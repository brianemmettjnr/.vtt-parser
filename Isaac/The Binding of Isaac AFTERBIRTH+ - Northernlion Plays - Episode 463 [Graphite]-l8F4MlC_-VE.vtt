00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.350
hey everybody welcome back to know the

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.690
lion please inviting eliza contra plus

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.760
we got a knock out maybe some greedier

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.230
we're getting close to the point at

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.790
which we should unlock the lost I don't

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.030
know probably have like a lost month or

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.470
something qf q yv c 9p 1 number 7

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.260
letters I'm ok with that

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.150
I got a high apple pie in the sky hopes

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.580
here let's remind ourselves we haven't

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.740
played as a Polly on very much at least

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.939
in the the new safe we can go check this

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:35.309
out I don't dislike the bombs and we'll

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:39.059
probably get value here sure it's not

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:44.210
good but it's ok what do you do with

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:48.390
apollyon it's actually fairly simple you

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.719
suck up bad passives or awesome actives

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.969
but for the most part I think it's like

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.500
bad passives are the ideal item for you

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.610
because every bad passive I mean

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.870
obviously you'd rather just have a good

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.520
passive but there's a lot more bad

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.079
passive than good passers in the game or

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.390
at least there's a lot of passives that

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.860
are mostly irrelevant versus you know

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.380
your odds of getting a stat that's

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.420
actually meaningful when you suck it up

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.680
like a range upgrade for example getting

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.180
sucked up and turning into a tears

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.950
upgrade I think it's a pretty likely

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.000
situation so this might not be the run

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.259
I'm not gonna get your hopes up right

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.270
off the bat should we have taken a hit

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.860
of damage right off the cut absolutely

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.869
not

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:29.189
the other thing is that we essentially

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.439
might as well I'm not saying step on the

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.159
button but we might as well just let the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.689
first phase and whenever it wants to end

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.380
here as long as we're not gonna die in

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.310
the process and then go buy a key and

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.350
see if we can pick up something from

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.470
this shot because we need damage

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.450
we need HP we need DPS we need to your

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.280
effects and if it's anything Oh like

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.570
knocked him right into me if it's

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.100
anything apart from that well we can

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.450
just execute the apollyon protocol in a

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.130
declassified dossier recently from the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.390
National Security Administration oh

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:06.509
that's horrible

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:08.489
and yeah this is real bad I'm trying to

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.000
give myself as much real estate as is

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.200
plausible just kill this guy leave the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.050
other dudes on the north

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.790
of the map it's too many it's too much

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.480
riffraff it's like I met an LMFAO

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.480
concert

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.720
apparently riffraff is not a member of

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.030
LMFAO by the way I was I was incorrect

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.770
I made that assessment on stream

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.420
recently it made me look very ignorant I

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.110
had no idea that he was like his own

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.000
personal entity I apologize I must have

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:50.160
missed you know culture when that

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:56.250
happened it's my mistake 13 cents okay

00:02:50.160 --> 00:03:00.180
so you buy a key is cheap you go into

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:03.420
this room and you get crickets head and

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.700
now with the existence of crickets head

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.630
I'm like buy HP because this is a

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.920
winning run previously I might have been

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.870
like you know what we'll just try to

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.400
beat the boss without taking damage and

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.739
it probably won't work like we'll

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.420
probably get hit but oh my god I got

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.890
caught on the corner of the rock there

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.180
would've been better to just dodge but

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.310
you know if you dodge when there's no

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.200
shot coming for you you didn't dodge it

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:34.230
all you dotted it into a shot it's a

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:37.380
terrible idea just be smart about this

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.200
be smart about this you got smarts in

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.760
Isaac at least it might not be you know

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.799
Isaac Stephen Hawking but you're at the

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:51.900
very least you're like you know Isaac

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:54.019
Ken Jennings please get that face out of

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.130
here I don't care who I kill first

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.230
sounded way more menacing than it

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.799
intended to come across I don't care

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.930
which boss acquiesce is first either one

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.900
is fine by me we could die in a single

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.750
hit if we find ourselves in a delicate

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.239
situation I don't think we want we have

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.010
exactly 15 cents I don't think we owe no

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.450
we only have 14 cents disregard I was

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:21.080
gonna say experimental treatment maybe

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:24.330
but not a very plausible situation in

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:33.510
hindsight plus it could just take away

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:35.340
HP anyway I mean we could try to get

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.050
more money and then buy experimental

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.940
treatment or buy potato peeler but I

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.710
don't really think that that really

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.270
provides us with much value either if

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.190
I'm being a hundred percent honest like

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.900
what does potato peeler and give us we

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.479
get an orbital we get a small damage

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.180
buff we lose HP it's not like we can

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:53.310
suck it up like if we try to suck it up

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.610
with void then every time we use void

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.070
we're gonna lose an HP like an HP

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.990
container I should say it's gonna be a

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:09.030
nightmare oh god I've got cat fur just

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:11.220
like a single microscopic like filament

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:15.229
of cat hair that has worked its way into

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:25.169
the itchy as part of my nostril you are

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:26.729
so beautiful to me they were really did

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.530
not like that voice I don't know why I

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.080
did that dodge twice in a row I don't

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.760
know why the universe allowed it to work

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.270
twice in a row it really is just setting

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:43.050
me up for disaster oh that's an itch no

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:46.440
Krampus why well if we make it out of

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:49.349
this we've earned it you know we paid

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.020
our dues for crickets head lump of coal

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:55.800
is well worth taking now just don't die

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.450
I mean shoot these but we've gotten

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.940
major upgrades on the first floor we got

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.770
a good chance to succeed as a poly on

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.380
what we need to do is kind of guide it

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:07.349
into the end zone here the best way to

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.690
do that is by getting HP that's not HP

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:14.400
that's a suck right there we got speed

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:16.440
and shot speed totally fine not against

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.680
that we're gonna quickly check on this

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.659
this is good value potentially yeah the

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.919
Sun card it's actually a great value

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:29.449
I'll go one step further

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:33.560
we want that tears upgrade push this

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:36.319
button that's pretty nice I think I'm

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.029
gonna suck it up though I also buy the

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:39.199
key right off the bed now that we have

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:41.120
the Sun card we got a little bit more

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:43.300
leeway I'm feeling good five bombs plus

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.680
a bomb synergy please nuts rainbow baby

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.659
rainbow baby is worse than spider mod in

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.580
my opinion we'll probably try to make

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:53.029
both work though this is range and shot

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:57.889
speed not particularly strong we want

00:06:53.029 --> 00:07:02.150
that tears upgrade now our damage is

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:03.919
good don't forget you know I think kids

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.449
these days they play Isaac you know cuz

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:07.219
their fathers like Isaac they don't

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:09.710
really have a respect for the game gosh

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:12.439
darn it please don't be a tears

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.599
downgrade how that's like still pretty

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:15.949
bad I think I'd prefer it to the tears

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:17.439
downgrade in the present moment but

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:19.750
still

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:21.860
kids these days always going around

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.949
disrespecting lump of coal you don't

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:29.120
even know dude the lump of coal is like

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:31.669
the 4-yard running back carry of Isaac

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.919
is it gonna make the highlight reels nah

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:35.900
you're pushing closer to a first down it

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:37.580
opens the defense up for you know

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.689
there's more bombastic passing plays

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.520
because they think you're gonna take the

00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:42.949
safe route out in the future it's the

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:48.529
bread and butter of any good offense

00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:50.000
you know I'm thinking if I just go deep

00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:51.529
enough on the football metaphor you

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.149
might not realize that I have no idea

00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:59.569
what I'm talking about outside of the

00:07:53.149 --> 00:08:02.110
Madden series so I don't like that sound

00:07:59.569 --> 00:08:04.779
are you gonna explode into more no you

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:06.949
can tell we're strong though cuz we're

00:08:04.779 --> 00:08:09.229
beating the waves as fast as they can

00:08:06.949 --> 00:08:12.409
spawn in most cases maybe like slightly

00:08:09.229 --> 00:08:14.270
slower in some no big deal I'm gonna be

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:16.909
a $0.20 this is the final wave good

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:19.879
stuff okay so we definitely want torn

00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:22.639
photo nice rate of fire increase I think

00:08:19.879 --> 00:08:24.770
we just want to suck spider-man up luck

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:28.849
and damage I'm not sure how good luck is

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:32.949
for us but damage is very good so I know

00:08:28.849 --> 00:08:36.199
there's gonna be a little bit of

00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:37.669
disagreement over that spider mods suck

00:08:36.199 --> 00:08:38.599
a lot of people love spider mods spider

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:40.610
mods got some good

00:08:38.599 --> 00:08:41.990
you I don't disagree but I love stats

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:45.680
and after the last two runs can you

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:47.269
blame me man in the desert asked you for

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.649
a diet coke are you gonna be like

00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:50.029
willing to diet coke why don't you just

00:08:48.649 --> 00:08:52.250
get water it's better for quenching good

00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:55.100
just give the man his diet coke okay

00:08:52.250 --> 00:09:00.139
he's been starving or dying of thirst

00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:02.209
give him his diet coke unless you know

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:04.190
you're a doctor at the hospital where he

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:07.579
was admitted in which case please just

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:15.290
you know a saline drip or something but

00:09:07.579 --> 00:09:17.120
I've been starved for stats no I just

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:21.699
walked right into it I've been starving

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:24.290
for stats and apollyon is the stat giver

00:09:21.699 --> 00:09:28.430
in the same way that thorn forge in New

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:32.569
Vegas was the slit tickler and that

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:36.139
Harvey danger was the flagpole Sitta get

00:09:32.569 --> 00:09:37.730
shredded like a mini wheats we got no

00:09:36.139 --> 00:09:39.110
bombs though how are you gonna do this

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:41.240
give me no bombs you know what it's okay

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:43.130
we got HP shouldn't be mad we got HP

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:46.069
instead of spending HP we don't want

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:49.759
anything else here mama mega is kind of

00:09:46.069 --> 00:09:52.550
like it's an interesting ask but we're

00:09:49.759 --> 00:09:56.810
moving on sixteen cents gives us an

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:58.220
immediate purchase or a key into an

00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:00.139
immediate item room we have no charge

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.790
yet so let's cool it I think we can deal

00:10:00.139 --> 00:10:06.980
with just having HP there that's fine a

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:11.899
little shot speed upgrade I'm gonna

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:13.519
start with blue cap I don't think we

00:10:11.899 --> 00:10:16.130
want blue map we got blue cap who needs

00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:19.250
blue map right so we're probably at or

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:22.240
near that's your cap I always heard

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:25.990
often I should say mess up the tier cab

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.990
five is the default

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:32.180
we're just gonna hold our charge for now

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:34.370
like we're doing etana damage a damage

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:36.200
with a five rate of fire and there I say

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.670
that our increased shot speed is

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:40.070
actually helpful

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:42.320
I will almost never give shot speed like

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:44.270
the time of day but in this present

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.640
situation I think it's getting a lot of

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:48.410
good work done you know it it's making

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:52.340
our shots like instant travel time

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:53.660
almost fairly helpful in ensuring we

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.890
actually manage to kill the enemies

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:57.110
before they get a chance to shoot in a

00:10:54.890 --> 00:11:01.550
lot of situations alright this is our

00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:03.320
final wave very helpful on enemies like

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:06.490
this that kind of teleport as well so

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:08.750
we're at 13 cents that's key territory

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:10.100
kind of hope we like what we see in our

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:12.020
item room I mean why wouldn't you I

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:17.870
guess but kind of hope we like what we

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:19.700
see so we don't use a charge I'm gonna

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:21.410
think about is the way I'm gonna phrase

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.210
this because we might want to use it on

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:25.280
a deal with the angel or devil and we're

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:26.870
only gonna get one shot as I said in the

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.940
last episode in my completely original

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.860
freestyle rap if you only get one or two

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:35.350
shots do not miss a chance to blow this

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:37.700
opportunity comes twice in a knife time

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:43.400
so we're gonna go through all of this

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:45.080
the straw is one of those things I know

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:47.570
people are gonna be like you should suck

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:49.640
it up but it's not the reason the straw

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:52.100
is good is not because it's objectively

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:54.920
good in a static context it's good

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:57.560
because it's okay in a static context

00:11:54.920 --> 00:12:00.470
and then also you can use it once every

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:02.270
room or multiple times per room once

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.890
every six rooms getting a little bit of

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:06.590
you know damage done to everything that

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:08.600
you can see it's not that valuable it's

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:11.870
not bad I mean I'd take it but I'd

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:16.430
rather suck up a bad passive or a great

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:18.080
active and this raw is a great active

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:20.150
but not if you strip its charged time

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:23.090
away from it it's like principle

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:25.460
strength by far like even here sucking

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:26.900
up the Necronomicon is like a better

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.340
move I think I'm gonna be pretty

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.570
aggressive on this one I think I just

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:32.810
want to see ooh

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:34.790
gimpy we absolutely wants and now I feel

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:37.490
much more vindicated and going down to

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:39.050
low levels of HP here I'd much rather

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.350
have Necronomicon but you're not gonna

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:42.630
believe me

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:44.040
I was actually thinking to myself maybe

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:46.560
I'll go off on a tangent about how I'd

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.790
rather have the Necronomicon then the

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.440
reason that I was gonna do that and

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:51.270
again I recognize it sounds a little too

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.830
convenient but the reason I was gonna do

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:55.320
it is because the Necronomicon is like

00:12:52.830 --> 00:13:00.390
my punching bag for bad or at least not

00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:02.070
that useful space for items but it's

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:03.540
actually pretty useful if it charges

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:05.340
that the same speed as everything else

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.350
which it does in this situation so

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:10.230
polydactyly it's got something going for

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:12.720
a punching bag and you know not really

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:14.010
highly invested I'll just be happy I

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:16.170
think to go down with a lot of money to

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:17.940
the next floor we got two keys right off

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:19.950
the bat which is wonderful

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:25.890
dude blood clot is completely fine

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:27.210
synthol is amazing and then nothing I

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:32.370
was hoping that I could trick the game

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:34.680
by just going and then I think well

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:37.140
we'll go for spun we could use the speed

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.610
we don't need it but we can use it and I

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:42.770
don't know if we need toothpicks so

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:42.770
that's a little bit more of a of a guess

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:51.000
so again we probably don't want to use a

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:53.910
Necronomicon like but we don't want to

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.400
use void just for Necronomicon that's a

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:58.170
little overkill but if the stars align

00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:02.160
and we're gonna get an extra charge

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:04.800
anyway we might as well kind of bereft

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:07.140
of reroll machines down here huh this is

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:09.960
my ideal run it's actually like one over

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:12.660
the previous runs the last two that

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:18.810
we've had cuz this one death is

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:21.630
extremely plausible but it's very strong

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:23.580
as well unlike that keeper run which was

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.600
like deaths not plausible at all and

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:26.220
then all of a sudden we were dead

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:30.110
because you couldn't kill enemies fast

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:30.110
enough to save our own skin

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:34.630
this one is much much much more

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.370
interesting I think

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:37.780
now do I want some HP to go along with

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.560
it yeah that's why I like you know what

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:42.340
the perfect

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:44.200
apollyon void item is prayer card you

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:46.330
know to be able to get essentially one

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.980
free HP upgrade per floor and if you get

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:52.030
battery charge is maybe even a little

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:55.540
more well worth it I kind of think you

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:57.100
go toothpicks and hope and it just gave

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:59.140
us shot speed which is pretty bad so

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:03.550
we'll we'll hold off then but if we ever

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:07.150
get to break the tear cap this will help

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:08.710
us it is that we paid fifty was fifteen

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:12.700
cents yeah we paid 15 cents for shot

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:15.430
speed it's a horrible pick-up but it we

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.960
could be vindicated much much later if

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:20.290
we managed to pick up a lot of stellar

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:23.940
items this is kind of like a bit of a

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:27.750
jacked up wave here you know we got some

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:30.100
we can make it get some high HP enemies

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:32.220
who in an array with one another are

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:35.530
actually quite difficult to dodge but

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:37.540
and whoever had money on little horn

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:39.400
being the last unit to die here go

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:43.450
collect your one hundred trillion

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:44.620
dollars from the Dead Pool do you have

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:46.030
enough money to buy something what was

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:51.160
the other item in there I thought it was

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:52.390
I thought it was maybe worth it a double

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.900
Right Said Fred here it's like the

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:57.400
easiest boss on planet Earth essentially

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.840
there's like two vectors on which this

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:01.060
guy can actually hit you so as long as

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:04.450
we don't stand on one of those for too

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:10.920
too long pretty much we're getting free

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:10.920
items here free access Elise

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:18.310
this could be for the best to be honest

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:20.200
double perthro well hold per throw

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:22.450
usually you don't want to use per throw

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:25.570
on a shop I think we might want HP +

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:28.450
trinket I'm not gonna be everybody's

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:30.070
favorite item for sure but the other

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:31.990
thing we can do is use per throw to

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:37.830
re-roll up bad active and hope to get

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:42.970
something a little bit more voidable hmm

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:50.170
okay that's a suck we got damage pretty

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:52.570
much the ideal outcome no bomb for sale

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:54.310
let's go peep this this is extremely

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:56.350
important it's actually a seem for us

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:58.030
right there because then we'll go push

00:16:56.350 --> 00:17:00.630
this over its gonna take 20 years but

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:06.010
that's okay do we want a halo yes I

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:08.290
overate halo but it is HP plus other

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:12.189
things which is kind of what we want

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:15.089
right now now I am indeed I know you're

00:17:12.189 --> 00:17:18.160
going NL don't you dare I'm Darren

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:24.819
now I'm actually Ryan but still I'm

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:27.459
thinking about re-rolling Oh or sucking

00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:30.070
I should say multi-dimensional baby but

00:17:27.459 --> 00:17:32.830
if we're gonna do that probably start

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:35.830
with that and you know what that's okay

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:37.450
I can live with that every like once

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:39.550
every 10 shots we get a really nice

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:40.840
monstro shot it's better than okay I

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:43.030
made it sound a lot worse than it is

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:45.250
with our rate of fire being as

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:48.870
ridiculous as it is this is actually

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.870
going to be useful like all the time

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:54.509
and with our shot speed the shots are

00:17:52.889 --> 00:17:56.490
actually gonna land I would never

00:17:54.509 --> 00:17:58.769
suggest that our shot speed is like one

00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:04.500
of our primarily amazing attributes

00:17:58.769 --> 00:18:09.120
right now but it's just I'm stunned that

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:11.669
it's helpful basically at all and this

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:13.950
runs shaping up do we want to buy a raw

00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:15.630
liver I think we might I mean the HP is

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:17.009
pretty nice for us right now we never

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:23.970
need to donate anything we've already

00:18:17.009 --> 00:18:25.110
maxed the donation machine we just want

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.990
to make sure we're getting value for

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:29.730
money sin victims playing player on owns

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.929
battle graphs I never thought I'd see

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:35.029
the day

00:18:30.929 --> 00:18:35.029
what about pajamas

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:44.929
it's just a lot of spirit hearts but

00:18:42.529 --> 00:18:50.029
three or four spirit hearts for seven

00:18:44.929 --> 00:18:52.009
cents is an outrageously strong deal we

00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:53.750
still have one more floor this would all

00:18:52.009 --> 00:18:57.230
be it less items by the way let's just

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:59.210
finish off the boss here like just want

00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:01.220
to make sure like we're hitting with the

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:04.940
pencil because the pencil shot is

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:07.879
actually like a one-hit ko if half of

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:10.129
the burst hits look at that like just

00:19:07.879 --> 00:19:14.809
outrageously good obviously we want a

00:19:10.129 --> 00:19:16.730
little rod and baby love we could buy

00:19:14.809 --> 00:19:19.970
two more items the Steam sale might

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:20.870
actually be no joke the best item that

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:25.220
you could conceivably

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:26.539
get on agree to your run I really

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:29.840
thought that my master plan was gonna

00:19:26.539 --> 00:19:33.320
work there oh this is what I need it was

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:36.230
like a pseudo kind of quick run after

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:38.360
that just not even god-awful but just

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:42.519
like the slog that the last couple of

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:46.549
runs were why would you buy a key there

00:19:42.519 --> 00:19:50.059
in fact for the same price you could

00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:53.840
have gotten latch key which is just

00:19:50.059 --> 00:19:56.120
better in every single way I'm a little

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.080
I'm upset with myself just cuz it's you

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.629
know Kevin O'Leary

00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:02.809
you're making me sad because you throw

00:19:59.629 --> 00:20:03.320
away good money what did that money do

00:20:02.809 --> 00:20:06.289
to you

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.970
kevin O'Leary also as an aside said it

00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:09.500
was wonderful news that two billion

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:12.769
people on planet earth were in poverty

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:15.200
but we are losing me my money big fan of

00:20:12.769 --> 00:20:19.279
his in case you it says is irrespective

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:23.269
of his politics mostly but at the same

00:20:19.279 --> 00:20:24.679
time like come on boys and it's a

00:20:23.269 --> 00:20:27.519
wonderful thing at two million people

00:20:24.679 --> 00:20:27.519
are in poverty

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:31.860
I don't think that's a controversial

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.260
statement to say that's a little bit of

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:37.200
a ridiculous statement and I'm the king

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:38.670
of ridiculous statements I don't

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.030
understand why there's more than one nut

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.590
butter

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:42.750
what like peanut butter was good enough

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:44.460
for you now we got a so I haven't cashew

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.030
and hazelnut and almond butter and stuff

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:47.100
like that

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:48.840
come on I don't want to go to the

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:51.450
grocery store you know I'm gonna have

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:53.610
kids one day maybe got a dad what's nut

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:55.710
butter and I got a stifle a laugh like

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:59.520
all because you just couldn't go with

00:20:55.710 --> 00:21:02.100
Skippy or jiff you had to be oh yeah

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:07.680
like hazelnut butter the best go eat

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:14.130
your Nutella then make yourself damn

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:16.740
case of Dilla um I mean I think we can

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:19.650
afford to buy infinite HP so we might as

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:22.110
well do this everything else why bother

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:22.950
like it's it's just not good enough 26

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:26.460
cents what do we do

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:29.460
latchkey for the spirit hard spun and

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:33.060
the damage very nice we definitely do

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:35.670
not need speed we might as well take a

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:38.850
cube of meat in that case we don't need

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:41.490
any of these other items we have no need

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:43.020
to suck the shovel up so we're kind of

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:46.010
just like I mean that's it we don't have

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:46.010
anything else to do with the money

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:56.050
well I was hoping we'd make hivemind

00:21:52.510 --> 00:22:00.730
work probably will actually one of these

00:21:56.050 --> 00:22:02.290
should have a coin get burned son well

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:04.720
you know like I said by a three cent

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:08.830
speed upgrade and then a 3 cent speed

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:10.300
upgrade let's get out of here can't

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:11.800
remember if we take double damage from

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:18.280
this point onwards but this should be a

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:20.200
well and truly sorted run that felt

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:22.870
amazing we should have sucked that up

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:24.580
what are we doing trying to get extra

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:26.110
value out of the quarter at this point

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:29.110
we want to donate to the green machine a

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:33.340
second time maybe we have to but I don't

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:38.050
think we do alright so like the money

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:40.180
maker is this pencil shot all those

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:45.520
super armor continues to irritate me to

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:47.680
no end so I used a void there I don't

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:52.230
know what we got I think maybe we got a

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:52.230
damage upgrade from Samson's lock

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:56.110
because Necronomicon killed enough

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:59.260
enemies to take us up a tick or

00:22:56.110 --> 00:23:00.940
something dude like okay I'm gonna be a

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:02.740
whiny baby for a second I'll use my

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:05.560
whiny baby voice which is just my voice

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:07.990
when I'm complaining why is super armor

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:10.390
a thing like look at this 17 damage

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:12.490
times 5 rate of fire plus the pencil

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:18.070
shot and yet this dude is still like not

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:19.060
going down just takes away all sense of

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:22.300
accomplishment

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:23.650
I'll sense of power 4 and then gun greed

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:26.020
mode that annoys me the most cuz we

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:28.720
built this run on rock and freakin roll

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:30.190
dude like we are the ones who made the

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:35.500
decisions on this run that led to the

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:38.530
items that we got sure maybe it would

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:41.640
make it so that the keeper felt like way

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:43.930
too underpowered if you got too strong

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:45.640
maybe that means this should be tweaks

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:47.050
out swearing greed mode instead of just

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:50.070
like hey you see his HP bar well

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:50.070
actually it's lying to you

00:23:52.309 --> 00:23:59.549
don't get tilted don't get tilted you

00:23:54.480 --> 00:24:02.039
got a lot of HP plus you got perks using

00:23:59.549 --> 00:24:03.539
perks properly is just like a good

00:24:02.039 --> 00:24:05.429
reason not to throw this run down the

00:24:03.539 --> 00:24:16.850
trash tube which is what we call our

00:24:05.429 --> 00:24:16.850
garbage cans in Canada apparently please

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:28.289
highly roasted oh no kiddin Phase two

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:34.010
huh don't let him get the money that's

00:24:28.289 --> 00:24:34.010
your money he wants it for HP

00:24:36.269 --> 00:24:41.580
oh my lord this is it's coming off the

00:24:39.089 --> 00:24:43.769
rails man its comment off the rails

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:44.969
we got gimpy though there's a lot of red

00:24:43.769 --> 00:24:48.769
hearts on the ground he's not picking

00:24:44.969 --> 00:24:48.769
those up I think we're fine nonetheless

00:24:49.459 --> 00:24:57.080
his super armor can go eff itself as far

00:24:54.269 --> 00:24:57.080
as I'm concerned though

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:06.940
I really thought we'd be safe there

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:12.470
wonderful just uh just a really I mean

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:14.870
I'm bad at this fight for one half of

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:18.010
this salt is just manufactured for

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:20.120
humors sake hopefully but still dude

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:23.620
it's not taking my money and healing

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:23.620
yourself with it that's my money that

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:29.740
time I shouldn't have stood there

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:40.460
you are a jerk but you're still gonna

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:42.020
die like all jerks and that's not a

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:45.770
menacing statement I'd like all nice

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:49.060
people as well okay we're losing too

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:49.060
much HP my dudes

00:25:54.350 --> 00:26:00.610
how did we sneak through destroy him

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:00.610
destroy him well you have the chance

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:13.150
he's done he's done okay I mean dude if

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:15.850
that run ends up being difficult we got

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:17.260
problems black room is really good so

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:19.710
we'll continue to donate for reasons

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.710
unbeknownst

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:30.340
he likes to sleep at 9:00 p.m. but he

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:32.470
wakes up at 3:00 and tries to annoy me

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:33.310
