##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.670
everybody welcome back to Norton land

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.010
please the binding of issac entereth

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.630
plus we're just like rollin basically

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.049
this isn't going to be keeper it's not

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.199
going to be the losted okay it is going

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.869
to be Judas probably like one of the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.779
most tenuous characters to be even more

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.949
so than the lost early but of course

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.070
consistently a little easier once you

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.980
get into the the meat of the run f2 to

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:32.700
b9 rnt we are like you know we're like a

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.510
an egg right now one day we're going to

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.809
hatch into over a bus lizard that can

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.600
you know use its venom to take down all

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.260
sorts of prey in the Sahara Desert

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.879
but for now you know we're just a thin

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.820
shell we can get cracked pretty easily

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.410
we need to find a spirit heart to

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.800
protect us the spirit heart in this case

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.980
is a lizard nest lizards late there's

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.570
definite snakes lay eggs right this is

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.859
actually you know I make fun of people

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.690
who make fun of me for not knowing

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.220
things about the animal kingdom despite

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.840
having a degree in biology this is

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.000
probably something I should know but I

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.180
got to be honest with you it's not

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.850
really what you do biology it's like you

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.610
know you spend a lot of time culturing

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.700
plates of agar and then growing bacteria

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.229
on them in different conditions you do a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.520
few dissections and then they're like

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.299
hey just get out of here here's your

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.790
degree it's not so much like classes of

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:40.979
just a teacher going you know lizards

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:42.780
lay eggs the Gila monster god ah well

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.399
like I said our head got cracked alright

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:50.250
would you just again v7 HLT w3e you win

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.500
the keeper run you lose the keeper or

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.100
you lose the Judas run you win the last

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.020
run

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.659
you lose the Judas or I never should

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.250
have been hit there it's completely my

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.750
own fault but yeah you know I feel like

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.100
that's like the same for anything like I

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.950
mean for those of you who are in college

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.530
you might be able to relate but for

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.300
those of you haven't gone to college yet

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.710
those of you are gynecologists yet

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.630
you know you might be thinking about

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:21.790
what to take probably not though cuz I

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:24.520
don't know no not again what the heck do

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.060
these enemies it'll make them like this

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.160
anymore

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.510
you know I know that I was like that

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.670
when I was in high school I was like

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.970
what am I gonna take in college I don't

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.480
know

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.480
geez I guess biology like I like biology

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.620
what do I know about biology you know

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.840
what you do in biology class say you

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.790
know here's the theory of evolution now

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.720
let's talk about the krebs cycle you

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.220
know you go to college for physics you

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.540
know you're coming off high school doing

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.540
all these sweet experiments with the

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.270
optics and you know elastic collisions

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.460
and stuff like that double slit

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.480
experiments plus the science is pretty

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.980
good too if you know what I mean you get

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.600
up there and you're doing experiments

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.600
well you're doing a lot of calculations

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.690
I must break him

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.000
JG 6 RT pH 9 is not me trying to

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.100
dissuade you you know academia is cool I

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.650
mean that sincerely I respect I'm still

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.930
in school myself I wilfully take night

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.150
classes sometimes I get comments from

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.280
that means they're not in physics as you

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.350
might expect not too much of a cottage

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.050
industry for you know teaching adults to

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.690
do physics well that's not true Khan

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.340
Academy is killing it right but oh yes

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.240
epic egg please let's redeem ourselves

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.930
this rhymes gotten off the rails already

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:49.600
sometimes I have people they go why you

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.160
going to school oh don't die on this one

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.990
they go why are you going to school

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.450
you've already got a job

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.520
by all accounts it's a good job it might

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.560
be the best job depending on you know

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.280
what you value in your life the answer

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.160
is I love learning and I think I think

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.770
more people should everybody I think I

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.110
think is in the innate human human brain

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:15.220
you know the human brain the one we all

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:17.260
got in our human skulls and it's just

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.209
like to learn something to commit it to

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.430
memory and actually understand a concept

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.550
is like a serotonin release I think that

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.140
education system sometimes does not do

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.889
fantastic job of getting that out there

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.310
you know

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:32.229
because at least a lot of public schools

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.749
like the one I went to is kind of just

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.219
like you know glorified daycare but it's

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:38.409
going to happen I suppose and you're in

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:40.659
them for 900 hours a day

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:41.860
HP please thank you alright don't die on

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:43.900
this one we got it going I don't know

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.289
why we were already in rant territory

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:51.639
here but certainly we want to take jar

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:54.909
of flies on a run in which we have 44

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:57.900
damage there's spirit art in there as

00:04:54.909 --> 00:05:00.279
well anyway the whole point of the story

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.469
is that there is no point to the story

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:06.099
but you might find that yourself you

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:08.259
know I know I definitely I knew kids

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:09.879
when I was like 12 that were like I

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:11.439
can't wait til I'm done high school cuz

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:13.120
then I never have to go to school again

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:15.370
and there is something to be said about

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.669
that although I fundamentally disagree

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.740
with looking forward to that for me

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.000
personally at least I understand it at

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.069
the same time there is something to say

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.080
for if you don't like learning in an

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:28.060
academic environment you might as well

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.139
be working because at least you know

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.400
you're doing something that's maybe more

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:31.960
in your wheelhouse and you're making

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.719
money you're not being held somewhere

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.110
effectively against your will careful

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:39.400
careful careful we're going to make it

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:43.300
well yeah you might find that yourself

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.339
you know education can be cool as long

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.259
as you you got your own foot in the door

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:48.610
you got your own choice I don't know

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:51.539
where I'm getting that with this anyway

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:54.159
let's move along here the point is I

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:56.740
should know whether or not Lizzy's lay

00:05:54.159 --> 00:06:02.259
eggs but I don't and I'll just admit

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:04.240
that I don't better to know where your

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:06.370
flaws lie to be honest with you I got

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.800
decent marks but I wasn't necessarily a

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:12.370
great biology student I definitely had

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.659
friends and classmates that you know

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.909
they were like wow I'm really interested

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:18.460
to find out how my spectrometer results

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:21.129
come back from that bird egg exam and I

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.599
was like I want tell me that we never

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:25.960
should have taken that but tell me more

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:28.060
about you because I want to be like you

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.520
if I had watched the jungle book

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.210
recently I would have sang the song but

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.210
I don't know it

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:41.690
I'm a little nervous that I may have

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:44.040
screwed us with like a time-delayed

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.419
Loki's horns here that I didn't even

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.030
think about until after I'd already

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:52.080
picked it up as long as we're aware of

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:54.180
it could this be a very strange run on

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.060
which we actually want to depress our

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.840
luck value and I'm not talking about

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.540
press our luck

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.180
I'm literally means we want to depress

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:06.780
our luck as much as possible so if our

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:08.610
luck stats stays low is that what

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.580
dictates whether we shoot with Loki's

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:15.389
horns or not of course the other

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:18.389
alternatives are very obvious explosion

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:22.400
invincibility helpful pyromaniac even

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:22.400
better you definitely takes a cossaks

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:27.840
you don't take to your detonator you

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:30.300
don't take sharp plug you could stack

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:34.100
spirit hearts I think you can take

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:36.660
champion belt although to damage is

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:39.990
meaningless so maybe that was a little

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:41.940
over the top here but you know it's a

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:44.820
good rule of thumb to follow champion

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:47.940
belt tends to be very good but this is

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:49.950
not necessarily relevant for us what's

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:53.220
much more relevant for us in our

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:54.750
existing situation is probably finding a

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:57.360
way to generate more HP you know what

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:59.310
would do it for us the relic it's kind

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.960
of a great item of course it's not like

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.610
I'm saying hey this item is really slept

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.020
on everyone knows the relic is great

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:06.090
once every four rooms you grab a spear

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.620
at hard but the reason I think in

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:10.440
particular that would be awesome for us

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:12.539
is because we're probably never going to

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.340
hit ourselves once every four rooms you

00:08:12.539 --> 00:08:16.050
know we only shoot maybe one out of

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:20.419
every ten shots right now ends up being

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:22.229
a Loki's horn shot so I'm I'm thinking

00:08:20.419 --> 00:08:23.940
mathematically speaking especially with

00:08:22.229 --> 00:08:26.240
flies which as you've noticed are not

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:30.150
exploding that doesn't work towards a

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:31.919
beelzebub transformation as well but

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:34.169
especially if we use our flies properly

00:08:31.919 --> 00:08:37.740
and each one of them does 80

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:39.360
well 94 damage I think unless they don't

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.969
inherit all of it for whatever reason

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.790
maybe they don't override the virtual

00:08:41.969 --> 00:08:45.680
method of the

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:46.880
and lots of programming where it's

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.680
thrown together to make you think I know

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:55.100
what I'm doing but actually I'm a novice

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:57.290
okay let's see what we've got all good

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:59.090
stuff the only thing that's bad about

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.950
the Flies is ever the Flies kill an

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:03.260
enemy they don't generate a fly off of

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:05.570
that kill so it would be nice that we're

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.100
different but it would also in this

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.960
situation basically mean that we could

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:11.870
just have one fly from jar of flies that

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:17.930
killed everything because it would just

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:19.670
recycle itself into more flies and what

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:22.880
I'm thinking to myself right now is the

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:27.560
problem with that is what because that

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:31.880
sounds pretty sick but we actually had a

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:34.700
good locust horn there these pills

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:37.490
coming from we have perks and addicted

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:39.890
on the same room here that you know that

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:43.190
weird bug territory I think if we get

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:44.720
hit so let's try not to do that

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:46.550
all consumables on the ground are about

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.920
to be rear old that's actually great for

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:51.050
us because we really only care I

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:54.230
shouldn't gulp them we really only care

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:55.910
about spirit hearts so we can finagle

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:59.530
those into existence I'm a happy man

00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:03.710
speed ups great and honestly lazy worm I

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:07.520
think is good not in most situations but

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:08.920
in this one it's not really about how

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.330
long it takes to reach its destination

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:13.640
it's about the fact that we can track

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:17.270
its progress and and you know the

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:19.310
direction is taking to get there so that

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.900
we have more time to plan our escape if

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:26.000
it looks like it's going to head in a

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:29.780
direction of deleterious for us so know

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.570
what I'm sorry jar of flies I am for

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:35.120
real never meant to leave the jar of

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:42.140
flies I've got the fog get me now

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:46.940
surprise I'm sorry jong-il flies I am

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:51.890
they me I have to take call forget me

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:54.080
now otherwise I'll have it cow okay well

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:56.720
we need to take yarrow with us when we

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.560
go down to the next floor you know it'd

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:02.510
be sick

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:03.020
is a 9lives pickup right here and by

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.870
sick

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:09.890
I mean nearly compulsory am i right

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:14.360
because we could actually die so easily

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:16.720
you got a go dude so we're not going to

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:19.760
get Nine Lives

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.050
Chara flies is so good though what we

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.460
still could get nine lines it's like an

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:26.480
eight percent chance of seeing nine

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:29.570
percent chance we really should take jar

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:32.090
flies which means we really shouldn't

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:37.430
take jar of flies because this is way

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:42.260
more hilarious but you know that's thank

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:49.720
you however we're based at any given

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:52.220
time we're too bad dice rolls away from

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.450
finding ourselves in heck and I don't

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:55.400
like to use strong language like that

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.540
but we're going to head down to the next

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.800
floor we're not going to use the

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.810
forget-me-now right now we're going to

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:01.160
use it on a floor in which we find a

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:04.280
better space bar item that we'd like to

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:09.080
replace the forget-me-now with ie Jarrah

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:12.110
flies but I digress or we're going to

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:17.000
use it as a novel teleporter to get us

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:20.300
out of boss rush we only take half a hit

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.880
from getting hit with half a heart I

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:29.740
should say from getting hit with if a

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:29.740
kak it's actually very reassuring

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:41.350
still means oblivion is closer than I'd

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:44.910
like to be did you guys ever realize

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:47.920
that we're closer to the release of

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:50.680
Bethesda's 2005 Elder Scrolls game of

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:57.520
libyan than the egyptians were to the

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:59.290
creation of the Sphinx see that's a joke

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.510
about and you don't worry about it

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:06.870
he's always online you see like you know

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:06.870
TI l steve buscemi was a fire fighter

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:12.970
volunteer firefighter at least not i

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.090
said it like that was an insult yeah

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:18.070
well he wasn't a fire fighter he

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:20.050
volunteered he was doing it for free

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:24.600
which I don't respect oh that's a great

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:28.000
balls of steel so what do we do check it

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:29.980
we drop bombs like mad because we have

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:35.770
99 of them instead of running into

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:38.080
enemies but anyway people always say

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:40.420
like we're closer to the reign of

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.740
Cleopatra than Cleopatra was to the

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.090
building of the pyramids there's a cool

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:45.250
thing to keep in mind you know because

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.810
we when people look back on history I

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:49.180
think they tend to see it as like a flat

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:50.860
they see it as a photograph instead of a

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.690
video you know they see it as a static

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.370
image instead of a moving picture that

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:56.350
has you know time is a scale that's

00:13:54.370 --> 00:14:00.790
that's important in telling that story

00:13:56.350 --> 00:14:04.300
but obviously that's not the case dude

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:07.060
I'm actually hopeful that negative one

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:10.110
luck is meaningfully good for us it

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:10.110
sounds ridiculous

00:14:13.329 --> 00:14:20.420
but I believe it

00:14:15.589 --> 00:14:23.629
I want no scrubs who are guys who can't

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:26.240
get much love for me a scrub is a guy

00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:30.560
who thinks he's fly also known as a

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:33.220
Buster always talking about what he

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:37.399
wants well he just sits on his broke ass

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:39.649
so no I don't want your number no I'm

00:14:37.399 --> 00:14:42.560
not gonna give you mine no I don't want

00:14:39.649 --> 00:14:47.120
to take you nowhere no I don't want none

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:55.579
of your time no scrubs is a song I will

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:57.319
never be able to relate to I mean I'm

00:14:55.579 --> 00:15:00.410
having a bit of a crisis right now and

00:14:57.319 --> 00:15:01.670
realizing that I never really liked no

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:03.470
scrubs as a song it's not because I

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:06.829
found it offensive I was just always

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:08.329
like it's a little rich Lisa left eye

00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:09.529
Lopes what do you mean you don't want

00:15:08.329 --> 00:15:13.100
those scrubs one of the scrubs don't

00:15:09.529 --> 00:15:14.990
want you I know that you are inferring

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.250
that the scrubs do want you from the

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:19.430
fact that you're singing a song called I

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:21.230
don't want no scrubs you know I'm

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:23.120
talking for the passenger side of your

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.920
best friend's ride trying to holler at

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.569
me I doubt that the situation that's

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:31.670
ever happened well I don't know I can't

00:15:26.569 --> 00:15:33.620
say that for certain the problem is I

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:37.300
also don't know if the scrubs are likely

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:37.300
to be listening to the song you know

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:42.939
what about me am i a scrub I mean I'm a

00:15:40.459 --> 00:15:45.860
scrub and eyes because we all know but I

00:15:42.939 --> 00:15:47.389
didn't own a vehicle for quite some time

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.500
I lived in and say well I still do I

00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:50.240
live in a city with good public

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:52.939
transportation as long as you're on one

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.139
of the two sky train lines you know what

00:15:52.939 --> 00:15:56.389
about what if I'm hanging on the

00:15:54.139 --> 00:15:58.459
passenger's side of the sky train line

00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:59.930
trying to holla at you you know what I

00:15:58.459 --> 00:16:02.449
wouldn't because I'm a faithfully

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:04.399
married man and luckily at one point in

00:16:02.449 --> 00:16:06.410
her life my wife she didn't say she

00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:09.889
wanted to scrub necessarily but she was

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:11.809
like you know what I'll judge each scrub

00:16:09.889 --> 00:16:13.309
on a case-by-case basis because people

00:16:11.809 --> 00:16:16.959
are worth more than just the sum of the

00:16:13.309 --> 00:16:16.959
materials in their wallets

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:25.020
I think that's a bad message I always

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:26.490
thought it was very brazen by always I

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:28.700
mean I literally just thought of this

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:32.370
but don't you think it was pretty brazen

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:34.980
then on the first single from that album

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:38.700
TLC said ah no one no scrubs scrub as a

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:42.089
guy who can't get no love for me ie fuck

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:44.520
poor people and then the second one was

00:16:42.089 --> 00:16:46.230
about the media making you feel like

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:48.510
you're inadequate that's a song by the

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:51.600
name of unpretty you can buy in hands

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:55.410
that won't go you can casinos if he says

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:59.160
so you can't have it both ways TLC the

00:16:55.410 --> 00:17:00.990
message cuts is artificial first one is

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.480
like hey buy a car then you can ask me

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:05.339
out second one is like don't let the

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:10.550
media tell you you're not beautiful

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:10.550
that's not a fair one-two punch very

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:17.699
totally dissonant and quite honestly I

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:20.010
don't know what to believe anymore Lisa

00:17:17.699 --> 00:17:21.900
left eye Lopes chief al I don't know

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:26.610
she's got to take an L on that one who's

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:31.890
the there's um chilli and then T who's

00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:36.929
the T from TLC TLC give me a second

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:39.510
known TLC group Tionne t-boz Watkins

00:17:36.929 --> 00:17:42.990
that's right Lisa left eye Lopes and

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:45.420
Rozonda chilli Thomas I know that Lisa

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:47.670
left eye Lopes is you know subsequently

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:53.070
passed away I don't mean to besmirched

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:55.380
your memory at all I'm just saying the

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:57.780
song I mean first off you're like 17

00:17:55.380 --> 00:18:00.330
years old at this point we can we get

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:02.309
dispense with the notions of being

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:04.860
offended on TLC's behalf for their

00:18:02.309 --> 00:18:06.809
magnum opus here we on thank that's one

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:12.299
okay so we do have a great deal with the

00:18:06.809 --> 00:18:14.639
devil chance here I'm just saying

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:17.669
that's like if Christina Aguilera's

00:18:14.639 --> 00:18:21.149
first single from her 2003 album dirty

00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:25.409
was dirty and then her second single

00:18:21.149 --> 00:18:28.830
which in this case was you are beautiful

00:18:25.409 --> 00:18:31.739
no matter what they say you know if if

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:35.820
the second signal single had instead

00:18:31.739 --> 00:18:38.039
been called extremely clean oh that's

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:40.859
dangerous that's the situation that we

00:18:38.039 --> 00:18:45.690
have here I don't want poor Babylon

00:18:40.859 --> 00:18:47.879
right now it's too dangerous you would

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:49.469
be concerned well not concerned you

00:18:47.879 --> 00:18:51.479
would be confused you'd like which is

00:18:49.469 --> 00:18:53.399
the christina aguilera dirty or

00:18:51.479 --> 00:19:01.109
extremely clean I can't take you

00:18:53.399 --> 00:19:03.269
seriously I don't have anywhere else to

00:19:01.109 --> 00:19:04.679
go from that just it's always kind of

00:19:03.269 --> 00:19:07.320
bothered me and again by always I mean

00:19:04.679 --> 00:19:09.899
like literally never until this exact

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:12.059
moment what we do have brewing here

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:13.829
though during the midst of this TLC

00:19:12.059 --> 00:19:16.349
rampage you know what it is it's like a

00:19:13.829 --> 00:19:19.289
biggie azalea's first single was fancy

00:19:16.349 --> 00:19:20.429
and then her second single was trash it

00:19:19.289 --> 00:19:23.219
was trash

00:19:20.429 --> 00:19:25.079
probably but trashy I don't know about

00:19:23.219 --> 00:19:30.479
that dude great opportunity

00:19:25.079 --> 00:19:36.139
good stuff d8 well actually like an

00:19:30.479 --> 00:19:36.139
extremely great role except we might die

00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:43.500
and we might tie to the same champion

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:46.230
who killed us on the first run who do

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:49.470
that's a extremely clutch get right

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:55.410
there we might not have really wanted to

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:57.480
get a humbling bundle but if it starts

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:58.340
paying for itself it's going to do so in

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:01.350
a big way

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:02.790
so what's run dank types one we're a

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.179
little ahead of schedule here's the game

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:06.059
plan

00:20:03.179 --> 00:20:09.000
first you go in get all the stuff go to

00:20:06.059 --> 00:20:12.120
boss rush take an item from boss rush

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.650
forget-me-now then we hope to have God

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:15.960
in the teleport card at that point we

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:19.980
can steal two items from boss rush and

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:22.230
the world's your banana know what that's

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:26.280
supposed to mean it's just really Corgan

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:28.860
says the world's yo banana dude it boo

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.960
boo - boo - that's maybe that's where my

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:38.040
musical prowess lives emulating the

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:42.330
talkbox from Fon Jovi's magnum opus

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:45.750
living on a prayer you ever feel like if

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:48.540
you were like the bassist in a band and

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:52.470
the would you ever let the main singer

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:55.590
named the band after him or her for that

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:59.040
matter seems like kind of a crap deal

00:20:55.590 --> 00:21:00.860
right you know I don't want to be a part

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:03.419
of Van Halen

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:06.110
what is it you've got four people here

00:21:03.419 --> 00:21:08.880
we get to be on your name you know

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:12.780
kickstart your hard-ons Motley Crue it's

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:14.100
a different band might as well jump you

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:16.970
know it's not anything without that

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:21.270
static content yeah the Kings good

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:22.799
that's Panama you know you get the idea

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:25.530
the point is I don't know what I'm

00:21:22.799 --> 00:21:29.520
talking about when it comes to a lot of

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:32.490
80s rock but she was a fast machine

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:37.280
ending she kept her motor clean I know

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:37.280
that much for a flip in fact buddy um

00:21:41.519 --> 00:21:46.870
how many of horf pills are you going to

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:51.159
give me on a run that already has it's a

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:53.350
CAC so little ridiculous but then you've

00:21:51.159 --> 00:21:55.360
got subversions as well like Santana

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:57.279
it's not really a band but I'm sure he's

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:59.230
got like a touring band it's named after

00:21:57.279 --> 00:22:01.690
the guitarist unless the wait the

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:05.380
Santana also sing black magic woman oh

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:07.480
my god dude this run was actually I

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:09.940
think my brain just broke halfway

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:12.070

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:14.080
