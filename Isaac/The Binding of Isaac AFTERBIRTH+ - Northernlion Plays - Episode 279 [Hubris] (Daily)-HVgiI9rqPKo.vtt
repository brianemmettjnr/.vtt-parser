00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.920
hey everybody welcome ignorant lamb

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.740
please binding wise Gareth plus it's a

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.240
daily we've been winning on dailies but

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.759
not ranking that well yesterday four

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.259
point six eight percent 401 overall it

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.059
was our rank with a score of thirty five

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.250
thousand six hundred and sixty took a

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.510
lot of damage learn a lot about living

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.789
in a little about love today we're going

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.920
to be Judas and I'm hoping to keep our

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.260
relatively good play recently going I'm

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.300
looking at scores number one to number

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.449
thirty ranges from forty five thousand

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.079
to fifty five thousand so those are good

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.850
scores I forget what this is leprosy

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.579
you're tearing me apart Lisa you know

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:44.370
what it's a daily leprosy Isaac the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.260
passive item upon taking damage

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.820
Isaac gains a body part as an orbital

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.110
with plucks enemy shouts and deal seven

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.180
damaged protected enemies it comes in

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.440
contact with maximum three body parts

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.360
active at once the body parts can be

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.660
destroyed the body parts persists

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.280
between floors that's kind of cool it is

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.379
a reference to the room thank you

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.899
Binding of Isaac rebirth wiki I was

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.780
aware but it's nice to feel vindicated I

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:11.220
suppose

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:13.170
so really today's run and and all these

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.930
dailies have just been a way for me to I

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.180
feel like I was in like an Isaac you

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.430
know mental hospital or something I

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.049
almost got hit they're talking about

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.790
this conspiracy theory they made the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.110
game harder so anyone who's done the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.409
research tells us they made the game

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.380
harder and then I've emerged and I'd

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.150
been like I'm better now we don't need

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.950
to talk about that but I was still kind

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.540
of in this convalescence like recovery

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.520
period where I don't really I'm not

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.409
going into this being ambitious I'm not

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.880
saying we should win we should come in

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:51.619
the top 30 of today's daily all I'm

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.670
coming into this run suggesting is

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.219
beating the run would be nice and even

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.600
like if we lose against delirium as long

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.130
as we're able to beat hush and make it

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.500
to the void floor we lose against the

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.500
unfair boss I kind of consider that okay

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.830
dude I was pretty skeptical that was

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.790
going to work but now I basically feel

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.819
like a god so

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.439
let's go back we have two bombs now this

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.689
gives us a huge leg up on the

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:21.069
competition if it gave us a spirit art

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.629
which it obviously did not so we're

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.430
going to come back here go to our shop

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.890
our shop does have a speaker in arts but

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.540
there is no money to purchase it yet so

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.190
we'll use a bomb to blow up the

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.280
shopkeeper the shopkeeper has no money

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.900
okay we need one penny one penny gives

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.239
us so much peace of mind we can get hit

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.560
like three times and be alright not

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:44.319
quite there yet we do have a decent

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.760
trinket poison not that good as an item

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.290
because there's better opportunities as

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.340
a trinket there are better opportunities

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.420
as well but less of them it's five cents

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.109
that's not going to be your second

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:59.079
secret room you had yeah dummy in fact

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:01.209
now that I think about it there's only

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.780
one secret room location that makes any

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.129
sense and that's this one right here

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.260
everything else is spoken for or

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:12.129
otherwise inadmissible for one reason or

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.170
another so go to seven cents normally I

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.510
don't get too aggressive about looking

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.579
for you know love in all the right

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.840
places here but we're going to shoot all

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.549
the poops and fires because we get a

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.680
nickel that could give us you could

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.449
change the game a little bit battery

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.129
charge we cannot afford weird nicely a

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:28.269
blank card but I honestly unless you get

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.519
pageant boy I don't think the money

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.709
exists on this floor to get a to get

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:37.209
pageant boys or sorry to get blank cards

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:39.190
so let's kill Big Horn it's the great

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.590
thing about being Judas sure you're

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.349
little scared in the early game about

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.540
your HP but being able to go to nine

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.269
damage basically on-demand is pretty

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.560
nice and simple is going to help out a

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.629
lot with that as well and we head down

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.000
to the next floor feeling very good what

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:58.209
do you need to get between 45 and 55 I

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.790
like how does anybody else go through

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.440
this we're like you know sometimes to

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.209
find like starting a class or something

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.340
I'm like this is going to make me sound

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.599
like nerdier than I actually am I'm

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.400
starting a class or something like that

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.629
I'm like I don't really not to worry

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.760
about all I do in this class you know

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:15.400
it's just for personal gain then I get

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.470
like you know 9 or 10 out of 10 on the

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.989
first quiz and I'm like I'm going to get

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.210
the highest mark ever achieve the same

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.710
thing is like this issac round nothing

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.570
ambitious right now you know I'm just

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.410
hoping to have like a good run play well

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.630
then

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.700
add to the first floor I'm like how do

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:36.690
we get those scores because we're we're

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:42.760
well poised that was extremely lucky

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:44.020
yeah 45,000 is a high score tie enough

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.530
to put you in the top 30

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.630
of course honestly we don't need to blow

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.450
up the other side so let's just try this

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.120
it is a secret room two-spirit arts back

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.380
it's a very survivable one obviously you

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.820
don't even need me to say but I gonna

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.070
say it anyway because it feels like 10

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.610
seconds to air not taking so much bad

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.760
damage

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.100
that'll how about a great deal and then

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.840
if you know blank card maybe could show

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:14.020
up again and then we could use that

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:15.370
combined with some two of everything the

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.050
body needs to have a good score apart

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.840
from that the path here in case you're

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.640
not aware but you probably are is make

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.410
it the boss rush make it to hush fight

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.450
use the hush fight to go to void and

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:30.430
then again in theory you should believe

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:33.340
the run before you fight delirium I've

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.680
been saying that that's not the kind of

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.720
person I am and every time I fight

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.310
delirium I lose like 3,000 points and

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.740
probably slipped like a hundred points

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.540
down the rankings so not to mention

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.770
haven't fighting delirium on occasion in

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:50.950
my you know non dailies I kind of hate

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.570
that guy I kind of think he's like the

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:56.110
most annoying boss in the game which is

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.340
very sensible given the you know the

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.510
hoops you got to jump through to get to

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.350
him but still my dog is annoying is all

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.870
I'm saying here

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:08.050
so leprosy I'm assuming if it blocks a

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.960
bullet it takes damage and thus comes

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:13.300
closer to death or you know being

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:18.010
removed from our dorba ttle list at

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.640
least but if it hurts enemies does it

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.780
counts

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:24.360
I'm excited huh it's an all-time classic

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:27.370
like if I use it as an orbital does it

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:30.040
take damage from contact of does it only

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:32.710
take damage from actually being shot by

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:35.200
the enemies because I want to use my

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.850
chariot card to make this as easy as

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.410
possible I don't really want to use a

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.740
bomb to look for a secret room when it

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:48.680
could be in many different locations

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:51.199
so oh yeah it's gone still kind of a

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:56.660
cool item take PJ's mostly that's are

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:58.370
exclusively that's just extra spirit

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.599
hearts but you know it is nice as Judas

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:03.410
although we're probably an overkill

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:04.789
territory razor blade is interesting but

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.430
doesn't strike me as being particularly

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:08.330
strong dark bomb of course was amazing

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.800
for it so we're going to head down to

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.970
the next floor being on pace but

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.740
considering you want to fight house you

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.669
might want to go a little bit faster but

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.979
we do have that deal with the devil

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:17.449
precedent now so I'm thinking that it

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:20.240
shouldn't be too much of a challenge to

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:22.669
start going a little bit faster you know

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.289
what leprosy razor blade might have

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:26.150
actually been a combination I didn't

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:28.940
even think of and then beyond that if we

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.409
can get like HP IV bag leprosy can only

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:34.520
have three orbitals at any given time

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:38.599
but seems like a fairly high quality

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:44.690
pick up here so you could just take that

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:47.539
like anything that gives us a benefit

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:49.759
for taking damage is an interesting

00:07:47.539 --> 00:07:51.050
archetype and Isaac because there's so

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:52.969
many ways to exploit that without

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:55.580
actually having to hurt yourself like IV

00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:57.169
bag functionally doesn't really hurt

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.699
yourself most of the time you only use

00:07:57.169 --> 00:08:01.719
it in where you tend to only use it in

00:07:58.699 --> 00:08:04.130
situations where you know you're already

00:08:01.719 --> 00:08:05.930
doing fine on HP or you're just

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.440
desperate and you'll you know take what

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.150
you can get

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.610
that was poor damage there of course

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:14.060
we're gonna take these pills once we

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:19.460
finish this room get out of here you

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:21.500
weird sly not saying like leprosy dull

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.180
razor is the one true pairing that

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:26.210
people still say that is that more of a

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:29.870
a 2013 thing I haven't seen OTP in a

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:31.430
long time it died along with you know me

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:34.810
getting tweeted a bunch of supernatural

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.810
means addicted

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:43.190
least we know it exists and we know that

00:08:39.229 --> 00:08:45.590
we don't need to know it anymore there's

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:47.120
no notes and there's unknown knowns and

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:50.440
then there's no not known that unknown

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:52.640
unknowns we now have a known unknown

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.850
which is probably one of the best

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.050
unknowns in my opinion don't even get me

00:08:55.850 --> 00:09:02.720
started on missing though that's a whole

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:04.550
different category a silliness there so

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.610
probably our first key should go to the

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:09.410
shop but of course literally as soon as

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:12.380
I said that we found ourselves face to

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:14.360
face with the item room and in the item

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.740
room is a pretty good time I don't know

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.940
if you guys are aware of this but most

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.740
of the time you go in there you leave

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:20.570
with an item which is I mean a

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.070
revelation I'm sure for some of you who

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.550
haven't put two and two together on this

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:25.160
run

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:26.810
but around in this game I should say but

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.370
yeah I mean it took me probably a three

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:32.180
or four hundred episodes to realize it

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:33.710
anyway as well I mean out of these

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:37.340
you've got to go car battery I don't

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:38.420
know if it even helps with book of

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.870
Belial like I don't know if it's going

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:43.310
to take us to to X the bonus for book of

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.780
Belial but we got to give it a shot and

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.920
if we have a replace book of Belial

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:49.550
which actually happens quite frequently

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:51.980
on Judas runs because you can get items

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:54.050
that fit your needs more more fleshly I

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:56.630
know this this is a technology 0 we had

00:09:54.050 --> 00:10:01.220
this on yesterday's daily and it was

00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:02.480
sweet except it really in it well I mean

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.280
I've had it once today I'm talking like

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.710
I'm an expert you know you all have one

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:08.890
friend who spent three days in Spain

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:11.780
it's like low in Spain this is hell oh

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:14.750
the restaurants in Spain is so different

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:18.280
than the ones here potion seller you can

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.280
handle my finest pie err

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.430
I don't know where the regular secret

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:29.389
room is aw this is like this beautiful

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:33.579
perthro is holdable and usable and oh so

00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:36.440
kissable the gods very usable right now

00:10:33.579 --> 00:10:39.170
blank rune you usually just pop it

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.630
that's the guys on soos at least would

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:44.120
allow us to see the secret room just far

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:49.850
away and then perthro algae's like

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:52.519
really really good for that's I'm pretty

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:54.170
confident that's only one book of belial

00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:56.690
upgrades a book of belial upgrades i

00:10:54.170 --> 00:11:00.440
guess do not stack with the car battery

00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:02.149
or not I really want to roll into a

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:04.579
tears upgrade here dude if we can get

00:11:02.149 --> 00:11:06.610
static nonsense rolling about I'll be a

00:11:04.579 --> 00:11:09.319
happy camper

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:11.120
that's it tears upgrade I'm a happy

00:11:09.319 --> 00:11:12.199
camper I'm going to leave I'm not going

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.310
to worry about the secret room even

00:11:12.199 --> 00:11:18.199
though we did use on soos to find it

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:19.670
just don't think it's a it's worth the

00:11:18.199 --> 00:11:23.060
time investment but I will come down

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:26.439
here and check this out like honestly

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:28.790
this is starting to pop I'm a

00:11:26.439 --> 00:11:31.040
notoriously terrible judge of like how

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:32.600
my run is looking from a point

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.980
standpoint you know if you ask me how

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.980
many points this runs going to finish

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:38.449
with I'd somewhere between 25 and 150

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:40.819
thousand what have I done

00:11:38.449 --> 00:11:43.220
okay I'd lost a leprosy orbital in there

00:11:40.819 --> 00:11:46.250
okay I'm going to close this I don't

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:51.560
care right now I will engage you in the

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:53.930
Skype conversation at a later basis and

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:56.029
not belabor the point but I think we

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:57.529
have all the tools we need to rank well

00:11:56.029 --> 00:12:00.050
here like already because our rate of

00:11:57.529 --> 00:12:02.540
fire is 30% better than 10 which is a

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:04.970
very strange way to describe that I feel

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:06.199
like we're capable of beating boss rush

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:07.519
even faster than we beat it yesterday

00:12:06.199 --> 00:12:10.069
which shouldn't be hard because

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:12.889
yesterday's boss rush took us 1 or 2 1

00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:16.209
to 2 human lifetimes on average

00:12:12.889 --> 00:12:18.709
repeating of course to defeat however

00:12:16.209 --> 00:12:22.149
because we've got this technology here

00:12:18.709 --> 00:12:24.649
we get great coverage at killing enemies

00:12:22.149 --> 00:12:26.420
peep didn't die in record time but it

00:12:24.649 --> 00:12:28.430
certainly you know didn't take forever

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:31.550
what you try to do I think is miss with

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:33.079
your shots and then get the shots to

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:34.950
create like an electrical field that

00:12:33.079 --> 00:12:37.860
goes all the way through the enemy

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:40.050
it's not necessarily an easy thing to do

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:42.090
and having piercing shots will make this

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:44.220
20 times you know less difficult to pull

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:46.020
off so what I'm hoping to get is to is

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:48.180
for this to be the tech X run that I

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:53.880
wanted to see yesterday but never came

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:56.250
through for us in the end so start by

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:58.020
going to the well we have one key don't

00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:01.680
go to the item room yet save it for the

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:03.630
shop man we still do have to go to our

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.370
shop on the last floor got a great deal

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:09.120
with a devil chance here and we're still

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:16.950
holding per throw in case we find

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:18.090
something that we're not a fan of yeah

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:19.350
where we're starting to chew through

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:23.040
these enemies pretty quickly this feels

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:24.330
like a strong daily ah okay to tears up

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.710
and a shots me down which seems like

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:50.550
both of those might be good with

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:51.900
tex06rus time goes on next big upgrade I

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.440
mean getting into tears cap would be

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.270
nice

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.870
we have piercing shots with tech zero

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:59.580
right now so we're crushing it speed

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:01.890
honestly if we can get to like 1.4 speed

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:04.910
it's kind of an arbitrary number in case

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:07.140
you hadn't guessed but we can get the

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:08.700
1.4 speed I'll be pretty happy I almost

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.710
left I thought there was like a 0%

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:13.740
chance he'd pay out that quickly the

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:15.630
virus of course is a it's made of six so

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:19.310
we're at 0.9 speed which I hadn't

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:19.310
considered sadly

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:29.960
got one key still so if it's great its

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:31.790
greed yeah its greed we do have enough

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:36.590
time the question is more whether we

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:41.870
have the desire to try to gamble for a

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:43.820
key we don't need two lovely I think

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:46.010
though we should play I mean we got

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:50.780
forty nine cents we should play the

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:52.520
judgment and we should play the the

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:55.940
blood bank as much as possible as well

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:59.090
because blood bag for the speed upgrade

00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:00.560
mostly would be pretty nice right now so

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.880
we got HP I think we take because it

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.330
allows us to play blood bag a little bit

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:07.910
better

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:09.320
I still think you have to try could have

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:11.870
been a good peripheral opportunity but

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:13.220
life goes on alright to stay on schedule

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:16.850
we have to leave right now and that's

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:18.410
fine I still feel like this run is one

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:19.670
of the stronger runs I've had on dailies

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.710
over the past couple of weeks and that's

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:25.220
very encouraging stigmata is a lovely

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:26.750
pickup not very strong from a damage

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:30.080
standpoint but it does inches closer to

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:31.340
ten there and beyond that this has got

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.720
to be our second secret room the

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:37.640
archetype just points us in the right

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:39.320
direction and you know you're going to

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.850
think I wasted a lot of spirit arts

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.500
there but we're already at max HP once

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.910
you get max level you stop leveling

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.420
we're going to head down to the next

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:55.410
floor

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:57.330
Dae Leonard okay I'm ready this floor

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:59.130
we don't expect a deal with the devil

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:00.710
and to be honest with you we probably

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:05.640
don't need one for the rest of the game

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:07.440
but it would be nice to get a to get

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:09.660
something that synergizes with car

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:12.390
battery and eclipses book of a while in

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:15.300
terms of usefulness I think kind of a

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:17.670
less obvious but but really comfortable

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:19.430
item there would be Book of Shadows you

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:21.930
know to get twice as much or

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:23.850
invincibility for twice as long I know

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:26.130
we can get two bombs for a bomb there

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:29.580
but I'm starting to not worry about time

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:32.970
but be more conscious about the timing

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:35.070
of this run right now of course there's

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:40.770
like you know an endless variety of

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:43.250
items that could fit our bill here you

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:45.360
got to try this I think rules card I

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:47.220
bought the emperor card trying to pick

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.320
up the era which is actually per throw

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:50.580
just per throw me right now and we don't

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.020
want that so that's fine we got our

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:54.390
emperor card and you got to try this as

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:56.990
well huge growth and I mean like you got

00:16:54.390 --> 00:17:01.410
to try this as well to a clubs

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:05.820
I'll stick with to a clubs the emperor

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:07.680
card should not be relevant but yeah

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:12.600
there's a variety of space bar items

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:14.640
that fit our bill here so we don't need

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:18.630
to be overly attached to any of them in

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:19.920
particular but I'll space bar item that

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:23.760
works well for us would be nice because

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:26.610
car battery is good and I would feel not

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.930
so good if we had wasted it so a minute

00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:29.880
and a half before we start to worry too

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:31.770
much about time here pick up whatever

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.570
you want to pick up we finish this floor

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:35.340
really really quickly the only reason by

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:38.160
the way that I bought so many of those

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:39.540
cards is because a two of diamonds is

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.620
hugely valuable I mean a two of clubs

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.620
could be hugely valuable

00:17:47.399 --> 00:17:52.769
don't use Boca Belial here not relevant

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:58.570
but mostly from a point standpoint so um

00:17:56.769 --> 00:18:00.760
little go explore we can if we leave

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:02.409
this floor and things look dicey that's

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.299
a really good opportunity for a golden

00:18:02.409 --> 00:18:07.720
key if things look dicey from a point

00:18:04.299 --> 00:18:09.370
standpoint I don't know maybe let's try

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:13.990
black hole at least we can keep enemies

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:19.120
in one spot and it's novel we'll head

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:20.799
down to the next floor here was there a

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.630
key in the shop if there's a key in the

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:24.190
shop we should hedge our bets a little

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:25.720
bit there was a key in the shop and we

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:28.240
could buy two keys in the shop that

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:32.110
might be a smart idea to Shambala

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:33.100
tickets nothing okay two keys is enough

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:34.929
because now we get to save some money

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.429
for the next floor I think we're

00:18:34.929 --> 00:18:40.809
probably going to be like a little ahead

00:18:36.429 --> 00:18:42.549
of where I normally am as far as points

00:18:40.809 --> 00:18:44.230
go like we could be at 14 when we come

00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:47.200
down to this floor thirteen point five

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:49.870
oh just 13 flat okay again what did I

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:52.330
tell you who is the worst person when it

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:54.490
comes to judging point totals probably I

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:56.740
mean I'm one of the few who tries and

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:58.120
fails most people who try probably

00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:00.159
succeed but most people in general just

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:06.570
probably do the daily and go that's

00:19:00.159 --> 00:19:09.220
where I ended up so I don't know if the

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:12.159
black hole's gonna last twice as long or

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:15.149
it's going to have twice as much suck in

00:19:12.159 --> 00:19:20.950
power or what's going on there but we

00:19:15.149 --> 00:19:23.919
got it nonetheless as this is a scary

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:25.179
situation we got two keys usually you

00:19:23.919 --> 00:19:27.580
don't to spend too much time doing this

00:19:25.179 --> 00:19:29.230
okay that's fine we wasted one key we

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:32.139
got some consumables out of it point

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:33.940
wise you know we'll we'll get out of

00:19:32.139 --> 00:19:35.110
this and one key for a golden key I mean

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:38.460
we've been really lucky with a

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:38.460
distribution of these so far

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:46.180
showing up like exactly when we need

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:52.610
them sho'nuff exactly when we need them

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:53.960
dawn right okay what do you get for the

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:55.730
man who has everything it's an easy

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:58.040
answer I don't have everything give me

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:59.630
speed sure it tears up I mean it might

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:02.810
break the tears Capet even if it doesn't

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:05.950
it's a it tears up it's not a bad thing

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:08.780
but you know don't let me stop you from

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:11.300
giving me it tears upgrade if you decide

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:13.790
that that's in the cards for us here I'm

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:18.520
not going to complain the runs lovely

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:18.520
it's actually fantastic situation

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:24.980
genuinely one of the strongest dailies

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:28.520
I've had in weeks and I'm playing

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:32.650
alright I'm fitting the bill here after

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:35.870
a period of unique you know

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:37.820
deconstruction in my Isaac play not

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:41.140
deconstruction that implies like a level

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:43.790
of deliberateness is more like a

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:47.300
destruction just wasn't playing very

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:49.040
well at all we've got this run here

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.960
that's it's a beautiful creature and now

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.820
we're asking for speed upgrades but

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:56.230
we're asking for speed upgrades because

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:59.030
I'm slow and I'd like to be faster

00:20:56.230 --> 00:21:02.030
neither of these items necessarily

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:07.670
justify a purchase static was the fact

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:11.000
that we have restock so I don't think I

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:13.220
want to purchase oh yeah but it was

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.620
actually really good Noli Ace of Hearts

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:17.180
no this is fine no it's not fine

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:19.220
actually I used I thought we've

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:20.690
purchased a second two of clubs card but

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:22.400
we hadn't now we have a supports which I

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:23.810
don't care about but I'm not going to

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:28.010
purchase anything here I'd rather use

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:29.030
our money on the shop to get more and I

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:31.010
don't know if we're going to be able to

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:33.710
do that and by the shop I mean the shop

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:35.000
in the Blue Room which you know it would

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:37.870
have helped if I had articulated that a

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.660
little faster for certain but we have

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:43.790
money and we have restock but I don't

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:46.430
really want to spend money on bad items

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:47.630
just to get restocked to work let's go

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:49.750
fight the boss I think we're good to go

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:49.750
here

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:54.230
and we can go to a deal with the devil

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:56.900
which is a rarity for us to have that

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:59.180
sort of time but if it's Krampus

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:02.210
honestly I'd welcome it because both

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:04.720
Krampus is head and lump of coal could

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:12.470
serve a purpose for us right now

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:13.670
it is Krampus if we get screwed here

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:15.230
because we don't have a spectral tears

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:18.530
I'll never forgive myself but that's

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:21.770
good in fact it's very good we get locus

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:22.940
of conquests and lump of coal and then

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:25.160
let's see what we got going on on boss

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:27.020
rush this would be a great boss rush to

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.340
not be super slow on I mean how can you

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:30.590
not take magic much you're going to have

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:33.050
to impress him pretty hard to make magic

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:35.030
mushed not the item of choice there so

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:37.190
we're going to pop this down grab magic

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:44.990
mush we have no other damage multipliers

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:46.480
so it's a five damage up how is he he

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:49.070
interstellar

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.630
he escaped the event horizon how does

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:54.230
one do that I don't understand

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:57.530
as Neil smoke deGrasse Tyson been lying

00:22:54.230 --> 00:23:01.190
to me this whole time we are going to

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:03.890
get through this very very quickly I

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:11.600
mean oh you know what he's not really

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:14.890
escaping is the thing he's just sort of

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.890
getting trapped against the wall

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:24.490
I'm also sort of confused like with car

00:23:22.539 --> 00:23:27.190
battery I don't really understand why

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:29.860
we're getting a full charge like I

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:32.440
understand why we're getting half of a

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:33.940
charge when we killed a wave I do not

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:36.990
understand why we're getting a full

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:39.010
charge both angels statues at once I

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:40.330
don't understand why we get a full

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:42.039
charge when you finish away it's like we

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:47.110
get a half charge when the wave dies and

00:23:42.039 --> 00:23:49.840
then we get another half charge when the

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:52.360
next wave spawns maybe they made boss

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:57.929
rush easier when you have spacebar items

00:23:52.360 --> 00:24:00.460
they just give you more charges now well

00:23:57.929 --> 00:24:02.200
you know I'm calling it like I see it

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:05.470
pretty sure we're going to make the hush

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:08.350
fight oh you're still hanging out over

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:10.929
there huh I don't know if we have a

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:13.389
particularly strong claim to beat the

00:24:10.929 --> 00:24:16.529
hush fight quickly what's going on here

00:24:13.389 --> 00:24:16.529
it's war

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:24.830
oh so you just went to like the Z

00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:33.200
dimension to get away with that I see

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:35.960
how it is we're going to be out of here

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:38.780
by like 23 minutes at latest and we have

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:41.830
no mapping it would be nice to sort that

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:45.679
out but point wise we're going to be

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:48.710
very much ahead of the curve relative to

00:24:45.679 --> 00:24:50.660
my relative to my average here so we get

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:53.720
cursed I obviously like that's not high

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:55.850
on my list so let's uh let's bounce dude

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:59.390
this is a great situation I actually

00:24:55.850 --> 00:25:03.100
feel like the top 100 probably should

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:03.100
shy away from saying it's a certainty

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:14.660
but it seems well within the realm of

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:18.470
plausibility because I just I don't know

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:22.610
if black hole is like an item that

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:25.010
people respect if you know what I mean

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:26.870
like don't think it's the item where

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:29.540
people go all black hole I'll take that

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:31.190
you know least I don't respect it most

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:33.110
of the time I look at it I go this is

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:34.580
not garbage but I just don't really

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:38.570
understand how to make it work for us in

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:43.000
the best way possible here how are we

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:48.950
going to make it so we are able to

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:50.750
defeat delirium or is this going to be

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:59.330
the daily where I succumb to the dark

00:25:50.750 --> 00:26:01.040
side and like just bow out of the

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:02.480
Delirium fights we got celebrity for

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:05.030
dummies we got Satanic Bible that is a

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:06.350
bookworm transformation but neither of

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:09.470
them are that appealing to me as a

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:11.360
keeper right now mmm tella pills we lose

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:12.290
the hero font but we probably are never

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:14.540
going to need the Euro font but we're

00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:15.860
going to go back anyway but I think I am

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:19.429
going to abstain from the curse room I

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:20.960
don't think we need it let me put it

00:26:19.429 --> 00:26:23.570
this way the damage from the curse room

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:25.880
is going to in all likelihood outweigh

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:27.740
the expected value of the curse room

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:30.669
this is why I watched northernlion for

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:32.440
the armchair statistician

00:26:30.669 --> 00:26:33.970
who's actually incorrect but still I'm

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.470
you know my hunch is that that's the

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:42.159
case and I guess be sure to use the

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:44.559
Satanic Bible once but are we too late

00:26:42.159 --> 00:26:48.489
for like a twelve million view YouTube

00:26:44.559 --> 00:26:50.409
video that's kylo Ren singing Adele's

00:26:48.489 --> 00:26:57.730
hello but called hello from the dark

00:26:50.409 --> 00:27:01.379
side instead hello film adduction and

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:03.580
then you got to put other lyrics there

00:27:01.379 --> 00:27:04.960
that I can't really I'm trying to think

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:07.419
of what rhymes with dark side and has

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:09.669
like some Star Wars relevance but you

00:27:07.419 --> 00:27:10.749
know that's what the SNL writers are

00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:17.730
there for I don't need to pick that up

00:27:10.749 --> 00:27:22.590
and put it back down we're good let's go

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:22.590
those things are about to pop again

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:32.100
you might as well use the black hole

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:34.110
like oh my lord you get an extra charge

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:37.880
every wave on these rooms now so I think

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:40.800
you'd have to be a little silly not to

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:45.690
so I will admit you know I'm being

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:49.590
tempted by the fact that a pretty good

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:54.480
chance if you just don't fight delirium

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:55.530
you'll rank really well today and it's

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.840
not like I'm in the most difficult

00:27:55.530 --> 00:28:00.600
position in the world here you know it's

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:01.860
not like a 51% while maybe do a 49% one

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.750
being to want me not to do it

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:06.510
probably like 80% of people are like

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:07.590
just do whatever makes you happy I'll

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:08.850
tell you what we'll cross that bridge

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:10.950
when we come to it when we see what our

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:12.690
score is I also I wouldn't put it past

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:15.060
myself to try to cheese it and then

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:17.420
accidentally invalidate the daily like I

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:20.160
don't know habits of you alt f4 you like

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:24.060
you hit escape quit run or something

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:27.630
like that I don't know the secret room

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:29.160
in all likelihood but we are that's the

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:32.400
first damage you're taken in a long time

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:34.380
we're very well equipped to tackle the

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.670
unique concerns of this daily we still

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.080
do have the hush fight and the hush

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:38.820
fight I mean it gives us points but it's

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:42.480
going to cost us points as well I don't

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:45.090
think we need flies I'd rather have flat

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:48.840
penny to give us keys and then we use

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:53.340
those keys as a point bonus like that's

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:55.260
how in I am right now on this run like

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:57.830
the extra 300 or 400 points where you

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:59.760
get from keys sign me up

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:02.400
because I think we got a chance here

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:06.000
we're out of boss rush like in time that

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:09.450
never happens in time to easily get to

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:14.930
the hush fight we do I mean probably

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:14.930
will want dark bomb to pick those up

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:22.850
we might as well fight ah maybe I don't

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:31.400
think it matters

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:34.910
I really don't but I'm not going to

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:36.650
fight mommy I just in case the mom well

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:38.660
just in case the hush door like D

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:41.240
materializes if you leave the room I

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:42.350
it's been in the game for like two and a

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:45.559
half years or something like that at

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:47.030
this point but I don't think it does but

00:29:45.559 --> 00:29:48.770
if we're in a situation where we want to

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:52.120
backtrack regardless why riskier right

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:56.090
we do have a deal with the devil

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:58.400
like now we don't want counterfeit penny

00:29:56.090 --> 00:30:01.340
necessarily it's not horrible but the

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:03.230
only thing I would say is that don't

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:06.980
give up too much HP to this deal with

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:08.750
the devil because we do still need to

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:10.429
fight how and do the entire void floor

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:12.710
and to be honest with you the entire

00:30:10.429 --> 00:30:15.080
void floor basically I'm just

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:17.510
subtweeting delirium unless I wish

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:20.750
somebody would have less HP don't you

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:22.760
hate it when you keep going back to a

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:24.410
boss and then the boss just disrespects

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.820
you by ruining your dailies yeah that's

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:27.500
really insulting and then delirium is

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:29.210
like hey who's this about and you're

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:35.390
like don't worry about it I'm a private

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:37.630
person just drop the key at the southern

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:37.630
entrance

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:43.880
like we could make it into the boss trap

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:45.740
room here I think that just adds in a

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:48.050
degree of uncertainty that I'm

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:51.170
uncomfortable with not to be the world's

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:55.010
biggest baby back bitch but I really

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:56.390
don't want to I mean why is the thing I

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:57.890
guess we got this self-sacrifice room

00:30:56.390 --> 00:31:01.070
where we get some extra spirit arts but

00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:04.820
it doesn't benefit us enough to justify

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:06.440
the potential cost even though the

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:12.410
potential cost is fairly low to begin

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:12.860
with alright obviously easy money there

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:16.940
uh

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:20.750
okay I don't really want either of these

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:21.950
to be honest with you I can't I have to

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:28.550
leave and try to come back in and all

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:30.860
that portal is like oh my god I got a

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:33.590
note I got to check the reddit after

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:34.940
this and see like people are like I got

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:39.260
sucked into the portal just before the

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:40.160
hash pipe alright so crooked penny is

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.900
always interesting

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:43.820
these are garbage so we're looking for

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:46.850
like a Perth row or a d6 or something

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:48.680
okay well scapular is lovely don't get

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:50.540
me wrong but you've got to go pyromaniac

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:55.310
immunity to explosions by itself is

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:57.860
worth a ton and despite this being a

00:31:55.310 --> 00:32:00.470
little bit contrary to my normal

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:02.840
strategy at this point I am going to

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:05.990
take a blood bag because I want the

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:08.200
speed upgrade then we come in here and I

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:10.850
feel we might as well buy crooked penny

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:12.050
we might as well buy a starter deck I

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:15.200
don't know why everything's half-price

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:17.000
but you know remember we're spending but

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:18.770
it's because I want to make the Delirium

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.680
fight that much easier so I mean we

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:22.220
don't really want convertor nightlights

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.980
fine

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:26.150
there's option of cake maybe like I mean

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:29.360
we're spending a little too much the

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:30.560
Maps good fanny packs good blowing our

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.420
glass not that good

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:34.310
you want to double everything maybe get

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:35.840
like a battery charge otherwise we're

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:39.430
stuck with crooked penny you know what

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:43.880
we're stuck with crooked penny we got no

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:45.320
we got no night light no not no night

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:47.810
light no black hole I think that's

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:49.160
completely okay crooked penny if I'm

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:50.360
being real with you is what we were

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.960
going to take at some point anyway

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:56.399
because

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:58.980
the the chance to double everything is

00:32:56.399 --> 00:33:00.330
too valuable from a point standpoint

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:02.519
from a Zayn standpoint it's got

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:03.809
everything the body means so it does

00:33:02.519 --> 00:33:05.820
suck to lose the black hole but the

00:33:03.809 --> 00:33:08.029
black hole was amazing for us on boss

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:11.070
rush and that's enough

00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:14.429
even if it's just a boss rush specialty

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:16.950
for whatever reason it did amazing work

00:33:14.429 --> 00:33:18.499
for us on that last run so the score is

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:26.070
the highest scores are between 45 and

00:33:18.499 --> 00:33:28.409
35,000 45 and 55 thousand we should be

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:30.720
able to ascend to those levels if I'm

00:33:28.409 --> 00:33:32.610
being legit with you right now

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.960
I'm just thinking like man it would be

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:42.029
so nice to have shielded tears but

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:44.009
that's an aside we're going to be at 37

00:33:42.029 --> 00:33:47.009
by the time we leave this floor with the

00:33:44.009 --> 00:33:53.399
full floor remaining so the easiest way

00:33:47.009 --> 00:33:57.240
to get to 45,000 would be to I mean of

00:33:53.399 --> 00:34:01.769
course a never take damage again because

00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:05.039
now failed and be cranked on these

00:34:01.769 --> 00:34:06.389
consumables and then you usually get a

00:34:05.039 --> 00:34:10.319
little bonus for finishing the run

00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:14.250
regardless we got it we got it we got it

00:34:10.319 --> 00:34:21.659
okay let's go go grab a spear at our

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:22.980
back here this is our void floor and

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:24.720
let's get a move on so what do we have

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:28.260
the world card what was our the guy the

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:29.460
hero font it is the ear of fun

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:31.559
so we blow this up even though I don't

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:33.210
think it gives us anything at all well

00:34:31.559 --> 00:34:36.599
give us three cards it's not useless

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:38.819
actually Wheel of Fortune and then we

00:34:36.599 --> 00:34:41.639
replace the Tower with the Europe on and

00:34:38.819 --> 00:34:44.720
a high priestess like I'm pretty I'm

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:49.069
semi confident we do more damage than

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:49.069
than high priestess does at this point

00:34:55.570 --> 00:35:01.240
so again general MO here you want to

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:04.210
explore every room take no damage and

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:06.910
then quit just prior to the delirium

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:10.570
room whether or not we go through with

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:13.750
that plan I don't know I feel like oh it

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:17.410
would be a compromising of my ideals but

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:19.210
at the same time every time I've gone

00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:22.260
through with the delirium fight to

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:24.760
finish a run I've always lost like

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:28.060
thousands of points and sometimes I've

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:30.940
also compromised my ability to even win

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:32.800
the run so it's kind of like if you

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:33.940
can't beat them eat them and if you

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:37.810
can't beat them and eat them join them

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:39.280
as far as I'm concerned because I really

00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:41.770
feel like they should just make it so

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:44.350
delirium gives you like it doesn't have

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:46.480
to be a big bonus but delirium gave you

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:48.460
another 3,000 points for beating it

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:51.250
everyone would try to do it because

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:54.310
that's the way that you get ahead on

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:56.140
these dailies is you you do aggressive

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:59.230
plays that other people might shy away

00:35:56.140 --> 00:36:01.810
from because they happen too fast or

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:03.190
they're too dangerous and I think you

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:05.200
know that would actually be bad for me

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:08.340
because I'm a notoriously terrible

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:10.330
player when it comes to delirium but

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:14.800
okay those spikes might be legitimate

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:16.420
still so be careful but I think that it

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:21.880
just it fits the spirit of the game

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:25.440
better if it's a spirited a game better

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:29.230
okay I you don't have to sponge me me

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:32.080
give me the right there

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:33.370
these are like all potential delirium

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:36.850
fights so I'm going to stay away from

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:39.940
them for now you might ask why I sought

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:40.690
them out in the first place got a good

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:43.570
point

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:45.310
in fact almost every one of these could

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:48.000
be delirium so you know what let's force

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:48.000
our own hand

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:56.880
okay you might think I'm bummed in a way

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:58.710
I am because I've gated myself out of

00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:01.410
one of the options but in a way I'm not

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:03.690
because now we can just go through the

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:05.430
rest of the floor and I was looking at

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:06.720
it you know go look at the map pause the

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:09.780
video look at the map there were like

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:12.090
two locations where delirium almost

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:14.520
certainly would not be and then in every

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:17.850
other location that a boss room could be

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:20.040
like the terminus of a path there was a

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:21.150
decent chance it could be delirium so I

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:24.480
figured let's just go for the bosses

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:27.180
closest to us and then you know if it is

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:28.620
delirium least we found it fast if it's

00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:32.730
not delirium then at least we didn't

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:34.500
waste time you know for tracking to a an

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:38.130
area that might be delirium nonetheless

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:39.090
you know this is an easier delirium

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:41.480
fight than usual

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:44.550
probably our ridiculously high damage

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:46.830
piercing shots killing power and tech

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:49.140
zero or doing great work for us I'm not

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:54.800
going to sweat getting hit twice I'm not

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:58.680
going to sweat getting hit six times and

00:37:54.800 --> 00:38:00.740
you know what to kill delirium that

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:06.590
sounded like an eternal heart but to

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:09.330
kill delirium and maintain like my own

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:12.540
twisted sense of you know a moral code

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:15.600
and Isaac feels good and I almost

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:17.910
immediately ate it but by taking damage

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:20.100
against a troll bomb right after that

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:24.450
but we made it that's fine all right I

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:26.490
mean you might as well well we might as

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:30.330
well not have because it cost us 20

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:32.280
points so at this point if we see an

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:35.040
item that's fun we should take it if we

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:36.270
see an item that just sort of exists we

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:39.030
shouldn't take it like we could take all

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:40.530
the guppy items once we see if there's

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:44.730
three guppy items on this floor for

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:45.930
example and now we feel pretty safe

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:48.000
going into like every single one of

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:50.120
these rooms like blue map we don't need

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.260
sure maybe it finds us the secret room

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:54.090
the second secret room I should say all

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:59.220
right all find us both secret rooms but

00:38:54.090 --> 00:39:06.120
I don't think it's high on the necessity

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:07.350
list and I mean to be a hundred percent

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.850
real with you you should kill every

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:12.470
enemy without getting hit at this point

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:16.040
I would have given myself

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:18.960
ohoho I would have given myself way more

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:20.190
flak for taking damage extra damage on

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:22.260
top of what we already took against

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:24.150
delirium then I would give me for taking

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:25.470
extra damage now against pretty much any

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:27.560
other enemy I'll take this because it

00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:30.740
gives us five items to sorry five bombs

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:34.410
and I think that that's worth something

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:35.910
that is a devil card it's got a half way

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:39.360
through this floor so we're going to

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:41.970
finish 45 I actually think is within our

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:44.850
grasp if we don't take damage maybe a

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:46.440
lucky - of X card shows up I think 45

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:48.270
thousand is not outside of the realm of

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:50.940
possibility I think this could be a top

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:54.000
50 daily let's call it top 50 for now

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:56.400
and that's top 50 with delirium so as

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.020
far as I was like number negative 12

00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:03.690
you know we're higher than number one

00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:05.910
that's a little bit of a stretch but we

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:08.130
did it our way and for once our way work

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:10.130
it probably still did not work as well

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:14.010
as the other way but it worked

00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:17.070
gosh darn it okay Pandora's box is

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:21.600
actually garbage on this floor I believe

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:23.160
it gives you nothing I've heard they've

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:25.530
recently added more hops

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:27.570
I have also used swallowed penny

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:29.820
approximately zero times and swallowed

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:30.960
penny of course immigrants beating

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:35.400
around the bush you have a swallowed

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:41.130
penny of course is actually crooked

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:46.170
penny should try to double some things I

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:50.060
don't know kind of just focused on

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:50.060
playing absently for now

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:55.210
keys are thankfully coming up mostly

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:56.980
again that flat penny pickup which I do

00:40:55.210 --> 00:41:01.960
think was the right call if we can get

00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:05.470
to 43,000 before the the world okay if

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:07.900
we can get to 43,000 before the before

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:10.420
we finish the run I think that we will

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:13.660
have a great chance to be in the front

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:17.800
page of the leaderboard right now 55,000

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:19.690
is not within grasp think to get that

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:22.720
done you'd basically have to not take

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:24.160
damage on this run and then maybe I mean

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.690
if you use your two of clubs better than

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:28.990
I did you can eke another thousand out

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:31.600
of that potentially maybe you double the

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:33.070
two of clubs with swallowed penny you

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.870
know that puts you in a great spot as

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:36.790
well but today's daily I'm given as a

00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:39.760
seal of approval this is like an A to A

00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:43.810
plus daily as far as I'm concerned I had

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:46.410
a great time on today's daily if we play

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:49.560
our cards right we might be at 44,000

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:53.910
44,000 dude I mean that's pretty good

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:56.890
you might wonder by the way why am I not

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:59.080
picking up like anything even some items

00:41:56.890 --> 00:42:00.490
that are good at this point you know one

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:02.950
room of guardian angel isn't worth the

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:05.350
cost we should that we should open this

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:07.210
because two keys if we get two pennies

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:08.650
we got a good chance to get it back we

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:12.820
have one penny and some bombs which are

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:15.820
functionally the same and what you got

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:17.530
for me I thought maybe he would give us

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:19.390
points just for eating those some of

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:21.610
those enemies do I'm not going to blow

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:25.320
up spirit arts because a bomb or sorry

00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:25.320
have a tinted rocks because a bomb for a

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:31.080
for spirit arts that I can't even pick

00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:34.240
up makes no sense to me so we'll very

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:40.460
very quickly just come up here crack

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:42.230
into this and blow these both up

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:45.770
and that's going to do is we're going to

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:47.840
be at like 40 3643 I'd say we've got a

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:49.340
good bead on the front page today for

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:50.690
now at least it is pretty early in the

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:51.950
day still

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:53.810
well actually I live in like the

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:59.150
westernmost timezone so it's not really

00:42:53.810 --> 00:43:00.380
early in the day but still time you know

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:04.480
people are coming home from work and

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:06.920
stuff like that but not quite this one

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:09.110
but I think that will be definitely

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:12.110
within the top like 50 today top hundred

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:14.440
somewhere in that vicinity so let's go

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:16.250
check it out see how we did here we got

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:17.630
forty-three thousand six hundred

00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:19.130
forty-eight I thought we were going to

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:21.590
get a point photo so he finished but now

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:23.750
we're 103 I was too in Milan more than I

00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:25.580
should have but still a good run a fun

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:26.690
run I had a great time hope you did as

00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:27.770
