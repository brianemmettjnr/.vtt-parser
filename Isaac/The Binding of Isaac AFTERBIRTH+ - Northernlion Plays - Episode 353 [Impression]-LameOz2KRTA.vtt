00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.910
hey everybody welcome back it's funky

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.150
it's not spelunky I shouldn't joke about

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.059
that spelunky is a beautiful game so is

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.410
Isaac especially when you get an IVA and

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.750
I was going to say especially when you

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.199
get a no matter who it was no matter who

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:24.449
it were I was going to say that dat CR

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.490
for FH basically straight up these have

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.859
been the easiest Isaac runs of all time

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.590
and I am incredibly blessed it's like

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.149
you know being an NHL team coming off of

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.440
the all-star break and you look at your

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.260
schedule and you're like Colorado

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.579
Avalanche like I'm going to touch on

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.420
that there's another tangent I have for

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.090
that Colorado Avalanche Arizona coyotes

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.039
Arizona coyotes Vancouver Canucks San

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.989
Jose Sharks look at the tough one then

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.170
you go back to Colorado for another game

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.780
against the 2016-2017 Avalanche the joke

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.360
is that they were not very good this

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.930
year neither where the Canucks see us

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.219
northernlion school of owning people is

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.510
you got it before you can own people you

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.739
got to own yourself and then they feel

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.750
comfortable being owned because you're

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.470
all in it together anyway let's go for a

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.540
Babylon here um in my opinion you know

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.450
and and I'm not saying I'm an expert but

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.939
I did teach English in South Korea for

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.430
12 months and as a result I would say

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.090
that I am a professional of the highest

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.119
the order can't open it unfortunately

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.860
the the hardest expression in the

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.400
English language to say is Colorado

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.860
Avalanche there are like and I never

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.869
used to have this problem and this is

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.810
not a bit well I mean I'm mining it for

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.250
a bit but it's like it's the reality of

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.170
the situation when I was a kid I had no

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.570
problem saying Colorado Avalanche

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.979
because that's just how you learn you

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.860
get that pattern and stuck in your head

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.380
and you say it I went to Korea all of

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.020
the a sounds are pronounced the same

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.689
they're all ah so you know we say

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.520
Samsung that's not correct technically

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.409
although again you can localize it to

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.799
that if you live in the Americas I think

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.229
that's fine it's actually Samba song if

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:12.490
you go that's wrong no you're wrong okay

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:14.260
this is a family name in South Korea you

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.970
you know better than the South Koreans

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.550
how to pronounce the name of the same

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.430
thing like it's not hye-young day it's

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.350
film day but anyway I digress this is

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.110
getting to the point of irrelevance

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.510
I never had a problem then I came back

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.260
after you know learning to speak just

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.080
very very very basic Korean chuggy old

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.350
makes you do gauge you say oh bali

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.020
bah-li it's a joke for my expats out

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.860
there it says bring me two beers and get

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.570
the land out if you know what I mean

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.760
so all the A's are pronounced off and

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:52.480
then you get this word call a raw dough

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:56.950
so that's a rah rah rah rah rah and then

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:00.220
you go ah Vall lanch it's like I know

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.460
this bit is like it's not actually I

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.900
know this bit is very insular it doesn't

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.330
seem like it makes sense but people make

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.400
fun of me they go why'd you say Colorado

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.350
Avalanche wrong it's because it's that

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.510
it illustrates it's the perfect

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.320
cellar-door ism for illustrating how

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:20.080
stupid the English language's Colorado

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.130
Avalanche is it's a team in the NHL by

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.260
the way if you're confused about what

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:28.660
I'm even talking about to begin with

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:30.850
here oh that was bad it's got like eight

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.530
A's in it and they're all pronounced

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.580
differently despite being the same

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.990
letter that's why I would it's the the

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.390
lightning rod for my criticism of the

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.130
English language that and I say this is

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.050
someone who I think has a good handle on

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.030
the English language I understand you

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.280
know the musicality of words and how to

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.290
use them in what I hope is the proper

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.580
fashion to elicit the maximum amount of

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:57.820
humor or at least meaning from them but

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:01.240
okay that's a good one not a good joke

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:04.300
but a good one but Colorado Avalanche

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:07.000
it's a tough one that would that should

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.470
be like on the final exam of any kind of

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.660
like English language proficiency test

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.030
even for spelling it's a little hard

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.800
it's no Massachusetts which even to this

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.480
day I can't spell and if you can spell

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.010
Massachusetts properly I'm assuming you

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.120
travel there a lot or live there that's

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.440
just the way it goes you know sure you

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.390
know I've been to Ketchum makuu jig

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.840
national park I can spell that kappa

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.990
skate

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.360
it's not a problem a palapa scat no

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.250
worries dude no all right we got belly

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.419
button we can hold two of these

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.720
absolutely no freaking problem go

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.669
building a new cook up and Squamish with

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.169
the iroquois you got a problem it was

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.270
actually here at koi it's actually

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.040
whatever they wanted to be okay you

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.810
don't get to choose is what I'm trying

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.889
to suggest can I have a key please by

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:54.389
the way but Massachusetts that just

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:56.770
can't do it just name the state mass

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:00.280
might seem like a stupid name but we got

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:03.010
no shortage of those you know I live in

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.050
a province called British Columbia what

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.220
country is it in Britain no that's

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.880
stupid are you an idiot

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.130
Columbia no are you crazy absolutely not

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.410
it's in Canada obviously British

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.360
Columbia is in Canada it's not even

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.669
close to Britain or Columbia well it's

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:23.770
not that far from Columbia depending if

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:26.020
you're walking it's a long trip they

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.380
finally gave me a key all right

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.720
anyway what I was the whole point of

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.340
this was to say that like the first runs

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.780
we've had here have been very easy it's

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.340
been like you know a strength of

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.750
schedule has been very low I'll try to

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.729
localize it for whatever sport you

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.410
follow if you follow sports if you

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.910
follow basketball it's like coming back

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.010
from the all-star break and then you got

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.020
games against the 76ers of the Brooklyn

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.490
Nets back-to-back you've watched the

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.810
National Football League it's like hey

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.180
we got a home-and-away against the

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.400
Jacksonville Jaguars next week if you

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.700
watch the Major League Baseball it's

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.590
like good news we got a doubleheader

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.570
with the Philadelphia Phillies tomorrow

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.080
anyway the maybe the Marlins are worse

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:07.710
now I can't remember anyway

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:12.639
if you watch the British Premier League

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:15.580
it's like we've got a few games with

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:17.400
Stoke City does I a few tilts with Stoke

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.260
City coming up if you watch

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.729
international soccer only it's like

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.370
you're playing Canada and World Cup

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:26.080
qualifiers what is this this is not a

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:30.510
modded run so it must be a new booster

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:32.740
pack item the seven seals okay I have a

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:36.930
have a horseman of the Apocalypse

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:39.790
following me around it's war

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:43.080
then he seems to be creating flies for

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:48.040
me on occasion

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:49.780
he's fly out these switched into I don't

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.430
think I can control them at all so I

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.870
mean the way I see it right now is that

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:58.780
it's just the horsemen that follows you

00:06:52.870 --> 00:07:02.980
around and creates flies so it's like a

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:04.960
weird rotten baby does it create a

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.370
different number of flies by I'm

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.780
assuming it doesn't create a different

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.940
amount of damage for flies because that

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.040
breaks kind of like the fundamental rule

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.780
applies from Isaac which is that flies

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:17.650
always do two times it's your damage of

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:20.500
your your actual damage set this room is

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:24.220
like Loki one of the most underrated

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.360
difficult rooms in Isaac everyone always

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.090
talks about the room with like the

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.770
mushrooms that pop up and shoot on

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:34.180
diagonals and and we're on verticals but

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:36.100
they never actually Telegraph like these

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:39.820
guys right here lady why do I say when

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:41.290
you can just you know show it it's like

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.640
the first rule of filming I believe it

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.500
was Stanley Kubrick that said that

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.140
originally when I say it when you could

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:50.290
just show it say hey it's rain Stanley

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:58.630
Kubrick right-hand man to Al Capone in

00:07:50.290 --> 00:08:00.400
the 1930s I mean there we go

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:02.620
I'm not going to take curse died this

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.510
run is fine I don't know how good the

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.700
item is I almost talked about over

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:08.350
Corrections I almost said I don't know

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:12.420
how well this item is I don't know how

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:12.420
good the seven harbingers item is but

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:19.360
care about rosary bead I mean I I do

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:21.750
like Callas even though the odds are I

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:24.820
probably oh you know what it creates

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:28.720
flies when you kill enemies is that no

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:30.370
that was just a coincidence creates

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.920
flies when all your flies die I don't

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:34.660
know yet we'll figure it out but the run

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.210
is still good like our damage stat is

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:39.010
great as long as we can enable Whore of

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:41.740
Babylon to function which we can as long

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:44.170
as we keep the razor blade and a level

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:46.420
of HP that is not zero although a zero

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:48.450
we will keep it anyway so suppose that's

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.490
sort of irrelevant

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:52.200
I prefer to have a little bit more HP

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:53.520
let's see what conquest does I'm going

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.800
to assume that he flies around it makes

00:08:53.520 --> 00:09:00.870
flies for us yep

00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:05.310
so far so good if it's just like a weird

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:08.480
kind of like variable version

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:10.770
no no because it also seeks out enemies

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:13.080
but it doesn't seem to do much damage

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:16.860
maybe the maybe the different followers

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:22.110
have different behaviors like conquests

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:25.650
definitely sawed out enemies it or they

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:29.010
appeared to at least we are getting like

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:30.720
mighty low one HP it's got me concerned

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:33.060
we still got an item room to go to here

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:36.570
it's X lakhs what we are going to do is

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:37.950
pop temperance and we basically want

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:41.250
temperance to give us blood bag because

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:42.840
it's permanent stats now we have enough

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.880
money to make our shop potentially work

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:49.740
as well so let's try that first and the

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:51.390
shop gives us a key which we probably do

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.950
want but do it in this order first

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.630
because we get PhD we should have gone

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:57.960
back and plated a little more of a PhD

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:59.490
first gives us HP which we can then use

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:02.430
to get enough money to buy a key anyway

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:04.080
out of this but it also gives us the

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:06.180
pill and the pill ended up being a luck

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:10.410
upgrade which is really good and then we

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:13.920
can buy a heart for three cents so I

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:16.350
figured we might as well knock that out

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:19.770
we don't really I mean we don't raise er

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:23.040
can do good stuff for us but I don't

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:24.930
think it's a necessity right now X lakhs

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.660
counts as a good pill unfortunately so

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:31.560
we're not really doing anything by

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:33.000
converting that unfortunately with PhD

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.530
is what I mean to save so bomb is a

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.960
worthwhile purchase because the bomb

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.490
gives us access to the tinted rock this

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.780
is the kind of run that I'm happy to

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:42.050
have now because I'm a little bit warmed

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:44.460
up but this gives me the opportunity to

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:46.580
I'm going to be a little lazy about that

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:50.550
but this gives me the opportunity to

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:52.730
start to have two min max just a little

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:56.910
bit not in the way like oh well if i

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:58.660
play my cards right I could go from 81

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:00.730
keys to 84 keys here

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.920
I just use the you know sign curve of

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:04.690
the Delta time you know it's not like

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.769
that on disparage anybody from doing

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:08.920
that I'm just not that kind of person

00:11:05.769 --> 00:11:10.449
for the most part see we're in kind of a

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.579
rock or in between a rock and a hard

00:11:10.449 --> 00:11:16.089
place here because I really want to use

00:11:12.579 --> 00:11:18.779
the razor bullion right now pills is not

00:11:16.089 --> 00:11:20.920
a good pill don't let them lie to you

00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:23.769
hopefully uh now that we have a bomb

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:25.750
actually so they can keep Liberty cabin

00:11:23.769 --> 00:11:27.279
Calais now that we have a bomb we don't

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:29.740
even buy a bomb it's getting kind of

00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:32.620
confusing here and you're saying no it's

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:34.839
not don't insult our intelligence but no

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:36.519
I think it is getting slightly more

00:11:34.839 --> 00:11:39.459
tricky the situation we find ourselves

00:11:36.519 --> 00:11:42.790
in here so that's probably our secret

00:11:39.459 --> 00:11:48.459
room will crack this yeah it was not

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:52.089
really a huge get but not bad and I do

00:11:48.459 --> 00:11:54.939
want to go let's see what we get here

00:11:52.089 --> 00:11:58.629
then we'll talk about ASA hearts yeah

00:11:54.939 --> 00:12:00.610
that's actually like pretty good I'm

00:11:58.629 --> 00:12:02.199
going to go to our curse room we're

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.240
going to hope that on the cursor we can

00:12:02.199 --> 00:12:09.360
find a way to not have to lose half a

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.360
spear at hearts so start by razorblade

00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:15.310
yeah it's like the opposite isn't it

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:17.259
this guy wants to take all of my hearts

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:18.850
here but this wooden cross is really

00:12:17.259 --> 00:12:22.360
good okay gives you one a holy mantle

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:25.630
per floor if I remember correctly so we

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:27.819
can use it like right now I don't need

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:29.110
that HP I will just do it like this so

00:12:27.819 --> 00:12:32.439
there goes our holy mantle what only

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:34.360
mantle poor floor is still very good in

00:12:32.439 --> 00:12:35.889
my opinion at least and we're really I

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:39.069
think we're doing the right thing here

00:12:35.889 --> 00:12:42.639
we've managed to make a lot of things go

00:12:39.069 --> 00:12:45.699
our way on this floor with a very

00:12:42.639 --> 00:12:47.680
limited amount of resources and I'm not

00:12:45.699 --> 00:12:50.559
talking about Magic the Gathering so

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:53.069
hopefully this is a secret room get two

00:12:50.559 --> 00:12:55.930
birds stoned at once and I mean that was

00:12:53.069 --> 00:12:58.000
actually terrible and okay this is great

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:59.860
so we should get blood or Evie bag both

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.559
of which could be useful for us here we

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:05.670
do have to be a little careful about the

00:13:02.559 --> 00:13:05.670
way that we choose to play this

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:11.940
we don't want to accidentally kill

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.500
ourselves but either of these pickups

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:16.020
could be good we will also definitely

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.940
get enough money to get a dull razor if

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.470
we want to get it there we go so we got

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:21.810
blood bag I mean we don't need to pick

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:23.700
up any of those then and we will we will

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:25.170
just barely get enough money to take

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:29.310
Dola razor

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:33.420
I think dull razor is like super the

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:35.040
wrong choice though unfortunately not

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:38.220
having any spirit arts does put us in a

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:40.200
weird spot here but you know we can even

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:43.440
though we got 2.63 damage which oh my

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:47.160
god 2.63 damage is terrible even though

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:51.000
we got 2.63 damage though i have hope

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:53.070
that we can basically via the holy

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.660
mantle charge I just had to use

00:13:53.070 --> 00:14:00.870
unfortunately I had a hope it was a

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:06.750
really good amount of creak there that

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:08.160
we can get to a spirit hard before we

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:10.580
have to use razor blade to put ourselves

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:14.550
in a dicey spot you know what I mean

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:15.960
possibly not a secret room but you know

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.560
with this number of bombs we're going to

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.410
check anyway

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:23.310
we little like unsung hero sort of stuff

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:25.140
going on here we went from zero bombs to

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:27.060
ten bombs by the end of that situation

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:30.210
then I squandered all my goodwill by

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:31.890
taking damage in that situation so this

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:35.700
is becoming like the opposite of what

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:40.100
you want out of a neve run by that I

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:45.560
mean you don't normally I'm sorry buddy

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:48.240
you don't normally want HP and no damage

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:51.960
we'd much prefer to have no HP but like

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:54.600
probably quite a lot of damage so we're

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:59.100
a little bit opposite of where you'd

00:14:54.600 --> 00:15:00.390
like to be on the average even run but

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:03.630
you know what it's not an average eaten

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:05.970
run so weirdo beaten run thus far at

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:09.110
least we got an item I've never seen

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:09.110
before in my entire life

00:15:10.259 --> 00:15:17.829
and honestly although I was originally a

00:15:14.769 --> 00:15:20.829
little bit skeptical that it was any

00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:23.290
good at all the longer it goes on with

00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:24.879
us having basically garbage damage the

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:29.550
happier I am to have it especially the

00:15:24.879 --> 00:15:31.209
creeps seem to just like de stroyed

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:33.459
that's how you know you've played

00:15:31.209 --> 00:15:37.540
probably a little bit too much Isaac

00:15:33.459 --> 00:15:39.129
when you can look at where an enemy is

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.509
and then place the bomb for where

00:15:39.129 --> 00:15:43.000
they're going to be in like four seconds

00:15:40.509 --> 00:15:45.610
that's an indication that I've probably

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.709
wasted my young adult years here NL

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:51.339
don't be silly you're not a young adult

00:15:47.709 --> 00:15:53.800
anymore well I don't know you know what

00:15:51.339 --> 00:15:57.790
the problem is I think the phrase young

00:15:53.800 --> 00:16:01.029
adult has lost all meaning because of

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:03.670
bookstores I was reading young adult

00:16:01.029 --> 00:16:04.959
books when I was like 11 years old when

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:06.310
you're 11 years old you're not a young

00:16:04.959 --> 00:16:08.829
this is not I was not saying I was

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:10.180
particularly precocious you know young

00:16:08.829 --> 00:16:13.360
adult books when I was a kid was like

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:15.730
goosebumps like the you know might be

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:18.459
some Kissin in the book that's what a

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:19.750
young adult book was I got bad news for

00:16:18.459 --> 00:16:21.550
you for you if you're watching this and

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:24.189
you're in you're 11 years old first stop

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:26.079
you've probably first stop good for you

00:16:24.189 --> 00:16:29.290
I guess not really a target audience for

00:16:26.079 --> 00:16:30.939
these surprise that the fact that you

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:32.379
resonated all over the content most of

00:16:30.939 --> 00:16:35.529
the references are a little bit before

00:16:32.379 --> 00:16:38.430
your time but anyway kudos it's

00:16:35.529 --> 00:16:40.930
unfortunate you don't represent really a

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:43.329
prime demographic from an advertiser

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:45.069
standpoint you know it'd be nice if you

00:16:43.329 --> 00:16:47.110
could get older and then buy like some

00:16:45.069 --> 00:16:48.759
outies or something like that and then

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:49.750
you know the ad rates would go through

00:16:48.759 --> 00:16:51.850
the roof but I don't have a grudging

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:55.300
watching the content anyway although it

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:56.949
is stealing anyway um that's a joke of

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:59.949
course where we go in here we finally

00:16:56.949 --> 00:17:01.059
got a sphere in art and a 2 of hearts

00:16:59.949 --> 00:17:05.250
versus an Ace of Hearts

00:17:01.059 --> 00:17:05.250
oh thanks for the secret room access

00:17:07.799 --> 00:17:12.130
but if you're 11 and you're like I read

00:17:10.179 --> 00:17:14.409
young adult novels no you don't you you

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:16.720
read novels that are for probably

00:17:14.409 --> 00:17:17.799
teenagers teenagers not a young adult we

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.019
there's nothing wrong with it

00:17:17.799 --> 00:17:20.919
that's why we got a word for it the word

00:17:20.019 --> 00:17:24.370
is teenagers

00:17:20.919 --> 00:17:27.059
I don't care bad maybe I do I don't know

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:32.580
I don't know dude we're getting like a

00:17:27.059 --> 00:17:34.750
litany of mid-tier trinkets here yeah I

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:38.139
maintain goosebumps not a young adult

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:40.360
novel in my opinion so what is a young

00:17:38.139 --> 00:17:42.340
adult as a 28 year old I'm not an

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.870
authority on the subject like a young

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:49.539
adult is probably someone between the

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:52.960
ages of like 18 and 25 yeah you stop

00:17:49.539 --> 00:17:55.210
being a young adult when you can tell

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.779
someone that you just had a baby and

00:17:55.210 --> 00:18:01.779
they don't look at you like you sure

00:17:57.779 --> 00:18:03.990
like if if we had a child and I was like

00:18:01.779 --> 00:18:07.690
hey guess what you know Kate's pregnant

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:11.169
people would be like Oh finally you're

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:13.840
right at least my mom would be um but if

00:18:11.169 --> 00:18:17.470
you're like 22 in your Ella and guess

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:22.299
what okay it's pregnant people would be

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:24.220
like oh that's like on purpose you know

00:18:22.299 --> 00:18:28.480
that's when you're a young adult when

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:31.740
when having a child is you agreed with

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.740
an inquisitive response

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:41.290
it's a remarkably elegant metric now

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:42.400
you're going to say things like what NL

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:44.140
what if you come from a particularly

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.030
religious community what if you come

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:48.100
from you know a rural community where

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:49.450
things are you know the standards and

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:55.740
norms are different well you know Fair

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:58.360
Play I did I I knew a guy in university

00:18:55.740 --> 00:19:00.220
totally like I mean I only met him like

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.780
three or four times with stand-up guy

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:04.420
everyone had nothing but nice things to

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:07.300
say about him devoutly religious he had

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:09.100
two kids by the time we graduated it was

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.730
still like going to school this is

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.990
amazing

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:13.020
say I was that wouldn't say I was

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:15.760
jealous because I mean come on dude and

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:17.650
see two kids by the time you're like 19

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.720
20 21 years old you're getting a little

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:21.870
ahead of your sitters plenty of time you

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:24.810
know we never stopped making sperm

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:27.610
unless you know you're not married to a

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:30.280
38 year old you doing fine dude take

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:31.570
some time for yourself here less than

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.850
ten years ago you were in like middle

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:35.590
school learn something about the world

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:37.210
so you can pass it anyway the point is

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:39.940
I'm not disparaging young parents I'm

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:41.650
just saying you know different people do

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:44.470
see you know stuff like that at

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:46.180
different points in their lives as being

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:53.110
you know appropriate or inappropriate I

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:55.240
suppose anyway it's not it's not for me

00:19:53.110 --> 00:20:01.270
to say I just you know I basically just

00:19:55.240 --> 00:20:02.950
handled myself death card we're

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:04.360
definitely like we have no chance of

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:07.180
making boss rush in case that's not

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:10.660
abundantly clear and we don't really

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:12.970
care about having triple-a battery again

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:15.130
I not disparaging this we've gotten such

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:18.480
okay trinkets over the course of this

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:21.730
run mmm that's a little scary isn't it

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:23.730
but we really have gotten just okay

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:27.040
trinkets over the course of this run

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:30.550
we've not had like one cancer level

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:31.990
trinket or curve torn or you know it's

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.400
not dark princess crown but like bloody

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:36.390
crown or whatever it's called show up

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:39.610
and be like this is the trinket instead

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:41.470
we kind of you know we're getting a lot

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:44.440
of B pluses and we're going hey you know

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:46.000
well well you can retake the midterm

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.530
exam and if you get a higher mark then

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.760
you got on the midterm

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:50.350
second time I'll give you that mark and

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:53.680
then you know we got like a 51 and now

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:56.200
we're getting like a 53 like yeah it is

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:58.030
better but I spent like you know another

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.590
eight hours studying for it so I'm not

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:01.930
really sure from an opportunity cost

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:06.370
standpoint it was a great use of my time

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:09.220
but the point is as good as that was

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:11.020
terrible as decent as the run is right

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:13.570
now it's no longer good I would say

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:16.420
but as decent as the run is right now we

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:19.960
need a damage upgrade that is not

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:21.430
dependent you got something for me no we

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:25.080
need a damage upgrade that is not

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:29.410
dependent on for Babylon for its quality

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:31.690
right now I put myself in a rough spot

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:32.340
there right now we're not there not even

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:34.720
close

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:36.730
without Whore of Babylon being active we

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:40.000
have like two damage growth hormones

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:43.450
helps yeah okay I'm going to go glass

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:48.100
candy for a while here and we should go

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:51.220
to our shop now that you're too slow

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:52.600
well that's easy money and we will get

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.760
the stopwatch which is also a speed

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:58.540
upgrade but we're at max speed okay well

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:59.830
we will use bombs and I need more than

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:02.620
that I'm sorry to tell you

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:04.120
we'll use bombs and that takes us to

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.340
five cents which allows us to get this

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:13.720
which is ace of clubs which is not great

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:14.590
but can live with it try a few of these

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:18.100
out and then we're going to use

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:19.960
forget-me-now okay

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.070
so we'll keep ace of clubs for now you

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.750
just forget me now we're going to try to

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:23.620
get like a one floor ahead of where

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:25.570
we're at right now because we're

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:29.860
certainly not there at the present

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:31.510
moment so I am starting to get a little

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:33.340
bit more nervous about this run I think

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:34.750
I went into it I had like the opposite

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:36.820
of highway blindness where you the

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:38.320
highway blindness is where obviously by

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:41.470
the way we don't need Calais anymore so

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:44.670
it's not that out but I highway

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:46.570
blindness is when you know you're going

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:48.870
110 kilometres an hour

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:51.580
you know like 75 miles an hour on the on

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:53.740
the interstate and then you hit your

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:56.560
exit and the sign goes you know maximum

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:58.420
30 miles an hour you're 50 kilometres an

00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:00.250
hour you slow down to that speed and you

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.270
go what were they smoking they can't be

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:02.890
right this is like I'm

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:04.860
going at a snail's pace but it's only

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:09.040
because you've become acclimated to your

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:11.860
fast speed that you that you think that

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:13.480
that is impossibly slow we got like the

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.860
opposite where all of my recent runs

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.450
have been so good where I'm looking at

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:18.850
this one and going this one is also

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:21.210
great because it exists and that is

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:24.040
clearly not the case

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:25.690
that's tough love tough choice

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:28.150
we got three luck right now so it's like

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:29.830
a little tempting but I'm gonna go for

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:31.780
rotten baby instead it's a little bit of

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:34.930
the coward's way out but you know

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:38.290
cowardice gets a bad rap what how many

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:40.270
people have died due to cowardice

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:43.170
appearing to be like a negative trait

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:47.830
cowardice is a survival trade dude

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:50.770
the problem with cowardice is a bad

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:52.300
thing you know if invaders are knocking

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:53.290
on your door or something like that and

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:57.390
they're like we would very much be

00:23:53.290 --> 00:24:00.370
liking to take your property right now

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:01.780
yeah let's just go and you're just like

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:03.670
well I don't want to get hurt so sure

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:05.560
take my house and you know use my car

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:07.090
keys that's that's cowardice to an

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:10.870
extreme degree they always do it like

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:12.340
hey want to want a duel well you'll be

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:14.020
really funny as if we just got in a

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:16.840
gunfight and killed each other don't

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:20.010
really want to do that oh what a coward

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:23.650
I like cowardice is the most

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:30.100
misdiagnosed personality trait of all

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:31.870
time we can use polydactyly I always get

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.100
confused because I think that it's the

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:35.380
same as the belly button until I

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:37.420
remember that they're just similar but

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:42.190
not the same what a garbage deal with

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:44.950
the devil I would say that you know to

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:47.610
some extent I am I am a coward but I

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:52.330
don't think that I'm on courageous as

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:53.710
much as those might seem like they're at

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:56.650
odds with one another I don't like to

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:59.980
take stupid risks like I really don't

00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:01.600
understand beyond like a neurochemical

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:04.230
level I don't understand the appeal of

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.230
gambling

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:11.300
but oddly for a while I was really into

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:14.120
opening Counter Strike global Offensive

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:15.860
boxes not like I didn't never do like

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.540
csgo lotto or stuff like that but I'd

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:19.010
like sure you know we're doing the

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:21.170
subscriber stream all open like you know

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:23.360
ten crates or something like that which

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:25.130
is gambling except the downside is that

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:27.130
instead of even having a chance to win

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:29.120
real money you just win skins me and

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:31.520
literally an incredibly complicated

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:33.320
series of intermediaries you can turn

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.790
those skins into the money that you

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.130
originally had when you start okay I

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:40.160
know I'm very familiar sadly with the

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:44.440
whole process that's family I mean

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:46.610
wouldn't be lost aches I suppose but um

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:48.220
could have been a better bomb could have

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:50.210
been a better bomb

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:52.880
gotta send it like a letter from above

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:55.040
because I forget them it's been a while

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.420
Watsky it's not been a while for him

00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:02.570
he's working but it's been a while for

00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:04.160
me anyway but I you know I've said this

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:06.680
a couple times but I had the misfortune

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:08.120
if you lived there and loved it don't

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.590
let me decide you but I had the

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:13.280
misfortune of being in Las Vegas a

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:17.980
couple times this year I just do not

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:21.320
understand gambling we had the my

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:23.630
colleague of mine and I were hanging out

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:28.720
of the roulette table is pretty again

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:28.720
low stakes you know it's like a minimum

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:35.390
five dollar minimum $10 bet Soze like

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:37.430
you know the kiddie tables basically but

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:38.690
you could bet up to like $200 a bed or

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:41.510
something like that there was a lady who

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:43.340
came out of sat next to us and that I

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:46.790
feel like the thing with gambling is you

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:49.850
never call it like you never you never

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:52.550
know if they're cool or addicted which

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:55.370
doesn't sound nice but she came down and

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:58.430
she you know was at the roulette table

00:26:55.370 --> 00:27:00.110
making some very very dangerous bets you

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:01.580
know the way that I was doing it was

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:03.620
basically like I want to sit here and

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:06.710
they will keep bringing me stuff as long

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:08.960
as I you know am constantly betting so

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:11.450
I'd be like look at me you know $20 on

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.740
red and then they'd be like okay it's

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:15.530
black what do you want this time and I'm

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:17.710
like $20 on red and then they're like

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:19.490
it's red and I'm like feeding the system

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:21.230
except sometimes you get

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:25.190
double greens and then that throws your

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:28.820
variance all off anyway the point is she

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:33.080
was going like give me $200 on like 11

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:34.640
lady 11 is just one number I understand

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:38.840
you get paid out to a proportionally

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:40.970
higher degree but still she'll to buy my

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:43.510
fuzzy mental math calculations of this

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:46.400
lady lost like two or three grand

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:49.040
sitting here for an hour I was down like

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:53.179
you know 18 dollars or something like

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:56.620
that it was a fantastic time either way

00:27:53.179 --> 00:27:59.240
I just I don't get it because for me

00:27:56.620 --> 00:28:00.890
they would have like if they doubled the

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.690
odds of the casino in my favor I might

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:04.640
be in but if I bet like a hundred

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:08.690
dollars on something and I lose a

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:10.730
hundred dollars I'm like that sucks I'm

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:14.300
a failure why I just spend a hundred

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:17.630
ollars for nothing but if I bet $100 and

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:20.210
I win and I get $200 I go as not really

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:22.760
that big of a deal you know I turned 100

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:24.679
dollars into $200 it's not like

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.429
life-changing I suppose it could be

00:28:24.679 --> 00:28:27.710
life-changing

00:28:25.429 --> 00:28:31.970
if you bet like your whole life savings

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:33.530
on it but then you know multiply the

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:35.360
feeling of losing that hundred dollars

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:37.070
is what any you get the idea I think is

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:39.920
what I'm trying to get across here like

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:40.970
there was the story and I hated that I

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.130
don't think it's irresponsible

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:45.530
journalism that this was published but I

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:46.670
hate the interpretation that some people

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:49.160
are going to have of this there's like a

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:51.140
guy in England and he got fired from his

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.190
job he was it must have been a good job

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:54.740
because he had something like you know a

00:28:52.190 --> 00:29:01.340
hundred thousand pounds in savings so

00:28:54.740 --> 00:29:02.960
he's doing pretty well right but he got

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:05.929
fired from his job and I guess this you

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:07.760
know you know something shorted out in

00:29:05.929 --> 00:29:09.440
his brain no offense meant but you'll

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:11.990
hear the story and maybe agree with me

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:15.320
and if you don't well I'm not saying I'm

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:16.730
right but he was like you know what I'm

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:20.000
just gonna I'm going to start a new life

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:23.120
so he flew to Vegas and he put all of

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.520
his life savings on like black or red it

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:28.640
doesn't matter you one of the like 49%

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:30.140
gets at the roulette table and he won so

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.070
the news printed the story and they're

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.750
like this is amazing

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:36.139
look at this he doubled his life savings

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:39.139
in one go yeah but like if you've got

00:29:36.139 --> 00:29:42.230
like a hundred thousand pounds in your

00:29:39.139 --> 00:29:47.539
savings account you're doing better than

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:49.340
like likely I mean obviously compared to

00:29:47.539 --> 00:29:51.799
people who live you know in like Burkina

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:53.509
Faso I'm going to exempt that from this

00:29:51.799 --> 00:29:55.159
situation but even relative to the other

00:29:53.509 --> 00:29:57.470
people in your country you're probably

00:29:55.159 --> 00:29:59.779
beating like 98% of them or something

00:29:57.470 --> 00:30:02.720
right you're up there is what I'm

00:29:59.779 --> 00:30:04.370
getting at to double that is not that

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.899
big of a deal you know once you get a

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:08.690
those levels of wealth you got to start

00:30:05.899 --> 00:30:10.700
multiplying it by five I think in order

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:11.539
to see a huge return that is a great

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:13.700
pickup for us

00:30:11.539 --> 00:30:15.950
whereas if you lose all of your life

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:18.350
savings you go from being like I can

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:23.120
comfortably rent for the next four years

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:24.379
without working a day - I have to live

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.799
in a garbage can

00:30:24.379 --> 00:30:29.690
this is like that seem like the worst

00:30:26.799 --> 00:30:32.090
sure is it 50/50 no but it's like

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:34.070
roughly 50/50 admittedly that he's going

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:38.269
to win or lose and you get a

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:40.129
proportional reward for winning that you

00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:43.220
do for losing so I understand from a

00:30:40.129 --> 00:30:45.230
mathematical standpoint not the appeal

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:46.580
necessarily but the value proposition

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:50.600
but I feel like if somebody had just sat

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:52.610
down with him and been like hey Dawg you

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:54.259
understand that yeah okay you got an

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:56.419
equal chance to win loose not quite but

00:30:54.259 --> 00:30:58.340
you know roughly but the consequences of

00:30:56.419 --> 00:31:00.950
losing are way better than the rewards

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:02.179
of winning in this situation he would

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:06.289
have been like oh yeah

00:31:02.179 --> 00:31:11.779
let's see ball the way it's me it's 1961

00:31:06.289 --> 00:31:17.389
Paul McCartney paperback writer that

00:31:11.779 --> 00:31:18.919
gives me a good idea anyway sounds

00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:22.129
nothing like Paul McCartney because I

00:31:18.919 --> 00:31:25.340
haven't died and then add myself

00:31:22.129 --> 00:31:28.909
replaced with a look-alike yet am I now

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:33.500
most Australian apparently New Zealand

00:31:28.909 --> 00:31:38.529
maybe Jerry's out gives me a great idea

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:38.529
for a song anyway

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:42.530
anyway I don't know that's what I'm just

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:43.580
saying on it I don't get gambling I

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:46.429
don't even remember where that came from

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:49.190
I guess I get the addiction aspect of

00:31:46.429 --> 00:31:50.900
gambling I suppose it's like Kanye West

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:54.350
said why everything is supposed to be

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:56.540
bad make me feel so good everything they

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:59.390
told me not to was exactly what I would

00:31:56.540 --> 00:32:01.429
oh dude we can actually fight huh she or

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:02.900
Kanye didn't say that part but um I

00:32:01.429 --> 00:32:04.820
don't think we want to is just a

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:06.830
testament to the fact that the run has

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:13.040
gotten like a little better here all its

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:14.780
own even but he doesn't talk about

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:18.260
gambling in that song he says what's

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:22.160
your addiction to money is girls is it

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:24.980
weed I'm been inflicted but I would but

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:27.260
not to but all three and is more than

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:28.460
that it's like crocodile I think you've

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:29.360
ever been afflicted by crime not trying

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.770
to say you haven't gone through your own

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.840
struggles you know everybody walks their

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:36.050
own path Kanye but they're going to

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:38.450
addicted to crocodile you know what I'm

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:40.010
going to roll the freaking dice here the

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:42.140
other thing is Guppies tail gives us a

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.550
little protective sorry Guppies a paw

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:48.950
gives us a little protection for Whore

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:51.500
of Babylon by that I mean if we get like

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:52.970
uh if you get lard we could take it and

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.620
then get six spirit hearts out of it and

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:58.340
it's not like the speed downgrade gives

00:32:54.620 --> 00:33:00.500
us much of a negative right now so so I

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:02.120
got to say the Harbinger seven

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.500
harbingers whatever the hack is called I

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:09.470
don't know like I don't know if it's any

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:14.140
good at all but it is nice all that's so

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:16.820
good it is nice to have the the Flies

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:18.950
like part of it is rotten baby now as

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:22.429
well but I think it might be sort of

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:25.940
good this but it's like a like a meat

00:33:22.429 --> 00:33:27.980
boy I don't know if it's as good as a

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:30.679
third-level meat boy but it's like a

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:32.750
like a little huh she that seeks out

00:33:30.679 --> 00:33:38.480
enemies and spawns flies for you seems

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:41.020
okay by the way I've like ignored look

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:45.650
listen this whole time I guarantee it

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:47.870
shouldn't have done that and mmm not

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:50.000
gonna necessarily apologize for I think

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:52.160
that's the punishment doesn't fit the

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.320
crime but you know I'm hurting myself by

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.550
doing so and I recognize that one

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.450
internal heart could have changed the

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:58.520
game for us at a few different

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:59.660
opportunities but we're gonna we're

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:03.169
going to manage to make it through here

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:04.600
regardless and I'm relatively shouldn't

00:34:03.169 --> 00:34:10.639
have shouldn't have done it but

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:12.470
relatively happy about that thing is I

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:14.720
play a risky style and Isaac oh I didn't

00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:15.980
even see that one play a risky style and

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:18.050
Isaac you might think that I'm prone to

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:19.760
that sort of like well now I know if you

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:20.929
would listen to the episodes you're not

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.530
just watching for the high caliber

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:28.070
gameplay you know I'm a you know I'm a

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:29.840
fairly risk-averse person I think yeah

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:30.710
that's why I like playing risky and

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.629
video games

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:34.760
I guess appeals to me because the

00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:36.679
consequences are essentially nil except

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:38.149
for you know when you do really bad in

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:39.290
Kerbal space program for a little while

00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:41.359
you know jeopardizing your whole

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:45.350
livelihood but you know that's not

00:34:41.359 --> 00:34:47.750
nothing serious so something's wrong

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:53.929
come on man there's something happening

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:56.570
here I'm not even picking up pennies

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:59.410
anymore you can't convince me let's go

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:59.410
for keys

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:10.210
my favorite concert have ever seen was

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:12.589
the four keys it was the Black Keys a

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:14.510
Stevie Wonder cover band that played the

00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:16.070
entirety of songs in the key of life and

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:17.780
now you go on choose how we going to get

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:19.580
two more keys out of this one key &amp;

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:22.130
peele opened with the comedy thing you

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:23.540
know comedy music go hand-in-hand nice

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:25.490
to see they haven't gone to Hollywood

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:32.630
and they can still show up at the you

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:33.920
know Bellingham iBUYPOWER Festival I

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:36.830
don't know I was trying to think and all

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:38.540
these arenas have like bad names you

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:40.490
know I understand the corporate

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:44.900
sponsorship but you know when I was a

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:48.380
kid the Montreal Forum you know Maple

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:50.930
Leaf Gardens now it's always like it's

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:53.060
the Quicken Loans track and field event

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:55.400
and you're like I lost a little bit of

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:56.900
the magic fear a little bit of the

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:59.060
decorum you know when did the sports

00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:00.920
become all about money well when they

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:02.540
asked you to give up your 20s and have a

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:04.810
good chance of a you know chronic brain

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:06.770
injury that afflicts you later but

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:08.690
whether it would come all about the

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:10.940
monies that you see you're changing my

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:12.050
points around here so we're going to get

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:18.680
two books that I couldn't care less

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:22.580
about and that's okay but certainly not

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:24.410
quite the caliber of items I was

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:28.369
expecting to grab down here I think it's

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:31.490
fair this run is actually like kind of

00:36:28.369 --> 00:36:34.910
not good I don't want to I don't want to

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:37.520
make you think that it's like it was a

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:39.170
chore to do this run cuz we got some

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:41.660
positive things going for us like when I

00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:44.570
had to we get six luck like my luck set

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:46.970
is just like it's like having a child it

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:48.470
is matured before my eyes and then one

00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:50.720
day you know I turn around and it's

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:54.070
going off to college here sprinkler is

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:54.070
pretty cool I like that item

00:36:54.690 --> 00:37:00.220
but apart from a couple of big pickups

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:02.560
it was a little bit of an underpowered

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:05.050
run I think so I got to give it up to

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:06.730
like Rawdon baby Harbinger those were

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:08.530
both pretty solid I think growth

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:12.250
hormones was a big help when we needed

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:18.850
damage succubus also a high-quality

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:23.680
pickup without a doubt but also like a

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:25.540
lot of near garbage let's say rotten

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:27.010
baby I would be remiss if I didn't

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:29.440
mention rotten baby I always want to

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:31.450
mention rotten baby one of the best well

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:32.590
probably be one of the top three

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:34.750
familiars I'm going to say the best

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:37.150
familiar but you do have succubus

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:39.820
Incubus rotten baby little brimstone

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:41.800
like you got some got some really good

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:44.320
familiars there Rawdon baby a little

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:45.970
brimstone can can swap out that number

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:49.840
three spot depending on your own damage

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:53.770

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:56.650

any worse so you know these guys are

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:59.890
done and dusted there's still a

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:03.270
theoretical chance of a loss but it's

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:06.430
low come in here drop this is low like a

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:08.940
