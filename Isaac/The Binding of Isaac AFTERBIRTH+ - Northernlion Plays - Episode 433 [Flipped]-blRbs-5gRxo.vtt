00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.570
hey everybody welcome back to nor the

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.509
lion place binding of us get with us

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.340
we've been doin good work lately semi

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.650
good work don't even talk to me about

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.570
the cursed run we failed semi recently

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.840
apart from that that we've been killing

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.330
it

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.949
what is the thing on the right side of

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:25.230
the posted note I feel like I'm taking

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:29.880
crazy pills dude you know what huh so

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.430
mega satan is bottom left and it's the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.700
negative that's far right so when I was

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.070
looking at every character they were all

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.350
missing the negative and I was just

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:46.410
losing my mind for no reason okay sick

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:48.030
um I don't see actually okay let me you

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.590
can't knock out the negative n mega

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.199
Satan on the same run so we might as

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.270
well like try to get two birds stoned at

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.449
once

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:02.340
Eden has not beaten Eden his not beaten

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.559
Eden has not beaten Cathedral down to

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.990
the chest has not beaten the negative

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.790
has not beaten hush has not beaten mega

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.770
satan and is not beaten greevey ER so we

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.000
can actually do an Eden run here and it

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.729
really doesn't matter what path we take

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.220
trinkets melter the best hairstyle in

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.950
the game we Elsa voice I've never seen

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.920
frozen so don't get mad eq8 ate pizza w

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.049
and friendly ball let's look at our

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.920
stats here the stands are the the kind

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.810
of relevant

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.689
we have little haunt as well but the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.470
stats are the more relevant

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.400
characteristic we have a good rate of

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.619
fire full stop no asterisk required we

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.229
have bad damage full stop no asterisk

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.040
required range combined with shot speed

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.149
is pretty bad

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.220
HP is lovely good starting trinket as

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.689
well that immediately gets melted we can

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.719
use that as long as we remember that we

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:59.880
have it speed is adequate luck is bad

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.829
but you know all in all the fact that we

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.329
have HP effectively means this is a run

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.280
that it should be relatively

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:09.090
straightforward to pilot it's a victory

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.229
you know you find yourself having to be

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.900
a little bit more creative when your HP

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.930
is lower because our HP is

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:20.700
completely fine got very little to worry

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:24.750
about it's not an excel floor so we like

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.010
might as well get that extra penny we

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.230
might as well blow that up as well now

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.390
don't die like immediately here that

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.790
would be quite embarrassing I have to

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.290
admit we want one more key so we can go

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.360
to whatever the double key room is but

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.190
apart from that I think you know the the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.860
game plan for us here is pretty darn

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.690
simple live long enough get that do you

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.069
I mean this is like me explaining how to

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.890
play The Binding of Isaac for someone

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.540
who's never experienced it before use

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.040
our spirit arts to leverage ourselves

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.810
into a deal with the devil after the for

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.980
the second boss fight hope that the deal

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.660
with the devil contains things that are

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.489
actually good and then pretty much

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.300
you're off to the races at that point as

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:02.640
long as your HP is borderline acceptable

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.519
so I did watch that it's a shame because

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.950
one bomb would like pretty much

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:13.860
neutralize the bosses here at least one

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:17.220
of them don't rush me don't rush me

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.720
thank you I was kind of hoping to get

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.230
one more cent because we could really

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.070
take advantage of a blood bank on the

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.780
next floor but we'll just head

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:29.329
downstairs instead I think that's okay

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:32.480
it's a good first floor and actually uh

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.260
it's it's a good end a bad first floor

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.940
because we didn't really get anything

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.519
out of our item room and then actually

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.750
getting blue cap is awesome except for

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.630
the fact that our shot speed is already

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.700
garbage and shot speed is kind of I mean

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.440
I'm happier to have the rate of fire

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.320
increase than I am sad to have the shot

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.859
speed decrease but simultaneously I am

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.739
kind of like you know shot speed ups are

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:57.180
relatively rare I think I have the

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.650
perception that they're more common than

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.209
they actually are because they're mostly

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.090
useless but in this situation they'd

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.370
actually be good so you know something

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.280
that speed ball is almost like of the

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.950
perfect item contributes to spun solves

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.780
are slightly below average speed and at

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.500
the same time also gives us enough shot

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.709
shot speed did hopefully not have that

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.020
be a limiting factor for us here but

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.790
either way we're probably good

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.740
in dire need of some damage improvements

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:33.160
but apart from that work we're set here

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:34.810
I like how I pick up a new item from the

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.880
booster pack the eyeball tears and I'm

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.170
like I hate it and I'm old and then I

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.880
get a new hairstyle from the booster

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.680
pack and I'm like this is the greatest

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.540
thing ever I did you're probably

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:49.020
watching this video I'm utilizing this

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:52.210
as an example to basically I'm gonna

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.740
poke fun at what you said to me while

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.470
also adding a no offense but I

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.480
understand that a few people not a ton

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.090
I'm gonna go back yeah we should just go

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.810
for the ko here a few people not a ton

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.820
but a few people were like a little

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.610
displeased upset would be too much of an

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.110
exaggeration that I picked up those

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.390
eyeball tears and I was like these are

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.950
bad I got a lot of tweets that were like

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.780
hey here's some synergies you've never

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.700
experienced but I did also go like a

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.470
tweet chain from one dude who was like

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.330
that it culminated with a tweet that

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.220
just said just so you know you have a

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.800
really bad habit to be dismissive of

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:30.460
something out of instinct and it's a bad

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:34.110
look and I was like my dude we're

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.490
talking about an item in a video game

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.290
people when they tell me about their

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.940
experiences in real life though you know

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.650
what the kyrgyzs stay this weekend I'm

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.410
like that's the coolest thing ever but

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.550
some type icked up by ball tears

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.870
evaluated them accordingly based on the

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.550
criteria that I had in front of me

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:52.210
little brain is gonna be very nice here

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.120
and and wasn't a big fan but also sort

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.229
of reserved judgment for future

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.320
situations try not to read too much into

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:00.970
it this isn't the real northernlion like

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.200
I'm a pretty genuine guy in my videos

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.979
but the real northernlion

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:08.640
you know we'll be watching stepbrothers

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:11.530
and eating Cheetos all day on the couch

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:16.150
or he'd be playing The Binding of Isaac

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:18.070
but without commentary or something this

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.450
is this is the exaggerated character of

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.250
northern Laksha the real law in the land

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.890
we spend in time was with his family

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.760
right now the real Ryan I should say I

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.290
guess we should get out of here

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.910
speaking of which you guys seen season

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.289
two of real Rob starring Rob Schneider

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.320
okay yeah me neither

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:34.240
down to the next floor I'm just saying

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.840
you can't judge too much based on what

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.900
you

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.550
you can't in its borderline offensive to

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.260
infer something about my personality

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.419
from the way that I feel about an item

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.130
that was added in a booster pack but I

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:47.440
also read a lot of those tweets and I

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.720
was like you know what I may have

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.430
misjudged it a little bit I may have

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.970
underestimated potential synergies

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.590
because sure soy milk lump of coal

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:00.760
combined with eyeball tears then we got

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:03.000
some some power there this is a regular

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.229
secret room

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.900
kind of a weird location for it but

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:09.760
we're gonna give it a shot regardless

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.330
absolutely we will smelt that the more

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.000
the merrier

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:16.240
don't take this by the way is you know

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.950
have have sympathy I was cyber bullied

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:23.500
you know cyber bullying is a real thing

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:25.270
it exists it's not what Dan did two

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.590
mouths in the battleground series

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.180
despite with some of the comments like a

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.720
couple of the episodes would say but I

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.360
digress

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.190
um though those comments are relatively

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.080
harmless like I got a pretty good social

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:37.060
media feed mostly people are just like

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.620
where's this and I'm like oh I forgot to

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:41.260
post it here it is and then they go

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:43.020
thank you or I go machines broke and

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:48.610
they go understandable have a nice day

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:49.780
I've managed to get saddled saddled was

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.060
usually a bad word but I'm trying to

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.169
think of what a good analog a blessed

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:57.520
would be the word with a with a

00:07:53.169 --> 00:08:00.310
community that is quite erudite most of

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.169
the time and and relatively positive to

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:06.669
be honest with you and I'm appreciative

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:08.110
of it don't step on those so we got head

00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:10.120
of the keeper head of the keepers good

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:14.650
in this situation because we have bloody

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:16.810
penny so it renders us all that it kind

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:19.630
of stinks first off that I took so much

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:21.849
damage there but also that that dime is

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:23.289
over there if we can get maybe a ability

00:08:21.849 --> 00:08:29.490
to fly somewhere along the lines here

00:08:23.289 --> 00:08:32.229
that would help out so if we we get a an

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:33.700
arcade on the next floor probably a

00:08:32.229 --> 00:08:36.700
pretty good chance we get blood bag

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:41.380
blood bag always while most of the time

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:43.690
very nice I may get compass but I also

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.520
kind of want to donate some money to

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:47.680
continue our progress there you know

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.760
small rock please although small rock is

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.590
a speed downgrade so we

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.020
should be concerned all right you know I

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:54.520
decided I want the item but I don't want

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.830
it right away I wanted to sit there and

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.120
be like you know what you've done I'm

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:00.430
not even gonna use a bottom to get the

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:03.520
spirit hard yet so I just want to

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:05.530
caution you that this run isn't yet as

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.330
good as it looks you're looking at this

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:11.440
you're going little brim money and

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:14.080
actually this this boss might be able to

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:18.000
tilt things more in our favor but our

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:19.750
damage is actually trashed here

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.810
multi-dimensional baby doesn't help us a

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:26.650
ton but it's okay now we're hoping for

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:29.230
like GUP items man okay so we're still I

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:30.340
think we're up against it to be honest

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:33.670
with you I think this is kind of a hard

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:36.780
run I'm going to go down to the next

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:40.390
floor I'm gonna take a sip of my coffee

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:41.980
I'm going to continue to narrate

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:46.620
everything I do in excruciating detail

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:49.900
I'm now sending a signal from my brain

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.490
to depress the right arrow key in order

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.960
to shoot in that direction now we're not

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:56.050
gonna follow it to that illogical

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:58.210
extreme he has ever and I'm very much

00:09:56.050 --> 00:10:00.520
not this guy most of the time so feel

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:05.830
free to roll your eyes but every once in

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:08.050
a while on aided by potentially legal or

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:10.000
illegal substances as I know that

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:12.100
whenever people get philosophical they

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.020
go oh how many pots of you smoking but

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:16.060
anyway first off that's a that's an

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:17.800
antiquated attitude that's deprecated in

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:20.860
today's modern harm-reduction era but

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:24.070
anyway disregard that how crazy is it we

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:28.900
have like in our skull there's a big old

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:30.850
orb of meat it's it's I can't stress

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:36.010
this enough it's it's flesh it's like

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:38.020
edible organic matter within that we

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:39.670
possess the capabilities like that organ

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:43.120
possesses the capabilities to solve

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:45.610
problems that is mess with me today and

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.810
you know it sometimes I would roll my

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.770
eyes at the fact that I said that to

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:49.750
begin with yeah

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:51.820
well for some people is better than

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:54.160
others I suppose you gonna be snarky

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:59.140
about it but isn't that it's the power

00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:00.690
of like genes and evolution we've

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:04.340
evolved

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:09.380
might as well take it why not right

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:13.890
we've evolved a piece of meat that can

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:16.350
write songs like it's um it's amazing at

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:18.480
first that it can even the piece of meat

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:22.650
can manipulate your hand in such a way

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:24.450
that you could write with a pen and on a

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.740
piece of paper but the fact I'm just

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.030
trying to like distill this down to

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.230
brass tacks because it sounds like I'm

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:30.870
being in eloquent here and I think that

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:32.760
that's a valid criticism we have a piece

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:35.730
of meat inside of our skulls that can

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:39.330
solve problems it's just kind of messing

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:40.590
with me right now cuz I'd you know when

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.270
you don't think about it you just go yes

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:45.390
it's the brain that's what the brain

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:48.570
does duh when you think about it on a

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:50.520
like a more literal level we literally

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:52.800
have like a cut well it's not cut a

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:55.800
steak but you know what I mean it's semi

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:58.800
analogous to a cut of steak that was a

00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:01.860
terrible idea it lives in our skull and

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:03.810
it goes oh here's abstract reasoning

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:10.260
capabilities for you that's incredible

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:11.730
dude we are mad lucky this is gonna be

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.710
another trinket so I'm happy about that

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:16.320
I'm also really happy about the deal

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:17.880
with the devil although it's still you

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.790
know we got to make it be good so let's

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:22.920
see how it works that's like exceptional

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:25.730
but also very scary because I want to

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:28.340
take all of this and really should not

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:30.630
because bloody penny is very valuable

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:35.040
have we we have taken a deal with the

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:36.480
devil so far here's what I'm gonna do

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.100
I'm gonna start by taking goat head and

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:43.020
the reason I'm gonna start with goat

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:44.490
head is because it allows me to see the

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:47.130
other one here lovers card I'll hold it

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:49.170
for now it allows me to get back into

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:50.910
this deal with the devil first off it's

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:52.620
good in its own right but then beyond

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:55.620
that it allows me to get back into that

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:57.870
deal with the devil perhaps we will find

00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:00.780
an arcade over the course of this floor

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:03.390
and we will as a result I have a good

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:05.010
chance to get a blood bank that blood

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:07.700
bank has a pretty good chance to give us

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:07.700
a blood bag

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:16.290
and were able to get more HP we might

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.820
consider taking the mark for example or

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:19.800
sorry the pact was the the one that was

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:21.300
in there we also you know still have our

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:25.080
item room that could just give us HP to

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:27.660
begin with so I think it was like a like

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:29.100
a time-delayed choice on our deal with

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:30.780
the devil here I'm happy with this

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.070
decision I don't really want to take

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.930
gimpy unless we get a ton of money

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:36.390
because our luck is not good enough to I

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:37.770
think make it very applicable but you

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:41.340
might be able to actually raise it here

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:45.200
as well it's just people this oh my god

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:47.550
he came in hot off the presses there so

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:50.310
varicose veins is not gonna be great for

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:52.560
us with 2.9 damage but varicose veins

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:53.010
plus fanny pack plus ass melted bloody

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.700
penny

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:58.500
I think there's we're only one cent away

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.660
from red candle that whole time I think

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:02.670
it's pretty good because now we get a

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:08.790
lot of advantages for being hit as I can

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:10.590
eight again here but like dude I hear

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:11.490
people say sometimes and I I empathize

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.380
with this I understand where you're

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:16.400
coming from they go I wish I could just

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:18.780
be a cat you know they sleep all day

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:21.900
they get fed food that they like even

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:23.640
though it's garbage they play you know

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:26.370
they the most they have a good life most

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:29.790
of the time I would say I'm gonna I'm

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:32.940
gonna get like very aggressive here I

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:35.010
don't want to get the teleportation and

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:37.020
I don't really want to fight the angel

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:39.090
statues but I mean I suppose we could

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.920
get the key pieces and fight mega Satan

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:46.290
here before we do this though let's um

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:48.000
be a little smarter I think we have time

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:48.570
to write yeah we're still like ahead of

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.010
schedule

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:53.490
I want to peep this maybe we'll get

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:55.320
something half decent you we've got like

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:57.890
eight trinkets melted I think we've got

00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:00.540
a good excuse to go with Guppies head

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:03.450
and let's keep this as well let's like

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:05.070
literally do whatever we can and that

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:12.070
that was exquisite although it does make

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:14.200
me not really want to play the

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:18.580
self-sacrifice room anymore but anyway I

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:20.050
was on this Kant tangent I am like it

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.340
certainly grateful to have been born a

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:23.680
human being because I think it's a

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:26.710
unique experience on the planet Earth

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:28.510
it's incredible that a cat is like I'm

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:30.910
hungry what do I do about it

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:34.030
you got a particularly smart cat it

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:35.800
meows there you go I recognized this

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:39.610
because it's my own cat solution to the

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:43.270
problem mankind can be like we went into

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:46.030
outer space on a ship that we built and

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:47.560
kept a bunch of people a lot like it's

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:50.380
incredible you know how many problems

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:53.860
there are on the on the chain of getting

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:55.540
a human being into outer space oh we

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:57.040
need enough Delta V to get off a planet

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.390
or it's solved all we need heat

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.700
shielding so they don't burn up in the

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:02.230
atmosphere solved oh we need you know

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.730
it's just the list goes on and on we

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:06.250
need to calculate the proper trajectory

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:10.540
to fly through outer space

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:13.120
it's incredible we're like the scariest

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:16.240
species in Earth's history well I don't

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:21.970
know there are T Rexes and stuff but but

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:25.930
also like the dopest its I think you

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:28.300
know word we're incredible people

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:30.190
oftentimes have the opinion and and I

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:33.010
don't necessarily disagree with this but

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:35.590
they go people are people are bad and I

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:37.180
like yeah we're gonna go for this now by

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:38.560
the way because at least we'll have one

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:40.720
HP on the next floor which still allows

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:43.450
us to sort of take advantage of bloody

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:46.030
penny and take a deal with the devil I

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:47.320
guess which is good with goat head but

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:50.050
we want to go maybe a little faster

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:51.100
although I guess we don't really need to

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:54.670
do boss rush because we've already done

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:58.780
it so to some extent disregard people

00:16:54.670 --> 00:17:01.060
are capable you know being smart is not

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:03.430
always necessarily I would say it's like

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.570
always a good thing but doesn't

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:07.000
necessarily mean you're a good person

00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:08.709
just because you're intelligent however

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.290
and you know the same applies to

00:17:08.709 --> 00:17:16.630
countries and organizations and so on

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:20.079
and so forth but still mankind is pretty

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:22.010
cool right and I love you watched the

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:25.940
news recently no I haven't

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:29.000
okay I mean it will save that RAM for

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:31.990
another time but just no news I've got a

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.990
bone to pick with you

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:39.980
like why are you on at 6:00 p.m. that's

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:41.750
halfway through my day it's not nearly

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:44.240
how much news couldn't none it is that's

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:47.360
not the ramp any white disregard this is

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:49.370
uh this is a good Isaac run or Eden run

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:53.360
if you want to be more pedantic about it

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:55.820
which you know I do but it's also very

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.560
strange cuz this is lower damage that

00:17:55.820 --> 00:18:03.170
you start with on a lot of Eden runs

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:08.270
dude don't make me laugh but it's still

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:11.720
somewhat strong so would probably take

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:13.490
the Joker car it's a bit of like the Sun

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.620
might be more valuable especially if we

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:18.560
want to get boss rush but the Joker is a

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:22.520
boss rush teleporter we can actually

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:24.380
hold petrified poop still trinkets

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.960
melter is actually I shouldn't have been

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:28.160
like so wringing my hands over whether

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.680
or not to get rid of trinkets melter cuz

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:33.380
trinkets melter actually has stored

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:35.480
value it's like one of the only space

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:37.370
bar items I guess the other ones would

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.590
be like ones that change your stats but

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:42.650
it's one of the only space bar items

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:45.830
that actually like retains some of its

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:51.470
usefulness after it's gone definitely

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:53.240
will take starter deck lovers card not

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:56.930
worth much I will take that and actually

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:58.400
you know what go a little deeper on this

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.270
I'm not gonna buy too many spirit arts I

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.580
don't think we need them

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:04.280
we'll take black candle which i think is

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:07.190
an excellent item compost has some value

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:08.900
for us here for sure with fish head

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:11.000
already smelted I'll take there's

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:12.800
options it's got like two floors to

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:17.030
benefit me and it's it's just kind of an

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:20.860
easy pick so I'll take it obviously like

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:24.350
it would be big to get guppy on this run

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:26.770
pretty self-explanatory we suggested all

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:26.770
the time

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:36.880
little brim can carry us for a fairly

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:40.810
long time we had enough HP could carry

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:42.130
us potentially through the entirety of

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:43.360
the game so I'm gonna skip the curse

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:44.620
room and you're gonna be like don't skip

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.140
the curse term you want to become guppy

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:49.420
yeah but we could also get to boss Rush

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:52.990
and I value a free boss rush pick up

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:54.970
more than more than I value going to the

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:57.610
curse room right now that's not a good

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:58.990
trinket we get another guppy item I

00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:00.700
don't care about permanent polaroid

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:02.250
invincibility and this is where we gotta

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:05.830
exercise self-control cuz it's very

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:07.390
tempting to just pop the Joker card

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:09.040
right now in the hopes of getting guppy

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:12.970
and if it worked it would be the right

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:15.580
decision well that's you know one of the

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:17.230
things about probability I suppose is

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.670
the knowledge that just because

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:23.470
something worked out doesn't mean it's

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:25.570
the right decision like if you if you

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:31.510
had a 1 in 20 chance to win a million

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:33.570
dollars but a 19 and 20 chance to die if

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:35.560
it works out if you get that that

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:37.060
amazing role that gives you a million

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:39.910
dollars was it the right decision to do

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:41.260
it I don't know I don't believe that

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:45.400
that's the case first off that's a

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:46.480
terrible deal because just by the way

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.400
there's probably some of you out there

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:51.550
that are going I would take that you

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.650
know cuz it in the 1 in 20 odds you get

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:56.050
a million dollars you're set yeah but is

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:58.390
that worth like literally a 95% chance

00:20:56.050 --> 00:21:01.030
of losing your actual life I would say

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:03.340
no I'm I am gonna I'm gonna stream

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:04.720
splainin you know I'm gonna act like I'm

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.220
an authority on the subject in my

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:13.600
opinion is more valuable than yours cuz

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:17.230
you're worth more than that okay you can

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:18.730
do it don't make them hold out for 5050

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:22.540
at least that's all I'm saying that's a

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:25.360
dick it's a bit of a dark joke I'm just

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:27.760
saying this product if you uh I think if

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:31.470
you gave me everybody's got their right

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:34.240
price right if you were like 90% chance

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:37.420
you'll get a million dollars 10% chance

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:40.140
you'll die I wouldn't take it because I

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:41.820
mean 10% when the consequences are large

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.440
I think that's a big number too big for

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:47.130
me to feel comfortable with but if you

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:50.190
were like 999 times out of a thousand

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:54.810
you'll get a million dollars and the 1

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:57.990
in 1,000 you'll get murdered I might be

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:59.670
persuaded you you could probably and I

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:01.710
imagine a lot of people's prices

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:02.820
probably lower than that but we don't

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:04.110
really need Steam sale unless we're

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:06.120
gonna fight hush so I think we just buy

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:09.270
this to see where it takes us and we

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:14.250
probably by the spirit art as well if we

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:15.870
could walk over it but yeah I think I'm

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:17.790
worried about saying this because in my

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:21.090
head I'm irrational and I'm like what if

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:23.880
somebody comes to me with this deal the

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:26.220
condition by the way has to be that it's

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:28.440
fair they can't be like oh there's a 1

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:30.840
in 100,000 chance you get the negative

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:34.020
consequences and then they you know are

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:35.220
just lying see that's another reason to

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:38.130
probably not engage with these

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:40.440
supernatural tricksters that are in

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:44.000
theory applying this so I think you just

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:47.310
go to boss rush first because we have

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.950
the Joker card and the goat heads so

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:52.080
here I mean I don't love it necessarily

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:54.360
but you gotta take a little monstro out

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:56.460
of all these I think probably make a

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:59.070
case for sack dagger although I will

00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:02.250
admit to you things are looking a little

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:06.480
scary HP wise but trying to like raise

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:08.310
our ability to kill enemies so we are

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:11.060
going to the the chest this time because

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:14.080
we took the polaroid I think that's

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:17.000
completely fine

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:22.040
we are only one item away from becoming

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:24.950
Daffy so like I'm super happy that we

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:26.360
did not use our Joker card on the last

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:33.860
floor rate when we got there because we

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:35.240
would have just not gotten much no okay

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.440
we got two and a half hearts just play

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:38.270
it cool

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:41.120
this is about where you reach the point

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:47.900
where you you look for like Black Lotus

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:50.270
in here not gonna get it we should be

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.680
fine but I hesitate to say that because

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:53.660
I think again people are gonna look at

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:56.180
this round and be like you got no reason

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:58.130
to die on this run we have a really good

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:59.390
reason to die on this run our damage is

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:04.160
three point eight three our speed is

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:08.360
zero point nine seven and the there is a

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:10.460
little bit of my own personal folly that

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:12.200
was just actually horrible there is a

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:14.210
little bit of my own personal folly I

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:19.640
probably got overly aggressive on deals

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:23.380
with the devil I'll give you that but at

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:26.960
the same time we basically had like

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:30.230
three or four actually maybe maybe five

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:33.860
item rooms that provided us with no

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:35.720
value a lot of like really bad actives

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.160
showed up on this run and our stats have

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.840
not really improved we've got a lot of

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.850
little brim helping us out and a good

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:46.250
rate of fire and that's that's what's

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:48.080
driving the bus right now plus actually

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:49.730
like in aggregate we've got a really

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.830
good set up thanks to trinkets melter

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:53.810
like guppies head is twice as good

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:56.600
because we're generating twice as many

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:58.400
flies you got to go synthoid i hate to

00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:02.480
say it but we need both damage and speed

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:04.130
you got to go sin toil but I don't mean

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:06.560
that simple is a damage plus speed

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:08.420
upgrade I just mean like both of those

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:12.140
syringes contain things that are useful

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:13.910
for us there's an angel statue in there

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:19.690
both of those syringes contain things

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:19.690
that were useful for us I have to try

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:28.019
but I had to I had to go you know with

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:29.489
first principles damage is probably more

00:25:28.019 --> 00:25:33.690
important than speed in this situation

00:25:29.489 --> 00:25:35.970
we did not get first off one fly what

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:37.559
happened secondly we didn't get a key

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:38.309
piece for killing the angel statue in

00:25:37.559 --> 00:25:41.599
the devil Room

00:25:38.309 --> 00:25:45.869
all these little fiddly Isak things I

00:25:41.599 --> 00:25:50.330
don't remember all the time well that

00:25:45.869 --> 00:25:50.330
last floor was not really good enough

00:25:52.849 --> 00:26:00.119
that's a good card that's a decent card

00:25:57.090 --> 00:26:03.330
that's not really a good card not right

00:26:00.119 --> 00:26:04.950
now anyway uh and once you get down to

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:06.840
the womb I in my opinion at least

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:10.619
principles kind of reverse themselves a

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:12.720
little bit you know you don't want to

00:26:10.619 --> 00:26:15.210
explore melis when your HP is low you

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:21.559
don't want to explore more than is

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:26.009
strictly necessary I actually like got

00:26:21.559 --> 00:26:27.899
so scared the word no got caught in my

00:26:26.009 --> 00:26:30.259
throat like Jamie Lee Curtis in

00:26:27.899 --> 00:26:32.159
Halloween or something like that I

00:26:30.259 --> 00:26:35.460
didn't think that there was another

00:26:32.159 --> 00:26:43.799
enemy alive on this planet we have to

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:46.649
have to take the left hand we need it

00:26:43.799 --> 00:26:48.029
because it'll give us oh there's a

00:26:46.649 --> 00:26:49.499
tinted rock dude just survive this room

00:26:48.029 --> 00:26:51.179
we need it because it could give us

00:26:49.499 --> 00:26:53.639
spirit hearts it could also give us copy

00:26:51.179 --> 00:26:55.229
I suppose or teleport us to the two

00:26:53.639 --> 00:26:57.330
deals with the devil pass this floor

00:26:55.229 --> 00:26:59.489
where we could get got because on this

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:59.999
floor we have the goat head good good

00:26:59.489 --> 00:27:01.409
good good good

00:26:59.999 --> 00:27:04.440
this would be the worst time to get

00:27:01.409 --> 00:27:07.759
small rock just distill it down to brass

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.759
tacks thank you very much

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:12.140
I don't know if there was a way for me

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:13.640
to not get hit there but thankfully we

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:15.700
got that spirit heart earlier they made

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:21.050
it plausible oh good

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:23.510
just in time for the mom fight we

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:24.050
finally go up one luck algae's is

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:26.030
enormous

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:27.740
ASA Club still sucks towers way worse

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:32.630
magicians not very good Sharia could

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:34.420
save our lives so let's take that and

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:37.790
we're gonna pop algae's first I think

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:41.510
why am i salty about getting luck well

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:45.950
cuz we've had gimpy for four floors only

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:47.240
now did we stand a decent chance of

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:52.010
getting spirit hearts for getting hit

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:54.200
now that we've got zero HP so hopefully

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:58.120
you can understand my my salt a little

00:27:54.200 --> 00:28:00.860
bit there's an extremely good algae's

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:05.020
all it had to be was nine lives if it

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:05.020
was nine lives like we win the run

00:28:09.869 --> 00:28:17.999
well they were going up to the Cathedral

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:17.999
here and I'm a little frightened

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:24.539
that's okay we've we've made it out of

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:33.999
trickier buckets of syrup than this fool

00:28:24.539 --> 00:28:37.450
credit card huge growth yeah I actually

00:28:33.999 --> 00:28:42.450
I I got so mine flooded I'm still gonna

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:42.450
fight these guys I got so mine flooded I

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:46.450
can't even see sac dagger oh you know

00:28:45.009 --> 00:28:49.119
what cuz it's stuck on one part of my

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:51.100
body here that makes sense thanks to the

00:28:49.119 --> 00:28:56.580
the duct tape which I always call toilet

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:56.580
paper I think you got a look sorry

00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:02.559
couldn't have just been blue Larry jr.

00:28:58.929 --> 00:29:04.480
right um the reason I did that extra

00:29:02.559 --> 00:29:07.149
room again the one that killed me is

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:08.320
because I I thought that there might be

00:29:07.149 --> 00:29:10.600
something useful in this room and

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:13.269
clearly that was mistaken and all of my

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:18.369
hoping possibly getting something good

00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:22.360
in this run has now been lost but copies

00:29:18.369 --> 00:29:24.850
caller has already saved us like more

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:26.320
times on this run or more times on this

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:28.029
save file that I think it ever did on

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:31.690
the other one which is really funny to

00:29:28.029 --> 00:29:33.549
me that's also like deliberately an

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:35.889
exaggeration we had a lot of clutch

00:29:33.549 --> 00:29:38.529
Guffey's caller savings and I refused to

00:29:35.889 --> 00:29:40.389
be like wow we got so lucky Guppies

00:29:38.529 --> 00:29:42.009
caller saved us you know that's what

00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:44.529
it's there for like it's an item in its

00:29:42.009 --> 00:29:46.240
own right it doesn't just enable the

00:29:44.529 --> 00:29:49.499
copy transformation although most of the

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:49.499
time that's what you get out of it

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:57.760
I don't know how I'm you know actually I

00:29:56.169 --> 00:30:00.070
do what I was gonna say is I don't know

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:01.090
how I can usually aim little brim but I

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:03.279
suck

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:04.690
playing as Lilith but the answer is

00:30:03.279 --> 00:30:07.149
actually a thing more simple than it

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:08.590
might originally seem we gotta wait

00:30:07.149 --> 00:30:14.350
until we get like a chariot card or

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:21.370
something a nalgas ruin to play that got

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:23.860
a blow up these fires as well let's go

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:25.779
if this is a bad idea but if we get like

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:27.370
three I would have gone to the cursed

00:30:25.779 --> 00:30:29.049
room if you get one more I'll probably

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:30.789
still go to the cursed room okay I

00:30:29.049 --> 00:30:34.090
really still want to go to the curse

00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:35.559
room but I'm gonna abstain the reason is

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:36.970
because there's no knock back on little

00:30:35.559 --> 00:30:38.740
brim and it kills things like instantly

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:41.019
so you know hitting something with one

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:43.299
tear from Incubus as lilith normally is

00:30:41.019 --> 00:30:46.510
not going to get you the kill it's just

00:30:43.299 --> 00:30:48.490
the way the cookie crumbles but little

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:49.659
brim if it connects is not gonna push

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:51.789
the enemy out of the way of the next

00:30:49.659 --> 00:30:55.299
shot this is like the exact same room we

00:30:51.789 --> 00:30:57.159
just had that was it took balls of steel

00:30:55.299 --> 00:30:59.919
speaking of which I would love to get

00:30:57.159 --> 00:31:03.789
balls of steel right now well we

00:30:59.919 --> 00:31:08.289
probably will not be playing any blood

00:31:03.789 --> 00:31:10.510
banks now that we got a little HP and

00:31:08.289 --> 00:31:12.309
you know picking up the eternal heart

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:13.899
there in my opinion at least is just

00:31:12.309 --> 00:31:16.210
like Isaac's version of rules are made

00:31:13.899 --> 00:31:17.799
to be broken you know most of the time

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:23.679
permanent polaroid invincibility is what

00:31:17.799 --> 00:31:25.899
you want but that's like it's a

00:31:23.679 --> 00:31:27.580
situation where you're worried about

00:31:25.899 --> 00:31:28.899
your quality of life this is not a

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:30.190
situation in which we're worried about

00:31:28.899 --> 00:31:32.799
quality of life this is a situation

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:38.130
which we're worried about living by the

00:31:32.799 --> 00:31:38.130
way gimpy I'm not asking for much okay

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:46.539
I'm so mind flooded and oh my god I'm

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:49.590
actually a moron I deserve to lose for

00:31:46.539 --> 00:31:52.419
that mistake but I didn't and there is

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:57.720
don't be spiders I think there were

00:31:52.419 --> 00:31:57.720
spiders okay let mean disregard

00:32:02.629 --> 00:32:09.480
Wow I do want to point out it's a little

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:10.830
harder with 0.97 speed not much but a

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:15.149
little but the other thing I want to

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:18.419
point out Gympie has never on earth done

00:32:15.149 --> 00:32:20.009
anything for us oh thank god okay I

00:32:18.419 --> 00:32:22.529
don't know get rid of the left hand you

00:32:20.009 --> 00:32:28.460
know we always forget to drop it before

00:32:22.529 --> 00:32:31.710
the next floor but the single black card

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:33.179
might allow us to live long enough right

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:35.369
we got to reverse the way we do this now

00:32:33.179 --> 00:32:37.440
might allow us to live long enough to

00:32:35.369 --> 00:32:40.440
get down to the chest and this is a run

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:45.389
that if we win basically we got really

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:47.700
really lucky cuz coming back twice with

00:32:45.389 --> 00:32:54.179
Guppies collar now we're in you know

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:58.470
luck territory no question but would it

00:32:54.179 --> 00:33:01.919
like actually kill you to give me a

00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:05.850
single gimpy payout I know we had

00:33:01.919 --> 00:33:10.909
negative luck for a while but like that

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:10.909
was really bad that was a bad play

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:27.009
it's actually like catastrophic to have

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:29.769
such low speed at this point because if

00:33:27.009 --> 00:33:32.230
we choose wrong where our positioning is

00:33:29.769 --> 00:33:34.090
even like mildly off on these beams of

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:35.739
light we got a real problems but we

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:38.739
could have compensated for that by not

00:33:35.739 --> 00:33:40.600
using Guffey's head which gave us three

00:33:38.739 --> 00:33:42.279
flies for you know I'd say that you say

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:44.230
worth the squeeze is the best way to put

00:33:42.279 --> 00:33:44.919
it we just cannot do that you got to be

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:50.799
out of your mind

00:33:44.919 --> 00:33:56.619
oh my lord okay well down on the next

00:33:50.799 --> 00:33:59.830
floor use this decent very good

00:33:56.619 --> 00:34:01.210
excellent okay I mean sad Audion doesn't

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:04.859
do anything for us yet but maybe one day

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:08.399
stigmata HP which we could really use

00:34:04.859 --> 00:34:10.510
and we shouldn't use kelpies uh

00:34:08.399 --> 00:34:16.889
shouldn't use Guppies head again you got

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:22.899
illuminated bulb so I think we could win

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:27.399
but my odds of winning so in my opinion

00:34:22.899 --> 00:34:31.030
at least sort of hinge on us getting

00:34:27.399 --> 00:34:33.280
some items you got 1.52 luck I would

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:35.679
love to see some items show up I'm not

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:40.270
gonna say we deserve them just that I

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:44.020
would like to see them and I'm probably

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:47.379
gonna use like you know one set I got

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:52.000
hit probably gonna use like one sad bomb

00:34:47.379 --> 00:34:54.839
per room sort of neutralize the

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.839
situation a bit

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:08.020
he got the Guppies heads backwards again

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:09.400
um I'll be the first to tell you I don't

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:12.490
think I played ten out of ten here but I

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:14.920
think I played like seven everybody

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:21.100
takes bad damage but in a lot of runs

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:22.690
the bad damage is kind of neutralized by

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:24.369
the run being a little bit more high

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:26.830
quality and we've gotten some great

00:35:24.369 --> 00:35:28.900
items here but they haven't always

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:34.150
worked well in conjunction with others

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:35.890
so that spirit art pickup was very very

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:37.420
important that's why I endeavoured to

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:40.210
kill pestilence first although I was a

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:42.220
little worried sad balms was gonna mess

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:44.380
that up for me right okay so when the

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.640
last enemy on this room dies this is

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:48.700
definitely where you want to use sad

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:50.530
bombs as well by the way when the last

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:57.250
enemy on this room dies that's when you

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:59.550
want to pop Guppies head I still think

00:35:57.250 --> 00:36:03.520
we got a chance here gimpy

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:06.040
so many red hearts and zero spirit

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:10.060
hearts I think unless I'm mistaken zero

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:11.800
spirit hearts I'm not upset as long as

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:13.300
we get the W you know everybody gets

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:15.869
their name engraved on the Stanley Cup

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.869
okay

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:22.040
this is actually a run where we probably

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:25.010
should have taken like zero deals with

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:30.950
the devil just relied on bloody penny to

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:36.230
carry us but here we are on the final

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:39.110
room just don't get clever cleverness I

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:45.620
think is one of the most overrated

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:49.300
traits be tenacious that's valuable pay

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:49.300
attention to details here

00:36:56.040 --> 00:37:03.990
good good good good good okay we almost

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:06.230
got tagged there if only we had used

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:10.230
like picked up duct tape

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:14.060
when sac dagger was like on the right

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:14.060
side of our body instead of on the top

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:20.190
then we would have blocked well I mean I

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:21.930
guess it depends which direction your

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:24.690
fighting enemies in most of the time but

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:28.350
feel like we kind of got a a not amazing

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:31.080
roll on that but we lived there's no
