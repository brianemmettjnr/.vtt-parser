00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.770
hey everybody welcome back to the land

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.990
plates of binding Madagascar's pluses

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.370
the first Isaak episode reported on my

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.380
new PC which actually is trying to run

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:19.170
some math I think this is like the fifth

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:24.300
PC I've recorded Isaac on my laptop when

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.430
I lived in South Korea and then when I

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.099
came back got a new computer when I came

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:36.090
back moved to Vancouver used capes

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:38.250
computer got another computer in 2015

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.930
and then this one I nights I'm not

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.700
saying it to brag you know I'm chewing

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.320
through these at a rate that is not I

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.090
mean let me put it this way I hope our

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.940
car last longer than the computers do

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:53.460
but they're being used like crazy here

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.230
anyway the main draw is that we don't

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.399
get slowed down anymore when we get a

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.719
Skype message or at least we're going to

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.670
test that bya to jbw to and we're just

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.080
like very slowly crunching our way

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.450
through Isaac achievements here thanks

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.869
for the cool thanks for the support on

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.220
the basically reboot of this year it's

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.820
not really a reboot but you know what I

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.380
mean as we work our way through getting

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.450
everything unlocked again it's kind of a

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.640
symbolic rebirth of the series and how

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.049
ironic given that the name of the game

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.619
is the same I feel like there's a more

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.170
elegant way to phrase that but anyway

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:35.460
yeah I mean it's funny that we have this

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.329
new machine that like actually could I'm

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.340
not going to say it's like a

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.530
supercomputer necessarily but you know

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.180
then I play battlegrounds everything I'm

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.500
like oh my god there's so much detail in

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.939
this game that I never even knew about

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.009
it even battlegrounds is not the best

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.270
looking game on planet earth but then

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.310
I'm like you know what okay let's play

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.799
some binding of issac now that's a game

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.340
where we can really test the mettle of

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.780
this thing I will say it looks a little

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.369
smoother in the preview footage but I

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.409
don't know again the other opportunity

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.450
here is for you guys to say hey your

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.000
audio sounds like garbage or hey your

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.849
audio sounds great just let me know and

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.009
we'll get it all sorted out you know

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.390
let's try not to die as Kane on the

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.610
first floor I've played

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.800
and just being straight up with you here

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.320
I played pretty badly in the episode

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.760
since we've gone to a new save file it's

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.810
almost like my brain is like well you

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.810
don't have to play that well anymore

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.960
because you're you know dealing with the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.510
easier version of the game maybe true

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.530
maybe not but check this out I got this

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.050
Elgato stream deck thing open I can

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.690
switch to the overlay I can switch it

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.310
back I can switch to the intro for the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.930
NL SS which I'm not going to play right

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.780
now but just rest assured that I could

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.670
pretty cool huh I still need to get the

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:53.540
soundboard built into this thing so I

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:56.790
can play like you know he doesn't answer

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.830
you know I can play stuff like that when

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.090
things go wrong not because I think it

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.570
would be funny but because I think it

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:08.180
would be anti funny which is hilarious

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:10.860
anyway we're working on it will work

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.330
this is the one time I've ever wanted a

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.390
Skype message like as soon as I've

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.850
started an episode no Skype message

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.330
comes in it's a Sunday what's everybody

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.340
working

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.360
I don't think so there's no NFL football

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.580
on either where's the hey you know

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.850
here's what I got in my overwatch Golden

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.590
Boot box or something like that you

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.850
can't see but I do also have a button to

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.230
tell you to use your twitch Prime

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.480
subscriptions if you haven't used them

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.180
already I can just I can if I hit that

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.900
right now it just posted it in the

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.330
twitch shed

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.360
I didn't even have to be there it just

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.730
used the API one day the cat is going to

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.280
well one of the cats is going to step on

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.430
the buttons and it's going to send like

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.200
you know 25 messages within the space of

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.660
a single second I'm going to get like

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.290
globally banned for 24 hours but until

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.720
then it's a dream come true okay how's

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.050
this run going I mean it's actually

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.480
pretty good

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.600
I forgot actually I didn't turn a couple

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.769
of things on here so we want I don't

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.959
know what active cam is but we

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:18.299
definitely want extra HUD and bound HUD

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:21.470
I guess we could turn on charged bars as

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.250
well I've never used those before

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.840
originally I was like I'm not going to

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.720
turn on charge bars and I thought about

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.790
it and I was like why not what's what's

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.310
the benefit to not turning on charge

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:36.150
bars it allows me to stay in my little

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:39.889
stubborn hidey hole right let's see it's

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:42.419
a time for rebirth we got a new system

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.720
we got a new ability to span people to

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.040
use their twitch prime subscriptions

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.500
might as well try to work out some other

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:56.550
new optimizations in the process as well

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:59.250
but same game definitely same game mom's

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.729
perfume chad and i disagree on this

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:06.150
item.i well I mean we agreed for a while

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:08.160
I thought it was terrible and then I

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.229
realized it affects your tier delay and

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.690
I was like no it's really good and then

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:15.270
we were planted on the NL s s the other

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.740
day and Rob was like how's mom's perfume

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.870
and I was like oh it's pretty good and

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.479
Chad was like not sucks now I'm not

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.850
gonna try to Big Shot you and say that I

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:26.880
know you know more about at this point I

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.100
think I'm the I'm the guy who's been

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.200
working at the Isaac factory for like 50

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.520
years and a lot of you guys are like the

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.260
young pups that come in you got a

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.539
university education I went to the

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.490
school of hard knocks right so you're

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.860
like what are you just the couple the

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.510
manifold and then reverse the polarity

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.090
and you'll get 20% more efficiency and

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.820
I'm like dad just taught me to you know

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.380
shooted the enemy until it goes down but

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.610
eventually we've come to an

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.750
understanding with one another and

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.650
that's what's important so we do have a

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.260
double key room

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:01.260
aisle we roll my whole run bothers me

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:05.039
what bothers me very little is what I

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:07.320
mean to say just surprised that wasn't a

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:11.270
secret room but it does happen from time

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:15.750
to time two keys for a five room

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:17.190
absolutely I can't open that well save

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.100
our Temperance cards we've got five

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:23.820
cents we could get the temperance card

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.919
to give us a second blood bank on the

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.419
next floor and then we'll get more value

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:30.199
out of it mr. Megas appeared in the

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:31.849
basement like we've used

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:33.740
50 bombs or something like that I don't

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:36.919
remember I don't remember what unlocks

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:42.039
freaking anything in this game also holy

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:42.039
crap mr. mega is a is an on luck

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:48.949
slightly bigger bombs it's not like it's

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.629
a bad item just not really that bum

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:51.979
bastok but I guess that's a part of what

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:54.020
makes Isaac fun is that you're unlocking

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:58.639
things so regularly especially in the

00:06:54.020 --> 00:07:00.349
early game and it's like I mean you got

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:02.240
it right it's the first brimstone run in

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:05.210
a new era we shouldn't have taken old

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:07.729
bandage and we were totally fine to take

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.259
old bandage actually because we wouldn't

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:10.610
have had the HP to take all three of

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:13.610
these we probably would have stayed away

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:15.439
from the Harbinger or whatever the heck

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:18.379
that item is called so we could die here

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:20.389
we should be careful about that we're

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:21.860
going to crack into this and that was a

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:23.629
you know well where the cost of doing

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.689
business but nothing much apart from

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:27.409
that this is okay this is it's better

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:28.990
than okay

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:32.749
we just have to be careful about our

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:34.250
survivability here okay so charge the

00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:36.889
bars wow this is actually an extremely

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:38.539
positive UI change as always my

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:41.300
apologies a number of people were like

00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:43.430
why don't you use charge bars and I

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.529
always just went I don't need them I

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:49.219
grew up without charge bars why would I

00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:51.050
need them now turns out probably should

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:52.430
have taken advantage of them guppies

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:57.889
head is what we're going to use a long

00:07:52.430 --> 00:08:00.409
term here ended up being pretty good

00:07:57.889 --> 00:08:03.349
actually a secret room probably not but

00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:06.949
you want to look regardless if you can't

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:08.629
quite go to that room and this is

00:08:06.949 --> 00:08:11.060
actually like this by far the strongest

00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:13.189
run we've had Butterbean has appeared in

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.960
the basement all right and realize

00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:21.830
you've got so many unlocks for shooting

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:23.360
poops secret room perhaps indeed we

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:26.449
can't get into any other rooms yet other

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.949
no we can get into this one I don't

00:08:26.449 --> 00:08:30.199
remember what this is though it's

00:08:27.949 --> 00:08:32.659
another five room I mean I'll do it but

00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:34.940
a little ridiculous I just want to

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:37.669
survive now or as good Charlotte would

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:40.159
say I just want to live two more spirit

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:41.149
arts we might get a deal with the devil

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:43.260
but I think I'm going to use these to go

00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:46.770
to our curse room instead and try to

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:50.370
you know leverage our advantages we have

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:52.290
to pick up curse die at some point my

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:54.360
thinking is why not now of course we've

00:08:52.290 --> 00:09:00.870
got nine lives I think this is a good

00:08:54.360 --> 00:09:05.040
run to have it it's the way I see it at

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:06.330
least maybe not the best use of the

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.500
temperance cards are kind of a fun use

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.540
of the temperance card and you know what

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.860
we got another we got the ability to get

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.330
into the shop up there which should

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:17.400
allow us to get a key all we need is a

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:18.750
bomb but I'm fairly like overjoyed with

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.750
the way this run looks right now we've

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:24.690
got a lot of like 10 out of 10 items and

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:26.520
I'm sitting pretty dude I'm gonna do the

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:29.340
5 room again - I want to become guppy

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:33.510
before we leave this floor Wow mama mega

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:36.920
here we go again I'm just going to use

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:39.060
it because it's cheap and you know what

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.460
donate some more money here I don't know

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.780
probably got to get to like 25 cents

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.460
before you get anything else but why not

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:47.850
give it a shot right 20 cents gives us

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:49.410
the first store upgrade I guess and I

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.840
thought maybe we could cheese it that's

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:52.920
fine

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:56.490
it's going to be incremental progress

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:58.350
but progress nonetheless look at our

00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:00.510
second secret room for free and it's

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:03.150
useless we may not be able to get to our

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:05.070
item room but that's alright we'll get

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:08.430
another one on the next floor probably

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:10.920
now the one thing I want to know is if

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:14.040
we don't get a deal with the devil here

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:17.490
do we have the benefit of not getting

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:21.510
one which sounds confusing but what I

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:24.120
mean is if we don't get a deal with the

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:25.530
devil which we didn't do we have a 67

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:29.340
percent chance of the next floor do we

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:31.760
go back to a 33% chance we just had a

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:36.590
subscription I apologize for that

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:40.080
previously I've never had I've never had

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:42.660
my subscribe my god we are goofy my

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:45.030
subscription overlay on OBS because I

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.410
used expletive stream but now there

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:49.110
might be you know what we could try to

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:50.640
like check this out okay I'm just going

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.050
to try it I'm going to press the twitch

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.670
Prime button

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.869
and I'm going to see if we get a

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:57.149
call-and-response here with a

00:10:54.869 --> 00:10:59.129
subscription is it a scumbag technique

00:10:57.149 --> 00:11:00.989
maybe but it would also be a great joke

00:10:59.129 --> 00:11:05.519
so let's see if it works I press the

00:11:00.989 --> 00:11:06.959
button we've sent out the siren call I'm

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:09.899
not paying that close attention to the

00:11:06.959 --> 00:11:11.670
preview window so I might miss it you

00:11:09.899 --> 00:11:15.569
got to let me know can't do anything

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:18.029
there come on it's a joke that

00:11:15.569 --> 00:11:23.519
financially benefits me be a good sport

00:11:18.029 --> 00:11:27.119
now it's a that was funny though I can I

00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:29.129
can disable that for uh for videos which

00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:31.290
I will do from this point onwards so

00:11:29.129 --> 00:11:32.759
this is like a disgusting run I don't

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.589
know what we can accomplish on this run

00:11:32.759 --> 00:11:39.209
but we should try to do everything

00:11:34.589 --> 00:11:43.679
that's in our power even if it ends at

00:11:39.209 --> 00:11:45.720
mom's heart we might be able to I can't

00:11:43.679 --> 00:11:47.489
remember if you get the hush fight do we

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:50.040
choose to go into the chest after the

00:11:47.489 --> 00:11:51.449
mom's heart fight or not we definitely

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.920
have the ability to do boss rush this

00:11:51.449 --> 00:11:57.360
could be our first boss restaurant which

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:58.949
would be something you might want to use

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.779
our keys to open the golden chest I

00:11:58.949 --> 00:12:02.970
think we'll still make boss I maybe got

00:12:00.779 --> 00:12:05.459
brimstone guppy on the first freakin

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:06.929
floor so I'm very confident - despite

00:12:05.459 --> 00:12:08.220
being one floor behind schedule we're

00:12:06.929 --> 00:12:11.160
going to make boss rush that should be

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:13.980
like no problem whatsoever and you know

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:18.480
what it's nice because I don't feel bad

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:20.069
about the fact that we I think this is

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:23.429
the way you do it I don't feel bad about

00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:27.089
the fact that we're so stacked on this

00:12:23.429 --> 00:12:29.160
run because it's like we have a

00:12:27.089 --> 00:12:31.889
reasonable excuse you know we're trying

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.959
to oh my lord

00:12:31.889 --> 00:12:36.929
we're trying to get everything on lock

00:12:33.959 --> 00:12:38.069
that we can see where we can so why

00:12:36.929 --> 00:12:39.569
wouldn't we take every available

00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:41.759
advantage this is the first time we've

00:12:39.569 --> 00:12:43.470
ever had brimstone on the savefile in

00:12:41.759 --> 00:12:44.999
this very unique permutation of

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:49.350
situation so you get the idea

00:12:44.999 --> 00:12:52.230
sure I traded a key for a penny it's a

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:56.069
bad deal worst deal in the history of

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:59.399
deals and sometimes you trade a key for

00:12:56.069 --> 00:13:02.879
like enemies that's way worse but this

00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:05.069
is like the run is so easy I again I

00:13:02.879 --> 00:13:06.050
sort of feel like why not just pick up

00:13:05.069 --> 00:13:08.190
everything

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:10.529
it's like that Shakira song from

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:11.760
Zootopia try everything we might as well

00:13:10.529 --> 00:13:12.630
pick up every item that we get because

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.750
we're going to need it at some point

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:18.120
anyway it's like you know when it came

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:19.829
to after birth or when it came to

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:22.769
rebirth I can't I think it was rebirth

00:13:19.829 --> 00:13:24.720
one of my last items ever to get was the

00:13:22.769 --> 00:13:26.519
dollar bill just because I'd condition

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.930
myself to never play slot machines

00:13:26.519 --> 00:13:31.050
because they're almost never worth it

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:33.000
and was it a good idea yeah like almost

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:36.750
certainly but we could have also

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.100
increased our the rate at which we got

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:41.100
real platinum God by probably just

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:45.839
playing one of those before it became an

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:47.880
issue either way I can't bring up

00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:52.800
Zootopia any we didn't make it this mean

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:56.850
by the way Society made this mean I saw

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:58.680
Zootopia with my wife in theaters three

00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:00.180
months after it came out which is the

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.130
way that we see movies most of the time

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:05.100
I just saw guardians of the galaxy too

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:06.720
as we talked about I look forward in a

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.279
month and a half to seeing Wonder Woman

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.449
perhaps I'll even check out spider-man

00:14:08.279 --> 00:14:15.149
in September that's just the way she

00:14:09.449 --> 00:14:17.490
goes I didn't realize that by liking

00:14:15.149 --> 00:14:20.160
this movie it meant that I wanted to

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:21.810
have intercourse with all these cartoon

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:25.310
animals here I was thinking it was a

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:28.709
heartwarming you know family film about

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:29.940
acceptance even when we're all different

00:14:28.709 --> 00:14:31.380
from one another we've all got our own

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.790
different strengths and abilities and

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:37.290
that's you know part of what makes us

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:38.790
strong instead it turns out that I guess

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:40.410
just by enjoying the movie I want to

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:44.250
have intercourse with those cartoon

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:47.490
animals and that's on me I suppose I

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:49.980
don't know what it's like I don't know I

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:51.089
don't know how this got created but it's

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.339
the same thing I don't know why this

00:14:51.089 --> 00:14:56.190
doesn't apply to other things because

00:14:53.339 --> 00:14:57.329
and hear me out here because first off

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:58.980
there's not like there's anything wrong

00:14:57.329 --> 00:15:01.290
with it I don't care you know whatever

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.550
you jo to and the privacy of your own

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:06.630
bedroom doesn't bother me in the least

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:08.699
however why is it that if you like

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:10.680
Zootopia everybody thinks you want to

00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:13.740
sleep with the cartoon animals whereas

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:15.689
if you like you know Who Framed Roger

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:17.020
Rabbit everybody goes yeah it's a

00:15:15.689 --> 00:15:19.660
classic piece of cinema

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:21.459
they're both good two great movies and

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:23.740
you know sure maybe one's better than

00:15:21.459 --> 00:15:26.080
the other Who Framed Roger Rabbit might

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:28.140
be better than Zootopia but you're both

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:30.220
good

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:32.080
maybe I just spend too much time in the

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.250
Internet like if you talk to somebody in

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.990
the real world and you go

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:39.399
I like Zootopia they go oh me too is a

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:42.190
great movie nobody goes oh yeah me too

00:15:39.399 --> 00:15:45.940
probably I don't know but the Internet

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:47.740
is real life these days man people are

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:49.480
spending more than half of their days on

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.920
the Internet people of my generation at

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.320
least oh my god I don't I don't know if

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:56.950
they stack but it's still worth it it's

00:15:53.320 --> 00:16:00.610
the realest life which is a scary thing

00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:04.480
but also like kind of cool you have an

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:06.360
actual like cyber world I don't know

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.200
where I'm going with this

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:13.540
because I was going to talk a little bit

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:18.029
about the cyber world what's funny when

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:22.120
you go back and look at dystopian like

00:16:18.029 --> 00:16:24.459
cyberpunk movies is how they always are

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:27.399
like hey we're in the future of the you

00:16:24.459 --> 00:16:29.230
know cyberpunk and all that yeah things

00:16:27.399 --> 00:16:30.850
are real weird like reads people turn

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:33.250
poor people into food and then eat them

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:36.010
but then also almost every single

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:38.860
monitor still has like green on or green

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:40.180
text on black backgrounds it's like they

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.890
really thought that they had knocked it

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.540
out of the park so much with the user

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:45.490
interface they're like you can't get any

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:47.290
better than green text on black

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:51.390
background this as good as it gets

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:54.010
starring Jack Nicholson classic movie

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:57.430
turns out if you like it though sorry

00:16:54.010 --> 00:17:01.089
you want to slobber on Jack Nicholson's

00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:03.250
knob apparently that's how we like

00:17:01.089 --> 00:17:04.540
movies in this day and age oh you like

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:07.600
Space Jam sorry

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:09.760
means you want to put it in Lola bunnies

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:11.470
but I didn't realize until now but

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:13.600
that's that's the era that we've created

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:15.100
but we're bordering on some you know I

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.679
think the lady doth protest too much

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:20.740
sort of territory here so let's let's

00:17:17.679 --> 00:17:23.520
back away but hey it's a tangent hard to

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.520
come by lately

00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:30.620
all right this is like so overpowered we

00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:33.649
don't even talk about it

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:36.889
borderline at all here which is nice you

00:17:33.649 --> 00:17:38.960
know to just be extremely confident here

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:40.759
a little bit off pace for Bob's rush but

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.129
we'll probably make it happen regardless

00:17:40.759 --> 00:17:44.990
and we still have wishbone doing nothing

00:17:43.129 --> 00:17:47.090
for us but maybe one day coming through

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:49.879
in the clutch like Luke Cage which I

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:54.590
have not seen yet skills me streamer

00:17:49.879 --> 00:17:56.690
Luke Agee doesn't come in the clutch he

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:58.730
says I'm not going to lay in the cut no

00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:01.519
more at least that's as I understand it

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:02.419
from what Robert has told me I haven't

00:18:01.519 --> 00:18:07.899
seen that either

00:18:02.419 --> 00:18:10.429
I don't watch I don't watch TV much

00:18:07.899 --> 00:18:14.269
really it depends how much laundry I've

00:18:10.429 --> 00:18:16.100
folded in in recent memory like I

00:18:14.269 --> 00:18:23.869
haven't fully laundry in like five or

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:25.309
six days last time I folded laundry I

00:18:23.869 --> 00:18:26.629
watched an episode of you've got to eat

00:18:25.309 --> 00:18:29.090
here which I talked about in a very

00:18:26.629 --> 00:18:30.409
recent eyes together soap and I do want

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:32.269
to point out one of the benefits of

00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:35.570
living in a major city at least within

00:18:32.269 --> 00:18:37.039
Canada is when you watch diners

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:39.320
drive-ins and dives the Canadian version

00:18:37.039 --> 00:18:42.080
aka you got to eat here there's probably

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:43.490
like a 20 percent chance not a

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.200
restaurant you've been to necessarily

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:47.830
but a 20 percent chance at a restaurant

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:50.539
in your city is going to be on there

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:53.809
like I watched an episode when I was

00:18:50.539 --> 00:18:58.269
folding laundry and there's a restaurant

00:18:53.809 --> 00:19:00.499
called yokes it's like an egg-based

00:18:58.269 --> 00:19:03.049
brunch place and I was like I've seen

00:19:00.499 --> 00:19:04.580
that place there's always a lineup but

00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:06.470
is there a line up because it's good or

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:11.179
is it a lineup because you got to eat

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:13.039
here I mean I don't know how many bits I

00:19:11.179 --> 00:19:15.610
can do about you got to eat here as well

00:19:13.039 --> 00:19:17.600
it's getting a little ridiculous but I

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:21.110
find the name of the show very

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:23.809
presumptuous what about and consider

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:28.129
eating here this is a good place to eat

00:19:23.809 --> 00:19:30.230
something you got to eat here you got 48

00:19:28.129 --> 00:19:32.930
seasons of episodes that's like more

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:35.210
meals than I've consumed

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:36.710
since I've been able to eat there you

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:38.780
know they're trying not to break the

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:41.210
bank too much eating out at yolks every

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:42.950
day is getting you know goat cheese eggs

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:44.900
benedict with you know real Canadian

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:47.900
maple syrup on top that's expensive

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:49.340
everyone when they come to Canada hey

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:50.420
we're not everybody but a lot of people

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.920
when they come to Canada we're like are

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:53.420
you gonna get like souvenirs and they're

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.980
like yeah I was thinking I would buy

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:58.610
some maple syrup and take it back and

00:19:54.980 --> 00:20:01.460
we're going to stop it's - it's like you

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:02.960
know $20 a litre for real maple syrup

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:05.630
here now I always go I thought it would

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.550
be cheap and I know so we're always like

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:09.890
why is maple syrup so expensive I guess

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:12.200
like the fact that it grows in a tree

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:13.640
for a whole year and then you know you

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:16.670
just kind of take it all out and drizzle

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:19.730
it on pancakes some supply and demand

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:21.230
but also like how many litres of syrup

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:26.179
that you get from one maple tree I got

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:29.290
no idea well if you can't donate we

00:20:26.179 --> 00:20:29.290
might as well just bounce here

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:37.390
I'm trying to think of like other

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:39.400
examples that make sense but maple syrup

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:41.679
is a common misconception not cheap in

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.659
Canada same thing like we live I have

00:20:41.679 --> 00:20:46.210
got the perfect example we live in

00:20:43.659 --> 00:20:49.450
Vancouver if you haven't seen Vancouver

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:53.380
on a map it borders the Pacific Ocean on

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:56.350
like three sides basically and it's next

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:59.409
to like a major straight and a large

00:20:56.350 --> 00:21:01.539
river I know what you're saying seafoods

00:20:59.409 --> 00:21:05.200
got to be cheap they're not Sun it's

00:21:01.539 --> 00:21:07.990
like still real expensive I still will

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.850
never willfully buy like crab from a

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:11.409
grocery store first off because I don't

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:14.919
trust myself to cook it properly but

00:21:11.409 --> 00:21:16.539
secondly I I thought when I moved out

00:21:14.919 --> 00:21:18.059
here I was like fish is going to be like

00:21:16.539 --> 00:21:21.159
they're just going to be giving it away

00:21:18.059 --> 00:21:22.900
still like really expensive it's like

00:21:21.159 --> 00:21:25.179
the freezing and putting it on a truck

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:27.220
shipping it's Ontario and then flying it

00:21:25.179 --> 00:21:30.250
back out to justify the cost or

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:33.610
something so there's always people go

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:36.730
like you know not always but they go hey

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:39.820
do you like smoked salmon smoked salmon

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:43.750
is like a very Vancouver e common thing

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:46.330
smoked in candied salmon I say yeah if

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:48.250
I'm at a buffet that has smoked salmon

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:50.110
I'm eating a lot of smoked salmon

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:52.090
I will eat as much smoked salmon as I

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:55.510
can before they say sir you've hit the

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:58.690
limit on smoked salmon you're going to

00:21:55.510 --> 00:22:00.909
get leg zinc poisoning or something one

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:01.679
of the great scourge ha's of our modern

00:22:00.909 --> 00:22:03.909
day era

00:22:01.679 --> 00:22:07.179
I've never buying smoked salmon for

00:22:03.909 --> 00:22:09.370
myself are you out of your mind just

00:22:07.179 --> 00:22:11.980
keep eating ham sandwiches on Wonder

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:12.730
Bread that's the same price across the

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.950
whole nation

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:16.120
I'm not going to yeah we should say

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:18.730
we're going to kill everything so

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:22.390
quickly anyway we've unlocked Krampus oh

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:25.870
it's in a new era alright we're going to

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:28.150
do boss fresh I don't know maybe I think

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:31.900
this does work but it might really slow

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:35.409
down our rate of fire do you think boss

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:39.130
rush is going to be shorter because we

00:22:35.409 --> 00:22:41.080
have less bosses on lock's I really

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:45.610
doubt it

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:50.200
I would like that to be the case but I

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:51.880
would be very very surprised we're only

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:55.890
getting one charge from boss rush now -

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:58.890
they must have unfortunately fixed it I

00:22:55.890 --> 00:23:00.910
was really enjoying getting double the

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:08.880
active item effects that we normally

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:13.210
would but seriously this is like a

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:16.860
platinum god run on a mom's heart save

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:19.510
file what it what is sir mix-a-lot say

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:21.700
by Brooklyn face but in Oakland booty

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:22.630
that's what we had going on here I don't

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:25.090
know what that means

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:27.220
Brooklyn face but in Oakland booty I

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:29.980
think I would take offense if I live in

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:33.040
Oakland it's like yeah your girls have

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:35.410
good butts but for some reason they're

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:37.690
not quite as attractive as women from

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:41.020
this one particular borough in New York

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:42.450
City and sir mix-a-lot you're from

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:44.620
you're from Seattle

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:48.540
you couldn't just you couldn't just use

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:48.540
like Pacific Northwest landmarks

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:54.760
maybe you know don't poop where you eat

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:56.650
that's what they say especially if your

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:58.390
songs about butts you're like just

00:23:56.650 --> 00:24:01.510
asking for it at that point I think I

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:02.710
think sir mix-a-lot from Seattle you

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:04.480
know we got a lot of pride for the

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:07.480
Pacific Northwest music scene up here

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:09.700
and by that I mean we take credit in

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:11.860
Vancouver for being close to Seattle

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:15.190
where a lot of grunge music and hip-hop

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:17.620
happened that's what music does it

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:22.120
happens and then it's gone there's a

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:24.190
gente de rock we played a little better

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:27.760
on this run but it's also really easy to

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:31.720
play better when you have the easiest

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:32.710
runs of all time happening by the way I

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.850
haven't even looked to see if the

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:38.320
postive notes actually getting filled in

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:39.790
I'm just kind of assuming that it is and

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.850
if it's not well we're setting ourselves

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:45.280
back a little bit but we're certainly

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:46.870
unlocking things like we're not just

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:49.330
ending the run and mom every time that's

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:54.240
fun little baggie gives us fun I think

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:57.990
no just we picked up enough syringes but

00:24:54.240 --> 00:25:01.450
just off-kilter enough to be like

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:03.550
confused we did kill mom's heart I think

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:09.220
for the first time in the last episode

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:11.350
so we might get access to to the hush

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:13.000
fight and at this point if I ever get

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:14.800
the chance to do hush if I ever get the

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.170
chance to do delirium I'm going to do

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:19.390
them just to spice things up because

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:22.120
admittedly a run that ends in moms heart

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:26.280
is not the most exciting run in Isaac

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:29.320
history most of the time not Krampus

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:31.750
live a little take this take this go for

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:35.010
broke here we got to guarantee deal with

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:35.010
the devil at the end of the next floor

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:41.620
we might get cathedral access I don't

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:42.370
know I don't remember how to and this is

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.930
not a joke

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:47.200
I don't remember how to unlock almost

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:48.910
anything related to progress in Isaac we

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.930
just kind of we got it once and I was

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:52.060
like I'm set

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:54.100
I don't need I've got tenure I don't

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:55.750
need to worry about this anymore now I

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:58.210
wouldn't say I need to worry about it

00:25:55.750 --> 00:26:00.370
but you know just keep that in mind if

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:02.920
you ever want me to know something about

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:05.380
Isaac that seems pertinent now I'm being

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:08.920
serious here yell at me on Twitter

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:12.070
I'm good for the most part and filtering

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:14.260
out productive yelling from unproductive

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:18.970
yelling so I appreciate all that was bad

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:22.210
I appreciate when people you know

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:26.560
message me and go like hey you it seems

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:30.910
like you would want to know this don't

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:32.890
ever feel badly about that unless it

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:37.050
becomes absurd okay so I'm going to try

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:40.090
to never walk into a red poop again

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:41.380
we've actually created we left the

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.270
spirit out back there but I think we'll

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:46.120
be fine especially with all the red

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:51.070
hearts were getting anyway we've

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:55.000
actually created curse of the tower

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:56.980
unlike five rooms on this floor which is

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.210
very embarrassing for me I don't care

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:00.040
about permanent polaroid invincibility

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:03.910
because we don't have the polaroid so

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:10.450
that's like essentially completely

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:11.710
irrelevant to a clubs to our hearts I

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:15.000
thought that would give us all heart

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:15.000
there to be honest

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:21.789
so we're just looking for r.i.p now I

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:23.080
suppose we could explore the entire

00:27:21.789 --> 00:27:24.429
floor by don't know what we'd be looking

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:26.080
for that unlocks things because I don't

00:27:24.429 --> 00:27:28.330
know what unlocks things I thought we

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:31.330
established this okay I walk right into

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:32.980
the enemy's smart play so it's just

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:36.009
going to take me out I'll tell you what

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:37.360
oh no it's not we're going to get a

00:27:36.009 --> 00:27:38.860
bonus play here what I was actually

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.539
thinking is we would go back and explore

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:42.490
and look for a self-sacrifice room but

00:27:40.539 --> 00:27:46.840
dude let's try this out maybe we'll get

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:51.190
some serious on locks here now there

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:53.379
should be no way for us to get to the

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:56.740
void floor I think that we're screwed in

00:27:53.379 --> 00:27:58.179
that department and also this run is

00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:01.149
like a huge candidate for highway

00:27:58.179 --> 00:28:05.769
blindness because it's oh so strong so

00:28:01.149 --> 00:28:07.659
there's like a great incentive for me to

00:28:05.769 --> 00:28:10.000
like go get a snack after this episode

00:28:07.659 --> 00:28:12.519
and forget that we're dealing so much

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.190
damage because the next episode is

00:28:12.519 --> 00:28:16.929
unlikely to be as strong as this one

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:19.659
dude I just realize we got to unlock the

00:28:16.929 --> 00:28:22.539
lost and the keeper again if you got so

00:28:19.659 --> 00:28:28.029
much greed mode stuff to do like a month

00:28:22.539 --> 00:28:30.250
of greed mode at one episode a day it's

00:28:28.029 --> 00:28:32.529
going to be a well you know what it's

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:35.169
nice it's a long-term project I kind of

00:28:32.529 --> 00:28:38.049
see this as my like you know Far Lands

00:28:35.169 --> 00:28:39.639
or bust or something like that you know

00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:42.730
the series where that dude was walking

00:28:39.639 --> 00:28:46.630
across all of Minecraft to try to reach

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:48.580
the point at which the world ends

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:51.460
I don't know whatever happened there

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:53.020
mostly because I saw his task as so

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:56.620
gargantuan and I was like I can't watch

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:57.910
this I'll watch the last episode no

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:59.140
doubt about it and then yeah I don't

00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:02.440
regret any buddy spent their time

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:04.450
watching the other ones but like do this

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:06.490
kid literally the whole crux of this is

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:19.990
that the task is going to take a long

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:25.240
time how did we get a demon isn't there

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:28.540
a there an unlock for having 12 spirit

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:33.190
hearts to be already get that can't

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:36.370
remember we probably won't be able to

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:40.150
just create it out of thin air but there

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:42.250
is a chance we get enough red hearts I

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:45.130
mean even that might be one payout right

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:48.340
there we have gimpy so I guess you'd be

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:50.710
expecting a a lot of chances here gallon

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:55.780
for me doesn't have length is this like

00:29:50.710 --> 00:30:00.820
a nerfed version feel like I'm losing my

00:29:55.780 --> 00:30:03.210
mind maybe if I hadn't taken like 20

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:05.230
hits I had no reason to take we wouldn't

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:07.330
find ourselves in such a weird situation

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:08.740
I'm looking for a self-sacrifice room

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:11.290
which we did not find I don't even know

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:14.080
if they exist at this stage in our Isaac

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:17.320
you know save file but a fun run

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:20.260
nonetheless nay a very fun run

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:22.300
nonetheless I had a good time on this

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:27.160
one we got up to some good top of some

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:29.550
conversation I think come on dude you

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.550
got me

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:36.480
all right we tried um we unlocked a

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:38.100
bunch of stuff and we just skipped the

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.539
ending that I should have looked at but

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:42.120
we can do that again we have to fight

00:30:39.539 --> 00:30:44.840
Satan 30 times anyway we unlock Judas we

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:47.429
unlike the catacombs the ace of clubs

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:50.639
all we started to fill in the posted

00:30:47.429 --> 00:30:52.830
there the the main screen I still don't

00:30:50.639 --> 00:30:55.769
know why this has nothing was it because

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:58.230
I used the Bible to kill mom we got

00:30:55.769 --> 00:30:59.820
other stuff on locked here anyway we got

00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:01.260
as AIDS will we get Lazarus we got eaten

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.159
we should do an Eden run next just for

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:04.230
old times sake

00:31:02.159 --> 00:31:05.490
