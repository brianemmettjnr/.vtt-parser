00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.500
hey everybody welcome back to Norton

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.210
Lyon place the binding of issac address

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.670
plus where I'm feeling a little bit

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.630
better not quite like the Michael Buble

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.330
song and I'm feeling good doot-doot of

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.230
God the next challenge is speed

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.539
immediately

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.820
alright well let's uh approach this in

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.890
in an appropriate fashion how should we

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.850
handle the speed challenge I think the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.090
way that we should handle the speed

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.970
challenge is to hold our until we get a

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.140
good item right off the bat now I don't

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.329
think the item the the relative values

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.120
of the items change that much on speed

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.590
versus how they are in a normal run any

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.360
guppy item will probably start with any

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.980
damage upgrade any tears upgrade that's

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.590
at least over you know a certain level

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.239
and then special considerations like an

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.649
early blank card is amazing because if

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.890
we get the Emperor along with it we're

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.129
set but this is is meant to be a little

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.430
bit on the challenging side for certain

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.390
technologies zero is good enough

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.500
especially considering there's an

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:12.450
Isaac's room in there it's probably not

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.869
like our number one choice either static

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.880
zero or sorry add technology zero wait a

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.369
minute what are the static tiers so

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.860
technology zero I've forgotten now all I

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.640
know is my eyes are wide cuz I'm using

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.530
them for the first time but the problem

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.990
with the Isaac's room is that we don't

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.119
really benefits we definitely do not

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.350
want that we don't really benefit from

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.150
it unless we can to bombs and then

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.189
unless we get three bombs actually and

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.570
then the odds are still very very strong

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.820
that we're gonna end up getting a crawl

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.290
space so a crawl space is not really

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.659
necessarily that useful although things

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.130
can change right now I'm like 50/50 on

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.490
how I feel about this run I think static

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.890
tears are doing a lovely job I don't

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.240
think they're gonna be ten out of ten we

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.880
need like a higher rate of fire

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.159
something that causes our tears to like

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.069
fracture upon landing that was bad on my

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.660
part but odds are we're probably not

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.610
gonna get that here might get a little

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.959
lucky though we'll see it's weird

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.590
because everything moves like twice as

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.519
faster the

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.310
clock moves in real time it's hard to

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.750
remember and then parse how to handle

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.280
that the super bandage is actually like

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.620
a ten out of ten get for us there

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.390
because super bandage gives us two

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.000
spirit hearts which we can hopefully

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:34.980
endeavor not to squander here end up

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.400
benefiting as a result I don't think

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.230
it's worth playing the the blood bank

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.030
but I could be mistaken I don't think we

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:48.209
need a speed upgrade as ironic as that

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:49.799
might seem and more HP is not the most

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.200
urgent thing right now let's check this

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.849
out okay actually quite like this even

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.560
if it only gives us occasional extra

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:59.489
damage that's something if it benefits

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.079
us by making the it's not even worth it

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.540
to begin with if it makes our

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.430
electricity deal more damage on tooth

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.560
shots as well which I have no reason to

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.670
believe it does or does not then we're

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.290
in a good spot but we need to up our

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.510
luck as well but you know anything that

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.639
gives us any sort of conceivable future

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.049
advantage is worth taking we definitely

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:21.959
don't care as much about the future as

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.000
we care about the present but kind of

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.980
got a focus a little bit on both right

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.750
now keep it thank you you get an extra

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.650
penny which I'm just gonna hope against

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.000
hope is a Lucky Penny and it isn't and

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.560
then I'm gonna blow this up and hope for

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.720
what I'm gonna buy this blow this up

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.340
hope for some lucky pennies or nothing

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.230
at all would be the worst outcome I

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.030
would suggest always is rough okay so

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.620
we're gonna be leaving here about on

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.440
schedule I think we wanted to be out of

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:53.489
here by like 12 minutes ish we should be

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.660
leaving by let's say like 12:45 seems

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.150
like fairly realistic

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.160
just give me pageant boy in seven like

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.680
upgrades that's like the greatest dps we

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.730
could ever expect right now these shots

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.980
by the way in case you haven't noticed

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.560
are essentially like impossible to dodge

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.120
the way that they come out on the speed

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.109
challenge here so that's pretty sweet

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.880
but please just die before you get to

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:17.310
mess with me too much open your mouth

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.870
and then we run also open the door get

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.220
on the floor and everybody walked it

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.219
dinosaur okay

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.170
perfect timing meat is okay a very small

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:28.990
damage upgrade little brim

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.810
I don't know I don't know I I feel like

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.630
my nate silver 538 percentage chances of

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:40.750
success are going up and down here I'm

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:43.420
not fully sure where I exist on this one

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.360
I actually just lost demon hearts as

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.890
well or their spirit hearts I mean I

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.730
think it is important that we picked up

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:55.000
more damage in the form of meat and

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:57.940
little brim but in common cold even as

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.310
well is not bad but are they making us

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:03.880
good enough fast enough that's the real

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.560
question we should be able to survive

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.690
relatively easily but it's much more

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.430
important that you know far be it from

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.050
just worrying about survival we got to

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.190
worry about the speed at which we're

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.960
able to make it through these as well so

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.160
another key gives us another item room

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.020
on the next floor which is really good

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.090
we definitely do not want to backtrack

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.590
we want to bank as much time as possible

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.930
as long as you hit the item room we're

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.540
gonna get a Lucky Penny here and it's

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.390
not a lucky that's okay okay double

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:32.010
Gertie junior is actually held however

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:34.480
we will get a spirit heart for finishing

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:38.350
once that's done the worlds are buried

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:40.180
oh dude and not like even from Qdoba or

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.590
Chipotle and I'm not looking down on

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.960
those I mean it burritos a burrito but

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.760
I'm talking about from like you know and

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.890
taqueria in the mission or something

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:51.880
like that these are top tier burritos

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:54.610
here these are the kind of burritos that

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:58.000
gets a got raided they get a Michelin

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:01.840
star they can slice and dice and make

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.050
julienne pinto beans I'm more on the

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:08.740
side of being stoked to have little brim

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:12.520
now and the my reasoning is very simple

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:14.800
if a it's good and B we can charge it

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.310
like in between rooms so we kind of get

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:21.280
like Herbie fully loaded before we even

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:25.410
pop off on a room we probably should

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.410
consider this is tough

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:31.770
I want it but I want to see what our

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:34.020
shop entails first because if our shop

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.670
has blank card or like any form of

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.640
mapping we probably want to go for that

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:44.760
but like the money that is but that's a

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:47.460
play it by my ear no no I got out of my

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:50.690
comfort zone but that's okay yesterday I

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:53.580
got so old it felt like I could cry I

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:55.850
don't think that's the lyric because

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.990
that's in between days you know what

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.090
this is probably gonna go up on one of

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.620
the in-between days Tuesday's like the

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.050
in-between is day right did this go up

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.720
on a Tuesday that would be perfect good

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:09.090
deal please that is a bad deal I'm gonna

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.190
do one more room and it wasn't a

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.710
terrible decision but it didn't give us

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:15.390
much and we're just gonna ignore the

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.010
fact that we're unfortunately missing

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.890
out on getting an item room there life

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:23.070
goes on

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:24.960
dank taps one we got four floors left to

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.750
do and there goes our deal with a devil

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.640
chance we got four floors left to do in

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:37.380
ten minutes two and a half minutes real

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:39.270
time per floor I think we actually may

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.860
want to take like a no deal with the

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.530
devil approach of course no deal with

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.440
the devil also means you know you take

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:50.220
like the really really good ones

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:51.960
number one is actually maybe okay here I

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.990
don't want to get close to enemies like

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:59.010
I'll be the first to note that but our

00:07:54.990 --> 00:08:00.780
rate of fire is gonna be ridiculous or

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:02.730
you know if you're a map and

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:04.980
counter-strike go it would be de

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:08.910
underscore Rick Ulis it is gonna be a do

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:11.820
Rick Ulis run where did that shot that

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:14.270
he fired go it's just gone but apart

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:18.720
from that we also have infinite range on

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:20.940
little brim so we actually have a means

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.300
to to kill enemies from far away which i

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.300
think is

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:28.030
extremely important here I'm starting to

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:31.090
get my hopes up and that's scary because

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:33.160
hope is where you know hope is the

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:34.870
summer house of disappointment that's an

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.370
expression that I just invented that as

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.560
far as I'm concerned it essentially

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:40.210
makes no sense but does it make no sense

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:47.190
or is it the most poetic thing ever

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:49.780
invented nobody knows you know this

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:51.580
history will be the judge of that okay

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:56.230
we took way too much damage there no

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:57.490
lock upgrades taking about the right

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.110
length of time on this floor which is

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:00.850
good cuz everybody knows it's like the

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:05.260
number-one rule of Isaac the depths of

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:07.120
one is the longest floor you might say

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.470
I've watched all these episodes I

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.180
thought I would I heard you mention that

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.830
by now if it was such a critical rule I

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:14.680
guess you haven't been paying that much

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:16.540
attention because I say it all the time

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.980
I'm always going on about the depths

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.510
being the longest so that's one

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:20.310
specifically being the longest of all

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:26.290
floors

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:27.730
it's very paying glossy and good more

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:29.530
bombs I'm gonna check for a second

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:31.660
secret room super quick and we didn't

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:34.390
get it so I'm gonna pounce oh this is

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:36.370
actually completely okay so preserve

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:39.190
your 9% deal with the devil chance

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:42.670
okay preserve your 0.25% deal with the

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:45.960
devil chance okay don't die I'm moving

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:45.960
the goalposts a little bit but

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:51.510
it's okay now we have the ability to fly

00:09:49.529 --> 00:09:54.089
and just far too much speed to be

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:58.800
responsible but I think this is I think

00:09:54.089 --> 00:10:01.110
we have the tools all that hurts me we

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:06.600
have the tools necessary to win if we

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:10.620
can survive so don't blow it here

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:13.019
good pills that's a terrible pill that's

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:15.269
a fantastic pill that's an awful pill

00:10:13.019 --> 00:10:17.399
but you know what if I needed to get

00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:21.089
that badness to get the goodness of the

00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:23.250
full health then I'll accept it survival

00:10:21.089 --> 00:10:26.430
does you know take precedence over

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:29.040
everything here and little brim can win

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:31.140
the game for us I'd really rather not

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.690
have to rely on it to win the game for

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.290
us but it can do it and it's done it

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.490
before

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:41.220
I'm sorry I think number one might have

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:48.720
been that a bit off base here so we

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:52.470
should never run into enemies that can

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:54.600
hurt us via touch probably strength

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:59.310
versus emergency contact I'll stand by

00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:00.630
that nice what I keep forgetting we only

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.700
have four damage it's not really that

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:05.040
much phd for better pills now you're

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:09.450
just rubbing it in lemon party is

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:11.040
actually like a huge potential Saviour

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:14.910
depending on the situations we find

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:17.370
ourselves in really kill an enemy like

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:20.870
we kill mom pretty fast with this we

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:23.220
should also see if we could maybe get

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:25.320
something in here and I think a single

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:27.149
spirit art is totally fine I would love

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.930
to get more than that but that's what

00:11:27.149 --> 00:11:32.300
they're gonna do that's what they're

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:34.649
gonna do yeah okay that's this room is a

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.270
nightmare it's like the human clock

00:11:34.649 --> 00:11:37.949
speed is not high enough that's always

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:43.890
the magician this should be a secret

00:11:37.949 --> 00:11:45.149
room we got a check luck please just

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:49.640
lock dude that's it

00:11:45.149 --> 00:11:49.640
oh I walked into the freaking fire

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:53.720
now we're up over 15 cents and come back

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.580
down here we got a little bit of time

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.140
normally you'd like to be like five

00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:00.080
minutes four and a half minutes for the

00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:02.180
final two floors here but like we'll do

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.680
what we can man we're gonna try to take

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.960
advantage of whatever we can here blue

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:11.300
map is good enough it's not great but

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:13.550
it's good enough we can probably have a

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:15.740
decent chance to guess where our boss

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:17.720
fights are as a result just for God's

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:20.170
sake just stop running into the champion

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:23.060
that's all I ask

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:25.280
we have a trinket we can now take and a

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.230
good pill health upgrade I like it thank

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.090
you

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:30.920
right there is logically speaking about

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:34.370
zero chance that this would not be a

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:35.750
dead ends but walk through eighty knew

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:39.490
him didn't even see him until it was

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:39.490
okay now we got problems

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:47.080
they approach so quickly so if we fight

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.150
mom we're in like a weird

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:52.990
by the way fight mom great name for like

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:58.540
a graphic novel consider it if we fight

00:12:52.990 --> 00:13:02.740
mom we're in a tough spot cuz if we get

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:05.380
hit by the foot we die however if we go

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:06.700
on the back track you might be screwing

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.940
ourselves even worse which is why I

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:12.370
decided to just go for this you know

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:15.100
bank on having two thousand hours of

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:16.420
Isaac's kill and hopefully that'll

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:20.140
that'll come through in the clutch and

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:22.990
save me here either way I'd rather leave

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:25.090
the game and that the success of the

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:26.440
challenge up to me then up to the game

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:27.820
if you know what I mean so let's just

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.460
peep this there's no chance

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:33.070
yeah there's no chance we take it but we

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:34.870
got a look I'd rather give myself the

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:39.670
ball I'm not the guy who wants to pass

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:43.690
the ball if we you know we got one one

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:48.220
drive left give me the ball I can deal

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:50.620
with being the reason we lose I want to

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.760
be the one who has who has control over

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.110
the situation

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.790
so we bet right there and then I got

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:56.320
overly dramatic as if I was like Mark

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:58.870
Wahlberg and invincible or something

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:01.630
like that but you know what I have told

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:03.670
you a couple of times on this show the

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:05.560
only movies that genuinely like make me

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:08.170
tear up maybe even score it a little bit

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.940
sometimes are like cheesy sports movies

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:12.460
where the underdog wins you know the

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:16.510
underdog is gonna win they almost always

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:20.170
win or they lose but they win the real

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:23.320
prize which is a valuable lesson don't

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:24.610
mess with the favorites I don't want to

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:27.640
spend a bomb there we might need it

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:32.050
later well I guess we could get

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:35.020
something valuable in there no that's

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:36.700
probably a better approach there we

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.770
actually have a real chance at this one

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:41.200
and it's a big surprise because our

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:43.750
stats are actually the hot garbage and

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:46.710
I'm leveling with you a million percent

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:49.640
on that one our stats are pretty awful

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:52.760
especially

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:58.339
our range which is actually more of a

00:14:52.760 --> 00:15:02.779
factor than I'd like to admit what have

00:14:58.339 --> 00:15:04.730
we done but little brim the item I took

00:15:02.779 --> 00:15:07.399
and said I don't know if that was a good

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:12.620
idea turned out to be like the best idea

00:15:07.399 --> 00:15:13.730
we've ever had actually like ten out of

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.010
ten and you know what I should have

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:18.410
trusted my instincts here and gone with

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:22.250
the deal with the devil chance gone

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:23.690
should have gone with the second secret

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:25.940
room methodology here because we would

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:28.130
have been going much faster look at that

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:30.589
three demon hearts well worth the time

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:32.209
investment we're supposed to average two

00:15:30.589 --> 00:15:34.100
minutes per floor look at our timing

00:15:32.209 --> 00:15:37.010
right now we're playing from behind

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:38.089
honestly like we had an early lead and

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:39.769
now we're just trying to protect it

00:15:38.089 --> 00:15:41.810
while like the onslaught is happening

00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:44.480
we're Jaroslav Halak versus the

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:46.010
Washington Capitals in the 2010 number 8

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:49.630
seed nobody gave him a chance

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:54.230
all of a sudden young goalie out of

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:55.699
Bratislava makes Alexander Ovechkin cry

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:58.579
real tears I'm not trying to bring that

00:15:55.699 --> 00:16:00.649
up again Washington you know rest assure

00:15:58.579 --> 00:16:04.100
I was a Habs fan then because I it was

00:16:00.649 --> 00:16:07.910
like my ancestral team I'm a Canucks fan

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:09.760
now so I've had more than enough try

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:12.019
this I've had more than enough

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:13.579
situations as a Canucks fan them you

00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:16.459
know make me feel the pain that you felt

00:16:13.579 --> 00:16:18.170
there I'm just saying it can't happen we

00:16:16.459 --> 00:16:21.320
got two minutes and four seconds we're

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:24.760
gonna go left every room we don't have

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.760
to fight is amazing by the way

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:32.150
only good pills infested these guys are

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:33.530
easy enough to kill I know you're gonna

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:36.050
say you don't have to kill them and

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:38.390
you're absolutely right especially now

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:39.440
though they're almost dead it's not like

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:46.580
we're trying to protect the deal with

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:47.960
the devil get a library or something

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:52.130
there there's no chance that could be

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:55.120
greed right this took way too long we

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:55.120
should have just bombed their way out

00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:03.500
two keys two keys spirit heart

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:04.939
Bob's rotten head get dunked on rest

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.310
assured I feel it slipping away as I

00:17:04.939 --> 00:17:10.720
take 20 years here okay no no this is it

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:13.160
oh it's not it okay we got to go then he

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:16.819
took a bomb to the face and kept taking

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:19.430
I'm scared also not the right direction

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:25.160
we got three bombs left I I see it

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:27.079
slipping you still got a try I mean the

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.360
bomb wouldn't have saved us is the thing

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:32.920
if we had just bombed our way through it

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:37.210
probably wouldn't have saved us at least

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:37.210
now we're just hoping against hope like

00:17:39.409 --> 00:17:44.190
got to make some good decisions here and

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:51.179
then possibly also have to pick up a

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:53.250
Kaos card you gotta go dude we've only

00:17:51.179 --> 00:17:54.720
got two bombs and just land like trying

00:17:53.250 --> 00:18:00.840
to save them for rooms that seem a

00:17:54.720 --> 00:18:02.240
little bit more mission-critical so

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:05.130
here's what you do you got zero bombs

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:07.980
you get fully healed not fully healed

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:10.830
you get fully charged and then you just

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:13.799
crash into the mom fight mom's hard I

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:16.320
should say and just just destroy them

00:18:13.799 --> 00:18:21.140
with one hit I don't think it's

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:21.140
conceivable possible

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.990
we're gonna be like two seconds off okay

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.280
well you know what that just means we

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:40.560
get one more crack over the course of

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:43.140
this video the timer still I mean we

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.970
died but the timer was was done oh it

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:47.340
hurts it hurts okay hold our you know

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:49.830
that was a fairly bad run to get that

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:52.410
far here we go

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:53.940
I probably could have made that one work

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:55.680
but it wasn't like it was a 10 out of 10

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:58.290
run we squandered it was really like a a

00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.750
1 out of 12 it was like a 7 that we

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:02.910
elevated that's good potentially but not

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:04.800
good enough and I I think the negatives

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:07.140
that come along with it are too

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:09.690
dangerous speedball it's not good enough

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:11.700
you don't really need to walk faster you

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:17.520
need to kill enemies faster and this is

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:19.950
like not gonna help at all not not good

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.930
enough ok we should have gone to the

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:23.550
cursor because Guppie transformation is

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:24.240
like a 10 out of 10 and before is good

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.790
but not good enough

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.620
stigmata what we get out of that plus

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:30.060
0.5 eighth damage it might be a

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:32.010
multiplier but I think it's not quite

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:35.400
good enough to hang our hat on I meant

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:40.650
to go to that by the way I'm waiting for

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:41.760
like an actual great setup and I think

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:43.260
we should at this point cuz there's no

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.450
point you know throwing good time after

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:48.330
bad here we're gonna do and this is the

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:54.020
item right here if we're gonna do a full

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:57.120
run to try to beat the speed challenge I

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:58.800
don't want to do to that's just wanna I

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.660
don't want to do this speed challenge

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:03.000
ever again once we get it done so I

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:06.600
think deaths touch is it carries some

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.710
negatives but it's mostly of course we

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:11.090
don't want to speed up great now I think

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:16.020
about our speed is it to anyway but

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:19.160
death touch is the foundation to win the

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:22.010
negatives exists and they're not always

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:24.510
something that can just be ignored like

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:26.940
the speed down can sometimes be really

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:29.070
bad the rate of fire down can sometimes

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:33.560
be really bad but for the most part it's

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:35.460
it's an extremely great item and

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.790
offensively there's not a whole lot in

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.650
the game that surpasses its

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:40.750
a good trinket here will be awesome a

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:44.560
good card like the Emperor even just a

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:47.680
one-off The Fool it's a free boss rush

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:50.680
pickup so like I might be okay with it

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.180
but I'm not the world's happiest camper

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:55.450
here I think instead we're gonna do is

00:20:52.180 --> 00:21:00.970
this so we essentially traded half of a

00:20:55.450 --> 00:21:04.180
spirit heart for two bombs and a demon

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:06.070
heart it's actually great trade so be a

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:08.710
great time to get small rock by the way

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:11.940
the spirit hearts are lovely and I do

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:14.080
need and that's not once that's need to

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:16.570
get a deal with the devil here I think

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:18.370
to have a chance to win I really think

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:22.110
we got to stay stacked as quickly as

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:22.110
possible and as commonly as possible

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:30.640
come on just one more hit there it's a

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:32.530
tough room a long room at least but the

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:36.400
damage is is mission critical as well

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:37.810
teleport 2.0 is actually usually you

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.640
might think this is a terrible choice

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:41.050
cuz normally when we can teleport 2.0 we

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.100
take a hundred years to accomplish

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:44.980
anything as we're trying to make sure

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:47.950
that we get to every available room and

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:50.740
you might be right but it also allows me

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:52.630
to teleport which can save us a lot of

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:56.520
damage I think very quickly I'm just

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:58.810
gonna try to like maybe get myself

00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:00.280
second secret room access is there a

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:02.320
battery charge there is okay so now I

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.460
have error room access like guaranteed

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.890
as long as we get a deal with the devil

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:09.250
and then how long did that take 10

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:11.470
seconds now it's 10 seconds we probably

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:13.840
will not want to afford under most

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:15.850
circumstances to be honest but on the

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.500
early floors who knows that you know

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:22.240
error room can hold like a bunch of

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:25.180
stone chests or something we could get

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:28.180
unreasonably stacked this is a tough

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:29.620
fight we want to be out of here by 12

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:32.890
minutes we're gonna be out of here much

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:34.090
faster than 12 minutes which is a good

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:36.100
sign for the future we're certainly

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:40.150
stronger faster than we were on the last

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:42.220
run it's another good damage upgrade and

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:44.590
that's another good damage upgrade and

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:46.690
that's a nother indirectly good damage

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:49.470
upgrade and then ceremonial robes is

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:52.290
also like amazing for us here

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:57.720
so we're doing ridiculous damage our HP

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:59.520
is a serious concern however why arrow

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.910
room gives us parasitoid tears and we're

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.160
out

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:05.150
that's this all is according to plan

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:08.790
right now this is all positive now

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:11.670
there's certain concerns like our HP is

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:17.100
not incredible but everything else is

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:18.990
going like really really well so we have

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:22.380
eight point eight five damage the the

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:24.030
parasitoid piercing shots are like our

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:27.870
our ace in the hole right now please

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:30.510
excuse me it's moving in aberrations

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:32.610
perks you've got five HP so just try to

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:35.030
be very very intelligent about how this

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:37.710
HP looks right now because that's where

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:40.200
that's where things are gonna hurt and

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:41.790
you're not really doing a great job of

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:45.260
making the audience believe that you've

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:48.440
got that interest in mind right now

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:48.440
thank you

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:55.090
since this would be a throw if we can't

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:56.830
get this one closed this will be a throw

00:23:55.090 --> 00:24:00.880
anything can happen when you get down to

00:23:56.830 --> 00:24:02.860
like the womb but there's no doubt in my

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.420
mind that if we die on like the depths

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:12.160
I'm gonna be kicking myself on this one

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:13.690
I kind of want to go to the and our shot

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:20.620
speed needs to get a little faster too

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:23.500
um I kind of want to go to the special

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:24.970
room that was there and grabs some stuff

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.800
but I don't think I'm gonna like we

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:29.830
should just treat teleport 2.0 as a

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:31.180
teleport it's not worth on the speed

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:33.280
challenge at least it's not worth trying

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:36.090
to make it happen here and in fact it

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:38.470
will take book of Belial instead maybe

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:40.000
yeah I think it's there's there's a good

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:41.530
enough case to be made there we're way

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.780
ahead of schedule so we should actually

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:45.580
slow down you might by the way be

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:47.020
wondering I'm in like full theory mode

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:49.870
here but you might by the way be

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:51.280
wondering hey idiot why didn't you

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:54.370
teleport to see if you got to a further

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:56.050
along room you're right and you're wrong

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:58.690
if that's your line of reasoning you're

00:24:56.050 --> 00:25:00.430
right because it still probably would

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:02.350
move us closer to the boss but you're

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:04.840
wrong because unlike teleport 1.0

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:09.340
teleport 2.0 you can place more bombs

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:09.880
faster unlike teleport 2.0 sorry let me

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:13.120
try this again

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:16.330
unlike teleport 1.0 teleport 2.0 doesn't

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:18.790
allow you to place things to teleport

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:20.500
far away to a random location it

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:23.380
teleports you to the next closest room

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:25.510
you haven't been to which in most cases

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:26.860
is just a room adjacent to you so if

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:30.130
it's closer to the boss good if it's not

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:32.020
then you know you're out of luck if

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:34.870
those enemies are not conceivable to

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:37.450
dodge so we're trying to stack up some

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:39.580
capital here we're also kind of throwing

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:41.200
ourselves on the mercy oh my god we

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:45.550
dodged that kind of throwing ourselves

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:48.600
on the mercy of the this deals with the

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:51.010
devil here we need deals with the devil

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:52.270
so ideally provide us with like an

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:59.980
Abaddon which I don't even know if it's

00:25:52.270 --> 00:26:03.000
unlocked yet or 9lives although it's a

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:03.000
little riskier

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:09.030
we've already gotten the item that gives

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:10.620
you uh no it's not worth the time we've

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:13.260
already gotten the item that gives you

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:15.480
uh three spirit hearts for the cost of

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:19.580
three spirit hearts so can't really rely

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:19.580
on sin robes to show up and get cheesed

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:24.780
so even if we only use bookable I'll

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:27.600
once per floor there's still value in it

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:29.990
this is gonna be tricky though except

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:33.450
he's already dead

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:35.430
but we took some oh my god dude

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:40.560
he can't be dodged thank you for the HP

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:44.550
we desperately needed that we didn't

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:49.560
really need to encounter this situation

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:51.210
in my opinion oh my lord I've got to

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:53.460
overclock my brain for this one you're

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:56.750
done you're done we got something good

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.750
you know what we got a minute here

00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:02.580
to a spades not quite worth it but we're

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:05.100
still in this we got very little HP

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:08.820
we're going down to only depths one

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:11.280
right bank that's one so I think we

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:13.980
might be a little on the slow side which

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:15.690
seems unfathomable to me given how much

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:19.320
better this run is than the last run but

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:20.550
maybe there's you know unseen synergies

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.170
in our last run that I didn't really

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:23.700
appreciate I guess our damage stat was

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:27.090
bad but we had little brim and little

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:32.360
brims worth a lot in in Isaac no

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:32.360
question just play it cool

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:45.020
grab yes worth two bombs absolutely in

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:45.020
this day and age

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:56.390
help play it cool don't go too slowly by

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:57.670
spirit arts whenever available and for

00:27:56.390 --> 00:28:01.010
you know we got to check the card

00:27:57.670 --> 00:28:02.210
strength is actually pretty solid here

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:03.830
we didn't get an item room on this floor

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:07.030
you know what so be it

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:10.160
everything banking time is like

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:11.960
extremely important for us because it

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.790
means that on the womb we can play

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.110
slower and if we play slower we're much

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:17.540
more likely to play carefully I'm

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:20.090
actually starting to see the win here

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:22.250
and the pacifier with even one extra

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:24.530
spirit heart helps out a lot as does

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:27.010
this room except apparently it turned

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:32.270
out to be garbage so what do I know well

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:35.480
know I will rarely beat myself up over

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:36.460
missing HP but that is that's a bad one

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:39.050
right there

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:40.780
who knows that one spirit heart could

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:44.030
have made all the difference

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:46.850
either way remember what did we say on

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:49.880
the last attempt here we needed on

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:51.440
average like five minutes for the for

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:55.160
the final stages of the game that the

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:57.140
two wound floors we're way way way sorry

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:59.870
I woke you up there Ruka with my hand

00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:02.090
clapping we're way way way ahead of

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:05.300
where we need to be there and the run is

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:06.620
better despite the the non little brim

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:12.410
the run is better

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:18.140
I see the wind we got the puck on our

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:22.580
stick right now admittedly like any form

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:25.370
of mapping would be reassuring blank

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:28.490
room I think you take it strength is

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:32.840
good but I think you got to take the

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:34.730
blank route and hope that it's a was or

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:37.010
something along these lines super unit

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:41.450
I'm fine with this being greed honestly

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:44.620
he'll die quick luck luck luck be a lady

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:44.620
tonight nothing okay

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:54.800
trying it could also be on Zeus on Zeus

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:56.540
would be a pretty solid get a woz is

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:58.040
only good if we get out like immediately

00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:01.340
on the next floor so we're gonna be

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:03.350
ahead of schedule and it's it's

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:06.140
predominantly gonna be our own skill

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:07.700
determining this I think unlike the last

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:11.150
one the last one we were in like real

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:13.220
tight I felt this one I feel a little

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:15.080
bit more like we've got control over it

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:17.030
we're also like in a much much better

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:19.970
position coming off the mom fight here

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:21.830
and we're gonna have another deal with

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:25.100
the devil for certain as well okay so

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:26.630
grab that that's tough dude that's it

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.370
that's a tough decision at this point in

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:30.080
the game but I'm gonna take Rawdon baby

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:33.530
and I understand you're probably

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:35.750
thinking there's a there's a case to be

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:36.950
made for getting down to permanent

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:38.300
polaroid invincibility and I don't

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:42.170
disagree this probably a case to be made

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:43.850
for rockin the nail it is on soos okay

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:46.730
so we know where we're going and this

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:48.560
has potentially saved us I mean without

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:54.050
overstating things it might have saved

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:55.670
the run we are not far from the boss but

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:57.380
I would have assumed that we were on the

00:30:55.670 --> 00:31:02.660
left just because I have a tendency to

00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:04.610
go left on my like floor finding

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:07.610
algorithm we got the dollar out of that

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:09.410
that's surprising and we still need that

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:14.210
for real platinum god anyway no tinted

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:17.720
rocks mr. Fred mr. Fred take care of the

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:21.400
riffraff on the sides and then get ready

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:21.400
to go for broke here

00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:32.870
Rawdon baby proving pretty and valuable

00:31:28.769 --> 00:31:32.870
here I think we're in a good spot I

00:31:33.289 --> 00:31:39.690
think I think there's a case Judas a

00:31:37.919 --> 00:31:41.730
shadow to double our damage if we die

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:43.260
right we have effectively the same

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:44.700
amount of HP right actually we have one

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:50.130
more total HP when you factor in the

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:53.600
respawn and if we end up winning on this

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:56.250
one this is not like a four out of ten

00:31:53.600 --> 00:32:00.090
that would come through with the win but

00:31:56.250 --> 00:32:01.889
it is like not a nine I think at least

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:06.330
my perspective it this is this is not a

00:32:01.889 --> 00:32:08.580
nine so if if we win on this I'm gonna

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:13.139
feel pretty darn good about myself to be

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:14.700
honest with you and I said the last

00:32:13.139 --> 00:32:17.250
video or two videos ago I didn't want to

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:20.370
go through you know these challenges in

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:21.929
five different videos if I got a restart

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:23.220
a couple of times to make it work in one

00:32:21.929 --> 00:32:24.809
and that's fine now that I've been hit

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:28.019
once though I'm like wait a minute dude

00:32:24.809 --> 00:32:29.399
you're super fragile here even after the

00:32:28.019 --> 00:32:31.289
respawn I mean that was tough right

00:32:29.399 --> 00:32:34.799
there but even after the respawn you're

00:32:31.289 --> 00:32:36.750
in a tight spot permanent polaroid

00:32:34.799 --> 00:32:38.100
invincibility is like a huge Saviour and

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.539
you could bomb your way through these

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:41.309
rooms although you don't have to right

00:32:39.539 --> 00:32:42.990
now and to be honest I'm usually pretty

00:32:41.309 --> 00:32:44.549
sloppy when I bomb my way through rooms

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:49.019
end up taking damage it shouldn't take a

00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:55.230
lot of the times so should hole up there

00:32:49.019 --> 00:32:56.700
I think beautiful once we got him in

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:59.820
line there was no chance there are no

00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:01.799
tinted rocks just bombs no tinted rocks

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:03.929
this room's a little tricky cuz

00:33:01.799 --> 00:33:06.690
effectively the range on anything that

00:33:03.929 --> 00:33:09.000
shoots bullets is like 20 times greater

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:11.190
than it otherwise would be on this

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.870
challenge no luck upgrades but every

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:14.669
room that we go through especially now

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:17.870
that we know we've conquered like a big

00:33:14.669 --> 00:33:21.630
dead-end every room that we go to is a

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:24.929
much much closer step towards the the

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:27.360
mom fight and the less HP we lose or the

00:33:24.929 --> 00:33:30.000
less HP we lose especially with zero the

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:32.299
happier we are as those moments coalesce

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.299
here

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:38.350
we are very very close there is a tinted

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:40.810
rock there I think we just won

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:42.430
what is that bump I think we just won

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:45.850
not necessarily because of the tinted

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:49.450
rock but the the math is just working

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:50.830
out for us right now probably with

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:53.700
permanent polaroid invincibility we

00:33:50.830 --> 00:34:00.340
could use the tower without it being a

00:33:53.700 --> 00:34:02.760
catastrophe but why would you ever

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:04.900
chance it I guess is what I'm gonna ask

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:06.850
well that's fine we got permanent polar

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:11.920
invincibility just get in there finish

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:14.770
the job we're good and the challenge is

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:17.140
done Itay I step away from the keyboard

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:18.670
get out of jail free card not bad not

00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:20.440
