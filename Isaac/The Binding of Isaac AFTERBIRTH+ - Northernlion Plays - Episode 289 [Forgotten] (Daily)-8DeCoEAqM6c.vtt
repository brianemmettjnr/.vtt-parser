##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.080
everybody welcome magnet land please

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.640
binding of issac after birth plus it's a

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.160
daily time yesterday we came to point

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.260
four four percent two hundred and

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.920
seventy seventh overall wait let me go

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.199
back to point four four percent 207

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.010
overall pretty good score with room for

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.189
improvement today

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.869
Eden run all the way to mega satan

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.460
scores are good today fifty four

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.300
thousand sixty five thousand on the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.550
front page

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.039
although the front page hasn't exactly

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.630
been a reasonable goal for us based on

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.430
recent performance but that's ok you

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.739
start with the nail and mom's knife is

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.780
too this is this is just even this is

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.760
two items it's just even I thought it

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.250
was like today's international I don't

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.969
know build build things day or something

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.899
with knives and nails I mean we don't

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.660
need to give you the seed you know

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.239
what's up here this is uh absurdly great

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.219
this run effectively I mean I don't want

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.719
to get your hopes up unnecessarily here

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.520
it should be conceivable to beat every

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.110
room on today's daily without ever

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.460
getting hit as a result of the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.159
ridiculous damage that we have but it is

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.350
the first run that I'm doing the day so

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.090
I don't know let's just use it as a good

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.890
opportunity to ease into things here as

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.689
always I open these episodes I'd like to

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.640
turn the lens of criticism inwards you

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.490
know I I'm an adult most of the time I

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.840
take responsibility for my own actions

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.579
every time I fart I say the same thing

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.530
if you can't do the crime don't do the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.780
time you know that's what I always say

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.729
I'm always giving up time and then I'm

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.140
like hey where's my crimes and they're

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.390
like we don't know if you can do it I've

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.740
already given you the time let's work

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.150
backwards and then they tell me NL

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.950
you're intentionally obfuscating the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.810
metaphor for the purposes of absurdity

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.490
and I say why are you calling me NL I'm

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.799
at the DMV that's not what it says on my

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:54.899
driver's license yet anyway so my basic

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.579
game plan here is just to take as little

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:02.880
damage as possible I think I worry a

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:05.460
little too much about the like but now

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.229
like minutia of a run I'm always like a

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.239
little if we do this we can save one

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.400
bomb like I just did for there or right

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.629
there for example tried to walk into

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.890
that to see if it could be the secret

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.350
room but I'm not sure if that's how

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.720
works there's three potential secret

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.370
room locations here which is there's two

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.819
potential secret room locations here

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.130
which is kind of absurd for a for a

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:30.660
first-floor

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:33.000
this one seems relatively likely well

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.590
tinted rocks are irrelevant a because

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.540
we're doing fine and B because we can

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.490
just crack them open with a nail any way

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.110
out case we found this one three more

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.610
sense gives us a crack at an arcade that

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.260
could be good what do I think is the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.510
actual way for us to improve our daily

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.370
score say it with me

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.630
don't lose focus late in the game stop

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.060
taking stupid damage but we've been

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.650
playing very consistently lately no no

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.250
ten out of ten dailies with no fives

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.260
either so we do probably want to go to

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.260
the curse room but our first priority is

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.489
definitely going to be making sure that

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.830
we get our deal with the devil here and

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.620
otherwise you know it's been good Isaac

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.980
in lately so there is a tinted rock I

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.780
was actually like starting to entertain

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.690
the thought and people going to be like

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.130
no please go back to that but no I'm

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.299
starting to entertain the thought like

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.070
am I done with Isaac the games been out

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.010
for a long time and if I'm playing so

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.739
badly maybe it's time I hang on my Isaac

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.180
boots which are really just whatever New

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.640
Balance sneakers I purchase most

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.239
recently and have not completely worn

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.030
out yet

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.470
oh god run for your life but no I feel

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.350
like I'm back in the groove now I really

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.820
do like this game is good for my mental

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.910
health which is a strange thing to say

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.760
about a game where you know you play as

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:52.170
a baby who's murdering his own mother

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.280
but no there's it's a let me put it this

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.329
way we don't live in the animal kingdom

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.820
right humans evolved in a state of

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:03.570
constant competition and you know

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:07.739
threats and blah blah blah video games

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:09.840
are a way to simulate that and it once

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.850
you give relatively good at them there's

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.680
a certain sense of satisfaction I think

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.989
that comes with like hey I can play this

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.769
game I can execute like a pattern that

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:22.740
my brain likes and understands and feel

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.720
like I'm you know simulating ripping a

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.580
saber-toothed Tigers Jaw or something

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.780
like that I look I'm not a not a

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.340
psychologist I don't know

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:34.020
the finer points this was our other 10 -

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.680
Drock yeah I just want smaller rock

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.910
basically that's also decent it feels as

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.230
they answer why people like crossword

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.540
puzzles you know I'm a creature of

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.320
routine a hundred percent you might have

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:49.290
noticed her in the fact that you know I

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.169
play a lot of the same games that speed

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.340
upgrade is actually very useful here

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.810
let's go for deal with the devil

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.000
president I have a feeling it's going to

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.190
be more valuable especially with our HP

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.660
gear being good and I don't really feel

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.010
like my day is started until I've

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.169
recorded the eyes of Daley and another

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.300
you know Isaac episodes after it's just

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:09.090
like my baseline for for feeling

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.530
productive I don't know how this video

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.150
turn into this within the first four

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.450
minutes here but you know all I'm

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.800
getting at is I understand the idea of

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.320
video games as having a therapeutic

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.940
influence because Isaac despite the fact

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.310
that sometimes the video videos go up

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.080
and people go like oh your item room

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.300
play gave me cancer I'm like well you

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.460
know what in the moment that realm was

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.419
very therapeutic after the fact and

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.419
50/50

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:37.890
okay the speed downgrade bad but we're

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:44.039
still at 1.7 so I'm not sweating it -

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:46.320
too much at the present moment in fact

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:50.880
we shouldn't sweat it at all 1.27 is

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.740
very very good sure why not you know for

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.910
cents and a spirit heart out of that

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.800
plays and too bad we might have missed

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.310
out on a sin - Drock but think that

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.169
basically does not matter much in the

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.289
whole scheme of things got a dime again

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.820
and the other thing by the way that

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:08.610
would really help us crank out better

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.410
daily scores would be finally like going

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.320
to the Academy

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.210
deep within the Nepalese mountains where

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.370
they teach you how to break the game you

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.710
know a lot of my contemporaries have

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.360
gotten their training with Shaolin Isaac

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.890
monks and they've figured out how to

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.660
break the game and it's only benefited

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.490
their daily scores perhaps eventually

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:33.830
the time will come for us to take that

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:36.030
plunge perhaps I want to charge so I can

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.169
crack open all these golden chests in

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.849
here is there a tinted rock in here this

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:40.860
is like the perfect room basically for

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:41.610
us to give something go in there 15

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:46.740
cents for the

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:49.379
candle it's a good purchase except we

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.569
have no need to use it right now the

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:53.629
nail is like you can definitely roll the

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:56.400
nail for the entirety of the game a

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:58.050
little silly we had to take damage there

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.270
but I mean we a little silly that we

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.340
chose to take damage there by way of our

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:05.969
actions again personal responsibility

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.800
but still deal with the devil wire coat

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:09.719
hanger very good even with moms knife

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.800
use your bomb to find the second secret

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:13.080
room nailed it

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.370
second secret room as a couple of dudes

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.599
that are up to no good and started

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:21.259
causing trouble in the neighborhood but

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:21.259
I like it because now crack into these

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:28.860
we just like rebalance our consumables

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:29.849
basically I think and I will play this

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.020
guy maybe we should have blown them up

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:34.229
for a better deal with the devil chance

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.610
but I didn't look for the second secret

00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:37.860
room until after we beat the deal with

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:39.990
the devil anyway so for right now this

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:41.639
is a pretty decent use of like the extra

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.669
money that we have left over from the

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:46.259
quarter and just you know miscellaneous

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:47.849
finding of it elsewhere we got plenty of

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:49.169
time like we're three and a half minutes

00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:51.300
ahead of schedule I don't want to spend

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:52.620
my whole lifetime here but we'll spend

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.379
some time and see what we can get out of

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:57.990
it we're going to play the blood bank

00:07:55.379 --> 00:08:00.750
anyway so it's a getting a little

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:08.940
ridiculous Butterbean just god-awful

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:11.250
item we can get some luck UPS Oh IV bag

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:13.620
okay I was really hoping it would be

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:16.379
blood bag of course but I'll accept IV

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.849
bag my new Lord and Savior and we're

00:08:16.379 --> 00:08:20.219
going to keep using the nail because the

00:08:17.849 --> 00:08:22.439
nail is better although the IV bag again

00:08:20.219 --> 00:08:25.979
is one of the necessary ingredients for

00:08:22.439 --> 00:08:27.419
breaking moon card out of here I took

00:08:25.979 --> 00:08:28.529
less than a minute so in the whole

00:08:27.419 --> 00:08:30.930
scheme of things that was pretty good

00:08:28.529 --> 00:08:33.000
and we'll just bounce we could use our

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:37.099
bag you know what we should do the mob

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.990
trap room we could use IV bag as well to

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:41.279
hurt us a little bit more and then take

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:45.920
the extra spirit hearts but I think the

00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:49.140
damage penalty might not quite be

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:51.070
compensated for by the rewards that we

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:55.600
would get

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:56.980
maybe maybe not the jury's still out by

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.930
which I mean there is a mathematical

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:03.780
answer but I'm too lazy to figure it out

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:07.900
and that's okay you know that's life

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:09.310
half of being wise is knowing that there

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:11.230
is a way to come up with an answer for

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:12.990
something but maybe the juice just ain't

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:16.180
worth the squeeze

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:18.730
like I'm not an accomplished programmer

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:21.100
necessarily and I wouldn't deign to give

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:22.690
that impression but I got asked a

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.270
question that I thought was really

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:26.440
thought-provoking on Twitter and

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:29.680
somebody said hey now that you've been

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:31.990
coding more often what do you find

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.990
yourself thinking more when people pitch

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:37.480
projects to you I could never do that or

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:39.070
I can do that but don't want to and the

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:43.750
answer is that both of those are

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:46.780
actually valid like when you don't know

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:48.880
how programming works you're just kind

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.680
of like I it's Facebook but like when

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.210
your dog puts his nose on the phone it

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.890
posts a selfie and you're like well that

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:55.330
might not actually be a good example of

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:57.940
I'm like I don't know if that's possible

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:59.620
I have the dog's nose be recognized by

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:02.620
like I have to touch you interface blah

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:05.590
blah blah so like you do now go well

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:06.940
that's not possible cute idea though but

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:09.250
then sometimes people are like you know

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:13.450
like Rob he's like I want to make a game

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:15.490
where you know you can be a mech pilot

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:17.950
and then the mechs have like all modular

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:20.410
mech parts that have like you know they

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:22.150
can shear off and you know be replaced

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.770
to have different effects and stuff like

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:26.010
that I'm like oh you can totally make

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:29.710
that what you have described is

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:31.330
basically object-oriented programming do

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:33.010
you want to do it no absolutely not it's

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.580
going to be a ton of work are you out of

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:36.310
your mind

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:37.630
it's you know if you can find someone to

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:39.640
do it more power to you it sounds like a

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:43.720
good idea I'd love to see it manifested

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:45.700
but no no sir that sounds like a it's a

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:48.610
mega project that the History Channel

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:54.270
would make a television program about

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:56.730
what's this what's this paralysis well

00:10:54.270 --> 00:11:00.060
there's no reason to take betrayal if we

00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:01.320
don't like it hopefully we can come back

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.839
in here and play this guy so I'm not

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:05.339
going to blow them up just yet now that

00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:09.140
we can fly we can grab that excuse me

00:11:05.339 --> 00:11:09.140
sir excuse me sir

00:11:09.529 --> 00:11:15.060
addicted huh I don't like the fact that

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.320
that took like a whole spirit are

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.610
because of addicted but now we can get

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.060
in here and crack this open as well I

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:23.130
might as well do that hmm I think the

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:26.670
honest like complete answer is you

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:28.080
probably find yourself saying I could be

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:30.779
part of a team that could do that but I

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:33.060
don't want to do that because you know

00:11:30.779 --> 00:11:37.350
start to value your time I guess a

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:38.880
little bit you know what's cool is the

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:40.200
Nick I don't know if you still watches

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.589
these eyes together so he's been doing

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:46.050
3d modeling nobody tell him this is a

00:11:43.589 --> 00:11:49.800
joke by the way but nobody tell him that

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:51.810
he is doing the hard work everyone when

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.180
you're like you know I'm learning how to

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:57.149
program people people who are unaware of

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:58.470
that like what that actually means look

00:11:57.149 --> 00:12:00.149
at you like you're some kind of arcane

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:01.920
wizard like all I could never do that

00:12:00.149 --> 00:12:07.170
you must have were you born with the

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:08.520
sign you're your jar stroke blessed you

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:11.070
with a baptism when you were younger

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:12.720
does just you know you learn a slightly

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:15.630
different way of problem-solving in a

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.339
unique set of languages to do it nick is

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:21.630
doing 3d modeling which actually

00:12:17.339 --> 00:12:23.670
requires a different kind of brain than

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:26.339
the one that I possess that's something

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:30.029
that genuinely I don't know that I would

00:12:26.339 --> 00:12:32.250
ever deign to attempt so it's cool that

00:12:30.029 --> 00:12:35.550
he's doing that now because now I can

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:38.010
give him inspiration and also have like

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:40.829
custom models and stuff to work with on

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:42.450
my silly little prototype projects I use

00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:48.089
two of diamonds I just realize I hit cue

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:50.640
by accident back there but it is okay so

00:12:48.089 --> 00:12:51.959
I was making like a crappy little skeet

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.579
shooting game prototype where you can

00:12:51.959 --> 00:12:55.290
walk around and you know press a button

00:12:53.579 --> 00:12:57.000
and then it shoots a clay pigeon up in

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:58.440
the air and then you can you know shoot

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.990
it by pointing at it with your gun and

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:03.520
press the buddies get a little too you

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:05.080
know my new shed but

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:08.440
apparently those are the two words of

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:09.880
the day today Dane and minutia huge

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.410
growth is probably better than I'm

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:16.210
drowsy but they're both you know they

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:18.070
got their uses SS balls of steel so yeah

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:21.220
hey Nick you know if you if you're ever

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:22.630
starved because you know when you're

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.590
when you're a hobby if sometimes dealing

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.970
I want to make something but I don't

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:26.770
know what you know it'd be nice to have

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.880
a motivating purpose and said you know

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:29.590
if you're ever bored you got nothing

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.530
else to do you can make me like a clay

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:34.810
pigeon model and if you're what you want

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:36.160
to see a magic trick if you're feeling

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:37.540
up to it you can make me like a gun

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.670
model or something like that and to his

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:42.070
credit he did it and then I immediately

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:44.380
botched it thank you egghead for saving

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.820
me from taking damage there I tried to

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:49.360
import it into unity and it just didn't

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:52.120
import properly so jury's still out on

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:55.600
whether or not I'm going to be able to

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:58.870
use that but in theory it was sweet dude

00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:05.320
black rune thank you egghead thank you

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:06.400
egghead you got to say thank you it's

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.500
getting a little silly but I think it

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.620
was worth it for succubus out of all

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:15.310
these dude black room of course even

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:16.990
better than huge growth all right head

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:19.350
down we can't really suck up a trail so

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:19.350
we're good to go

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:28.420
just keep going I mean we're on schedule

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:30.730
I would I mean normally I'd say we're

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:33.940
ahead of schedule considering the amount

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:35.860
of advantages we've got I'd say we're on

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.540
schedule we should be going a little

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.670
faster but we have eked out some

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:41.740
advantages as well that otherwise might

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:48.820
not have been accessible like who knows

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:52.300
how important that that two of diamonds

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:54.730
play in the sack of sacks might uh did

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:58.780
we have to I lost like a hundred points

00:14:54.730 --> 00:15:02.260
just right there in my defense if the

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:05.920
hand is already on the ground how am I

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:09.310
supposed to walk into it and then have

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.990
it pick us up it's already clasping you

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:12.250
know gravel or whatever this floor is

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:15.510
made out if it doesn't look anything

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:16.630
like gravel but it talks like linoleum

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:22.980
like

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:28.480
you remember when you were young okay I

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:33.220
didn't even see that enemy spill milk

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:35.080
you know it's not a good item but I

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:38.530
don't really want to use black rune on

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:42.610
it with just basic clubs potentially

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:44.860
viable but it's it's good after you get

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:48.220
hit and you know mom's knife probably

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:51.670
makes it a little less good but it still

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:53.380
exists you want to be out of here by 16

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:55.660
minutes so I think we do want to do the

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:57.550
forget-me-now like the the forget-me-now

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:59.410
is basically something you do if you

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:00.580
have the time or at least if you feel

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:02.200
like you have the certainty that you

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:10.150
have the time and I think that we

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:11.410
probably do this is going to be one of

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:13.810
those especially because today is a

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:18.190
Sunday so it's going to be one of those

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:19.060
dailies where it shouldn't be hard to

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:21.250
win

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:22.170
we should easily kill magazine with

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.670
mom's knife

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:26.950
okay damage that's probably going to get

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:28.960
better and you know empty the nail is

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:31.120
our space bar item you know we got all

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.920
sorts of huge advantages today because

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:36.010
of the player base today it'll probably

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:37.990
be a tougher daily to rank well in which

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:39.940
is where we hope that maybe you know the

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:41.770
average player that's good so I guess

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:43.900
maybe you know an above-average player

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:45.040
is going to look at this and go I'm not

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.570
going to do the forget-me-now because I

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:50.800
really can't afford to miss boss rush

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:52.000
and they will be right remember we need

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.170
to be out of the next floor within a

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.730
minute and a half so I'm not going to

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:58.840
the shop I'm just going straight to the

00:16:54.730 --> 00:17:00.130
forget-me-now here similarly some people

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.200
might have walked into that five room

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:05.890
and been like I've already done half of

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:08.319
this floor I'm not going to you know go

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:10.060
fight the boss just to get the maximal

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:11.350
value out of this and they could be

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:16.150
right as well I'm going to go for the

00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:18.310
gummi tree however you know we got

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:20.140
humbling bundle as a result of being a

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:21.430
little bit more diligent so humbling

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:23.140
bundle is one of those things that coral

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.820
a is extremely nicely with ranking well

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:26.680
so I'm pretty happy about that but we

00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:28.030
could have missed out on we got a

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.080
contract from below sorry but we could

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:30.160
have missed out on something like

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.260
humbling bundle from our

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:40.540
by not going there so it's all about the

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:41.950
compromises you you make in order to you

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.510
know get to that that final destination

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:43.990
you know we're all going to the same

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:45.940
place

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:50.920
final destination great movie by the way

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:54.510
if you've you heard of this one I think

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:56.590
about that sometimes because I fly like

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:59.590
fairly frequently not as much as I used

00:17:56.590 --> 00:18:01.540
to for all the stereotype of me you know

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:03.010
and this is going to sound like big

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:05.740
shotting it's not intended to be though

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:07.630
genuinely so the stereotype of like oh

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:11.680
it's a new month where you going on

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:14.260
vacation this month you know lately I've

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:16.960
refocused my working life around

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:18.520
spending more time at home not just to

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.770
spend more time with my family but to

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:22.450
make more videos do more streams because

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:25.060
I realized you know the best place for

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:26.530
me to be is sitting in my underwear of

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:28.480
recording videos and making streams

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:30.370
that's what makes me happy that's what I

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:33.010
like doing about the job and you know

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:36.970
just because a company is like hey want

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:39.220
to come out to Serbia and check out our

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:42.460
game you know three or four years ago

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:45.190
I'm like obviously how did the game look

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:48.220
ah you know it looks okay but free trip

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:49.960
to Serbia and that's not a joke like I

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:52.360
mean the Serbia thing never happened but

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:54.310
and most of the stuff that I've ended up

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:56.380
checking out for like media events was

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:59.110
pretty dope like going to paradox cons

00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:01.600
got me into playing those as grand

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:03.250
strategy games for certain uh we haven't

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.540
been to item room or shop we're gonna

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:06.880
have to compromise here at some point

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:08.110
but the older I get or at least the

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.510
longer I've been in the business the

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:13.360
more I'm like I really want I don't want

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:15.310
to spend my life doing that as cool as

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.490
it is I'm better off being back here but

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:20.620
anyway the whole point of this is that I

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:25.050
fly a lot and sometimes you know Kate

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:28.540
will be like what if like before we go

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:29.890
wherever we're going I have a dream that

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:33.580
the airplane is going to crash would you

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:35.110
still get on and I'm like yeah as long

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:36.910
as you're getting on I'm getting on and

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:38.110
if you're not getting on you know we'll

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:42.690
have a conversation about it to figure

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:48.350
out what's going on but I I'm

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:48.350
very unsupervised

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:55.170
as a logical person I feel like the odds

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:57.480
of the plane going down are no greater

00:19:55.170 --> 00:20:00.360
because they aren't any greater however

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:02.550
I really don't want to give you the

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.930
world's biggest I told you so

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:05.130
like if somebody was like hey I had a

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.630
dream that your plane was going to crash

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:09.330
don't get on it and I was like yeah

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:12.260
whatever you idiot and then you know the

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:14.910
plane went down they would be like I

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:16.740
told you so they would also be a god

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:22.560
like I would be empowering them to be a

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:25.170
god and I don't know how I feels about

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:27.540
that we got to go by the way we should

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:29.910
still be totally fine to make it here

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:32.910
but we're two minutes behind schedule so

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:34.620
just like really get a move on because

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:36.090
we want to do boss rush and hush as well

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.080
we need the other trinket just an

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:39.360
emperor card by chance

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:41.370
now the chariot black runs better use it

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.680
on boss fresh black runes bet they're

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:47.340
used Tombaugh stretch this is the sort

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:50.070
of funky towns music what happened to

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:54.080
argue oh because we we matured a heart

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:54.080
out of our existing hearts I see I see

00:20:54.350 --> 00:21:01.320
yeah you know I did seriously like

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:04.140
flying the vast majority of the time is

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:05.550
a very very normal experience although

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:07.260
you know I am conscious of the fact that

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:08.370
maybe like five percent of the people on

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.870
the airplane think that they're never

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:13.140
going to get off and I was one of them

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:15.390
for a while I got a sandwich um totally

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:17.630
my fault but still this damage is taking

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:22.410
its toll on me

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:24.840
uh the weirdest flight I ever had was

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:26.490
definitely the third time I was ever on

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.920
an airplane which makes this just that

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:31.410
much funnier but and it's not funny

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.070
because like the woman was very much

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:34.440
ljust

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:36.780
on Thursday was now we don't need a was

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:38.250
the woman was very much in distress but

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:40.170
like it was a short flight Toronto to

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:41.820
Chicago and we you know get on the

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:44.490
airplane hey see you later I'm going to

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:47.820
Korea for a year via Chicago like a

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:51.390
Wilco song and we get out like we're

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:54.360
about to take off and then this lady is

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:56.280
like hyperventilating in the flight

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.300
attendant is sitting down next

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.320
so we're like don't worry it's going to

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.640
be okay it's like an hour and a half

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.560
late we're just up and then we're there

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.600
basically and she's like no we have to

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:05.100
go back to the gate so bad I mean I

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.770
understand why I have to do it but it

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.330
was extremely annoying

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:11.760
then we taxi back to the gate and then

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:13.650
had to like unload her and then wait for

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:16.500
permission to take off again and it was

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:18.630
just like it was the whole thing

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:20.190
that's what I mean to suggest that's the

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:26.070
weirdest thing I've ever had happen on a

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:27.960
flight I have also experienced one if

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.770
there's a doctor on the flight please

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:33.360
let us know

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:36.630
I think somebody passed out I think you

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.260
probably go a host Hatford explosion

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:40.500
immunity

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:46.200
I don't know triple shots kind of funny

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:48.570
at least thankfully no emergency

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:50.880
landings some pretty rough landings

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:53.040
where I was like we're gonna we're going

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:55.890
to crash I'm not really like that

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:57.240
anymore thankfully you know even when

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:59.280
things like when Kate and I were coming

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:02.940
back from Japan it was like 10 hours of

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:04.830
mad turbulence not quite people like

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:09.510
crying and saying their prayers but like

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:11.400
pretty bad and occasionally it shakes

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:12.720
you out of your seat and like shocks you

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.790
a little bit but I was like nah dude

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:17.130
it's just fine it's just a little bumpy

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:19.350
mind you it's a little rich because I

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:21.960
find roller coasters on Pleasant ma'am

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:23.250
I'm on the airplane like nobody what you

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.920
doing start the next episode of Game of

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:28.020
Thrones we got a really got nine hours

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:30.150
this is a nine hour vacation you can

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:38.160
watch at least 10 episodes if we

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:39.810
maximize our time but I'm it's it's an

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.580
affliction you know flight anxiety I

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:44.850
understand it because I had it for a

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:48.410
long time just got over it thankfully

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:51.000
through overexposure basically just

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:53.130
being on airplanes enough to not be

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.340
scared of them that's why I like I kind

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:58.140
of rib Mathis cuz he keeps said you know

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:59.820
he travels more than I do I think at

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:02.750
this point because he's gone to all

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.750
these conventions and events

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:08.820
except for e3 this year I'm not you know

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:10.320
trying to talk down to him or anything

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:12.210
but like what's up with that buddy I

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:16.140
thought we had a good time last year but

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:18.540
I guess not but he's still like you know

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:22.500
before a flight he gets anxious about it

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:24.450
and I'm like you're gonna be fine man

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:29.130
how many times you you've been over the

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:31.560
Atlantic Ocean like like 10 times now

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:33.810
you got nothing to worry about man the

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:36.450
Atlantic Ocean is a baby ocean you know

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:38.490
there's so many places for you to land

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:39.870
if things go wrong you know there's any

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:42.960
chance of recovery you're fine you're

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:46.050
gonna land in like you know Bermuda or

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:49.710
you know the falkland Iowa that's in

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:51.210
Argentina what's what's the one maybe it

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:52.650
is the Falkland Islands the ones that

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:54.960
are in like the north of Scotland

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:56.400
it's just use it glide the green Linden

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:59.130
and live with the rest of your life and

00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:02.430
look you'd be fine dude you want a

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:06.540
harrowing cross fly over the Pacific

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:09.870
Ocean dude biggest ocean once you pass

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:12.420
Hawaii you know like just little tiny

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:14.940
islands out there that house the 10

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:16.340
meter runway once during the Second

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:18.900
World War

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:21.330
you got to divert around North Korea

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:22.470
like now that's a hair it was not even a

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:26.370
harrowing flight you know it's still a

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:28.410
routine but at the same time I rib

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:30.990
because I love not because I feel

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:32.670
superior to Mathis because I don't have

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:34.680
the same level of flight anxiety but

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:38.100
because I love I think we should black

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:39.600
roon Bob's rotten head we're going to do

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:43.860
that we should pick up everything else

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:48.180
here that we want to first we're gonna

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:52.470
lose like a lot of battery charges there

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:54.290
we go we go oh oh my god we got a fire

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:56.820
rate increase which is awesome but dude

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:58.380
you see the look at the fly rate

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.570
increases what I'm most concerned about

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:01.980
here

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:05.420
so you know if you and I think it's

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:07.800
applies to like a lot of things in life

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:09.390
there's there's a few different kinds of

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.890
it's going to start by saying there's a

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:12.390
few different breeds of people that

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:14.070
would have come across I think a little

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:15.090
incorrect you know there's a few

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:17.080
different kinds of people there are

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:18.910
people who are scared by almost nothing

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:20.580
I am envious but also at the same time

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:23.200
like something's wrong with your brain

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:24.520
you know how did how did your ancestors

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.110
live long enough without being like at

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.490
least a little afraid of some things

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:29.110
they should have been afraid of like

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:31.030
your you basically have won the genetic

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:37.570
lottery just by being alive right now if

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:38.980
you're a thrill seeker excuse me but I'm

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:41.110
not that kind of person and then there's

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:43.840
people who are like who will like always

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:45.190
be afraid of something and that's

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.570
something I'm not qualified to talk

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:48.310
about as well much like everything else

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:50.830
I talk about in these episodes like if

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:52.630
you have a genuine phobia of something

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:53.890
I'm not a psychologist I'm not gonna be

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:56.670
one of those guys like all you have

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:58.840
depression yeah I was sad once I just uh

00:26:56.670 --> 00:27:00.310
drank a glass of orange juice when I

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:02.670
felt better the next day just try to

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:04.830
keep your chin up you know this is

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:06.970
psychiatric and psychological

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:09.490
professionals for a reason that stuff is

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:13.600
mad demeaning if you're a person like me

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:16.540
who is like just worry I'm gonna say

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:19.420
worry something no it's just a person

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:21.210
who worries about things that are beyond

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:23.530
your control

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:25.800
don't sweat it too much and try not to

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:27.940
sweat it too much you're my people okay

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:30.520
I'm not going to take faiths reward I

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:31.930
don't think it's that good here if

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.640
you're afraid of flying

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:37.120
you'll probably get over it if you fly

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:38.290
enough my parents didn't fly for like

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.400
thirty years not because they were

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:41.950
afraid they just didn't have a good

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:44.920
reason to so he told me at least and

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:47.080
then my first flight was in like 2010

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:50.560
which is you know I was like 20 years of

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:53.620
22 years old late in the game right do I

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:55.840
want an orbital why not and that was

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:58.510
like their third or fourth flight and we

00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:01.330
were all scared we were all like flying

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:03.130
is not fun it's a it's a five-hour

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:05.080
roller coaster just to get to Las Vegas

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:08.500
a town I don't even like that much to

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:09.850
begin with what a ripoff and then you

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:12.570
know we've all flown enough now that

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:16.690
we've gotten over it so if we share a

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:19.180
meaningful genetic history

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:21.940
I've got hopes I got hope that you can

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:24.730
get over it just got to give it some

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:28.120
time there's no magic bullet for it

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:30.220
though sadly would have been sweet um

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:35.029
grab these

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:37.820
okey-dokey so we're gonna get our Cuba

00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:40.010
meet no deal with the devil

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:42.080
what else do we have to like leverage on

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:43.640
this run we are above average in terms

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:45.679
of where our points would normally be

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:48.260
you do get a nice bonus of course for

00:28:45.679 --> 00:28:51.409
beating mega satan as well and we like

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:52.880
will beat mega satan Loki I'm apparently

00:28:51.409 --> 00:28:56.570
the most boring idiot on the planet

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:59.240
because I'm actually stoked whenever I

00:28:56.570 --> 00:29:02.899
get a Bob's curse on a daily I'm like

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:03.590
five bombs endpoints an item we can take

00:29:02.899 --> 00:29:07.340
guilt-free

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:10.220
what a country well I think the big

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:15.289
thing for us is finding some way to be

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:18.590
safe against the hush like a nalgas room

00:29:15.289 --> 00:29:20.929
would be awesome because sadly by the

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:26.659
way like don't get your hopes up about

00:29:20.929 --> 00:29:27.799
Duffy seems unlikely less likely

00:29:26.659 --> 00:29:30.100
although we do have a good chance here I

00:29:27.799 --> 00:29:32.299
would take ship to loop here actually

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:34.490
although our damage isn't that amazing

00:29:32.299 --> 00:29:38.179
maybe ship the loop well we're going to

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:41.510
have a choice like the thing is the nail

00:29:38.179 --> 00:29:42.830
is so good for survival and also it

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:44.270
gives us some points when we use it

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:46.100
because it gives us a spear at our when

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:48.230
we use it but okay that's getting a

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.760
little ridiculous now I would say we

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:51.740
have almost no chance to become cubby

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:55.630
but shoopdawhoop is going to be a really

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:55.630
nice way to hit enemies from afar I

00:29:55.750 --> 00:30:01.340
don't know I kind of like it but our

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.750
damage stat isn't that impressive it's

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:04.610
the fact that we have mom's knife that's

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:09.799
doing good work for us I think we should

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:15.110
also well I have no internal convictions

00:30:09.799 --> 00:30:16.850
about this it's kind of a mean to take

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:20.809
the left hand in situations where it's

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:22.490
not it doesn't belong but I don't think

00:30:20.809 --> 00:30:24.880
it's a bad idea to take the left hand

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:27.080
down to the blue womb we cost ourselves

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:29.450
well may I mean bookable Isles

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:33.230
specifically might be better now for the

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:37.410
hush fight we get to use it more often

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:43.400
as well but what I mean to say is

00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:43.400
our four red chests really worse than

00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:50.820
four golden chests we need to guppy

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.710
items so we're probably not going to get

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:54.600
to Goffe items out of four red chests

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:55.980
but we could and what are we hoping to

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.820
get out of golden chests you know we

00:30:55.980 --> 00:31:00.360
don't need fate

00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:04.020
we don't need consumables of almost any

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:06.539
kind should explore everything that we

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:09.450
can explore here maybe we're better off

00:31:06.539 --> 00:31:14.100
like certainly I will get rid of this

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:15.390
before the dark room because we don't

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.470
want to get red chests on the dark room

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:17.970
they're the only chests that aren't

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:23.850
guaranteed on the dark room to pay out

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:26.070
with an item I think the value

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:27.750
proposition might be decent enough this

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:32.610
would be an awesome time to get a guppy

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:34.260
item by the way let's get out of here

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:39.000
alright I'm ready to move on I think

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:41.700
here I do even though I haven't used it

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.500
at all yet big book of Belial is the

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.150
right choice just to get us through that

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:48.710
hush fight as quickly as possible mega

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:51.090
Satan is like a joke compared to

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:57.419
compared to what the hush fight is going

00:31:51.090 --> 00:32:00.860
to be like so it's going to be a fast

00:31:57.419 --> 00:32:03.120
finish here and we played pretty well

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:04.289
mild room for improvement but pretty

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:06.360
well so that's Krampus is head we don't

00:32:04.289 --> 00:32:11.640
care we're down to the next floor were

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:15.390
going to be in the thirty somewhere 33

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:16.740
not bad we kept the left hand well we

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:18.360
got an item but it wasn't the item we

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:22.409
wanted so what about the pills full

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:26.220
health paralysis and burp into a full

00:32:22.409 --> 00:32:29.789
health pill they keep giving me good

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:33.720
choice oh it's a double tinted rock it's

00:32:29.789 --> 00:32:38.940
also a ghost ball I'm gonna have to

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:40.830
think about that trinket smelter why not

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:42.570
what kind of person would I be if I

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:45.140
didn't smell two trinkets I smell to the

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:45.140
left handy

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:54.430
it's a mistake it's a mistake okay so I

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:57.940
think actually what you do you take the

00:32:54.430 --> 00:33:00.580
passive here now we can learn from our

00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:03.370
earlier daily that the right course of

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:05.890
action here is to do the entire floor

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:07.270
like let's just assume the hush fight is

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:08.440
over and we win because we're going to

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:15.210
win we might take some damage in the

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:19.980
process so you go to the you go to Sheol

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:23.500
you beat Sheol you go to the land and

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:25.870
you do everything on that floor then you

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:29.860
fight mega Satan then you press the

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:34.900
spacebar to use forget-me-now and you go

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:37.210
to town on the floor one more time this

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:39.460
is why you know when you when you make a

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:43.780
mistake in a productive way you should

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:46.540
never be too upset unless it's like you

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:48.310
know catastrophic but don't sweat the

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:50.470
small stuff and most of its small stuff

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:52.600
it's all small stuff that's just

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:55.180
disingenuous isn't it you know some of

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:56.500
it is very large stuff they might they

00:33:55.180 --> 00:34:00.250
might cover that in the book I don't

00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:01.720
know I haven't read it just read the

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:03.130
CliffsNotes it's right there on the

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:04.750
front page don't sweat the small stuff

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:07.140
it's all small stuff hey I never thought

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:07.140
of it that way

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:13.960
but maybe like two weeks ago we had a

00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:15.700
daily where I was just one week ago I

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:19.390
think we had a daily where we got

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:21.130
forget-me-now on the chest or it might

00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:22.330
have been on the dark room and I said no

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:24.790
we're not going to do it because I don't

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:27.940
think you can fight mega Satan I think

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:31.120
your key piece or your full key gets

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:32.919
used up when you open the door for the

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:35.230
first time and it's Invicta was like nah

00:34:32.919 --> 00:34:38.890
dude you can definitely get saved us

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:40.330
there you can definitely fight a mega

00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:42.520
satan twice I don't know if you get

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:43.780
double the bonus but or at least even if

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:45.400
you don't fight them twice you get the

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:47.320
bonus for having fought him once and

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:48.820
killed him and then you can do the whole

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:54.280
floor over again and get an extra few

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:55.179
thousand points so I think that this is

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.650
the right call

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:59.840
but don't accidentally use the forget me

00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:01.790
now full help I'm full helpful helpful

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:05.900
full health or full health you know as

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:09.050
many good options there so yes we're

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:10.160
going straight down got to be fifty five

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:15.050
thousand to be on the front page

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:18.110
unlikely plausible plausible but

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:20.870
unlikely so again we smelted the left

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:22.160
hand this is where we're going to start

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:25.550
to find out whether or not it's

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:26.870
plausible that that's going to pay out

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:28.790
with Duffy I mean we'll get a lot of

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:32.120
read chests not because of the left hand

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:34.250
only but because of the fact that those

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:36.860
are all full health again because of the

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:39.350
fact that we're going to do the lam

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:42.020
floor twice I guess we'll keep full

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:43.550
health I've decided that out of the

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:44.510
three full health pills full health is

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:49.790
probably the one that we should roll

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:57.260
with even though it provides us with

00:35:49.790 --> 00:36:00.230
like literally no benefits I would love

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:02.030
like a straight up and algae's room be a

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:03.800
good get actually balls of steel is

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:06.740
appropriate as well all right don't

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:08.320
worry roll mile run please all right

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:11.390
they want to reroll my whole run as

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:13.490
always that was pretty dumb of me but as

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:17.390
always on dailies I think I reserve the

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:18.740
right to not reroll my whole run if it's

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:21.950
been going well or if it's been going

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:25.070
badly for that matter like I these are

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:28.370
runs in which I take more owners it's

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:30.020
the only time I ever get to compete and

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:32.000
that's important for me because I have a

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:35.210
bit of a competitive streak it comes out

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.470
on the NL s s sometimes admittedly or in

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:38.390
the battlegrounds videos when

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:40.010
everybody's freaking talking to me out

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:41.690
did they already died I'll go over here

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:42.020
go okay but this is not the time nor the

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:45.490
place

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:45.490
I don't want HP Rios

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:52.999
comes out on the analysis sometimes

00:36:50.779 --> 00:36:55.759
admittedly and the other thing is you

00:36:52.999 --> 00:36:57.380
got to accept I'm pretty easygoing when

00:36:55.759 --> 00:36:58.999
it comes to comments you know I'm not

00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:00.019
like old you know somebody yelled at me

00:36:58.999 --> 00:37:02.539
on the internet it's gonna ruin my whole

00:37:00.019 --> 00:37:04.099
day he's not anymore and my event is

00:37:02.539 --> 00:37:12.380
time at some point in the distant past

00:37:04.099 --> 00:37:14.450
but no longer but still I sometimes I

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:17.900
read the comments like a rag Don people

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:20.150
go nice you know win NL but why did you

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:22.940
do this you're stupid idiot the dailies

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:26.329
are here so that conceptually for me I

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:28.430
know like hey it's 75 people ragging on

00:37:26.329 --> 00:37:29.650
me on today's daily but I came in 50th

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:32.180
so what gives

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:34.130
you know those who can't do teach I

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:36.229
don't believe that expression but if I

00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:43.999
may use it temporarily for a roast than

00:37:36.229 --> 00:37:45.710
I will so specifically we did say stop

00:37:43.999 --> 00:37:47.089
taking damage towards the end of the run

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:49.849
that's the best thing you can

00:37:47.089 --> 00:37:54.589
conceivably do to maximize your chances

00:37:49.849 --> 00:37:56.150
without going of course the the camel

00:37:54.589 --> 00:38:00.769
Taj or whatever the heck Doctor Strange

00:37:56.150 --> 00:38:04.910
went to to get trained in the in the

00:38:00.769 --> 00:38:07.539
arts of breaking the game I'm going to

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:10.190
be straight with you I had no idea what

00:38:07.539 --> 00:38:12.469
we would actually get out of a Pandora's

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:13.940
Box on the dark room or sorry on Sheol

00:38:12.469 --> 00:38:15.489
it's kind of a fringe case doesn't

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:21.619
happen all that often

00:38:15.489 --> 00:38:26.749
it's a fringe case it's a French kkc not

00:38:21.619 --> 00:38:29.599
a French case that's some Lynette - that

00:38:26.749 --> 00:38:31.160
is like I'm not a fluent French speaker

00:38:29.599 --> 00:38:34.160
as you can probably gather from my

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:35.890
accent Arriba however I think I might

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:38.569
have just made a pun in another language

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:42.130
it's probably not called Ana pash it's

00:38:38.569 --> 00:38:42.130
probably called anitha Shay but still

00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:49.130
you know what I got a no I got a no I'm

00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:51.019
not going to reroll the whole run every

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:52.910
time I've ever rear old the whole run on

00:38:51.019 --> 00:38:56.440
a daily maybe not every time but most

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:59.450
times it has led to disaster and despair

00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:00.589
so we're just gonna leave I wanted to

00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:01.580
see if those are got the item because I

00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:09.110
had to know

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:11.150
oh wait what but what am I forgive me

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:20.960
now go I didn't have it when I what

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:29.840
oh I'm sorry Ruka I left it and we

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:32.540
became Guffey I left it in the in the

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:35.120
curse room Wow

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:37.670
what an idiot okay so what do you do now

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:40.250
well I'm disappointed but not like

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:42.410
extremely so I did give up an obvious

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:43.850
chance at getting a really really good

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:46.880
score but you know hopefully we can

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:49.250
still persevere here what and this is

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:51.020
why I should be streaming dailies man so

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:53.410
that I could glance over a chat and shad

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:58.040
will be like hey you idiot go back and

00:39:53.410 --> 00:40:00.650
you know get that freaking forget me now

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:03.710
that you sacrifice like a few pretty

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:07.160
great spacebar items to hold oh well

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:12.380
life goes on might be in the low 50s

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:14.060
today it's not bad but it's the shadow

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:15.770
of what it could have been by low

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:17.540
fifties I don't mean like low low ranked

00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:21.140
fifties will probably be in like a 200

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:23.120
to 300 s but low 50 thousands though I

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:25.160
think is not outside of the realm of

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:27.860
possibility High Priestess trained card

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:29.690
you have to give this role you take the

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:30.950
strength card because I'd rather have

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:34.550
damage than permanent polaroid

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:39.170
invincibility on the on the mega satan

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:40.640
fight a nalgas would be different

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:43.630
because we could probably kill mega

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.630
satan in one algae's

00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:51.940
there's a non sous room that's

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:55.350
completely different moon card it up

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:57.820
don't really want to fight you guys

00:40:55.350 --> 00:41:01.810
killed you in two seconds though so no

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:04.960
big deal well is like a monkey's paw

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:08.530
situation you know we made good use of

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:11.680
the left hand surprisingly and yet find

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:13.740
ourselves looking like the fools with

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:16.120
our pants on the ground nonetheless and

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:21.250
actually the left hand might be screwing

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:24.130
us up a bit but in theory it did also

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:26.050
give us the Guffey dream so I'm not

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:29.140
worried about those guys what I am

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:31.330
worried about is getting through here in

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:33.940
a reasonable time frame now on sousta

00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:37.000
moon I don't understand why it said

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:38.950
we're getting so many sacks that payout

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:43.350
with exactly the same combination of

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:43.350
consumables right down to the actual

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:49.240
like the the value of the card itself

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:51.250
like we had one run we were getting

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:52.990
exact we got chaos card and something

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:54.730
else out of like three or four sacks in

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:57.300
a row is getting to the point of

00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:57.300
ridiculousness

00:42:03.509 --> 00:42:13.269
this is spades also not relevant we have

00:42:11.019 --> 00:42:17.829
99 so I think we're okay in that

00:42:13.269 --> 00:42:18.549
department on soos again well I mean it

00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:19.960
is what it is

00:42:18.549 --> 00:42:21.819
we're going to beat mega Satan fairly

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:24.670
handily we're not gonna I don't think we

00:42:21.819 --> 00:42:28.690
get 9999 for beating mega Satan because

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:31.900
we already got the earlier bonuses again

00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:34.749
I'm not in charge of determining how the

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:36.789
points are scored in after birth plus if

00:42:34.749 --> 00:42:39.729
I were you would get a bonus for

00:42:36.789 --> 00:42:43.660
fighting delirium and more of you would

00:42:39.729 --> 00:42:45.519
probably dislike me to be honest so we

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:46.839
should count our blessings and we're in

00:42:45.519 --> 00:42:48.460
a position where we can just be in the

00:42:46.839 --> 00:42:50.920
peanut gallery and be like well why do

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:51.970
they do it this way where instead you

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:53.739
know when you actually got some

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:56.700
halves in the decision-making process

00:42:53.739 --> 00:42:58.259
that's where it becomes annoying man

00:42:56.700 --> 00:43:00.609
you've actually got like

00:42:58.259 --> 00:43:03.309
responsibilities and repercussions for

00:43:00.609 --> 00:43:07.239
your actions it's why YouTube is great I

00:43:03.309 --> 00:43:09.450
can just you know talk crap face no

00:43:07.239 --> 00:43:09.450
consequences

00:43:12.839 --> 00:43:17.400
so obviously the stopwatch

00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:33.990
is a great pickup here yeah I'm thinking

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:39.360
maybe like 48 to 50 1000 is where I see

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:42.060
myself finishing this run a great score

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:43.380
but relatively low compared to what it

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:45.840
could have been especially considering

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:48.420
we beat this whole floor in like under 3

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:49.650
or 4 minutes so if we had just had to

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:53.700
forget me now it's not like it even

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:57.600
would have been a big ask she had a

00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:59.640
great ask that's what happens when you

00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:01.800
know you ask why you entered a business

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:04.890
arrangement with the company down the

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:06.570
street they had a great ask 175 is way

00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:08.910
better than it should have been but I'll

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:10.500
survive we could have been top hundred

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:11.700
though for sure another consistent score

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:12.630
for now though thanks for watching I

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.680
hope you enjoyed the episode if you did

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:14.640
