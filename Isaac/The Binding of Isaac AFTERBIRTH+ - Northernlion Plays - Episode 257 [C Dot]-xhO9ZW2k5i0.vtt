##

00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.090
everybody ultimate on the line please

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.290
binding of issac afterbirth plots we got

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.269
a win streak of minus two which is

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:15.630
extremely deserving Lots random roll and

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:21.750
it's not Ana's able rap like flossing

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:23.250
nh4 jf my name is Jeff peeve FV I'm

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.609
Leslie the test

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.699
okay don't ya alright let's stop that I

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.880
know you got to unlock the edge online

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.770
MBA plus how long does it take though

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.040
there you go so now I'm leaving skype

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.850
messages we're in the midst of a little

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:46.649
bit of an early docket planning today

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:48.620
resume game let's go um yeah it's a loss

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.899
also the loss doesn't intimidate me

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.719
maybe it should but I don't think that

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.070
it should as long as we don't completely

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.190
capitulate early we should be fine

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.570
honestly and people in the last

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.489
non-daily that when i probably thought I

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.890
was you know blowing smoke with this but

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.520
it's actually more fragile to be as asel

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.560
early

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:16.259
sorry not as able that's ridiculous it's

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:23.030
more fragile to be Judas early than it

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:27.600
is to be the lost the lost has like way

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:34.829
way way too much resiliency to be

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:37.070
concerned about early death we should be

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.070
fine

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.200
we've got to get to this item room first

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.510
though and now I've accidentally started

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.910
an argument on skype about whether it's

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.960
good to leave online functionality

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.430
locked behind single player game content

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.280
in order to ensure a certain level of

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.009
proficiency in the single player game

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.270
content when you get online ie shouldn't

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.310
Madden force you to play like one

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.390
exhibition game offline to go online so

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.880
that you're not trashed when you get

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.959
there in my opinion no but at the same

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.910
time I am a streamer who wants to

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.130
download the game boot it up and have it

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:18.440
live within two seconds because you know

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:24.890
doing prep work that sort of thing isn't

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:27.560
my bag baby here I actually am in at the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.959
close skype though it's a pretty freakin

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.340
- glass ok I brought it on myself a

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.660
brought it on myself it's important to

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.660
remember it's important to remember

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:43.660
let's go all right heads in the game

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.660
nothing to worry about

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:49.700
eager to get something from this item

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.040
room hey here's something that's

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.709
important to keep a note by the way last

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.530
time we had a loss run we might have

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:03.470
been so strong that we still have Isaac

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:07.280
based highway blindness ie ibh B

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.019
actually I'll take it for the super

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.970
bummed chance but ie

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:16.459
we might have been so strong that I

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.660
don't play appropriately on this run

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.709
because I feel like I'm stronger than I

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.620
actually am it's like a little bit

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.590
dunning-kruger effect but for the law

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.750
specifically so that's we are going to

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.850
do here is light Larry jr. who isn't

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.739
that was for Larry juniors eye that's

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.019
fine for Larry juniors is not like

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:40.250
outrageous or maybe three Larry juniors

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.959
to normal size one really long but when

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.730
I first walked into that room it was

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.269
like an upside-down Tetris board and

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.820
despair so I'm happy that turns out it's

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.430
maybe not as problematic as it

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.989
originally

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.390
appeared but it's okay Larry jr. he is

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.609
no problem how many times we had to

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.219
fight this guy first you know hundreds

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:05.909
at the very least at this point we want

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:07.620
damage not HP damage not HP utilities

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:12.299
fine too but there's better damage items

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.760
on bosses you've got me reeling from

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.560
that one that's okay though you know

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.669
just one extra item to get deep forward

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.720
if the situation warrants it

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.539
kirsta the lost is effectively

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.060
completely irrelevant as long as we

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:32.070
don't accidentally go to too many rooms

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:34.110
that pose risk this is the like this is

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.910
what I live for on lost runs is the

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.560
second floor deal with the devil knowing

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.660
everything's going to be free it's

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.639
really the dice roll you should with

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.440
holy mantle even with 0 HP you have a

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.150
great chance to live to this point on an

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.349
average run even if you don't get

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:51.060
anything else useful not to you no shame

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:53.310
you I mean did you see how many is asel

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.260
runs I lost earned the Judas runs I lost

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.400
I just did in as asel daily which is why

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.320
I'm constantly getting them confused

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:04.190
here ok goodbye d4 and the hello huge

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:08.580
stat upgrade from dim bulb and then also

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:10.110
Guppies head and then also closing in on

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.330
the Gumpy transformation but also

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.180
Guppies head is a pretty useful item to

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:21.720
begin with so feeling pretty stoked

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:22.889
about this we do have a bomb now so we

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:27.960
should blow this up and hope for small

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:30.060
rock 2 bombs that's ok two bombs honey

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.680
do you see that up in the sky well

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.690
that's nothing it's just a little prick

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:41.250
I can't let my mini-me get sick in the

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:45.150
cold harshness of space it's from Austin

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:46.530
Powers to The Spy Who shagged me as

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.880
opposed to all the other Austin Powers

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:56.970
two's dude we have great stats when dim

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:59.219
bulb is active it's actually like a

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.840
market increase the fact that we get to

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:04.110
luck out of it is just the icing on the

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.360
cake really I think the eternal heart

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.729
for no reason we did have the chance to

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.880
buy a broken modem I don't understand

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:14.190
the value proposition of that item

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.389
that's a different thing than saying I

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.130
don't think it has a good value

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:18.389
proposition I really just don't

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.979
understand it but anyway what I was

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:21.840
going to say before we got got these

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:24.779
pods I go B's head and got sort of

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.699
sidetracked here is that this is where

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:28.550
you're rolling the dice is this first

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:31.110
floor second floor deal with the devil

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.639
you get Krampus if you haven't gotten

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.150
anything else up to that point which no

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:38.580
longer describes us stand an okay chance

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.710
to die there's not a whole lot you can

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.840
do about that except dodge really well

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.699
and you know predict what kind of shot

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.830
Krampus is going to shoot maybe you got

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:49.260
some bombs you can use to you know close

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.180
the gap or you could have what happened

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.860
to us on our last run and you could get

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:56.360
three guppy items and because deals with

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:58.560
the devil are always free as the lost

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.510
you know you're pretty much unstoppable

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.889
from that point onwards we only need to

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:03.210
guppy items this time so it should

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:07.080
definitely be doable

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:12.360
PJ's is no statistical change for us

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:14.969
because we can't accrue spirit hearts

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.560
speed downgrade is largely irrelevant

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:20.820
let's get out of here

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:22.430
I'm happy with dark matter but and to be

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:28.800
honest with you I'm happy with the

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:32.370
multi-dimensional baby as well but it is

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:36.630
fair to say that maybe a little

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:39.510
underwhelmed it's very strange we have

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:41.849
fought no other rooms of combat between

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:48.779
two boss fights that doesn't happen very

00:07:41.849 --> 00:07:50.669
often basically you had to go that was

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:52.050
extremely scary so now we got eyes on

00:07:50.669 --> 00:07:55.979
this guy so we don't have to worry as

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:58.529
much as long as we know where he is he's

00:07:55.979 --> 00:08:01.800
easy to combat okay so this is also good

00:07:58.529 --> 00:08:04.529
at tiers upgrade is very nice no Krampus

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.659
please no Krampus okay so we got mob the

00:08:04.529 --> 00:08:08.220
void and we got a little brim both of

00:08:06.659 --> 00:08:09.810
these are good they synergize with each

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:12.240
other and mob the void is a damage

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:14.099
upgrade we don't really want the demon

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:17.340
hearts but the ability to deal extra

00:08:14.099 --> 00:08:19.169
damage as a result is pretty good as a

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:21.090
result of having my Lavoie - okay sure

00:08:19.169 --> 00:08:22.349
you know at this point I don't think we

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:24.240
need to go for any of those other items

00:08:22.349 --> 00:08:28.319
you can take curse of the tower by the

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:31.650
way there's kind of no reason not to

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:34.169
take the curse of the tower because if

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:36.390
we've taken damage we've already lost

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:37.650
unless we come back as you know you're

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:41.189
just a shadow or lives or it's or

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:44.699
something what makes you larger you know

00:08:41.189 --> 00:08:47.910
it's irrelevant people tell me that I

00:08:44.699 --> 00:08:50.339
under 8:1 makes you larger which not not

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:51.510
people as if it's like a large swath of

00:08:50.339 --> 00:08:54.300
the population but I've had people be

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:55.470
like you really under 8:1 makes you

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.699
larger doesn't actually increase the

00:08:55.470 --> 00:09:00.260
size of your hitbox it just makes the

00:08:56.699 --> 00:09:03.060
model larger there's no positive to that

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:07.170
maybe it's not quite as bad mechanically

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:09.540
as I've made it out to be but it really

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:14.430
possesses no benefit to the best of my

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:16.170
knowledge and beyond that even if it

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:20.490
doesn't adjust your hip box which I

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:23.790
believe that it doesn't it does lead to

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:25.949
some confusion just visually about where

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:31.890
your hitbox in your hip box actually

00:09:25.949 --> 00:09:33.000
resides 2020 dude oh I find most items

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:36.480
are better if you actually pick them up

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.110
but we're uh we're crushing it here this

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.110
is awesome

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:44.100
let's get the heck out of town I would

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.570
like to get a speed upgrade because even

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:49.079
with I mean I know we took a speed

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:50.940
downgrade pill but even with our dimple

00:09:49.079 --> 00:09:56.850
being active like almost all the time

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:59.250
it's not that fast 1.38 speed is low

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:05.970
enough to be like I would like to change

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:09.180
that so we really did strike gold on

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:10.440
this guppies head pick up early it's one

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.630
of the best space bar items in the game

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.889
pretty much full stop and then you know

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.389
combine that with the fact that we have

00:10:13.889 --> 00:10:16.920
dim bulb which means that we're going to

00:10:15.389 --> 00:10:22.230
get the stat bonus from dim bulb

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:25.230
constantly I figured you check it like

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:26.339
unless we walk into a fire or something

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:30.000
at the end of this room we should be

00:10:26.339 --> 00:10:33.810
completely fine so what would I love to

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.110
see now straight up you know car battery

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:40.410
dude that's lovely six flies instead of

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:44.010
the one what I would love to see is goat

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:46.529
head selfishly you know getting free

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:48.899
deals with the devil all the time would

00:10:46.529 --> 00:10:50.880
be really really nice probably very

00:10:48.899 --> 00:10:54.180
useful great chance to turn us into

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:56.790
guppy guppy is I mean we six flies per

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:59.160
room is enough to not need guppy for fly

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:00.180
generation but it's always nice beyond

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.630
that

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:06.620
nine lives is essentially an instant

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.620
game-winner for us

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:17.260
and the question is do we want to go

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:23.590
into our curse room here the odds of us

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:25.240
getting hit are so low and the odds of

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:27.850
becoming guppy as a result to go into

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:31.870
that curse room are pretty good we got

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:32.500
to try it even like as I said I've got

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.180
to try it

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:38.760
in my head I was like you don't have to

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:43.390
try it well the algae's room is nice

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:44.980
could also just leave ya hold blank rune

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:46.390
and as the loss it's kind of an

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:51.090
interesting proposition isn't it because

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:54.430
we could use the blank rune to become

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:57.250
algae's maybe not the right way to

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:59.190
describe that I'm excited it's pretty

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:02.830
bad but yellow and with this many flies

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:03.730
I'm excited about I'm excited I'm

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:07.060
excited because it gives us the

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:12.550
opportunity to show over worth bear con

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:14.730
oh that's a that's the gods I can't

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.730
remember

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:24.580
probably a secret room something's wrong

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:29.800
one up okay one up is really really

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:32.890
really nice any kind of life that can

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:37.240
bring you back from the brink it's

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:42.820
valuable on a run like this hey don't

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:44.140
get any big ideas mister but ya blank

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:46.270
currents kind of a shot in the dark but

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.770
it's not like we really needed the what

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:50.200
infinity bombs that was our other

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:56.110
options two of bombs used late in the

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:57.970
game fairly inconsequential but what

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.250
would be very consequential is a deal

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:01.630
with the devil which we did not get

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:04.690
however life goes on we're way ahead of

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:06.250
schedule boss rush is a possibility if

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:10.690
that has like dark Judas or something on

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:12.610
it I'm lovin life this is another very

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:15.910
winnable lost run and it's true that the

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:17.800
lost you know not what it used to be in

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:20.670
terms of like difficulty I think what

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:24.280
has changed with the lost rebalancing is

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:26.410
admittedly achievements getting a a

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:28.360
million and one percent and all the

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:30.730
other you know whatever God achievements

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:33.280
that's fine though you know I think that

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:36.570
I would sacrifice bragging rights for

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:41.590
like I beated on the old version of lost

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:43.300
before I would sacrifice the lost being

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:45.430
like an actually viable and interesting

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:47.620
character the loss is one of my favorite

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:50.200
characters to play as because you really

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:56.200
can never have a run especially early

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:57.400
where you feel completely safe so thanks

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.530
for the one-up and that was a great

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.480
example of what I was talking about

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:04.360
which is why I was why I brought it up

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:06.190
there is because uh you know as I just

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:09.690
said you can never be completely safe so

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:12.760
we're going to hold the chaos card

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:14.470
and God for that one up dude go and

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:16.300
thank God for that one because Jacob's

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:18.040
Ladder is the sickest there is did I say

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:20.320
it's the sickest there is I said it's

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:24.029
the sickest there is you definitely want

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.029
to hide mine as well it's worth the cost

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:32.470
so we should be crushing in now we don't

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:34.690
want the battery because we don't care

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:37.350
we never want to store a battery charge

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:39.970
thanks to dim bulb so I mean okay you

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:41.410
brain it needs you to chill out here a

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:44.980
little bit you're making some very very

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:46.420
bad place do not walk into a mimic you

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:49.779
could have been hit on that room and

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:51.130
just not realize it you got to slow your

00:14:49.779 --> 00:14:53.200
roll with respect to that I actually

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:54.760
feel like I've been carried on this run

00:14:53.200 --> 00:15:01.270
which is fairly obvious but I think I've

00:14:54.760 --> 00:15:03.370
played somewhat badly so the general

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:05.560
game plan here in my opinion first off

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:08.490
great name for like a defensive line

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:13.170
coach in the NFL general gameplan but

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:16.200
secondly is to use the chaos card as

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:21.940
late as possible without it

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:24.550
dying with us effectively so in a manner

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:28.270
of speaking what I'm effectively getting

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:30.190
at is if we go to the hush fight this is

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:31.899
the right thing to use on hush if we

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:34.480
don't we probably want to try to save it

00:15:31.899 --> 00:15:38.730
for blue baby or Isaac little Loki is

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:43.480
fine your car battery hivemind

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:46.899
Guppies paw that was close Plus sack of

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:49.180
sacks is actually killing it like this

00:15:46.899 --> 00:15:53.020
is we have more flies than I would ever

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:54.910
expect from not being guppy yet I find

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.620
myself somewhat less confident that

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:58.360
maybe I should be mostly because of the

00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:00.850
fact that I continue to take damage

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.660
that's completely ok it's completely

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:04.920
unnecessary

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:06.730
due to hazards that there's just no

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:09.850
there's no good

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:12.550
Isak case to be made for taking this

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:15.540
hazardous damage willy-nilly and I'm the

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:20.010
guy who's always talking about morale I

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:20.010
don't think morale factors into this

00:16:21.009 --> 00:16:25.339
you got to take it you got to take it no

00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:29.029
cursed by monsters - you don't

00:16:25.339 --> 00:16:32.589
in hindsight have to take it it turns

00:16:29.029 --> 00:16:32.589
out that you did not have to take that

00:16:34.449 --> 00:16:40.519
the one thing that's bad about chaos is

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:42.259
that it's not get-out-of-jail-free which

00:16:40.519 --> 00:16:46.999
means that it is effectively not a

00:16:42.259 --> 00:16:50.769
teleport card if we take damage early on

00:16:46.999 --> 00:16:53.899
a boss fight could sink us

00:16:50.769 --> 00:16:57.679
probably won't but it only has to sink

00:16:53.899 --> 00:17:02.839
us once you know for things to go real

00:16:57.679 --> 00:17:04.279
badly continuing to get every single

00:17:02.839 --> 00:17:06.230
sack that we come across you know you're

00:17:04.279 --> 00:17:08.089
going to find me being not super

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:10.640
diligent about every consumable but

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:12.199
really really diligent about the sacks

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.120
because the battery charges that come

00:17:12.199 --> 00:17:16.250
out of those I mean as far as I'm

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:19.309
concerned six flies is one free room so

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:22.970
every room we're almost generating one

00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:24.980
free room I did Oh peeler might kill us

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:27.559
or maybe we can use a infinity number of

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:31.090
times I'm not ready to end the video

00:17:27.559 --> 00:17:31.090
here to find out one way or the other

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:41.330
great fight with curse of the unknown

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:43.520
there's no way I'm doing Bob's rush had

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:44.990
a feeling we might see Krampus grandpa's

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.539
has given us head of Krampus it's a

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:51.890
fairly useless item for us right now

00:17:47.539 --> 00:17:53.840
because guppies head is so good instead

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:56.390
we'll head down to the next floor as you

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:59.210
might expect don't get your hopes up

00:17:56.390 --> 00:18:04.690
about a delirium kill here however this

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:04.690
might be the rare lost + hush combo

00:18:05.799 --> 00:18:12.289
simply because the only thing we have to

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:14.720
do to kill hush is kill the first phase

00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:16.419
and then land the the chaos shot if we

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:21.159
missed the chaos shot we will like

00:18:16.419 --> 00:18:21.159
almost the 100% definitely die

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:27.940
come on battery charges battery charges

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:32.980
help us build the economy here don't

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:35.560
want that the fly economy I'm to be

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:38.200
honest with you I think it matters more

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:39.640
than the actual economy I'm talking

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:46.750
about the economy not just a you know

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:48.510
Canada but of planet Earth was the

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:51.730
economy ever done for us

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:55.050
hey here's a free car courtesy you the

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:55.050
economy I don't think so

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:02.890
you know what the economy does give us

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:04.390
though is like a great excuse and also

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:05.890
an easy punchline if we can't think of

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:12.400
another way to end a joke in this

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:14.760
economy ha ha ha adults ha ha ha ha I'll

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:17.530
joke about the economy ha ha

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:21.420
with interest rates the way they are I

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:24.420
should be giving this to you ha ha ha ha

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:24.420
adulthood

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:32.370
if my throat felt better I would go into

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:37.290
full-blown like maniacal laughter I'm

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:41.880
going to resist but just imagine that I

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:43.200
didn't give me the credit for it so I

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:46.490
was thinking the bends into the shop

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:51.660
last week and they said no floor mats

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:53.370
that'll be a million dollars oh let's we

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:56.610
put it on my tube

00:19:53.370 --> 00:20:03.420
I don't know what that voice is but I

00:19:56.610 --> 00:20:07.940
like it still got chaos what do you

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:11.640
think you think I think we should ooh

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:14.190
so hilariously we totally should have

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:16.770
taken curse to the tower that we didn't

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:19.500
get it later now in the hole Ashton

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:22.140
Kutcher butterfly effect universe might

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:23.910
not have made like any difference at all

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:25.950
we might have just gotten nothing out of

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:29.730
that chest instead of bombs rather

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:32.550
rather than something of a potential

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:35.910
value but it's still we would have

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:43.350
gotten something different and that does

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:46.230
matter our fly economy is screwed man by

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:46.650
the way why not take a left-hand dim

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:50.280
bulb

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:53.820
is so good we actually it's a great run

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:57.770
don't get me wrong but dim bulb is

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:57.770
providing a lot of that greatness

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:03.600
sincerely I mean the curse room again I

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:06.570
tell you what I'll see what I get from

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:09.420
the boss fight like if I get a deal with

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:11.100
the devil for example and then I'll go

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:13.320
see if the curse room matters

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:15.270
it could have two Goffe items in it

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.830
admittedly but I don't like narrative

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:18.660
that the cursor room doesn't contain a

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:20.520
risk I think it's actually one of the

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:22.080
riskiest runs or one of the riskiest

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:24.360
rooms I should say for us to go into

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:26.750
because there's guaranteed one damage on

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.750
the way out

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:30.760
or at least it's guaranteed to take away

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:34.210
holy mantle on the way out is what I

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:37.210
mean to suggest there but we got to be

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:39.820
mom first are we going to fight hush and

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:41.890
right now I don't see a good reason not

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:45.850
to we should be able to beat the first

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:47.590
phase of hush without getting hit no

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:51.040
deal with the devil means no curse room

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:54.280
and we do have 99 cents and plenty of

00:21:51.040 --> 00:22:00.340
keys so I feel like you definitely want

00:21:54.280 --> 00:22:01.540
to pursue this Avenue and we'll go we'll

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.890
open everything because there's no

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:07.570
reason not to that could give us more

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:09.400
sax then can give us nothing but jerk we

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:14.230
definitely do not want thunder thighs so

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:18.990
we'll go little haunts we definitely do

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:18.990
want proptosis so we'll go proptosis I

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:26.790
don't think we care about mama mega we

00:22:22.059 --> 00:22:26.790
sort of care about the pockets maybe but

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:34.900
we should donate a lot as well the thing

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:36.340
with Mama mega is what are we trying to

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:38.429
do with it we're paying a 15 cents for

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:44.980
nothing

00:22:38.429 --> 00:22:49.630
it will do a little bit of damage to to

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:54.220
the first phase of the hush aka actually

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:56.650
completely meaningless so don't get hit

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:59.320
during the first phase we can still win

00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:05.980
after getting hit in the first phase it

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:09.510
would be better not to though dusted and

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:12.250
then the moneymaker

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:13.630
we did get proptosis as a result of

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:15.700
coming down here so I think that this

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:19.740
was worth it but a little bit on the

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.740
like not that amazing side for sure

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:30.679
well that's not fair proptosis is like

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:34.340
really good so I drove Benza to the

00:23:30.679 --> 00:23:39.080
dealership the other day so proptosis

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:39.950
what is this college to come home in

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.350
this economy

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:44.649
okay let's mean we should get that we're

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:48.440
going to have to get it so using money

00:23:44.649 --> 00:23:54.440
let's go next best card straight up is

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:59.330
the Emperor if we can impure or we will

00:23:54.440 --> 00:24:03.889
oh you should check those like I get too

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:05.960
lazy here um if we can Emperor we let's

00:24:03.889 --> 00:24:09.980
say that our odds of winning the run go

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:13.340
up by probably like 90 percent of

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:14.899
whatever chance we have to fail so if we

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:18.730
got a 90 percent chance to succeed right

00:24:14.899 --> 00:24:21.799
now I'd say Emperor takes us to 99

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:25.299
we got an 80% chance that say Emperor

00:24:21.799 --> 00:24:25.299
takes us to 98

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:31.100
I hope I said chance to succeed instead

00:24:29.809 --> 00:24:33.020
of chance to fail there otherwise the

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:35.000
analogy was constructed backwards

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:36.980
because you know why we get to skip all

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.130
the rooms like that one that can

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:43.280
actually hurt us rooms with you know

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:48.289
these stupid vaginal bomb flies who kick

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:49.970
the crap out of you explode in your face

00:24:48.289 --> 00:24:50.559
without you even knowing you know what's

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:55.760
coming

00:24:50.559 --> 00:24:57.559
chariot card actually extremely good if

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:00.250
we get hit we're going to want to pop

00:24:57.559 --> 00:25:04.340
that chariot right away and came out a

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:06.830
phrasing easy boss fight' though the

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:08.750
guy's irrelevant so we'll just use it

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:11.809
and head down to the next floor this is

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:14.299
going to be like a 23 minute long boss

00:25:11.809 --> 00:25:16.159
rush or as I not bother I should win

00:25:14.299 --> 00:25:18.340
that's amazing if it's a win and we're

00:25:16.159 --> 00:25:24.820
going to take all these for certain

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:28.610
leech is okay crooked penny well mom's I

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:31.030
pyro it doesn't double empty chests

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:31.030
anymore

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:41.290
but with three luck I got high hopes

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:45.030
this is actually an extremely dumb idea

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:45.030
remember we're not generating flies

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:54.190
Guppies paw or go fishing every time we

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:57.760
should have tried to dobble it Guppies

00:25:54.190 --> 00:26:00.130
head is the only fly generator and all

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:04.150
of a sudden we also have 0.58 speed

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:05.860
right now so it's pretty horrible but we

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:16.320
have these chariot cards

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:20.740
I think sure - a closed chariot chariot

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:21.850
that's pretty good now we get rid of

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:25.860
this forever

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:29.740
guillotine mutant spider spawn benda

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:32.080
spelunker hat now we go with Guppies paw

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:35.500
which is actually Guppies head as I've

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:38.500
stated a million times accidentally it

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:43.180
got us some items I don't know if I love

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:49.030
them I might I mean the homing shot quad

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:50.680
shot pretty good selection guillotine

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:54.100
scares me a little bit as I think it

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:57.070
should scare you as well but seems like

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:58.360
pretty great right I don't even want to

00:26:57.070 --> 00:27:00.100
know what that was the fact that it gave

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:02.860
me a speed upgrade right off the bat is

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:05.640
all I need to know it's all I need to

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:07.360
say that that was an incredibly good yet

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:14.380
keep moving

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:16.750
keep breathing keep breathing and no I

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:19.510
know I'll I don't care steam sales fine

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:21.690
that's crooked penny so we got to give

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:24.580
it up the crooked penny I mean we did

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:27.280
not as a result of it but while having

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:30.190
it we did get a speed downgrade which is

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:33.780
pretty bad especially when we've already

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:33.780
gotten the speed downgrade but

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:41.650
we also picked up some pretty solid

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:46.240
items as a result of its existence I

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:48.780
think we're just going to win here which

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:52.450
is pretty amazing

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:53.620
it was a 24-minute lost run thanks for

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:55.090
watching I feel like I'm back in the

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:56.320
saddle even though they did it easily

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.760
for me there for now thanks for watching

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.049
