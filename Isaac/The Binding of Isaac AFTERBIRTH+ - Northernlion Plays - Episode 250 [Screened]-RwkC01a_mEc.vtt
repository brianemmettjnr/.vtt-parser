##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.659
hey everybody welcome back to on the

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.950
lion place the bunny once again triplets

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.600
are doing a daily today let's not even

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.510
think about yesterday's we drank like

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.330
300 it's okay but it's not that good

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.020
obviously today is Eve to Mom's foot but

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:21.630
there are scores from 30th to first on

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:24.420
greed but 37 thousand to 51,000 which

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:30.920
means that mulch just get started with

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:34.680
here which means that we should have a

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.270
seam what we must have a seam even to

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.149
get to 37,000 which is not a

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.489
particularly high score for you know

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.770
it's static it's not a particularly high

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.090
score unless you remember that you know

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.710
this one's only supposed to be in like

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.379
the nineteen thousands depending on how

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.860
well it goes as as Eve to begin with I

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.160
just wish start I swear to God I swear

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.680
to god you can confirm it for yourselves

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.859
I start record in the episode there's no

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.629
skype messages two seconds later I get a

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.280
Skype message one says come play player

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.229
unknowns battlegrounds I wish I could I

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.320
wish I could I love Isaac as well though

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.960
I finally found two games I can play for

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.689
the duration of my entire life now I

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.990
would really like if somehow I could get

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:26.520
this guy over to this area like I need

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.659
him to get here and then blow up I'll be

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.100
the first to tell you this is an

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:35.430
unnecessary play in fact it's actually

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.740
just very stupid if he touches us we

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.650
lose big time but you know what we sort

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.430
of worked out there Abel I'll take small

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.950
rock I'll take I don't think we had to

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.829
do that play in order for it to work out

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.570
for us but we got it regardless that's a

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.030
great opportunity to use our bomb and

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.439
honestly it gives us a huge leg up on

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.479
the competition what we need now is the

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.070
spirit heart and if we get a spirit

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.079
heart then we can use the razor blade we

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.759
can use the razor blade to get down into

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.710
that permanent whore Babylon state and

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.860
then we'll have excellent damage here

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.129
early on but perhaps more than worrying

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.270
about the actual you know quality of the

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.470
run right now I should be worried about

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.900
as quickly as possible

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.810
finding a seam because that is really

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.930
what has thrown us under the bus on the

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.150
past few dailies is an inability to find

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.250
a seam no coincidence that the daily on

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.900
which we rank the best in the past three

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.300
days is the only one of the three days

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.960
that didn't have us having to look for

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.220
some other way forward so doesn't mean

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.510
that the dailies are bad they've

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.430
actually been pretty good recently

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.610
relative to how they were for like a

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.100
three week period in April but it does

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.160
mean that I have been doing a bad job of

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.420
I don't want to say prioritizing looking

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.730
for seams because to the best of my

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.920
knowledge it's not like I had a you know

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.390
in a wazoo and I threw it away by being

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.240
an idiot or something like that I think

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.410
I've just I have not found the seams so

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:05.820
it's up to us to make up for that

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:09.690
if 1.03 speed oh that's the good stuff

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:12.360
okay it's actually bad that we didn't

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.950
pick up the relic earlier because we

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.510
could have gotten a spirit art on this

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.030
floor which would have allowed us to use

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.810
the razor blade faster but in the end it

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.550
probably doesn't matter all that much so

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.050
as long as we can go through this the

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.760
first three or four rooms to the next

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.280
floor without getting hit life will be

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.910
good and we'll be a happy camper so what

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.970
does that mean

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:36.330
you're not you're crazy in the coconut

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.310
though it means like don't uh since yes

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.780
you're right it's frontier psychologist

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.040
it means don't use your orbital yet

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.570
there will come a time when that orbiter

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.709
will be useful there is a Isaac

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.450
subreddit thread that's not the way

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.660
people talk about bread there was a

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.560
thread on the Isaac subreddit recently

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.330
it was what do you think is the most

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.830
underrated item or trinket in the game

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.450
you know what has a most amount of

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.070
upvotes

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.780
Cuba meat now it's weird because you

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.670
can't really have a popularity contest

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.680
about something being underrated it kind

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.049
of taints the results implicitly I think

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.030
but still I think that there is some

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.040
truth to that even if you know is it the

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.040
most underrated I don't know what is how

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.709
do you determine what's the most

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.539
underrated is the most underrated thing

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.220
the thing that's rated lowest but is

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.780
actually good the thing that isn't

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.910
respected is the best but is actually

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.130
better than expected or the item

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.880
with the largest gulf between perceived

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.990
value and actual value you know they

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.540
were getting into some questions that

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.600
are honestly probably irrelevant given

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.520
the scope of these videos but I agree

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.940
though for all of the pedant Ignace that

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:49.650
i brought up of all advantages cube meat

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.630
they're very good I actually thought

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.880
that that crime meant that we had been

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.070
hit so of course you know

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.530
eva's bird foot which is actually dead

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.600
bird not that great of an item but a

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.860
nice little value add for situations in

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.720
which we've got you know nothing better

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.210
to take advantage of here we will take

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.190
mom's heels and you've got to take

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.510
succubus that leaves those permanently

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.650
in the Whore of Babylon state we don't

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:16.290
care about we don't care about the other

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.300
option there which was headless baby

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.350
it's okay but without getting any HP

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.520
upgrades early on it's just not worth

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.110
concerning ourselves with but what is

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.590
worth considering ourselves with is this

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.540
room right here dreams situation for us

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.820
take zero damage get a spirit art from

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:36.060
the relic and you know maybe grab

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:39.660
Guppies head but also get a key or at

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:46.550
least some valuable consumables ie not

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:51.540
pennies from this other chest let's see

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:53.100
well spirit heart bomb two pills and a

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.200
key in a bomb okay so we could afford a

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.940
bombs a key if it happens it happens the

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.260
speed down is largely irrelevant puberty

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.730
is actually a good pill in spite of the

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.390
fact that it makes the bad pill sound

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:05.880
and gods flesh is okay now we can start

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:08.280
to talk about maybe looking for a secret

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.680
room and it could be either of these

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.790
locations I think you check this one

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:16.770
first because you're getting a penny out

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:21.480
of it and that indeed worked out we

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:22.890
can't really get anything extra here so

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.960
we're going to take our other bomb I

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:27.510
don't believe there was a tinted rock

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:31.680
but we should check quickly because more

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:33.390
spirit outs would be nice if we don't

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.010
find a tinted rock which I expect that

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.950
we will not we should be looking for a

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.450
second secret room but a second secret

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.600
room seems like it's going to be earlier

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.160
in the level so I'm actually

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.190
is going to leave and save our existing

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.440
bomb now I wouldn't say that we have fit

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.900
the bill perfectly today like I don't

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.360
think we've had a perfect run so far but

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.640
I think we have had a nearly perfect run

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.110
we got hit once on famine and I don't

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.480
believe we could have conceivably left

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:00.160
any consumables like you know the eihwaz

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:05.350
rune or something like that behind so

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:08.670
I'm relatively unconcerned all but that

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:11.470
was bad with our existing situation

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:14.410
triple-a battery is so much better than

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:16.450
the faded Polaroid despite the fact that

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:19.120
it's literally useless with the razor

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:21.910
that I find myself not even wanting to

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.100
take the faded Polaroid just in case we

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:26.020
get a better spacebar item later you

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:30.460
know I wouldn't want to forget but this

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:32.200
is a very strange room to the best of my

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:35.460
memory I have not seen that one or at

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:39.160
least not seen it regularly enough to

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:41.530
conceptualize it what makes you small is

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.970
completely okay but it's really nice to

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.950
have the relic in case you weren't

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:46.450
already you know well aware that this is

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.280
one of the better defensive items in the

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:50.020
game it gives us the ability to have a

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.270
certain certainty when we take pills

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.130
that we are not going to die which

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.960
doesn't always are not not going to

00:07:54.130 --> 00:08:00.940
inhibit ourselves so much the death is a

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:03.190
plausible outcome it's like having a

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:06.250
pension or something you know a pension

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:08.290
is all that was bad you might say I know

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.910
what a pension is I got roasted first in

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.620
a player unknown battlegrounds video I

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.060
asked an honest-to-god question to

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.350
better myself I said what is an

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.330
insurance deductible

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:18.130
I got roasted on Twitter people were

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.880
like what's it like living in Canada not

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.460
having her know what an insurance

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.350
deductible do we have car insurance we

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.600
have a home insurance we just you know

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:28.500
even we do have medical insurance you

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.610
just tend you know not to have it I

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.560
didn't know what a deductible wasn't

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:35.169
been lucky enough to never have to pay a

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.520
deductible in my life I asked an honest

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:38.010
to god quest this is why people are

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.300
afraid to ask questions you ever wonder

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.860
how you get to the point where someone

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.140
who's 28 years old doesn't know what an

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.820
insurance deductible is because they saw

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.760
somebody else to ask a stupid question

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:50.020
and get laughed at and then they decided

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.600
hey that's not going to be me I'd rather

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:54.060
save face

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.520
so we did earn a deal with the devil we

00:08:54.060 --> 00:09:00.750
shouldn't have gotten statistically

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:03.630
speaking and we got a pentagram out of

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.620
it which is a great item that was pretty

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:07.410
bad though

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:09.180
it's a great item that carries a little

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:11.070
bit of risk just because of the HP that

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.670
we gave up to get it but the idea is

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:17.610
that by the relic we should be

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:19.320
completely absent the fear of death but

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:21.120
obviously that's not exactly the case

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:24.840
and some of the damage that I've taken

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:29.250
has been quite poor so far I think we

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:30.840
got to check the curse room though not

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.910
always will that work out but obviously

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.800
in that situation it did and we can't go

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:38.250
to our item rooms which is always a

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.900
bummer so when they go do the same thing

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:41.820
we did last time and try to eke out

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.920
every conceivable advantage that might

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:45.540
have a key a bomb for a secret room

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.550
exploration bonus and three pennies is

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.020
okay and then you look for honestly a

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:52.140
second secret room at this point you

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:53.610
can't even do the mob trap room to get a

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.680
key because it requires the key to do

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.630
the mob trap room so instead we throw a

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.550
bomb down here give you like 80% odds

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:03.180
that's the second secret room and it is

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:03.780
we get six red chests spirit heart two

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:07.380
spiders

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:10.560
spirit heart two spiders is it just two

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:13.500
red chests triple two bombs it's not too

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:15.600
red chests tripled so no guffy items is

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:17.790
a bummer and honestly two spirit hearts

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.280
out of six red chest is a low payout but

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:22.740
two spirit arts for one bomb is a good

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:26.940
payout plus we got the exploration bonus

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:29.460
as mentioned many many times but what's

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:35.780
the problem with this run say with me if

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:38.400
you see it we don't have any seam yet

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:41.970
that's gonna get the job done

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:44.970
excuse me now without a seam that's a

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:46.950
key thank you we did leave triple-a

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.060
battery behind by the way which time

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.400
will tell if that was a terrible

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.990
decision I mean it's not like faded

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.820
Polaroid is doing anything for us either

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:56.250
so we might have been better off just

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.570
sticking with the you know the trinket

00:10:56.250 --> 00:11:00.630
that's strictly better despite not

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:02.010
having an immediate use but we have

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:05.070
bigger fish to fry right now and the

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:08.399
bigger fish to fry are obviously

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:13.680
related to the lack of a seam here the

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:17.009
ultimate like failsafe NASA style you

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:18.990
know avoiding a blown-out oring sort of

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:21.779
richard fineman failsafe that we need

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:23.819
here is get to the depths to with a

00:11:21.779 --> 00:11:27.000
teleport card that allows us to do boss

00:11:23.819 --> 00:11:29.250
rush then after we finished boss rush if

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.660
there's a self-sacrifice room on the

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:35.880
depths - we can still teleport out and

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:37.800
get both of the available advantages and

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:42.089
really if our damage ends up being

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:44.790
amazing we're going to love that boss

00:11:42.089 --> 00:11:48.360
rush because we'll take fairly little

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:54.029
damage probably and gain a lot of HP

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:56.100
hopefully as a result of the relic I'm

00:11:54.029 --> 00:11:57.240
completely fine with this boss rush

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.040
although our sorry with that boss fight

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.170
although would have preferred not to

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.540
take damage and the speed upgrade is

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:07.980
also fine I mean 1.5 is all we're ever

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:09.240
going to need got more exploration to do

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:11.610
on this floor though for once there's

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:13.230
like really no rush we could be as far

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:16.589
as three minutes ahead of schedule right

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:18.420
now depending on how much time we want

00:12:16.589 --> 00:12:23.190
to spend on this floor and really that's

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:25.769
enough time per throw room per throw

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:28.079
rune I think I overthink it from time to

00:12:25.769 --> 00:12:30.510
time I think probably the best time to

00:12:28.079 --> 00:12:33.329
use the per throw rune is whenever it

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:44.040
seems like you should use the per throw

00:12:33.329 --> 00:12:46.769
room so yes every trinket has uses

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.810
sometimes that's probably the first time

00:12:46.769 --> 00:12:51.120
we have actually used super magnet to

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:54.149
accomplish anything in like 300 episodes

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:55.889
but hey you know an extra seven cents

00:12:54.149 --> 00:12:57.510
we're never going to be able to spend it

00:12:55.889 --> 00:13:02.130
apparently but maybe we should have

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:06.620
played the got a try if we should have

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:08.970
played the blood bank but whatever so

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:10.560
instead of the razor blade we have how

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:11.610
to jump it's always a tough call and you

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.310
get something like this because you have

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:17.850
an item that is not useful for you right

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:18.510
now in the form of razor blade but that

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:21.090
could be

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:23.160
pivotal Yule pivotal to your performance

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:25.020
overall if we manage to get a lot of HP

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:28.590
upgrades which is something that has you

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:31.470
know a history of happening and then you

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:33.870
got how to jump which is a good item we

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:36.090
at least want to pick it up if only

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:39.360
temporarily to work towards that

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:45.090
bookworm transformation but I tend not

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:50.010
to use it that effectively so on a daily

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:51.330
you know what other time do you go with

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:53.760
something in your wheelhouse you know

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:56.220
the streak runs and the random and even

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.780
runs those are auditions and the daily

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.950
is the real deal so I think we stick

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:02.460
with what we're most comfortable with

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:04.740
here for now we finally got to go to our

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:06.660
shop by the way that looks like my face

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:08.130
from that you have been tweeting and

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.900
non-stop lately we're gonna take fanny

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:14.190
pack I think that's good we're going to

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:17.370
take this we are not going to take we

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:18.630
don't need the we don't need the spirit

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.980
heart I think as well but we're not

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:22.200
going to take momma mega and it's

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.700
because we don't need it if we miss boss

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.980
fresh we deserve what we get at this

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.540
point basically none of these look like

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:31.350
secret rooms which is a little confusing

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:34.890
for me so we might but a second secret

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:37.170
room is so valuable I mean to say viable

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:42.360
but that's fine so valuable because of

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:44.850
the possibility that it contains five

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:50.940
runes one of which could be a was all

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:52.530
that that bums me out dude I guess we're

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.720
just out of here

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:59.210
and again basically like right on

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:59.210
schedule so I'm okay with it but

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.620
wouldn't mind

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:08.210
improving on the loose they'll get a

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.920
couple of floors or we can get seams we

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:12.470
could blow up skulls the wafer is a

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:14.660
lovely item at the worst of times or the

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:16.400
best of times when you will run pretty

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.840
much single-handedly so I got a little

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.760
rattled on that last floor but I'm

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:24.830
looking at it now and I'm like for what

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:26.360
for what purpose there's no reason we

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:31.250
got the relic we got the mitre we got

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:33.010
the jazz we got the Jazz I don't want to

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:36.920
go through the whole ramp but you know

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:39.200
competition for fifo comes sideways I

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:43.090
think the competition it must come

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:48.140
straightaway been a while

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:50.960
either way plus we have succubus and

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:55.100
succubus is like the ultimate set it and

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:56.540
forget it item it just kills at least of

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:59.000
your damages above a certain point it

00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:01.700
basically kills every enemy to begin

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.470
with it's a magic bullet for us here and

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:06.460
I'm not talking about the infomercial

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:09.710
blender that actually works surprisingly

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:13.550
what happened there so weird rooms dude

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:17.480
okay I don't know what to say about that

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:19.880
one so this is actually important we

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.620
need okay we if we have 24 cents don't

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.700
buy that then use a bomb here don't

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.010
accidentally blow up the rear old

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:27.380
machine this is a big moment for us you

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:29.660
grab ventricle razor I do also want

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:32.090
mom's key and then we grab this it's a

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:35.660
joker card that's good so what's the

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:38.900
game plan here dude it's actually so

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:41.900
simple we can use ventricle razor as a

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:44.060
teleport on demand so we want to use

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:45.590
this by the way stepping on both of

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:49.520
those spikes will go down as my greatest

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:52.760
regret however now we can at least get

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:55.490
out of the boss trap room which is

00:16:52.760 --> 00:17:00.620
extremely important getting out of the

00:16:55.490 --> 00:17:02.600
boss trap room guarantees me the ability

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:05.709
to go to a self-sacrifice room if there

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:09.459
is a self-sacrifice room on the womb so

00:17:05.709 --> 00:17:09.459
our sorry on the deaths

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:20.020
this guy's going too fast I'm going to

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:22.780
need you to stop okay still on time we

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:25.360
do want the luck upgrade and the HP but

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:27.940
then we can trade away the HP and you

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:29.950
got to go shovel and you got to you got

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:32.020
to go both really and they're going to

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:35.260
cost us the same so ventricle raiser

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:37.240
turns out it wasn't really useful for us

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:39.280
at all however the shovel is extremely

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:43.480
useful for us it's a reusable ventricle

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:45.330
raiser let's go I think we're doing

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:47.770
things right here I know that we could

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:52.570
explore more of this floor I want to

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:56.590
make sure we make it to the we make it

00:17:52.570 --> 00:18:00.220
to the boss rush here so I'm going to do

00:17:56.590 --> 00:18:02.590
things this way we probably will not

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:05.950
need a self-sacrifice room on this floor

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:10.000
we could wait until later I have to say

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:16.360
as well we might be pretty lucky to have

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:19.390
gotten this scene if you didn't buy the

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:23.620
Joker card you probably would not have

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:25.210
gotten the shovel is the shovel the only

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:28.500
way that you can move forward on this

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:31.630
run at this point past a past boss rush

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:33.460
maybe not you could have just gotten

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:35.680
ventricle raiser that's a speed

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:38.890
downgrade by the way but I accepted for

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:45.310
the damage upgrade that it contains as

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:46.420
well we should do these rooms like what

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:53.140
are you waiting on here we got plenty of

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:54.460
time now yes it might be the only way

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:55.900
through it might not be the only way

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:57.910
through I don't know it doesn't matter

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:59.650
really I'm saving my charge by the way

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:00.700
because the only thing that matters it

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:02.080
doesn't matter if we get a charge

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.880
outside right now unless we get a

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:08.830
teleport card the most important thing

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:10.540
is that we nicely done the most

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:13.120
important thing is that we have as many

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:15.580
charges as possible in boss rush just a

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:18.190
for boss rush I should say just in case

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:20.230
the first one ends up being a crawl

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:22.090
space or something like that black

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:22.500
markets if we see that the first one

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:24.840
gives us

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:29.220
ladder instead of like a stoma then

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:30.630
we're going to go we're going to pop it

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:32.100
as many times as necessary and

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:34.140
considering we should get like eight

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:37.050
shovel charges the odds of us getting

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:44.370
eight nan portals to the next floor are

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:46.740
effectively less than nil now I'd like

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:49.110
to communicate unambiguously would which

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:55.410
is why I said the word stoma instead of

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:57.510
blood hole so to say lower than nil did

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:58.770
kill me a little bit on the inside but I

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:03.240
hope you understand where I'm coming

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:06.030
from it had to be done so we are going

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:08.940
to have no problems getting a to boss

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:16.440
rush are we should be pretty good on

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:19.020
boss rush as well we have full HP and we

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:20.370
stand to gain more we're just going back

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:26.330
because you never know at half-price

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:30.500
item on the shop or something get them

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:37.280
please hammer do hurt him okay I mean I

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:39.840
am an idiot but we effectively have no

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:42.300
concerns about killing mom in time as

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.380
long as we you know don't take 20

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.150
minutes to get there I mean obviously

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.290
that's an exaggeration but as long as

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.940
you don't think super long to get there

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:49.890
we do have ball advantages and that

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:52.590
allows us to pretty much crush the enemy

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:56.970
at will to put it in the most alarming

00:20:52.590 --> 00:21:00.630
way possible so I feel like we got every

00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:04.710
ability to survive and do pretty well on

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:06.150
today's daily might have taken a little

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:08.370
bit more damage than I'm proud of and I

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:14.760
might have I mean like super definitely

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:16.230
have but life does go on just money

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:19.929
please we don't want a Steam sale at

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:25.910
this point lockups

00:21:19.929 --> 00:21:27.880
the money's worth it now I mean SATA

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:30.920
Polaroid doesn't do anything for us but

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:32.990
neither really does blue baby's soul so

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:35.179
it's not even worth in my opinion the

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:37.190
mental energy to process it now we are

00:21:35.179 --> 00:21:38.540
going to be a little bit tight for time

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:40.760
and I know two seconds ago I said

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:42.080
there's no way we're tight for time it's

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.960
just because now I look at this floor

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:47.660
and I'm like this is a long floor if it

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:49.790
takes us 10 seconds to get back to the

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:51.440
boss fight that's longer than I expected

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:53.300
it would take to get back to the boss

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.470
fight and we might have a Krampus fight

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.700
and if we have a Krampus fight that

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:57.050
means we are not going to be able to go

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.100
into the deal with the devil so we're

00:21:57.050 --> 00:22:00.590
not going to go to the deal with the

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:01.970
devil unless you've got like at least 20

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:04.490
seconds which means we'd have to beat

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:05.570
mom in like a second and a half so if we

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:08.900
get a deal with the devil we're not

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:12.140
going to take it we haven't had Krampus

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:21.050
show up already right okay we need to go

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:23.380
a little bit faster please that's fine

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:26.590
no deal with the devil take the Polaroid

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:31.460
definitely could not afford to wait um

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:33.940
jeez I mean out of all these it's a

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:36.110
little tough I mean obviously you love

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:37.550
fire mind when it doesn't blow you up

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:39.920
okay I don't think we can rely on that

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:43.730
so now pop this down up here for so

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:45.320
there's a four other items so I mean

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:47.750
would you rather have a tack fly or halo

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:50.090
of flies I'd rather have a tack fly

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:51.620
honestly but that's kind of you know

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:56.809
it's a personal question we could also

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:57.860
take the d8 and roll stats once but so

00:22:56.809 --> 00:23:04.570
the strength card

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:09.890
I don't believe ruins are horrible on on

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:12.050
this boss rush no in fact it raised it a

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:13.190
great deal I sorry yeah I was worried

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:14.390
that it would ruin Whore of Babylon so

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:16.010
it raised our damage a great deal so I

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:17.720
popped the strength card knowing that

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:19.010
effectively this causes us to lose one

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.990
spirit art but we should have no problem

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:22.520
gaining it back the thing is we can't

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:25.940
get it back on boss rush we have to gain

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:28.100
it back on the on the womb and that's

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:31.160
fine remember we also have the wafers so

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:32.420
I would say 20,000 is obvious at this

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:35.420
point

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:37.520
if you want to add that top 30 the front

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:42.620
page of the greed but right now we need

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:44.120
37,000 points that is I mean the game

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:45.620
plan for us is so simple right now that

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:51.110
it's almost not even worth bringing up

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:55.550
we want to get to the lowest possible

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:58.070
floor that we can and then use a boss

00:23:55.550 --> 00:24:00.680
rush or sorry a self-sacrifice room I'm

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:02.270
on boss rush right now so I'm even not

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:07.280
using the shovel right now because I

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:08.900
find it kind of distracting from what

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.100
we're actually desiring to accomplish

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.860
right here that was lucky that we didn't

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:16.010
get hit there what do I want to see

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:17.840
after boss rush it's very simple the

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:21.230
item we get after boss rush if it's a

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:22.790
tears upgrade I'm loving life tears are

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:25.400
great right now we're getting a lot of

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:31.270
efficiency out of them thanks to the

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:39.380
piercing shots but could stand to have a

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:41.870
little more frequency I made a gamble

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:45.260
and loss that he wouldn't be in that

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:48.830
direction right there I can't believe

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:54.770
like the stain took a shot right to the

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:59.300
face and lived speaking of which my face

00:24:54.770 --> 00:25:01.010
is crazy eg right now just die and then

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:05.770
take forever for your animation to

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:05.770
finish please oh it's so itchy

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:14.609
oh that's the good stuff thank you

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:20.759
oh there's nothing better than

00:25:14.609 --> 00:25:22.409
scratching an itch man now I got it

00:25:20.759 --> 00:25:24.419
like my body's like hey you like

00:25:22.409 --> 00:25:25.769
scratching that itch what if I put an

00:25:24.419 --> 00:25:30.059
itch like on your nose right now I'm

00:25:25.769 --> 00:25:32.220
like no please after the Isaac episode

00:25:30.059 --> 00:25:36.269
I'm begging you because I shaved the

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:37.590
other day you know there's great things

00:25:36.269 --> 00:25:38.159
about being a dude there's no question

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:43.529
about it

00:25:38.159 --> 00:25:46.739
shaving is like mildly annoying but like

00:25:43.529 --> 00:25:50.090
you don't shave face gets itchy you

00:25:46.739 --> 00:25:52.440
shave your face gets into you it's like

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:53.850
the though you're gonna be like little

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.619
in a ellipse when you shower

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:58.889
look I shower daily all right I'm a

00:25:55.619 --> 00:26:01.169
clean person believe it or not I don't

00:25:58.889 --> 00:26:02.609
want my industry to you know betray my

00:26:01.169 --> 00:26:05.159
cleanliness I believe in the phrase

00:26:02.609 --> 00:26:08.999
cleanliness is next to godliness weight

00:26:05.159 --> 00:26:10.590
gotten godliness that's the one never

00:26:08.999 --> 00:26:14.309
feel better than when you just get out

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:16.460
of the shower you never feel better than

00:26:14.309 --> 00:26:20.609
when you've recently been wet third

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:23.369
phrasing things uh you know just kid

00:26:20.609 --> 00:26:25.950
think I grow with hair at an alarming

00:26:23.369 --> 00:26:27.480
rate I think it's the thing I started

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:29.580
shaving when I was in ninth grade which

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:34.259
is probably not that abnormal but I also

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:37.830
I don't want to grow a beard I could in

00:26:34.259 --> 00:26:42.149
fact sometimes I just accidentally do my

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:44.369
med Flanders they accidentally do all

00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:49.200
that freaking creep that blends in with

00:26:44.369 --> 00:26:51.149
the ground man sometimes I just go like

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.320
six days without shaving and people go

00:26:51.149 --> 00:26:55.169
hey I didn't know you were growing a

00:26:52.320 --> 00:27:00.059
beard and you know me neither I just got

00:26:55.169 --> 00:27:02.309
busy but I think a beer does anything to

00:27:00.059 --> 00:27:07.710
brag about it's just a you know it's a

00:27:02.309 --> 00:27:10.350
hormonal thing if I could make it so

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:12.690
that my face was permanently at like one

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:14.399
day of stubble and my head was

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:16.230
permanently at one day of stubble I

00:27:14.399 --> 00:27:18.269
would do it in a heartbeat I don't want

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:20.820
to be perfectly hairless like a baby but

00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:22.029
I also don't want to you know look like

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.529
the Epic Meal Time

00:27:22.029 --> 00:27:25.359
despite the fact these from my home

00:27:23.529 --> 00:27:28.080
country has made a great success for

00:27:25.359 --> 00:27:30.849
himself you know it's just not what I

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:36.940
want to see in myself although I wish

00:27:30.849 --> 00:27:38.950
him the best of luck I don't want to

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:40.960
look like the white Kimbo Slice is like

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:45.099
you know maybe if I could back it up in

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:47.379
a bar fight situation but I got you know

00:27:45.099 --> 00:27:49.090
mild tendinitis in my wrist it's like I

00:27:47.379 --> 00:27:51.070
don't want to invite that guy I want to

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:52.599
look harmless as the thing and then when

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:53.799
they go oh don't even mess with this guy

00:27:52.599 --> 00:27:55.330
he's a little baby that's when you get

00:27:53.799 --> 00:28:01.419
behind him like a spider monkey and you

00:27:55.330 --> 00:28:06.279
choke them out the Michael al Fox

00:28:01.419 --> 00:28:07.659
strategy so boss thrush is fine like I

00:28:06.279 --> 00:28:10.919
don't even know where we got off on that

00:28:07.659 --> 00:28:10.919
tangent all about faith bitchiness

00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:16.929
we got another Beelzebub enabler at

00:28:13.989 --> 00:28:18.159
least but not that I almost just left

00:28:16.929 --> 00:28:20.830
which would have been a horrible

00:28:18.159 --> 00:28:22.479
decision probably would not have killed

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:25.089
us but would have just been like super

00:28:22.479 --> 00:28:27.070
the wrong decision because the boss

00:28:25.089 --> 00:28:28.330
fresh would have been closed sure maybe

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:29.289
we would have had access to our deal

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:32.289
with the devil

00:28:29.289 --> 00:28:37.479
that's like unbelievably secondary for

00:28:32.289 --> 00:28:40.089
our overall situation right now so I

00:28:37.479 --> 00:28:45.369
mean I think we should use the shovel as

00:28:40.089 --> 00:28:47.109
much as possible we could we could

00:28:45.369 --> 00:28:49.269
afford like one black market right now

00:28:47.109 --> 00:28:50.769
you never know what a crawl space is

00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:57.279
going to entail just make sure you don't

00:28:50.769 --> 00:29:00.609
fall into it accidentally unsub's that's

00:28:57.279 --> 00:29:03.879
devilled we got the world you take the

00:29:00.609 --> 00:29:07.349
world card of the Moon card take the

00:29:03.879 --> 00:29:09.599
world card now we do have a

00:29:07.349 --> 00:29:14.619
self-sacrifice room on this floor

00:29:09.599 --> 00:29:16.450
it's tempting and again at some point

00:29:14.619 --> 00:29:17.469
you just got to say you know let the

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:19.389
chips fall where they may

00:29:17.469 --> 00:29:21.759
it's tempting to play the self sacrifice

00:29:19.389 --> 00:29:24.789
room on this floor because it's a

00:29:21.759 --> 00:29:26.710
guaranteed access to the lamp fight I'm

00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:30.549
not going to do it and the reason I'm

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:33.220
not going to do it is because I think we

00:29:30.549 --> 00:29:35.229
stand the chance to get more points by

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.490
just going to show even if there ends up

00:29:35.229 --> 00:29:37.620
being

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:40.170
self-sacrifice three months old however

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:42.570
if there is a self-sacrifice room on the

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:43.950
womb - I'll think more closely about it

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:45.000
but if there's a self-sacrifice room on

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:47.040
the womb - and you're willing to

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.480
compromise for that one you got to say

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:50.309
to yourself what it's like what's the

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.530
big difference in one floor between the

00:29:50.309 --> 00:29:54.240
womb one and the womb - well you've got

00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:55.710
a point you know and that's where we

00:29:54.240 --> 00:30:00.390
come to this kind of like variance

00:29:55.710 --> 00:30:02.160
element on Daly's that basically there's

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:04.590
no way for us in advance to know what

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:06.540
the right answer is the right answer

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:11.220
depends completely on what kind of daily

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:15.690
role we got today and to some extent

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:22.790
that can be frustrating but at least

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:27.090
it's not a daily with with no damage

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:29.730
that's I mean I'm in jovial spirits even

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:32.130
though I took two damage two full hearts

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:37.170
of damage from walking on spikes I had

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:38.760
no business walking on I'm like love in

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:40.620
life right now because we have a daily

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:42.450
that actually has like a semi

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:44.280
significant amount of damage now even

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:47.640
though Kay that's just embarrassing but

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:53.490
Bob's rush was even slow like thoughts

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:55.860
arrive like butterflies but it was not a

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:58.700
fast boss rush but we're still in like a

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.700
pretty good situation

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:09.490
it's not a 10 out of 10 run but it's at

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:13.760
least like an eight and a half even slow

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:16.549
but at least it's not no damage going

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:18.590
for went went go in for one out mean

00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:20.330
might not be able to emulate Eddie

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:23.480
better but at least I can emulate the

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:27.980
guitar sound from that song even flow is

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:30.710
great song first but you know here on

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:34.400
Pearl Jam alley we can talk honestly

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:38.530
about this it's a little overrated

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:41.570
as far as Pearl Jam songs go right

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:43.160
especially from 10 like I'll take an

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:46.700
even flow on the radio don't get me

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:49.790
wrong but you know give me a live over

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:53.990
even flow give me Jeremy give me once

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:56.780
something like that you know it's not

00:31:53.990 --> 00:32:01.730
that it's a radio friendly single is

00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:05.000
just like you're going to tell me you're

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:07.030
going to pass up alive for evenflo I

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.200
don't think so

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:12.160
anyway I don't know I'm even talking

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:15.110
about anymore but the range upgrade is a

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:18.110
tears upgrade is a nice touch I'm hoping

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:20.210
that against our better judgment here

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:22.580
against our better odds at least we have

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:24.650
a chance to get our deal with the devil

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:27.140
I don't know what I'd be looking for

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:29.000
right now except I mean I would take

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:31.309
more damage as an opportunity to take

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:36.820
less damage against enemies so give me

00:32:31.309 --> 00:32:39.169
the higher DPS so I can get lower DPS on

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:42.400
my own personal level so yeah don't pick

00:32:39.169 --> 00:32:46.040
that up accidentally we do want latchkey

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:47.960
luck stat is getting pretty great and I

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:51.070
mean you got to go gimpy in this

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:53.150
situation our odds of becoming guppy and

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:54.919
should be told the effectiveness of

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:57.470
becoming guppy is pretty suspect right

00:32:54.919 --> 00:32:58.970
now so I think and this is where we

00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:02.330
really put our money where our mouth is

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:04.370
but you got to look in this room give

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:05.090
yourself 10 points and just head down to

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:08.210
the next floor

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:09.679
goodbye self-sacrifice room I hope that

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:13.160
you're not the last one I'm ever going

00:33:09.679 --> 00:33:15.410
to see so there is not one on this floor

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:18.110
and in a way that's reassuring that mean

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:20.840
we cannot make a mistake on this floor

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:22.160
if we make a mistake it's already

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:24.230
happened we should have done it on the

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:25.730
last floor or we've already made the

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:28.840
optimal position so this floor is just

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:31.760
free points which is nice there's no

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:35.000
agency now we've made our bed and now

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:36.560
it's time to lie in it so to speak but

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.790
you'll notice you know I'm starting to

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:39.410
get more confident because I'm inching

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:40.850
closer to that thirty seven thousand

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:48.350
score that I know is going to rank us at

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:51.460
least temporarily on the front page and

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:55.130
it's not really like I want the glory

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:59.090
glory is a notoriety is a double-edged

00:33:55.130 --> 00:34:00.800
sword man you know it means that when I

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:02.330
get when I have a great daily I get

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.890
people tweeting me even before the video

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:05.870
goes up they go nice score on today's

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:08.650
daily it's very flattering you know that

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:11.450
you know people are interested in your

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:13.790
performances and they are you know to

00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:15.350
the point where even absent any kind of

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:18.080
motivation for it so that's our sole

00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:20.060
entrance point they're looking up your

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:21.530
scores that's that's again flattering

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:23.210
the people are interested but it also

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:26.330
means when you have a bad daily people

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:27.679
tweet you and they go what happened even

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:29.419
before the video goes up they're like

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:30.740
what went wrong are you okay you're

00:34:29.419 --> 00:34:37.010
showing the symptoms my uncle shows

00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:38.390
right before you had a stroke so and you

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:41.440
know you take the good with the bad I

00:34:38.390 --> 00:34:44.260
guess is what I'm trying to say I mean

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:47.630
we're going to get enough spirit hearts

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:49.429
we should check this because if I didn't

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:51.520
I wouldn't feel good about myself and

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:53.990
you know we got our HP back regardless

00:34:51.520 --> 00:35:01.160
we probably got enough consumables to

00:34:53.990 --> 00:35:04.280
offset it why did we have a 38% deal

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:04.670
with the devil chance last time didn't

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.980
we

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:10.520
how do you get a twofer ahlian wait I

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:13.880
can see it blow up like a judgment or a

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:16.220
greed statue and then factor in the fact

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:19.040
that you have a 75% penalty

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:22.690
maybe you get a two point something

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:25.940
percent increase I get theoretically oh

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:28.160
yes you're just very tiny I'm not going

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.880
to open that of our own volition at

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:31.579
least hardened for

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:36.650
shut the kitchen at least to mama role

00:35:31.579 --> 00:35:40.460
in that body at least I think you blow

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:43.730
them up because your pit kills them

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:46.759
oh that was so bad but the reason you

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:50.319
blow them up is well first off sweet

00:35:46.759 --> 00:35:54.980
trinket but secondly unlimited bombs and

00:35:50.319 --> 00:35:56.359
we do not care in the least about what

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.980
we're going to get from a judgement on a

00:35:56.359 --> 00:35:59.569
normal run we play it because you know

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:01.700
items are king you know we want as many

00:35:59.569 --> 00:36:03.500
synergies as possible on this run we

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:08.380
only stand to lose points from our

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:11.210
existing consumables so as much as a

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:12.890
sort of a lame way to play it is also

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:14.990
the incentivized way to play on dailies

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:16.880
and it's also the reason I used zero

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:20.809
bombs to pick up 12 cents here despite

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:22.190
the fact that functionally idiotic

00:36:20.809 --> 00:36:24.349
because we will never have another

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:28.759
chance to spend money because as you

00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:29.930
know recently elucidated if we ever come

00:36:28.759 --> 00:36:31.250
across something that we can spend money

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:33.200
on we're going to blow it up with one of

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:34.579
our unlimited bombs to get more

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.890
consumables than we would spend because

00:36:34.579 --> 00:36:40.130
that's the most efficient in my opinion

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:42.410
at least on average the most efficient

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:44.509
transaction you can take on that room oh

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:48.369
please NL talk more about the most

00:36:44.509 --> 00:36:48.369
efficient transaction I'm almost done

00:36:50.079 --> 00:36:58.400
ladies love when you min max the economy

00:36:53.240 --> 00:37:00.680
of a video game yo but stop structure in

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:03.319
your life just around what the ladies

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:06.470
like you structure your life around what

00:37:03.319 --> 00:37:08.750
you like within reason and then you know

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:13.430
the rest will snap into place maybe or

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:16.029
not but you know I talked about it

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:18.019
probably like a month ago in an episode

00:37:16.029 --> 00:37:19.430
you're going to you don't like

00:37:18.019 --> 00:37:20.869
motorcycles you're going to drive a

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:22.789
motorcycle just because you think that's

00:37:20.869 --> 00:37:25.460
what girls like it's like the lamest

00:37:22.789 --> 00:37:27.890
thing of all time you know what the

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:29.450
curse there you start driving a

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:30.559
motorcycle because you know you don't

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:33.559
like it because you think that's what

00:37:30.559 --> 00:37:35.690
girls like might get yourself a girl who

00:37:33.559 --> 00:37:37.160
likes motorcycles then you're with this

00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:38.890
lady who doesn't even like a thing that

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:40.910
you like because you put on a charade

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:42.230
you're going to end up subscribing to

00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:43.790
motorcycle weekly and she

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:45.080
honey you want to go to the motorcycle

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:48.110
party this weekend you're going to be

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:52.220
like no but yes because now it's part of

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:55.520
my identity you should be like no I want

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:57.260
to go to the workshop where I learn the

00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:01.160
basic syntax of the brainfuck

00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:08.870
programming language is a joke man

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:10.550
well I mean sadly again we really really

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:11.810
really want to play a self-sacrifice

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:15.830
room on the next floor so what's the

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:17.720
damage upgrade here zero so we I don't

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:20.690
think we want any of that most of the

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:26.990
time oh I hate you most of the time we

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:28.400
would want to take bobbling bundle

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:29.420
because double the consumables drops

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.530
will be important but we're getting

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:35.990
pretty close to the top of those

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:38.930
regardless like the maximum what we need

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:41.060
to do is find a self sacrificing room on

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:42.530
this floor and you know I think there's

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:43.850
a chance we can get a crawl space or a

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:46.000
black market out of the shovel but this

00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:48.920
is where the shovel loses its usefulness

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.530
so there is a chance in theory that we

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:57.710
could get like a narrow room and a

00:38:51.530 --> 00:39:02.750
narrow room would be access to the lam

00:38:57.710 --> 00:39:04.460
floor I think so of course probably goes

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:06.890
without saying I would be interested in

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:08.900
that but the odds of it happening are

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:10.610
extremely low we need to get the you

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:12.200
know the right space bar item I don't

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:13.850
even know if it can show up unless we

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:16.400
have chaos or something like that so

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:18.100
really this floor does largely come down

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:19.580
to the self sacrifice room and

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:21.860
considering we're going to spend

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:23.630
basically all of our existing HP going

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:27.290
to a self sacrifice room if it exists

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:28.820
which is the best-case scenario we

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:31.310
really want to avoid taking damage

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:34.720
because all this damage on the ground is

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:37.940
actually our HP for future floors so

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:39.740
this floor is where we discover if we

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:40.940
made the right decision or what is

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:42.680
something I wouldn't describe as a

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:44.360
terrible mistake but admittedly a

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:49.840
mistake nonetheless this is going to

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:49.840
hurt holy crap it did not hurt

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:58.160
and what I mean by that is simply you

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:59.809
know remember two floors ago on the womb

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:01.430
one where I said I don't think we should

00:39:59.809 --> 00:40:03.079
do the self-sacrifice room here because

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:04.700
we could stand to get one later that

00:40:03.079 --> 00:40:07.390
would you know have less of an

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:09.530
opportunity cost associated with it

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:11.599
that's where we're at right now we're

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:20.270
finding out if our opportunity cost for

00:40:11.599 --> 00:40:21.740
skipping it was actually enormous kind

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:24.500
of surprised how long it's taken us to

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:27.819
kill the Fallen is not the tanky ascent

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:27.819
of me in the Isaac Cinematic Universe

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:34.730
it's quite a long Daly by the way for a

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:36.950
Daly that only is going to mom's foot

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:41.079
I'm appreciative of that because we

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:41.079
found the scene one of the many scenes

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:53.510
I'll come on we had them and we are

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:55.280
unkillable if no self-sacrifice room

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:57.560
shows up we're not going to die

00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:04.640
there's there's actually effectively

00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:10.930
zero chance of that but we also will not

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:17.060
hit 37,000 I can't believe that works

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:18.320
well we probably won't hit 37,000 not a

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:22.280
secret I should have looked that's

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:30.830
obviously not a secret room um wait it

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:32.150
out there you're gone 37,000 though I

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:34.310
mean that's that's just to get in the

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:38.120
top 30 that's just to get on the front

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:40.400
page that's never been my goal in in

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:41.960
these Isaac Daly's is to ensure that we

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:48.410
end up on the front page you know to aim

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:50.480
for the top 30 is very brazen I think if

00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:52.910
we're in the mid 30s I'll at least feel

00:41:50.480 --> 00:42:00.230
like you know we put up a good try today

00:41:52.910 --> 00:42:01.700
but we really are kind of at the the

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:03.500
whim of the game at this point if there

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:05.720
is a self-sacrifice room I think we

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:07.850
could be in the mid-40s now there's not

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:09.140
very many scores in the mid 40s so I'm

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:11.990
going to guess that there's probably not

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:15.470
a self-sacrifice room on this floor but

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:18.740
if there is my god we're going to be you

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:20.990
know maybe potentially top 10 I don't

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:22.070
see it happening but and even then we

00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:26.390
probably shouldn't have even picked that

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:28.130
up you think about a hermit card there's

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:30.560
a self-sacrifice room okay so there is a

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:33.740
god which is pretty sweet we just learn

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:35.690
that right now we're going to lose a lot

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:39.620
of points playing the self sacrifice

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:40.730
room but and I know you got to put your

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:43.040
money where your mouth is now because I

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:47.930
said we might finish top ten that might

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:50.030
have been a little surprising or a

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:53.630
little incorrect maybe is the word that

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:56.800
I would use because we're going to take

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:56.800
a pretty massive

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:04.180
penalty from playing the self-sacrifice

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:07.930
room but it should be compensated for by

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:11.320
the extra bonus that we can get for

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:13.600
going down to the lam site so but at the

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:18.250
same time I would be pretty surprised if

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:20.380
we were able to get into the 40s just by

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:22.180
ranking or just just by doing what we've

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:23.200
done on today's daily because I don't

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:25.210
think we've done anything particularly

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:26.950
special especially with all the bad

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:28.510
damage I've taken I would think that

00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:30.280
anybody who managed to pick up the

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:34.690
shovel could be in the running with me

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:39.670
here if that's not the case then you

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:42.190
know great for me but I'm a little I

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:43.650
don't want to get too up to mystic I

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:46.710
guess is what I'm trying to say you know

00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:50.920
it's like the Radiohead song wait again

00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:54.760
returning this you can try the best you

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:57.640
can the best you can is exactly good

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:59.230
enough that's amazing to say it but the

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:01.090
sentiment remains you know we don't have

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:02.860
the cancer trinket so we can afford to

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:04.660
do like in and out here just to save

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:06.220
ourselves some time gimpy is doing great

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:08.320
work for us which I really appreciate

00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:10.510
we also have not lost that many points

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:12.730
for doing this which I've been surprised

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:17.050
by I really thought we'd kind of be left

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:19.570
out in the lurch here and I was that it

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:22.660
was that a kid a cut yeah the kid a cut

00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:26.580
you know I'm part of the pitchfork media

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:26.580
generations don't forget it

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:39.280
we don't want to pick a soul minor but

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:46.690
we don't want to pick up the key pieces

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:54.430
right because picking up the key pieces

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:56.260
is going to give us nothing except

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:57.940
negative points so yeah I don't think we

00:44:56.260 --> 00:45:02.530
care now we could look for a second

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:05.470
secret room speaking of not caring just

00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:07.090
doesn't matter that much so I think

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:09.310
we're about to teleport and honestly for

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:11.200
all the consumables we gained we really

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:13.930
offset our damage penalty we might only

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:16.000
lose in total like a thousand points

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:19.230
we're going to get all of that back

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.460
basically as soon as we tell it for it

00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:26.950
it really lose slightly more than a

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:30.010
thousand points I'm losing my mind

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:31.480
wait a minute do I actually have to give

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:34.600
you twelve hearts I don't just step on

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:36.430
the spikes twelve times because like if

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.480
that's better the wafers not as good as

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:38.830
I thought but no I think I'm just

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:41.590
confused so we're in the thirty-three

00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:43.300
thousands now it's a chance to make me

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:46.300
regret not taking those guppy deals of

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:49.120
the devil speed down full health both

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:51.280
irrelevant um now though we have a great

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:54.490
chance of hitting 37,000 I kind of

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:57.190
overestimate how many points you get for

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:59.860
coming down here now you know now that

00:45:57.190 --> 00:46:03.090
I'm looking at it the 40 mid-40s is not

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:05.950
plausible for us but certainly

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:08.110
thirty-seven thousand is plausible what

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:10.600
it will require I can't believe I killed

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:15.190
them like the same time what it will

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:17.770
require is well not taking bump friend

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:19.330
probably although perhaps he could take

00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:22.690
the money that we'd get and do something

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:24.160
more productive with it what it requires

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:26.370
is taking as little damage as possible

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.370
basically

00:46:30.299 --> 00:46:35.459
should get a few thousand points just

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.459
for coming down here

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:40.119
we should expel the honestly at this

00:46:38.589 --> 00:46:43.690
point we might not want to explore

00:46:40.119 --> 00:46:46.749
everything just because the penalty for

00:46:43.690 --> 00:46:49.329
taking damage is high so it might be a

00:46:46.749 --> 00:46:51.969
situation where our best-case scenario

00:46:49.329 --> 00:46:55.119
is getting out of here as soon as we

00:46:51.969 --> 00:46:59.380
kill the lamb not doing any rooms that

00:46:55.119 --> 00:47:00.729
are unnecessary especially because we're

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:02.170
not looking for items or anything like

00:47:00.729 --> 00:47:04.239
that to begin with so I'm going to try

00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:06.190
with that strategy not just because it's

00:47:04.239 --> 00:47:07.920
been a 45 minute long daily which is a

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:10.509
little on the long side but I'm actually

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:12.369
I'm still feeling pretty energized here

00:47:10.509 --> 00:47:15.150
mostly because I know that we've got a

00:47:12.369 --> 00:47:19.180
we've got a guaranteed good rank today

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:20.829
I'm set it up conversationally as if it

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:22.719
actually matters whether or not we hit

00:47:20.829 --> 00:47:24.459
the top 30 which it doesn't at all being

00:47:22.719 --> 00:47:27.160
in the top 30 would be like one of the

00:47:24.459 --> 00:47:30.430
best probably 25 daily scores I've ever

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:32.979
had so not an afterbirth plus like top

00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:35.019
25 daily scores I've ever had in after

00:47:32.979 --> 00:47:39.279
birth or after birth plus so I will take

00:47:35.019 --> 00:47:40.869
sad onion thing as well worth it so it's

00:47:39.279 --> 00:47:43.180
not like if I get 30 second I'm not

00:47:40.869 --> 00:47:45.309
going to be like we failed you know I'm

00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:52.029
not I'm not daddy eSports as I'm sure

00:47:45.309 --> 00:47:53.799
you're aware so so I mean I will take it

00:47:52.029 --> 00:47:58.509
the thing is it's like 30 points down

00:47:53.799 --> 00:47:59.709
but first off secret room access so

00:47:58.509 --> 00:48:02.319
thank you for that I might not have

00:47:59.709 --> 00:48:03.789
found it without it probably would not

00:48:02.319 --> 00:48:07.089
have looked to be honest with you and

00:48:03.789 --> 00:48:09.219
secondly we get a mild damage increase

00:48:07.089 --> 00:48:11.489
we also should get second secret room

00:48:09.219 --> 00:48:14.799
access thanks to the dog tooth so I

00:48:11.489 --> 00:48:16.749
think it's it'll probably pay for itself

00:48:14.799 --> 00:48:18.789
and also it's pretty good

00:48:16.749 --> 00:48:22.329
I just I'm sticking with the principle

00:48:18.789 --> 00:48:27.400
of damage upgrades are nice so let's

00:48:22.329 --> 00:48:29.680
take them even if it costs us some

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:31.780
points I don't think we need to grind

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:38.290
that hard

00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:40.960
I am looking at like you know in my

00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:42.820
mind's eye I'm looking at all the damage

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:44.830
I took on today's daily that was so

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:46.540
unnecessary and I'm thinking you know

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:48.940
what might have been what might have

00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:50.470
been I'm also looking at what happened

00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:52.630
on today's daily and I'm like I can see

00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:54.940
how you can get 37,000 easy I can see

00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:56.320
you can get 40,000 if you play the same

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:58.270
way that I did except you were better

00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:59.680
and took a lot less damage there's you

00:48:58.270 --> 00:49:03.250
know you're in your mid to high 30s

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:06.400
right now at the very least but 50,000

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:10.170
is otherworldly that is again whenever I

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:13.530
say like I never accuse people of

00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:15.550
hacking and video games like accusations

00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:16.620
they've just never been part of my

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:19.870
wheelhouse

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:21.340
because I know my own limitations so

00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:22.780
whenever someone goes all out he'd see

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:24.040
me there he must be wall hacking I'm

00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:27.670
like I don't know when I see people

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:29.260
flying around in a jet ski in like you

00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:31.540
know halo I'm like okay that guy is

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:32.790
probably hacking I don't think halo has

00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:36.490
jet skis

00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:38.920
well actually the race can go on water

00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:41.470
if you will the couple it's so velocity

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:46.510
from the physical plane okay sure all

00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:48.250
right you got me but still I think it's

00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:50.260
just you know you've got you've got some

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:51.910
preternatural technique I am unaware of

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:52.960
I don't know what it involved on today's

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:57.130
round I'm trying to think of where that

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:58.600
maybe maybe one of the arc caves somehow

00:49:57.130 --> 00:50:01.690
contain the key I'm trying to think of

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:05.650
like plausible areas where seams might

00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:08.790
exist the arcade seems like one of them

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:12.190
mostly it's a fast shot speed dude

00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:15.240
mostly because I very very rarely take

00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:18.310
full advantage of the arcade so I

00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:21.040
default to them as an opportunity uh not

00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:23.320
taking 200 years on boss rush might have

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:25.900
helped you out as well but usually when

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:27.430
I see points that are like ten thousand

00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:29.380
higher than what I'm getting it's a

00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:31.420
combination of not all that was bad

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:34.920
combination of not taking nearly as much

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:37.570
damage combined with some kind of like

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:39.750
consumable strat that I am largely

00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:43.140
unaware of I think so

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:53.190
wow that did not hit me somehow

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:56.519
ah variable rolls new okay we've done it

00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:57.690
I think we grabbed this get the heck out

00:50:56.519 --> 00:51:00.960
of this run we're ready to go

00:50:57.690 --> 00:51:02.940
we got 37,000 were 49th right now that's

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.779
actually excellent for now thanks for

00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:05.309
