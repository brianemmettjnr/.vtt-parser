##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.490
everybody welcoming the language binding

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.230
once again to earth plus we're doing

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.670
challenges some of them are going okay

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.870
some of them are not going okay I don't

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.429
know why I'm talking in the voice that

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.150
that woman uses on orange is the new

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.470
black girl so look it's the fun wheel so

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.710
what was it again marry with me and

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.640
Christopher get out of here um okay well

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.580
what's the game plan

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.519
curse I believe is the challenge where

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.920
every room hurts you

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:31.019
which actually strikes me with young

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.590
heart and child's heart is not being

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:41.219
that bad it does strike me as also being

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:43.079
like an off okay amazing sure even

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.000
though it doesn't do anything for us it

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.100
does also strike me as being like

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.780
impossible for us to I guess you should

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.579
try to minimize the amount of doors we

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.910
go through like in terms of backtracking

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.379
even but it also strikes me as making it

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.550
nearly impossible to get deals with the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.160
devil but considering we're starting

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.720
with six HP young heart an okay trinket

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.689
which we're not going to replace here we

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.950
should be fine I in fact I don't see any

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.630
cause for alarm whatsoever now getting

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.189
active items is not really on my to-do

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.960
list right now but apart from that this

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.729
doesn't seem that difficult all things

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.680
considered just make sure you're using

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.000
young heart at every you know available

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.430
opportunity don't take too much damage

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.009
from the bosses from any enemies if

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.540
possible and you know go into the boss

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.280
room and out as many times as you want I

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.280
guess there is a bonus to be had there

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.740
watch out you can't be taking damage

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.140
against the widow taking damage against

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.210
the widow is like opening up your day by

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.850
like almost getting into a traffic

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.890
accident even if there's no consequences

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.470
for almost getting into an accident just

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.630
puts you all geez it puts you in a funk

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.020
doesn't it look at us being all funky

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.530
right now you want to set the tone

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.000
properly did we succeed in that and

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.860
unnecessarily however most of my

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.300
surprise and much to the game's chagrin

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.010
and possibly some of the audience's

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.240
we're going to get for spirit hearts

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.710
here but to actually give us a great

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.510
chance get a deal with the devil and I

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.860
would say without being overly cocky

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.900
because again we have squandered a

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.310
couple of challenges thus far but

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.580
without being overly cocky if we're able

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.440
to get a good - great deal with the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.580
devil item we basically win we're

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.830
starting with so much HP now the sin

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.970
herbs the flipside although we would

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.480
have been hurt on the way out anyway I

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.340
guess the flipside is that it's so good

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.690
but yama heart is like compulsory right

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.209
now um allow me to continue the flipside

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.590
is that if we get overly aggressive with

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.600
the deal with the devil we might be in a

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.220
tight spot when it comes to our HP but

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.380
it's going to have to be like three

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.230
items for sale otherwise it's almost

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.510
unfathomable that we could accidentally

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.520
sell ourselves into a bad position but

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.080
we have taken some damage I'm not very

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.850
pleased with early on here and a half

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.590
red hearts goes into a whole heck of a

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.030
lot for us blighted ovum should be fine

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.700
Wow never mind

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:19.760
blighted ovum might be a touch difficult

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:23.090
here but on the bright side we should be

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.730
able to get through this a okay

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.030
hopefully is my game plan please slow

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.130
down

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.770
you move too fast you got to make the

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.670
good things last

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:37.490
spirit arts enjoy them while they last

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:40.580
polydactyl plus two of diamonds unlikely

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.560
to ever be worth much dude I don't know

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.820
I think a same might be like the keys to

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.730
the kingdom on this one I hadn't even

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.430
thought about this but items that do

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.310
things when we get hit seems like not a

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.320
bad option I don't know what do you

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.530
think about curse rooms that they're not

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.090
really by the way if Fame sucks I

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.190
thought that we would carry the the

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.740
circle of protection or a circle of

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.600
danger into the next room not the case

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.190
I think curse rooms without being able

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.070
to leave through secret rooms are not

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:13.640
worth it because basically if possible I

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.050
would like to minimize my odds or number

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.680
of moves where I have to go through the

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.910
same door twice I want to basically

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.110
imagine that I'm playing Fadel dungeon

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.390
rescuing for those of you who didn't

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.830
watch that let's look at well consider

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:31.130
yourself lucky because I played like a

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:32.540
hot garbage in it but excuse me the door

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.250
is open because I took too long to kill

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.840
the enemies that's an insult I'm going

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.310
to you know I'm going to do anything to

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.770
take advantage of that and leave because

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:44.200
I'm a savvy individual we that was a

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.300
game of which you can't

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.800
it's like snake you can't touch your own

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.840
tail I mean it snake if you touch your

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.510
own tail you die infidel you just can't

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:59.330
do it to begin with so key please key

00:04:53.510 --> 00:05:02.440
please as a penny not a key we could try

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.440
to gamble a little bit

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:12.360
the gamble worked which almost makes me

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:13.889
matter because all I had was a bad one

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.900
though all I'm trying to do is create a

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.810
deal with the devil essentially and

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.580
we're not quite I think going to be able

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.660
to do it here so you know what take

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.699
another stab at it it actually continues

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.530
to work much to my surprise

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:30.240
I'd love some luck so I could actually

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.949
get some consumables like I don't want

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:38.400
to walk back to the item room here I

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:40.590
probably will oh now we've done it I

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.199
probably will now that we have no real

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.460
reason not to and we have that key back

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:46.440
enough stuff but yeah we probably want

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.479
to avoid doing this long serves okay I'm

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.039
just going to catch myself in the middle

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:53.760
of making a stupid mistake

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:57.840
try not to cheese the item rooms have

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:00.690
been like predominantly pretty trash try

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.389
not to walk through too many rooms that

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.070
you have already gone through I know

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:07.080
that this time we've made a mistake here

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:10.710
we sacrifice essentially two and a heart

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.720
to make it happen but we're hard

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.000
programmed in Isaac to think that it's a

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.940
good idea to always go to item rooms you

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.180
may have overvalued there but dude I'm

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:23.280
losing my mind that we're still at three

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.169
point five damage no offensive orbitals

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.690
you know there's still there's still

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:31.039
goodness in this world but we're red

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:35.190
default damage default speed default BPS

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:39.599
we've got a same with you I mean not

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:44.099
doing anything for us but in theory

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:46.050
could I still like our odds here if we

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:50.150
can up our luck stat make a Thames pop

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:53.010
for us pick up some actual consumables

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:55.139
and pick them up in a timely fashion

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.729
rather than having to walk back for them

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:59.699
I'd be a happy camper please jump

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:00.150
perfect time for that jump just ask Tom

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:02.370
Petty

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:07.620
wait Van Halen yeah Tom Petty is free

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:10.229
fallin van Halen sang jump bad damage on

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.909
my part but I think it was smart to not

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:13.830
rush in there and take extra damage just

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:17.190
trying to make a Fame work

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:19.979
and in 20 or 30 years people be dead and

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:21.720
we'll be living the highlights

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:26.090
hidden them sly for the cenotes as they

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.090
said in camp blows magnum opus Luchini a

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:31.949
bit of a risky situation there dude I

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:34.800
need you to stop jumping because every

00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:36.270
jump I have to like run the trajectory

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.430
of these two eyeballs through my

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.569
freaking you know mental function again

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:43.020
here to try to figure out if we're going

00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:46.379
to be okay dude to do a just bounce spin

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:48.030
that record baby get it to do pretty

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:55.680
easy song to remember most of the lyrics

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:58.169
for alright so we're kind of we're below

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.819
equilibrium right now in terms of like

00:07:58.169 --> 00:08:01.680
the damage that we're taking versus the

00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:08.129
HP that we're receiving so we got to be

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:09.990
very very careful on the other hand I'm

00:08:08.129 --> 00:08:11.490
as excited as I've ever been for our

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:15.379
ability to actually like shoot enemies

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:18.659
effectively and every time we get a half

00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:20.310
spirit heart or half red heart I should

00:08:18.659 --> 00:08:22.560
say that means this room is free to go

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:25.979
to in fact it's more than free because

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:29.550
we're going to get a 1/4 of a heart out

00:08:25.979 --> 00:08:31.500
of young heart as well just for going

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:37.200
into the room assuming it's a regular

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:37.800
sized room still poor damage but we're

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.360
working on it

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.430
we got a key which means we can go to

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.500
the item room on time we're actually

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:46.440
going to get bombs for like the second

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:48.270
time ever on this run if I could also

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.610
get you because I hate to do it because

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:53.430
it's like tedious but if you could also

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:57.570
shoot some bombs my way like that Lenny

00:08:53.430 --> 00:09:00.420
Kravitz song just so we could okay well

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:02.910
you know I'll just be an ass I guess is

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.140
the alternative we're going to play some

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:06.630
bombs we're going to open the stone

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:08.339
chest because I value the stone chest we

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.810
got a bomb out of it so I consider that

00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:11.570
worthwhile and we'll try to just keep

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:15.120
moving here

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:18.120
save our other bomb if possible for a

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.620
tinted rock or you know damage against

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.829
an enemy or something like that get out

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:25.890
of here to a diamonds has done nothing

00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:30.570
for us but the lovers card is majestic

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:33.540
now honestly like it's so not worth it

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:36.899
but sure I will walk on the spikes to

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:44.130
get poppy ladoo clicks never say your

00:09:36.899 --> 00:09:46.529
boy NL doesn't make sacrifices being a

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:48.660
little facetious - of diamonds by the

00:09:46.529 --> 00:09:51.480
way is is functionally worth exactly

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.740
zero percent right now but I'm starting

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.240
to feel the pressure a little bit the

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:57.810
lovers card I'm gonna save for like

00:09:54.240 --> 00:10:00.120
last-ditch scenario if we can slash have

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:02.010
two big rooms are actually a blessing

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.899
for us because we take half damage on

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:06.600
the way in is better unlocks on the

00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:08.880
decent - this is this is a non-trivial

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:11.970
challenge a fun challenge but a

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.940
non-trivial one I do wonder if like you

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:17.940
could accidentally find yourself unable

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:20.490
to ever beat the nuts ever but I think

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:22.260
there might be runs for which the curse

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:24.120
challenge is actually mathematically

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.110
impossible to beat like what if you have

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:30.060
a big floor

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:31.920
there's not many big rooms and you you

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.890
just never get red hearts either due to

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.300
having like a negative one lock stat or

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:37.860
you know for whatever reason I know you

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.209
still have yama heart but it doesn't

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:44.010
seem like that much is what I'm trying

00:10:39.209 --> 00:10:46.140
to get at it essentially if you just hit

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:48.449
a bad run of like 20 rooms in a row

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.860
without a red heart you might be you

00:10:48.449 --> 00:10:52.350
might be out of luck even if you take

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:55.470
zero damage against enemies it's

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:58.110
probably pretty unlikely but I think the

00:10:55.470 --> 00:11:00.149
chance is a theoretical possibility at

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:02.149
least but anyway hopefully we won't have

00:11:00.149 --> 00:11:04.949
to worry about that I mean we're only

00:11:02.149 --> 00:11:07.290
we're only like one floor oh that hurts

00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:10.230
two floors away from success here excuse

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:11.699
me excuse me though thank you and we

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:15.089
still have this lovers card kind of like

00:11:11.699 --> 00:11:16.920
buffing us here so the hollow is the

00:11:15.089 --> 00:11:20.550
perfect enemy to take damage against and

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:22.320
try to create a demon heart we didn't

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:25.560
get one but we did speed up the boss

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:27.750
fight immensely we got a free red heart

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:30.000
container and a small bit of extra

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:34.000
damage not a ton but enough to keep us

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.450
going here and as always I kind of uh

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.130
I apologize as much as is necessary for

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:41.170
the fact that it's a commentary focus

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:44.860
run but this is like a commentary focus

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:48.220
challenge right now or wait game focus

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:50.920
might be the way to describe it you know

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:55.900
it's not easy to be e me

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:59.110
that's five for fighting screw Larry

00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:01.300
kill the pg-13 rated version of the game

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:04.090
including intercourse and murder five

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:06.190
for fighting Ben Folds Five and English

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:10.300
boyband five most famous for the songs

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:15.730
baby when the lights go out yeah every

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:17.350
single no you don't remember five dude

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:20.080
they were huge back in the day hurt me

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:21.940
please thank you thank you always making

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:26.760
jim cramer style mad money and look at

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:29.620
this finally a good use for our bombs

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:36.430
that door might already be open like we

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:40.330
might have no need to open it ourselves

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:42.130
but thank Dustin we don't ever need to

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:44.290
open it ourselves we are lucky we saved

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:45.730
a bomb and we might actually be able to

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:47.470
buy something in our shop for once even

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.060
shielded tears I don't think we fire

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:55.830
fast enough for that to be great right

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:55.830
now dude it's actually an okay smelt

00:12:59.939 --> 00:13:12.869
oh you go PhD no doubt also gave us like

00:13:06.449 --> 00:13:14.609
full HP yeah I'm not stoked about

00:13:12.869 --> 00:13:16.349
shielded tears because our rate of fire

00:13:14.609 --> 00:13:17.939
is bad enough that we if we encounter

00:13:16.349 --> 00:13:20.639
enemies that shoot at us it's going to

00:13:17.939 --> 00:13:22.529
be kind of annoying to have half of our

00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:23.699
shots be destroyed by them but it is

00:13:22.529 --> 00:13:25.379
what it is I don't think it's a bad

00:13:23.699 --> 00:13:26.849
pickup I mean I had the choice to not

00:13:25.379 --> 00:13:28.109
pick it up and I chose to pick it up

00:13:26.849 --> 00:13:29.970
that you know there's some kind of

00:13:28.109 --> 00:13:31.709
logical fallacy and assuming that that

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:35.569
means it's automatically good I suppose

00:13:31.709 --> 00:13:35.569
but at the same time how bad could it be

00:13:36.019 --> 00:13:41.399
we've got an outside chance of a deal

00:13:39.239 --> 00:13:42.989
with the devil here even but to be

00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:44.759
honest with you we're one floor away

00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:46.559
from beating the challenge here never

00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:49.729
seeing it again so what's my ideal

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:54.359
outcome dude let me fight war right now

00:13:49.729 --> 00:13:57.859
and then how are you not doing any

00:13:54.359 --> 00:14:00.419
damage to each other let me fight war

00:13:57.859 --> 00:14:02.639
let me get a cube of meat and then just

00:14:00.419 --> 00:14:05.669
let me walk into every enemy on the next

00:14:02.639 --> 00:14:07.829
floor you might say it turns this run

00:14:05.669 --> 00:14:10.889
like a little skill list but I very much

00:14:07.829 --> 00:14:12.599
disagree I just think you know we've

00:14:10.889 --> 00:14:14.129
already kind of slightly proved

00:14:12.599 --> 00:14:16.169
ourselves on this run not to toot our

00:14:14.129 --> 00:14:18.449
own horn but you know our first few item

00:14:16.169 --> 00:14:22.889
rooms we're not actually just bad they

00:14:18.449 --> 00:14:24.329
were actively deleterious if we had

00:14:22.889 --> 00:14:28.339
taken any of those items we probably

00:14:24.329 --> 00:14:28.339
would be we would be dead already

00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:36.329
this is not war and in fact it is an

00:14:33.899 --> 00:14:40.439
extremely annoying enemy but I can just

00:14:36.329 --> 00:14:43.019
get him to live in the fire there might

00:14:40.439 --> 00:14:45.389
be a little bit happier I also want to

00:14:43.019 --> 00:14:50.609
save my bombs because if we can get oh

00:14:45.389 --> 00:14:53.579
that's it if we can get two bombs two

00:14:50.609 --> 00:14:56.489
bombs is enough oh that was so dumb two

00:14:53.579 --> 00:15:00.509
bombs is enough to open up a secret room

00:14:56.489 --> 00:15:02.249
and then get into an item room with its

00:15:00.509 --> 00:15:03.779
adjacent but we got HP and we got a

00:15:02.249 --> 00:15:05.579
chance to get more HP when we get hurt

00:15:03.779 --> 00:15:09.199
so really at this point we're probably

00:15:05.579 --> 00:15:11.669
like a hundred percent invested in this

00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:13.389
potentially suboptimal strategy to just

00:15:11.669 --> 00:15:17.199
walk into enemies and I think we're like

00:15:13.389 --> 00:15:19.720
good to go at this point crack dice is

00:15:17.199 --> 00:15:21.670
like totally fine I actually think I'm

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:25.480
going to go to my item room because I

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:27.279
can that might have been a poor play

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.139
there but we should be fine now

00:15:27.279 --> 00:15:31.059
especially a tack fly is an orbital it's

00:15:29.139 --> 00:15:32.949
not keeping me but it's an orbital so

00:15:31.059 --> 00:15:34.989
just get the lovers card ready in case

00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:37.389
things go terribly terribly wrong but

00:15:34.989 --> 00:15:38.619
walking into enemies trying to get demon

00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:41.439
hearts if we don't get demon hearts

00:15:38.619 --> 00:15:42.879
that's fine old bandage you know the

00:15:41.439 --> 00:15:45.279
dream is that that'll pay out eventually

00:15:42.879 --> 00:15:46.809
if it doesn't pay out a same might pay

00:15:45.279 --> 00:15:48.339
out if that doesn't pay out well then we

00:15:46.809 --> 00:15:52.239
can start to be a little cheesed I guess

00:15:48.339 --> 00:15:55.869
but it looks good

00:15:52.239 --> 00:15:59.350
oh dude why not all right let's go to

00:15:55.869 --> 00:16:01.540
town so a same is not going to be worth

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:06.339
too much against mom's foot but old

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:08.410
bandage could still do some damage well

00:16:06.339 --> 00:16:10.029
never mind the ax same damage is

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:11.980
actually like our single greatest damage

00:16:10.029 --> 00:16:15.670
dealing source next to maybe the attack

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:18.160
fly but I mean the extra is demon our

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:19.749
potentials not worth much dude easy

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.610
enough this is a quick one

00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:24.129
grab this what do we got in here I mean

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:25.389
we're not going to do it but the virus

00:16:24.129 --> 00:16:26.739
would have been a nice touch that was

00:16:25.389 --> 00:16:28.720
actually surprisingly easy and the

00:16:26.739 --> 00:16:30.549
credit card is well worth it even if I

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:32.679
do tend to misuse it so let's go down to

00:16:30.549 --> 00:16:36.669
our next thing when life gives you

00:16:32.679 --> 00:16:40.889
lemons this is our all lemon items right

00:16:36.669 --> 00:16:45.610
number one it's just lemon party and

00:16:40.889 --> 00:16:47.919
lemon mishap actually my net this is

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:51.029
like a more traditional run so just like

00:16:47.919 --> 00:16:55.509
be focused here this allows us to use

00:16:51.029 --> 00:16:56.980
lemon mishap once per room no reason to

00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:58.839
use it there obviously yeah this I mean

00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:02.259
this is a good start if we had this

00:16:58.839 --> 00:17:03.549
start as Isaac or Evie Dan I should say

00:17:02.259 --> 00:17:06.069
we would be like hey you know what cool

00:17:03.549 --> 00:17:07.480
run what I have said this is exactly the

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:09.490
same as the life gives you lemons run

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:12.399
probably not because I did life gives

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:13.480
you lemons once for 20 minutes in 2014 I

00:17:12.399 --> 00:17:16.659
don't know why it sounds like it's a

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:19.360
harrowing drug story but you know that

00:17:16.659 --> 00:17:21.880
it's been purged from my mental cue

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:23.799
since then I don't remember absolutely

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.559
everything that's happened to me unless

00:17:23.799 --> 00:17:27.210
it's related to a movie that came out

00:17:26.559 --> 00:17:30.190
between the

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:32.260
1996 and 2004 in which case I remember

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:33.370
it all so vividly and I wish I could

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:36.010
purge it okay what do we got

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:38.500
experimental treatment worse luck but

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:39.670
much better damage Oh worse HP as well

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.820
but I'm going to say that this is a

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:45.040
pretty big get for us and the fact that

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:48.160
this one only goes to Mom's heart is

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:51.390
like or sorry only goes to mom's foot

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:54.370
even is kind of surprising to me because

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:57.100
it's a fairly easy challenge all things

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:59.140
considered starting with three HP and a

00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:00.820
good spacebar item plus a bunch of like

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:03.430
augments for that it's not a good space

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:06.130
bar item but it says it's made good by

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:10.030
the fact that you know we have all these

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:11.290
augment ORS going along with it health

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:12.580
upgrade doesn't or not it looks like

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:15.400
we're going to be set here more or less

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:18.460
and I recognize that my cockiness might

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:20.590
get me into trouble but let's uh you

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:27.760
know put that theory of the test right

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:28.900
there throws out feet da ha News people

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:33.190
are always asking you know what's your

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:37.020
favorite Disney song everyone always a

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:39.730
whole new world a part of your world

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:41.770
just can't wait to be king circle alike

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:43.720
can't you feel the love tonight you'll

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:47.820
be in my heart by Phil Collins that's a

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:53.140
dangling special right there but the

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:56.020
real answer duel of the fates from Star

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:58.240
Wars Episode one you might say how is

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.810
that Disney that's Lucasfilm sorry to

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.850
tell you

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:03.760
Disney owns the rights to the Lucasfilm

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:05.860
catalog now and as a result duel of the

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:09.940
fates is technically the correct answer

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:13.480
I was trying to technically find the

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:15.340
most pedantic theme that I could in fact

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.960
if you want it if you want to use that

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:18.370
anecdote with your friends to make them

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.080
angry at you and make you a little bit

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:21.250
less don't say duel of the faith because

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.620
you might have to explain that that's

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:26.220
the song from when Darth Maul fights

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:28.720
obi-wan and qui-gon jinn in Episode one

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:30.460
instead just say Star Wars theme you

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:34.200
could even say cantina theme if you want

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:34.200
Dunston Dunston Bennett Sam

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:42.950
okay you're even getting goat head

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:45.840
unlike all of these I'm going to take

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:47.520
goat head because it's good but I'm not

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:50.220
going to take book of sin because I

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:54.150
don't like it that much dude I've been

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:57.510
getting so many emails with emojis in

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:59.760
the title recently it's driving me crazy

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:02.250
not because I dislike emojis but because

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.840
I dread I know what you're doing you're

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:07.049
trying to make your emails stand out

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:10.020
more by putting emojis in them doordash

00:20:07.049 --> 00:20:11.610
sends me these emails with emojis it

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:14.130
says like a hot new restaurants in

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:15.990
Vancouver I don't need that emoji for

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:19.290
that I'm never going to click on it on

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:21.540
fish tail can be good here I'm not

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:23.910
trying to be needlessly petty I feel

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:25.919
like everybody you know nobody's a huge

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:28.710
fan of emojis necessarily except for

00:20:25.919 --> 00:20:30.720
like you know everybody's mom I use

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:33.720
emojis from time to time just because I

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:35.429
find them ironic I guess nitronic use of

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.320
emojis I know something something the

00:20:35.429 --> 00:20:39.540
emoji movies look I'm not jacksFilms

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:43.679
okay take that stuff over to Jack's

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:50.130

Line make sure to click Subscribe what

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:54.419

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:58.080
don't put emojis in the email this is my

00:20:54.419 --> 00:21:00.690

door - I don't need fire emoji hot new

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:08.610
restaurants in Vancouver I'm aware of

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:11.100
what the word hot is okay embarrassing

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:12.510
to me got another one that says would

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:15.000
you be interested in reviewing games for

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:18.710
the Nintendo switch has got smiley face

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.549
emojis in the in the subject line I

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:22.650
wouldn't say I'm interested because

00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:23.970
Nintendo you know they're jerks about it

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:25.500
sometimes but yeah if you got like

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:26.850
review copies you'd love to send over

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:30.540
that's fine but I don't understand why

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:32.549
we got to bring emojis into this I was

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:34.710
fine you know just using the English

00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:37.169
language and other various Unicode based

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:40.230
characters but at the same time it's

00:21:37.169 --> 00:21:41.580
just I I just worry that maybe a month

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:43.620
from now I'm going to look at my email

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:45.720
inbox and it's just going to be like sad

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:48.570
face emoji your requests

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:52.050
for blah-blahs been declined then like

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:54.510
bomb emoji peach emoji eggplant moisture

00:21:52.050 --> 00:22:01.140
etc etc that's right I know how

00:21:54.510 --> 00:22:04.260
Millennials talk come on come on listen

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:05.750
to Millennials oh there is a deal with

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:09.540
the devil down there I almost missed it

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:12.510
come on let me hear Millennials talk

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:14.160
that's money talk by ac/dc you will know

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:16.890
it it's not soft for Millennials it's a

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:20.460
song for badass em efforts like yours

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:24.120
truly in the packs wait it's the pack

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:29.340
not the packs the packs is an item in

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:31.200
Isaac well this run is like set I'm

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:32.820
actually I feel like self-conscious and

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:35.910
if I'm being honest maybe even like a

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:37.500
mild bit of embarrassment that I'm doing

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:43.260
this run I'm not saying it's beneath me

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:45.600
but it's almost like it's like being a

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:48.570
team in the NHL and having a game

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:51.030
against the 2016-2017 Vancouver Canucks

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:52.920
it's like okay I mean it's on the

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:55.470
schedule it's got to be done or Gary

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:59.160
Bettman is going to find us but like you

00:22:55.470 --> 00:23:01.860
want to just resign right now because

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:05.630
like unless Bo Horvat pops off a

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:05.630
hat-trick you guys stand no chance

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:15.700
it goes ee for the draft lottery

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:18.190
unfortunately all this is like the same

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:20.049
episode which honestly it is fine by me

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:22.270
I like a thing I don't like that we have

00:23:20.049 --> 00:23:24.130
-1 luck but the odds is that having an

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:25.559
impact one way or the other are probably

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:27.910
pretty low right now

00:23:25.559 --> 00:23:30.309
so every roles everything on the ground

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:31.480
we should take blood of the martyr very

00:23:30.309 --> 00:23:34.059
good damage upgrade in this case

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:38.410
actually we roll everything else we

00:23:34.059 --> 00:23:39.570
don't even need the golden key it was

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:42.160
fine

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:46.900
if you're sick of challenges by the way

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:48.130
I for one I feel you some of them are a

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.330
little bit too easy some of them are a

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:50.620
little too hard than some of them are

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:52.780
just kind of like artificially weird

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:55.150
what I would encourage you to do is just

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:57.309
relax a little bit take a long form

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:59.919
approach the situation if you hate the

00:23:57.309 --> 00:24:01.809
challenges there's only a month of them

00:23:59.919 --> 00:24:03.700
and once they're done they're done if

00:24:01.809 --> 00:24:05.770
you love the challenges this is a high

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:07.120
concentration to challenges you're

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:10.510
either you know you're getting a full

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:12.280
month of them in one spurt hear the word

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:18.640
I don't like using the did use in this

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:20.440
situation but either way forgot what I

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:23.620
was going to say moldy bread is pretty

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:25.870
solid though but yeah you know that no

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:27.520
one's getting a better or worse deal

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:29.950
there's going to be a static number of

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:32.580
challenges what I'm I supposed trying to

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.580
get at here

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:41.899
you could this is the like already

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:44.000
probably the longest fight against the

00:24:41.899 --> 00:24:46.730
hollow I've ever had for the hollow

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:54.740
fight to last more than 45 seconds is

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:56.960
like a serious problem grab dark bum and

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:59.570
then get the heck out of Dodge we got

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.590
two floors left to go and it's crazy but

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:02.210
it's going to be a little bit on the

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:03.889
short side as far as the video goes

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:05.210
despite having two challenges in it I

00:25:03.889 --> 00:25:06.769
mean it's not it might not even be a

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:08.240
month of challenges now I think about it

00:25:06.769 --> 00:25:13.399
obviously there's some we have to redo

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:15.379
but hey come this way please oh you're

00:25:13.399 --> 00:25:19.519
burning me up inside I will absolutely

00:25:15.379 --> 00:25:22.250
take Bob's brain I'm like Zane starved

00:25:19.519 --> 00:25:23.899
right now and I'm not talking about Zayn

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:26.960
Malik of everybody's favorite boy band

00:25:23.899 --> 00:25:29.659
One Direction okay although I am starved

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:32.269
of him as well Harry Styles nice

00:25:29.659 --> 00:25:36.139
dramatic turn in the 2017 Christopher

00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:37.879
Nolan film Dunkirk I haven't seen it I

00:25:36.139 --> 00:25:42.399
will see it at some point probably it'll

00:25:37.879 --> 00:25:46.039
take me a while and I do mean a while

00:25:42.399 --> 00:25:47.690
but it will happen at some point I'm

00:25:46.039 --> 00:25:49.879
looking forward to October go to the

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:54.620
multiplex see Thor Ragnarok if it's not

00:25:49.879 --> 00:25:58.490
garbage I'm inclined I would really like

00:25:54.620 --> 00:26:00.639
Taika Waititi I know that sounds like if

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:02.809
you're not familiar with the man's name

00:26:00.639 --> 00:26:07.500
you're like surely there must have been

00:26:02.809 --> 00:26:10.140
some kind of mistake no not true

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:11.530
what we did in the shadows hunt for the

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:13.090
wilderness

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:14.470
the Thor movies don't have a great track

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:16.450
record I get they're going in a

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:18.280
different direction but anyway I don't

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:19.990
know how many Isaac episodes I can do

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:23.200
where I talk about Thor specifically so

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:25.090
we should probably tone it down a little

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.230
bit and see Dunkirk it's been a lot of

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:32.290
good movies of summer though I still

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:33.490
haven't seen a Wonder Woman yet I really

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:39.730
thought I was going to be able to get in

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:41.830
there they got a controversial opinion

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:44.440
make less good movies make more junk

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:46.390
dude no one gets mad at you when you

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:48.850
haven't seen junk they just go hey nice

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:50.650
nice job avoiding the junk and I say

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:51.760
thank you and then they say what's

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:53.650
you're going to do with all that junk

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:56.080
all that junk inside that trunk and I

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:59.530
say will.i.am get out of here that's

00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:01.480
harassment I'm trying to go down a size

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:04.350
right now you're making me feel very

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:04.350
self-conscious

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:10.090
alright so easy orbital we played like

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:11.620
trash on this floor but we're also going

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:14.050
to finish the entire challenge within

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:15.640
like 12 minutes so I don't think we have

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:19.120
too much bounce to complain hey look

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:21.430
it's the pack get it I'm going to try to

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:23.320
add like a little bit of risk into this

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:24.880
by taking every single item despite the

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.830
fact that it's really just artificially

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:28.710
introducing a level of danger that is

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:32.080
completely unnecessary but hey dude

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:34.630
artificial is artificially introducing a

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:37.420
level of danger where there is none is

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:38.830
my middle name and boy dude I got to

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:41.760
tell you it makes it hard to fill out

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:41.760
forms on the Internet

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:48.880

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:52.030
film you may know it it's called

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:55.030
spider-man ever has problems with online

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:57.370
forms like what if you don't have a last

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:58.300
name and I know the obvious answer

00:27:57.370 --> 00:28:01.810
because they're always they always go

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:04.480
last name required we know whenever you

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:06.610
