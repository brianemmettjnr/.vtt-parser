##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.170
everybody 'welcome Agron or the language

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.500
binding of issac after birth plus where

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.540
the game has been merciful the game has

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.269
been bountiful I don't know if we can

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.790
use that phrase in that way either way

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.039
oh my god what a I mean it's good but

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.109
it's mean it's mixed it's got good

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.080
elements good speed horrible rate of

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:26.430
fire 15 is like I mean it's 50% worse

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:32.160
than average which is really bad HQ n 2

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:35.070
1 w HZ steven is a really really nice

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.989
item dude outbreak as well contagion is

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.190
a really really nice item as well but

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:45.719
this rate of fire is actually god-awful

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.570
trimmed woman I got so excited that she

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.219
was a loop I clapped what I saw it no

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.690
but shipped a loop you know I was

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.629
important for that room because I really

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.149
like would prefer not to ever have to

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.480
shoot any enemies if possible obviously

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:05.159
that's not going to be too likely but at

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:08.869
the same time barring a tears upgrade or

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.150
like a considerable improvement in our

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.650
lemme essentially are tears that I feel

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.740
like we're gonna be in kind of a weird

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.939
spot here and so one of those things

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.090
that's hard to articulate because I

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.729
think if you if you don't play that much

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.369
Isaac like if you're only a nerd and not

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.710
a turbo nerd like I am not that I'm

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.720
trying to people get weirdly like

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.340
defensive about that do you think you're

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.960
more of a nerd than I am no I don't mean

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.150
it like that I mean I've seen my daily

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.090
scores I know they're not always in the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.360
top you know 33.33% repeating of course

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.990
but I hope that you got to put yourself

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.869
in my shoes on this one we're shooting

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.329
not quite half as often as we usually do

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.259
but still infrequently and that's it's a

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.899
problem for us

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.310
let's see if we can get lucky here it's

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.020
lemon mishap again it's not bad

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.899
obviously but we're looking for like

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.210
mister boom or even kamikaze probably

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.719
would have been fine there but you know

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.280
we did our shot that we didn't get it

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:12.250
life goes on let's go beat the boss and

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.490
now hopefully we'll get a bomb out of it

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.820
Dead Sea Scrolls has actually been like

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:21.400
remarkably good so far

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.380
one day that'll backfire okay the first

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.820
tears upgrade here was not as good as I

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.020
thought it would be but it's hard to

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.700
complain about getting an all stats

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.600
upgrade and in general I'm not saying

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.500
this is like a 2 out of 10 run it would

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.480
be probably close to a 2 out of 10

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.490
especially knowing that our HP actually

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.230
wasn't that good to start with but in

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.730
fact our HP was 0 to start with so we

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.020
must have started with only two spirit

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.760
hearts which makes it look even worse

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:50.680
but our damage said starting at 5 that

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.750
actually buys us like a lot of tolerance

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.850
for failure on this run at least early

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:01.980
on but we do need to improve our DPS

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:04.240
like the S part of our dps is remarkable

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.260
that actually makes no sense because the

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.600
as part of dps is second and I don't

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.300
think you make my correct me if I'm

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.980
wrong but I read the news this morning

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.019
and I don't remember you know landmark

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.150
decision the length of time known as one

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.840
second has been changed now it's 1.1

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.880
seconds I did see the news that Amazon

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.330
bought whole foods and know what to

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.100
think about that as someone who

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.230
occasionally Shops at Whole Foods and

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.030
frequently orders from Amazon I was like

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:39.989
I mean I did tell me what to think is

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:42.010
all I'm asking I feel like I should be

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.049
negative about it because it's a

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.209
consolidation of two large businesses

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:49.180
and Whole Foods is already expensive but

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.100
also at the same time Amazon I know that

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.680
they have a perhaps of reputation for

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.850
not treating their workers that well

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.200
what I mean by that is not that they

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.049
don't get paid well but that they you

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.370
know this calls for them to unionize but

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.870
anyway the point is I'm not trying to

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.730
get into a labor dispute here that I

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:08.769
don't even understand the point is

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:13.570
Amazon is like one of two tech companies

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:16.479
where I'm like I should see it coming

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.669
that they will eventually be the company

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:21.849
that makes Skynet but for now I like

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:24.010
them it's like with I mean I know I make

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:25.270
my living on twitch in YouTube so what

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.460
I'm about to say is not business

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.460
really surprising but it's it's Amazon

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.750
and Google mostly where I'm like you

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.490
know you guys you got a good head on

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.330
your shoulders keep up the good work I

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:40.199
guess I'm lucky you know daddy longlegs

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:45.099
was it was a decent pickup by the way Oh

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:46.150
Tammy's had saved me like let me just

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:49.659
put it this way there are other

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.520
companies like I still use uber but

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:55.539
obviously there's been concerns about

00:04:51.520 --> 00:05:00.159
uber recently I feel like I would be

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:04.120
more apt to boycott uber if it was in my

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:06.370
area so instead like we were living in

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.750
the Stone Age I Dino Hoover has problems

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.940
as well I'm not trying to dispute that

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.319
whatsoever I don't know what I'm going

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.610
to reroll that into so we should just go

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:17.409
yeah let's get the heck out of here this

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.750
is gotten into some because now you

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:21.370
can't support a company every supporting

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.889
a company especially when their policies

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.960
are known is is sometimes almost like a

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:27.310
business decision and I long for the

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.110
days when things were simpler but we

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.469
can't necessarily go back to that time

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:35.560
so I know overs got concerns about

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:39.250
safety and workers rights and etc etc

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.560
but we're still rolling like just taxis

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.779
in Vancouver we haven't been

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.729
quote-unquote disrupted yet and that's a

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:48.639
good thing you know my grandfather was

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:50.199
actually a taxi driver whenever I tell

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.150
people like oh yeah when I go to the US

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:54.039
I use like ride-sharing programs they go

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.039
you don't know what it's like I know

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:58.569
what it's like it's it's a racket man

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:00.370
got to pay like you know eight hundred

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:01.779
thousand dollars for the taxi medallion

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.210
or wait until somebody in your family

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:05.770
who has the taxi medallion dies just for

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.770
the privilege of being able to drive

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.690
taxi which is not a you know an

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.639
extremely thankful job in and of itself

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.130
you people skipping out on fares and

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:17.380
being jerks ferrying around drunk people

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.599
all the time you know but that's that's

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.750
your lot in life when you provide that

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:26.979
service and you do get paid for it but

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:28.479
like just so much cheaper to use the

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:32.979
ride-sharing I'm sorry I find myself

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:35.289
being like not to mention like we're I

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:37.060
don't know this it's almost it's funny

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:37.719
that I feel like I shouldn't be talking

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.789
about

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:42.189
like this is a controversial issue for

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:43.689
me but like this stuff we say behind

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:46.779
closed doors every time we get in the

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:49.299
taxi it's like you know the taxi driver

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:50.799
is on their phone or they're driving

00:06:49.299 --> 00:06:52.239
like a freakin maniac

00:06:50.799 --> 00:06:55.809
please be Krampus because otherwise I

00:06:52.239 --> 00:06:57.729
can't take that driving like a maniac

00:06:55.809 --> 00:07:00.729
asking questions that are a little too

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:02.289
personal whenever I get into a new

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:04.269
variety like I'm being driven around by

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:06.339
somebody not necessarily was like a

00:07:04.269 --> 00:07:08.229
hundred percent committed to like oh

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:10.149
dude please sir would you like to you

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:11.559
know I brought some bottled bottled

00:07:10.149 --> 00:07:13.749
water for you I'm like that's too far

00:07:11.559 --> 00:07:16.179
man this is this whole ride is costing

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:17.499
me like 1/8 of what it should so please

00:07:16.179 --> 00:07:20.349
do not spend any more of your money

00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:23.110
trying to make my easy existence even

00:07:20.349 --> 00:07:26.409
easier although I appreciate it at the

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:28.569
same time it's not East anyway what I

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:30.309
was getting at is like you know with the

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:32.259
concerns that people have over over it

00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:35.169
over was like we bought which I'd be

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:37.149
like mm I don't know about this with

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:41.439
Amazon I was like I'm mostly ok with you

00:07:37.149 --> 00:07:46.599
because you are a kind bar delivery

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:48.639
service as far as I'm concerned we

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:50.379
should crack into this I think I don't

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:51.639
know it's complicated I shouldn't be

00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:58.329
talking about issues I don't fully

00:07:51.639 --> 00:08:00.429
understand that's the general gist of it

00:07:58.329 --> 00:08:02.739
more like the older I get the less I

00:08:00.429 --> 00:08:05.589
feel like I have to understand every

00:08:02.739 --> 00:08:08.199
issue and I think it's where you know

00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:09.550
when people like you approach being out

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:12.129
of touch when you start having opinions

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:14.229
on issues on opinions on issues where

00:08:12.129 --> 00:08:16.269
you don't have a decent profile of all

00:08:14.229 --> 00:08:17.889
the available information but you still

00:08:16.269 --> 00:08:19.539
for some reason care to have an opinion

00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:21.819
and I'm not quite there yet I'm at the

00:08:19.539 --> 00:08:23.679
laissez faire point of I don't really

00:08:21.819 --> 00:08:26.289
care to educate myself about this issue

00:08:23.679 --> 00:08:27.639
or at least all issues so instead I'm

00:08:26.289 --> 00:08:30.009
just going to choose not to have an

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:32.469
opinion about this issue because I'm

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:40.149
lazy and selective in that in that

00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:43.829
mindset all I know is when we when we

00:08:40.149 --> 00:08:45.899
were at e3 last year Bloom map

00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:47.300
runs just I mean we got a better rate of

00:08:45.899 --> 00:08:50.639
fire now I'm not really complaining but

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:53.579
we were at e3 last year we took a taxi

00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:56.429
from LAX to our hotel and it was like

00:08:53.579 --> 00:08:58.379
actually $60 and then when we came back

00:08:56.429 --> 00:09:03.720
from our hotel to LAX we took an uber

00:08:58.379 --> 00:09:06.209
and it was like you know what let's

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.619
lipstick with Dead Sea Scrolls let's see

00:09:06.209 --> 00:09:09.600
if we can make something happen we took

00:09:07.619 --> 00:09:14.489
a taxi or sorry we took an uber from our

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:16.889
hotel to the airport and it was like $14

00:09:14.489 --> 00:09:19.709
you got to do a lot to make up for that

00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:21.689
like 400% difference in price in terms

00:09:19.709 --> 00:09:28.799
of like why I won't use the service I

00:09:21.689 --> 00:09:30.420
think in other news water is wet the

00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:35.309
earth is round there's another

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:36.839
controversial opinion you get the idea

00:09:35.309 --> 00:09:39.029
anyway

00:09:36.839 --> 00:09:40.319
three minutes in here what's the profile

00:09:39.029 --> 00:09:46.769
of the run it's actually statistically

00:09:40.319 --> 00:09:48.059
pretty great now obviously our space bar

00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:49.889
item is not that good but I want to give

00:09:48.059 --> 00:09:51.600
it the chance that I feel it deserves

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:53.189
and to be honest with you our damage

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:57.089
could be a lot better and I think that

00:09:53.189 --> 00:09:58.589
we probably have ended up being slightly

00:09:57.089 --> 00:10:02.069
inhibited on this room because we had to

00:09:58.589 --> 00:10:06.360
curse the blinds in a row but that's not

00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:07.709
really that awful maybe we've saved

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.089
ourselves from taking a deal with the

00:10:07.709 --> 00:10:10.799
devil that we would have taken if we'd

00:10:09.089 --> 00:10:13.199
known what it was but would still have

00:10:10.799 --> 00:10:16.649
been too risky for example you know if

00:10:13.199 --> 00:10:18.809
there'd been like a shade in there and I

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:20.519
add one spirit hard left after I took it

00:10:18.809 --> 00:10:25.679
I might have gone for it it's

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:28.860
conceivable I'm not always the sharpest

00:10:25.679 --> 00:10:30.319
tool in the shed we don't have a curse

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.730
at all on this floor okay good good good

00:10:30.319 --> 00:10:33.779
the others like with no HP it's not like

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:37.199
we've got a per throat our way through

00:10:33.779 --> 00:10:38.490
that situation either so um for some

00:10:37.199 --> 00:10:41.069
reason I guess because we look like

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.910
Azazel I was like where is hazel but

00:10:41.069 --> 00:10:45.299
we're not as hazel

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:46.589
so we don't need to take tapeworm but

00:10:45.299 --> 00:10:48.269
that wasn't even tapeworm now that I

00:10:46.589 --> 00:10:50.100
think about it that was actually wiggle

00:10:48.269 --> 00:10:53.399
worm so there's like actually zero

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:55.620
reason to use that so okay proptosis has

00:10:53.399 --> 00:10:57.330
actually completely changed the

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:59.670
the tone of this run we will now win

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:03.000
probably easily which is really exciting

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:05.040
I mean it's not the first time I've ever

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.870
won a game in the binding of issac but

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:10.380
you know what you've gotta act excited

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:13.080
nonetheless because you never know these

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:14.610
runs are always like on paper they're a

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.940
dice roll whether or not you're going to

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:19.470
get the tools necessary to succeed

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:20.520
without tutu my own horn because I don't

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.080
think you know we even had a

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:26.120
double-digit streak in like a month

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:29.339
but without without Tooting my own horn

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:31.440
one of the only ways one of the most

00:11:29.339 --> 00:11:34.610
likely ways that we lose is just from

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:36.450
having garbage stuffed show up so as

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:40.260
long as we know that we don't have

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:44.640
garbage it eliminates the possibility of

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:46.230
us being forced to lose instead it means

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:49.020
that there's only two possibilities a

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:52.620
thankless win where everybody goes well

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:54.600
of course you on that one or a horribly

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:59.630
embarrassing loss where people go are

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.630
you feeling okay this is like you jokes

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:05.010
so in a way we got to reveal the extra

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.390
pressure to get that win because if we

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:10.130
don't get the win then it's going to be

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:12.930
you know a nightmare a social nightmare

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:17.910
anyway doesn't really matter in the

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:21.000
whole scheme of things that's they came

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:24.060
across as like needlessly nihilistic

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.410
great twitch name by the way those

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:28.470
really matter in the little scheme of

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:30.029
things nah man I mean in a way it does I

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:33.900
think you got to take pride in your work

00:12:30.029 --> 00:12:36.360
and it's really difficult to take pride

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:40.440
in your commentary I mean that sincerely

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:42.500
like there you might think that this you

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:46.080
know off-topic stream-of-consciousness

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:47.970
you know coming up with bits that are

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:51.750
supposed to be funny at runtime is is

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:54.000
very easy and in a way it is at least

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:56.730
effortless effortless but it's not easy

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.380
you know it's not like a faucet you can

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:59.100
just turn on and off you kind of it's

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.459
like water

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:03.870
divining is that the word that they use

00:13:01.459 --> 00:13:05.820
that's not real right the thing you hold

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:07.680
like a stick and try to find water you

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.089
know it sounds like I'm an idiot you

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.909
know you find a four

00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:15.149
divining rod and use the divining rod to

00:13:11.909 --> 00:13:19.319
find water in the ground am i I will

00:13:15.149 --> 00:13:21.299
suggest that just by saying this by

00:13:19.319 --> 00:13:22.469
describing this anyone who's not heard

00:13:21.299 --> 00:13:25.739
of it is going to think that I'm having

00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:29.609
a stroke live on camera but like this is

00:13:25.739 --> 00:13:31.379
it's a real genuine thing and by real I

00:13:29.609 --> 00:13:33.419
mean people do it I don't mean that it

00:13:31.379 --> 00:13:35.789
really works but you know what this is a

00:13:33.419 --> 00:13:39.209
good opportunity for NL's Wikipedia

00:13:35.789 --> 00:13:41.249
corner wiki water looky looky look at

00:13:39.209 --> 00:13:43.979
water wicked wiki water water divining

00:13:41.249 --> 00:13:46.399
okay water divine underwater diving no

00:13:43.979 --> 00:13:51.509
that's I search water diving water

00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:53.789
diviner there you go okay dowsing that's

00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:55.319
it dowsing is a type of divination

00:13:53.789 --> 00:13:57.719
employed and attempts to locate

00:13:55.319 --> 00:14:01.109
groundwater buried metals or ores

00:13:57.719 --> 00:14:04.409
gemstones oil gravesites or many other

00:14:01.109 --> 00:14:06.179
objects dowsing is considered a

00:14:04.409 --> 00:14:07.679
pseudoscience and there's no scientific

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:12.479
evidence that it's any more effective

00:14:07.679 --> 00:14:15.779
than random chance really you think I'd

00:14:12.479 --> 00:14:17.969
be surprised a 1990 double-blind study

00:14:15.779 --> 00:14:20.009
was undertaken in Kassel Germany under

00:14:17.969 --> 00:14:23.639
the direction of the Gessle shafa sir

00:14:20.009 --> 00:14:26.759
vicen shaft lickin I didn't make that up

00:14:23.639 --> 00:14:29.639
on Thurs suckin Vong para visa in

00:14:26.759 --> 00:14:31.379
shopton the Society for the scientific

00:14:29.639 --> 00:14:35.009
investigation of the parents I para

00:14:31.379 --> 00:14:38.669
Sciences James Randi offered a $10,000

00:14:35.009 --> 00:14:42.029
prize to any successful dowser all the

00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:43.709
dowsers signs then it stated agreement

00:14:42.029 --> 00:14:45.389
stating it was a fair test however the

00:14:43.709 --> 00:14:47.429
results were no better than chance and

00:14:45.389 --> 00:14:51.409
thus no one was awarded the prize get

00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:51.409
stopped buddy James Randi wins again

00:14:54.560 --> 00:15:01.100
but yeah that's that's what my

00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:03.780
particular brand of comedy is like

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:05.730
sometimes I got to throw leaves out

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:07.260
there and then just see what hit so what

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:09.930
I'm essentially saying is that my brand

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:12.780
of comedy is a fraudulent pseudoscience

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:18.780
practiced exclusively by charlatans and

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:22.920
largely debunked in the modern era I to

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:24.270
be fair I feel like watered I mean they

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.550
called it something of dowsing that's

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:29.580
right I've always heard the term water

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:31.440
divining but anyway I feel he has a sort

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:33.750
of thing I heard about occasionally as a

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:38.420
child and have literally not heard about

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:41.010
in like at least 10 years I don't know

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:43.020
it's been a while at least I don't think

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:46.080
it's necessarily dead I think it's more

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:47.310
just like I'm more careful about the

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.990
company I keep maybe

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:50.310
dude we should reroll that out you don't

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:52.890
get too many opportunities to reroll

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:55.100
skull items they gave us sad bombs which

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:58.920
is of course you know exquisite and

00:15:55.100 --> 00:16:01.790
continue moving on here that's one of

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:04.590
those pseudo-sciences where I go like

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:07.590
it's not fair because it probably

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:12.270
started in like the 1700s or something

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:14.970
like that and then I don't mean this to

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:18.390
be rude but people are Dumber back then

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:21.780
and I there's there's problems with

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:23.580
today's society without a doubt and I

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:25.590
don't deign to know how to fix them

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:27.180
that's the first step is identifying the

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:28.380
problem the second step is fixing it I

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:32.010
haven't gotten to that point yet and

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:33.900
probably never will but you know we are

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:35.520
so skeptical as a generation you know

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:38.760
anytime we see anything all fake

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.830
Photoshop but that's as annoying as that

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:43.470
isn't the people like hand-wringing

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:45.840
can't we hit can't we believe in

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:48.690
anything anymore no it's a good thing it

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:50.730
means you know a healthy skepticism is

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:53.130
positive it makes you more resilient to

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:55.410
being you know taking advantage of

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:57.420
basically does it make you more jaded

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:59.160
yet to some extent but I think you can

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.960
find a balance that you know protects

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:04.260
you without ruining your ability to find

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:05.629
joy in anything we definitely want this

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.579
I think

00:17:05.629 --> 00:17:10.959
why I take one makes you larger I mean

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:13.959
at this point just just for just fun but

00:17:10.959 --> 00:17:16.669
you know back then they didn't have

00:17:13.959 --> 00:17:19.759
Wikipedia you know if you own like one

00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:24.459
book you were the second richest man in

00:17:19.759 --> 00:17:24.459
your town next to you know the minister

00:17:24.639 --> 00:17:30.320
so you'd be like oh yeah we I just hold

00:17:27.289 --> 00:17:33.309
this fort twig and then I find ground

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:36.609
water you're like wow that's amazing

00:17:33.309 --> 00:17:39.139
world works in mysterious ways right

00:17:36.609 --> 00:17:42.190
feel like you just kind of can't do that

00:17:39.139 --> 00:17:44.929
anymore and you were like like I just I

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:46.820
can't even talk about something that

00:17:44.929 --> 00:17:48.590
actually happened to me without people

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.239
being like fake and you're gonna tell me

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:57.529
that you're gonna walk around being like

00:17:50.239 --> 00:18:00.559
this branch finds oil yeah okay I wonder

00:17:57.529 --> 00:18:03.489
sometimes I feel about like like a

00:18:00.559 --> 00:18:07.309
horoscopes as well in it if you enjoyed

00:18:03.489 --> 00:18:10.429
horoscopes as like as entertainment this

00:18:07.309 --> 00:18:14.779
is not meant as a damnation whatsoever

00:18:10.429 --> 00:18:18.139
but an actual like prediction of of how

00:18:14.779 --> 00:18:20.479
your week is going to go maybe it's

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:23.809
because you know I live in the city and

00:18:20.479 --> 00:18:26.059
I keep company that is as smarmy as I am

00:18:23.809 --> 00:18:27.769
but I'm like I don't think I've heard

00:18:26.059 --> 00:18:31.729
anybody talk about horoscopes in a way

00:18:27.769 --> 00:18:34.340
that was not like derisive in a long

00:18:31.729 --> 00:18:38.029
time man and I was putting them all on

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:43.820
blast today water diviners uber and

00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:48.289
horoscopes no sacred cows man let's do

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:49.879
it whoa I did not know that you're going

00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:52.190
to be like how did you not know that but

00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:53.929
I think that might have illuminated us

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:55.820
her a lot of people you think like 5-1

00:18:53.929 --> 00:19:01.220
makes you larger it gives you stompy

00:18:55.820 --> 00:19:04.789
what a horrible gift also I do not have

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:06.919
stompy or I mean because I'm flying I

00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:09.559
don't have stompy even though it works

00:19:06.919 --> 00:19:11.950
with every other combination sure okay

00:19:09.559 --> 00:19:11.950
whatever

00:19:12.269 --> 00:19:22.619
I don't know man is just it's weird I do

00:19:20.369 --> 00:19:27.509
feel like to some extent we sort of like

00:19:22.619 --> 00:19:31.049
lost we've lost something as a society I

00:19:27.509 --> 00:19:35.940
think it's worth what we've gained many

00:19:31.049 --> 00:19:39.469
people are still getting scammed there's

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:42.629
no doubt about that like probably like

00:19:39.469 --> 00:19:46.379
1/4 of the telephone calls I get our

00:19:42.629 --> 00:19:49.169
attempted scams I think is like hey your

00:19:46.379 --> 00:19:50.789
packages here and then there's uh we

00:19:49.169 --> 00:19:53.909
tried to deliver your package but no one

00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:56.279
was there you liars I never leave you

00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:58.379
I'm here the whole time but you know

00:19:56.279 --> 00:20:00.389
what I understand it's our job I'll I'll

00:19:58.379 --> 00:20:01.769
go pick it up it doesn't bother me kids

00:20:00.389 --> 00:20:03.809
need a reason to get out of the house it

00:20:01.769 --> 00:20:06.929
does bother me but let's not make any

00:20:03.809 --> 00:20:10.259
more enemies in today's episode and then

00:20:06.929 --> 00:20:13.349
there's like you know hey no please give

00:20:10.259 --> 00:20:16.200
us a call back at the dentist's office

00:20:13.349 --> 00:20:19.200
or your car dealership you know you got

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:21.179
a your next maintenance appointment is

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.669
coming up for either your teeth or your

00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:25.909
muffler and then I don't know anything

00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:28.889
about cars or teeth for that matter and

00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:31.469
then there's like hey oh yeah this is um

00:20:28.889 --> 00:20:33.029
it's Bill Gates from Microsoft : your

00:20:31.469 --> 00:20:37.379
computer's got a virus can you uh give

00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:40.079
us a call back that's the one quarter

00:20:37.379 --> 00:20:44.839
right there dude magic mush I was just

00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:44.839
about to say screw this I'm not using Oh

00:20:47.899 --> 00:20:55.259
I'm not using I'm not using come not

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:56.219
using my bombs to get any more rerolls

00:20:55.259 --> 00:20:57.629
here I'd rather just use my money

00:20:56.219 --> 00:20:59.789
because we have sad bombs but that last

00:20:57.629 --> 00:21:03.779
reroll came through in the clutch if

00:20:59.789 --> 00:21:07.200
you're like I'm this is kind of a weird

00:21:03.779 --> 00:21:10.649
question but if you're like 14 have you

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:11.940
ever lived in a world without cellular

00:21:10.649 --> 00:21:14.759
telephone spam

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:16.079
look at that 999 all honestly what we

00:21:14.759 --> 00:21:18.029
should do right now is just blow it up

00:21:16.079 --> 00:21:20.700
and then say we finally did it we took

00:21:18.029 --> 00:21:24.860
our donation machine back to back to

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:26.960
relative safety because

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:28.880
it might surprise you I'm not trying to

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:31.940
double back in my day you know six years

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:36.110
ago but now they're sincerely used to be

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:37.940
no cellphone spam at least there used to

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:41.240
be highly limited I remember like

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:44.090
probably around like 2008-2009 I started

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:45.520
hearing about cellphone spam and I was

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:48.620
like how do you even do that

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:52.190
like you got to send a cellular

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:55.220
telephone spam message to somebody it

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:56.929
seems so so strange obviously in this

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:59.360
day and age it happens like all the time

00:21:56.929 --> 00:22:01.960
but well it actually it doesn't happen

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:05.600
as much as email spam I guess but still

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:07.100
that's why I have essentially be have

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.750
you seen the big short I've essentially

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:16.100
become Brad Pitt from the big short it

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:17.870
would sometimes if like let's say we're

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:21.290
have like a clothing store and Kate buys

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:23.570
a shirt now again we get like an email

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:25.340
address to register their shirt to I'm

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:27.770
just like no no thank you

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:29.179
I'd rather not and they're likely just

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.770
like we're not going to do anything with

00:22:29.179 --> 00:22:34.309
your tape can we get your email address

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:36.410
now how about a phone number also no

00:22:34.309 --> 00:22:38.330
thank you if possible and I get that it

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:40.640
makes me look like a paranoid weirdo

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:44.179
because I'm self aware but at the same

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:48.040
time I'm like excuse me what happened

00:22:44.179 --> 00:22:51.980
there at the same time though I'm like

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:54.169
you know old Navy you got no reason I'm

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:55.820
not doing boss rush I mean like our

00:22:54.169 --> 00:22:58.429
stats are good but I'm not doing boss

00:22:55.820 --> 00:23:00.679
rush for a room bag on a non daily you

00:22:58.429 --> 00:23:02.270
know that's where I draw the line I'm

00:23:00.679 --> 00:23:03.860
like Old Navy you don't need to know my

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:06.470
email address here's my relationship

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:08.179
with Old Navy hey there's the old Navy I

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:09.950
can go in there and buy shirts I don't

00:23:08.179 --> 00:23:11.350
need you to email me and be like we got

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:13.669
shirts I know

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:16.460
hey we got a sale on this week I know

00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:19.520
you always have a sale on that's oh I've

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:21.710
been waiting to buy that shirt normally

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:23.540
it was $22 now it's on sale for twenty

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:24.980
one fifty I got to go down to Old Navy

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:26.780
buy that shirt you don't need to have my

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.740
email address you certainly don't need

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:29.660
to have my phone number

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:31.010
never in my life has there ever been a

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:34.070
situation where I've come back from an

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:35.900
Old Navy and been like you know oh I

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:37.130
wish the old navy representative would

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.370
call me because I got a lot of questions

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:42.030
about how to use this show

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:43.500
our relationships Thompson ends you know

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:47.280
when you say have a nice day and I say

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:49.320
thank you you too or what happens more

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.940
likely enjoy your new outfit yeah you

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:54.179
too oh what's what I meant to say was

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:56.520
have a good day you know there's no need

00:23:54.179 --> 00:23:59.720
to add in all this excess data here to

00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:04.970
complicate it it could only be misused

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:07.470
because there's no proper use for it and

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:10.169
then like sometimes they have like the

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:12.330
privacy policy on the store counter and

00:24:10.169 --> 00:24:15.990
they're like we keep your data safe and

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:18.630
I'm like well sorta BAE I believe that

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:21.809
you intend to but at the same time like

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:23.460
I don't know the 16 year old sales

00:24:21.809 --> 00:24:26.220
associate is the person that I'm going

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:28.440
to inundate with self-righteous

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:29.880
questions about oh do you guys a hash

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:32.820
and salt my phone number in your

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:35.700
database like the answer is probably yes

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:38.909
I assume but anyway the point is it's

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:41.640
not like it happened I get that it's

00:24:38.909 --> 00:24:43.289
part of it is they might sell your

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.789
information advertisers that actually

00:24:43.289 --> 00:24:47.370
does not bother me when people go like

00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:48.360
you know I know I delete all my cookies

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:52.679
because I don't want targeted

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:54.690
advertising I'm like you are entitled of

00:24:52.679 --> 00:24:57.960
that opinion but I also think that

00:24:54.690 --> 00:25:01.770
that's a little ridiculous targeted

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:03.510
advertising in my I mean again kind of

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:06.090
like avoiding biting the hand that feeds

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:08.039
for one but I genuinely am like I'm not

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:09.600
concerned about targeted advertising if

00:25:08.039 --> 00:25:11.549
I was looking at sometimes people get

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.140
like offended they're like I was looking

00:25:11.549 --> 00:25:15.240
at shoes online for two hours and then

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:17.970
Google showed me an ad for shoes like

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:22.080
Dae Big Brother and I'm like yeah but

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:23.520
like it's not I'm not going to be

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.200
self-righteous about it to the extent of

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.760
like while it may get the ads are better

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.770
because they're targeted but if that

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:30.450
works for you then it works for you I'm

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:32.130
not going to I'm not going to insult you

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:33.360
by suggesting they you know you couldn't

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:36.659
follow that line of reasoning for

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:39.630
yourself however I don't mind targeted

00:25:36.659 --> 00:25:42.720
advertising what I do mind is like Kate

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:47.490
and I purchased some tea from a tea

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:50.010
store recently that's the the leafy you

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:52.680
know brewed beverage not the

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:57.090
secondary sex hormone testosterone also

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:58.620
commonly referred to as tea and the dude

00:25:57.090 --> 00:26:00.530
at the counter was like hey can we get a

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:06.570
phone number for this account I was like

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:10.530
nah it's tea I don't need a consultant

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:12.660
and I don't need you to ever like text

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:15.750
me and be like how's the tea if it's

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:20.550
good I'll come back if it's bad I won't

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:22.260
it's a tale as old as time it's the

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:27.690
fundamental underpinning of our

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:29.040
capitalist society - and you know I'm

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:31.470
making myself look like some kind of

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:33.600
weird techno Robin Hood or something

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:35.520
here but to their credit nobody has ever

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:38.490
been like I need a phone number you

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.780
can't have the tea but I just I just

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:41.910
don't understand

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:43.770
I mean I'd okay that's not true I do

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:46.860
understand but I don't understand why

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:48.980
nobody else saying no it's not that it's

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:55.080
a big deal it's just that it's

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:57.570
completely unnecessary I want to I want

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:59.400
to create the culture I want to point

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:02.030
out that I am actually socially

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:05.520
competent I don't go out wearing like a

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:07.770
fanny pack on backwards or something

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.390
like that going like you know oh yeah

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:14.940
I'm a sovereign citizen you know I don't

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:19.290
I don't do that you know what I'll tell

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:20.550
you what I'm not going to I want

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:22.050
permanent Polaroid invincibility for

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:24.120
this I'm not going to go do the hush

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:25.800
fight but I am going to go play this guy

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:27.990
because now that we have nine lives I

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:32.220
think we can afford - I actually I'm

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:35.940
nice to serve his people dokdo just blew

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:38.730
him up again I understand the retail is

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:41.580
a tough job you got to deal with morons

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:43.590
like me all day I worked a goodwill you

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:46.350
it's like retail plus people drop off

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:48.720
literal garbage and go oh you can't sell

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:51.690
my garbage what do you mean like I know

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:53.340
there's actual animal feces in the in

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:55.500
the box that I brought in but you can't

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:57.810
just like clean it and then sell the

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:59.940
shirt sitting for 75 cents each you know

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:02.580
that's not cost-effective man this is

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.750
not for profit company anyway the point

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:08.000
is

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:12.210
I want it to be okay to say no so I am

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.830
in the pettiest sense I'm Mahatma Gandhi

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:17.670
be the change you want to see in the

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:19.230
world they say can I have a phone number

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:20.300
for this account and I say nah that's

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:23.760
okay

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:25.350
you know what you got to give me

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:28.530
something if you if you offer me a

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:32.040
discount I'll think about it that that's

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:33.630
an offset for the risk if you're like

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:37.830
we'll bring you exclusive offers I'm

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:39.870
like nah I don't like trading away

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:41.550
Steven Stamkos for future considerations

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:43.290
I need something concrete you know you

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:45.480
can talk to my lawyer and we'll discuss

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:47.730
the you know requisition of the email

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:50.160
address at a later date but for now I'm

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:54.240
not comfortable I just thought if you

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:56.160
buy like a computer hotter percent I

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:57.510
understand it you might have problems

00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.300
with that computer here's your phone

00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:02.790
number here's your email address you

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:05.640
know get in touch buy a card buy a house

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:08.130
these are like no-brainers okay buying

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:11.610
something expensive it helps to have a

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:14.520
contact and Slatin buying it sometimes I

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:17.310
go to the pet store you know and by

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:19.440
sometimes I mean like literally once

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:21.270
every three weeks to buy exactly the

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.010
same thing and they go got an email

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:27.150
address on file with us and like nah

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:29.040
dude let you want my customer profile

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:31.260
I'll give you all the information I need

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:34.050
I need to give you right now I buy the

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:36.600
same bag of cat food once every three

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:38.940
weeks and then every second time I buy

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.680
the cat food I also buy the exact same

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:45.050
brand of cat litter because they've run

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:45.050
out in like you know a two-to-one ratio

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:51.230
not quite guppy but the dream does

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:51.230
persist here

00:29:53.950 --> 00:30:03.520
anyway I don't think that makes me

00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:05.890
officially off my rocker yes I start

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:07.690
wearing like a Rorschach balaclava so

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:09.310
you know that all the CCTV cameras they

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:11.320
identify your facial signature you know

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:15.330
then we'll start talking about it but

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:18.430
for now you knows yeah when I go - oh

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:19.930
that's Anarchist Cookbook that is the

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:23.410
best anarchists cookbook of all time

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:26.140
actually though when I go to you know

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:28.800
London Drugs which is our version it's

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:30.880
like a pharmacy plus general story and

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:33.400
they're like you have a phone number I'm

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:35.080
like that's not what you're asking of

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.610
course I have a phone number it's the

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.310
year 2017

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:42.340
what do you think of some kind of weirdo

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:44.530
you think I'm nuts it's all spectacle to

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:46.210
you okay so we're going to we're going

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:51.670
to win this run and it's been a fast run

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:52.900
as well but like I am NOT a hundred

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:56.350
percent confident that it's going to be

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:58.990
automatic - by the way how many curses

00:30:56.350 --> 00:31:02.650
of the blind you got to give a man on

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:05.350
one run sad bombs like sincerely should

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:06.400
basically kill everything I'm not

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:10.180
worried about permanent polar

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:12.160
invincibility right now the more HP the

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:18.310
merrier as far as I'm concerned on an on

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:19.600
a raw absolute level ignore the frames I

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:22.890
got a very important Skype message

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:24.940
that's probably about nothing at all

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:31.390
well you know what let's go to let's go

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:34.060
to Skype corner here okay I mean it's

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:35.650
not anything important it's just asking

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:37.690
if you wanted to play the Dark Souls

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:39.250
board game the answer is yes but

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:43.090
unfortunately I don't have time right

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:45.700
now and if you asked her my phone number

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:49.530
I'm a nice view I didn't feel natural

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:49.530
coming out of my mouth I apologize

00:31:52.749 --> 00:32:00.409
copy and you can tell you right off the

00:31:55.639 --> 00:32:01.849
bat that Ian's copy you know what and

00:32:00.409 --> 00:32:03.679
this is what I meant earlier I said you

00:32:01.849 --> 00:32:05.749
can't just turn the commentary faucet

00:32:03.679 --> 00:32:07.699
like on and off you got to find it I

00:32:05.749 --> 00:32:10.039
think we found it on today's episode we

00:32:07.699 --> 00:32:10.609
found some disparate topics to talk

00:32:10.039 --> 00:32:15.709
about

00:32:10.609 --> 00:32:19.489
I am I participated in my brand my brand

00:32:15.709 --> 00:32:20.979
of humor which is essentially taking

00:32:19.489 --> 00:32:23.089
something absurd about myself

00:32:20.979 --> 00:32:24.889
exaggerating it very slightly and then

00:32:23.089 --> 00:32:26.389
you know playing it up to an extreme

00:32:24.889 --> 00:32:29.509
sorry about that mouse pointer by the

00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:34.009
way and and here we are I don't know

00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:35.749
what that is well one thing's for

00:32:34.009 --> 00:32:39.039
certain if there's any algae's in here

00:32:35.749 --> 00:32:42.919
we just win all right

00:32:39.039 --> 00:32:46.539
Empress Empress Empress Empress Empress

00:32:42.919 --> 00:32:50.749
tell me the news I got a slight case of

00:32:46.539 --> 00:32:52.999
statistical infuse okay well you know

00:32:50.749 --> 00:32:54.799
they say always leave it on the high

00:32:52.999 --> 00:32:57.909
note so I guess we'll be sticking around

00:32:54.799 --> 00:32:57.909
for a little while longer

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:05.000
and no delirium portal so we're going to

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:07.460
go very fast around I hope you enjoyed

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.019
it wasn't intended to be rushed but that

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:10.760
curse of the blind brimstone pickup

00:33:09.019 --> 00:33:12.080
really gave us a guarantee there but for

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.010
