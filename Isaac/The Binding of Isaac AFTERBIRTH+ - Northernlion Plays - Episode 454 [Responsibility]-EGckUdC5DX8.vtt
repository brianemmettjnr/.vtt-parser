00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.440
everybody welcome back to northern lion

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.140
place abiding by scattereth plus I've

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.330
been playing okay but making like dumb

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.260
decisions that make it look like I have

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.120
holes in my brain

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.710
Oh what do i what am I supposed to do on

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.389
this episode oh I messed it up I did the

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.369
wrong thing Oh what is this sytem do it

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.140
does this no it doesn't it does this I'm

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.080
gonna I'm not gonna make excuses I

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.519
should know this stuff I'm busy I got a

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.380
lot of knowledge coming into the brain

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.630
it's seemingly pushing other knowledge

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.039
out of the cache we're gonna the the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.990
buck stops with me we're gonna be

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.460
smarter play better starting now or at

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.340
least there's gonna be an honest effort

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.899
to do that and you know what it's a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.450
great start if we just play as the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.070
keeper and win and as far as I'm

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.600
concerned this is also the easiest thing

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.070
to do not the easiest thing to

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.390
accomplish but the simplest thing to do

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.649
because we just finish it we don't have

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.850
to worry about oh you got to get this

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.399
you got to get this just don't get it

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.690
two times before you can get a coin qwg

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.230
seven swing it's the young Sheldon

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.809
catchphrase

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.100
he's always swinging that's the number

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.449
one thing you need to know about young

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.970
Sheldon the dude loves to swing Busch

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.130
mingi anyway whatever happened to

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.869
bazinga they were like the biggest

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.670
mobile game developer in Earth's history

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.860
and now they're just gone what a sad

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.750
story everybody week for them

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.710
question mark card it can get us out of

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.890
a jam it's not really our number one

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.780
happiest thing in the world here small

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.950
rock is lovely though I mean it does I

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.299
think it does come with a tears

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.610
downgrade which I always forget about

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.200
and dude my best friend which is

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.390
actually punching bag doing some great

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.460
work they're actually sucking up aggro

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.320
usually it just annoys the Christ out of

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.850
me but here it's actually doing some

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.460
positive stuff even if it does look

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.159
almost exactly the same as the other

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.520
human popcorn in my periphery I'm happy

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.979
that it's they're not causing many

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.640
problems so what's the game plan

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:57.030
it's always very simple if not easy

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.439
again there's a distinction there you

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.829
know some things are very simple to do

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.659
but not easy for example running a

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.060
marathon it's the simplest thing in the

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.649
world all you have to do is you know

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.690
train to the point where you can run for

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.890
26.2 miles whether where's the problem

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.500
in that there shouldn't be any problem

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.650
at all in practice very difficult you

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.680
know

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.140
you gotta actually get up out of bed you

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.549
know it once you got to get up once out

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.829
of bed every day to begin with that

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.480
think but you know you got to get out of

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:27.180
bed four or five times a week and bust

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.860
out some long runs it's gonna be a

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.060
nightmare for you or not a nightmare

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.400
that's a little bit of a limiting belief

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.930
I suppose but you know what I mean some

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.340
things are very complicated but easy

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:42.450
like trying to think of a good example

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.609
making making fermented foods you know

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.139
the the concept of making a fermented

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.430
food requires a lot of science even

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:49.920
though it was done early in human

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.170
history and yet the process itself is

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.349
very simple you know yeast in the air

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.379
plus something for them to eat inside of

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.450
an airtight container equals a baby

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:04.370
you've got a stew going only the stew is

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.299
potentially alcoholic what a world now

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.459
now that I've made that completely

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.220
arbitrary and needlessly verbose

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.650
description the keeper simple but

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.879
difficult also simple and clean is the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.849
way that he's making me feel tonight

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:20.699
it's hard to let him go that's not

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.739
that's right I played Kingdom Hearts all

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:24.269
the way through I might add did I tear

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.530
up a little bit at the simple and

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.909
clean.the first time I heard it maybe I

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.379
did I was 13 and Haley Joel Osment was

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.150
on top of the world so what's it to you

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.379
we're gonna leave kidney stone I mean

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.049
we're gonna we're gonna do what we do

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:39.209
we're gonna leave a lot behind here

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.549
because it's not really hyper relevant

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.220
to our concern as the as the keeper like

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.799
an arcade could be relevant no question

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.229
there so I'd like to look for that but I

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.639
don't want to risk Oh exactly what just

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.810
happened I didn't want to risk taking

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:54.049
damage on rooms that it was not

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.129
necessary to go to now mind you we

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.989
probably wouldn't have taken a deal with

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:02.040
the devil anyway unless it was extremely

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:05.190
high quality because we needed HP to

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.329
make it work and we didn't get HP so

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.120
we're heading down in the next floor

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.859
here it's not a speed run we're just

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.209
trimming the fat off the stuff that we

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.010
don't need to do because as the keeper

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.329
is very dangerous so I'd say our

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.090
question mark card you know we got our

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.769
money's worth out of that truth be told

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.900
we're not very happy with our our last

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.060
floor worth of items kidney stone you

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.159
might think that you boy is losing his

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.100
aim it's not the case kidney stone lost

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:29.260
the same for

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.680
I'm more than happy to take a zany item

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:35.170
that affects our stats on a neutral

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.000
level when an item has dubious gain

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.220
which I would say kidney stone does and

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.900
also affects your stats in a negative

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.730
way that's where your boy starts to get

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.550
a little upset that's when your boy says

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.590
why are you imposing a Zayn tax there's

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.240
already a Zayn tax

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.800
it's called potentially getting yourself

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.240
killed or at least inhibiting the value

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.340
of your run because you're choosing the

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.930
Zayn over something more traditionally

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.280
good instead some of these items have

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.950
been balanced in such a way that they're

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.350
like not only are they zany and maybe a

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.990
little bit you know neutral in there

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.830
inert in their value to you on the run

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.540
but we're gonna make them like

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.370
objectively bad so hey here's a speed

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.020
downgrade on kidney stone just because

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.270
you were looking a little too happy

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.030
there for a brief period of time so I

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.590
I'm engaging in a silent protest that is

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.330
actually very loud and exposed to a

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.520
relatively large audience given the size

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.280
of what you know whatever audience for

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.510
rebirth is left on planet Earth and

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.430
being annoying about it see you on

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.140
mushroom I love this sytem look at the

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.870
rate of fire increase on that despite

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:39.130
the minor damage downgrade your boys

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.340
extremely pleased with this how oh what

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.960
the

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.740
he curved the bullet something curved

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:47.140
the bullet there there that was a total

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:50.560
100% wanted moment starring Angelina

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.780
Jolie and James McAvoy and might I add a

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.220
young Chris Pratt in a pre Parks and

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.860
Recreation role a lot of people don't

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.180
know that I didn't the first time I saw

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.760
a wanted for sure which was

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.760
embarrassingly enough in theaters anyway

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:08.020
this run is actually shaping up real

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.460
nicely right now deal with the devil be

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.710
darned I apologize to the strong

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.990
language google deepmind is gonna

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.370
penalize me for that and i you know what

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.300
all i can say is that i deserve because

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.460
if i argue with it

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.720
we'll get double d monetized and you

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.730
don't want to get double d monetized

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:26.200
polydactyly gives us a judgement card a

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:30.900
judgement card so the interesting

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:33.070
conundrum isn't it this judgement card a

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.790
demon judgement is not good for us

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:38.860
unless we get either swallowed penny or

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:41.530
nuns have it in fact even nuns habit is

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:45.039
not really that good for us but we might

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:47.110
try it here and a regular judgement see

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:49.780
what I mean a regular judgment actually

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.100
could be really good for us but it's too

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.169
late because we've already seen that

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:56.350
it's a demon judgment which we'll try to

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:58.630
get some value out of but wow that was

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:00.250
really dumb of me but the only thing

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.210
that really matters it is at the end of

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:05.500
this run whether or not we come through

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:07.180
with the the win right this is a

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.850
performance driven run without a doubt

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:14.020
so we're gonna try to give you two plays

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:17.229
it's very risky we're not gonna push our

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:21.160
luck here we're like really not gonna

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:23.830
push our luck here if I could get like a

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.180
goat head but even if I don't know

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.680
what's the best item that demon

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.740
judgement can give you we don't want

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.849
likes in robes necessarily oh man that

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.949
was really dumb as well

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:34.479
we don't want sin robes necessarily even

00:07:32.949 --> 00:07:37.509
though it is like minor stats we'd much

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:42.849
prefer like pacts even go ahead we don't

00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:44.139
necessarily want I don't think he can

00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:45.669
just give you brimstone you know it's a

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:47.770
realistic item he could give us that

00:07:45.669 --> 00:07:51.039
we'd really like to have is any ability

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:52.479
to fly pretty high value in this

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:55.150
situation normally you want to get

00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:56.229
something like goat head normally you

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:59.349
want to get something like goat head you

00:07:56.229 --> 00:08:01.060
know gives you the ability to get

00:07:59.349 --> 00:08:02.470
progressively stronger on a run start

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.210
that positive feedback loop we're not

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:06.039
looking for that this time this time

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:10.389
we're looking for something a little bit

00:08:06.039 --> 00:08:11.710
more you know grab and go we're not

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:16.289
looking for vitamins we're looking for

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:18.580
calories all right so we got our coin oh

00:08:16.289 --> 00:08:20.440
it's not bad actually this is a room

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.789
that we wouldn't have minded going to in

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:25.000
the first place well actually check our

00:08:21.789 --> 00:08:27.220
our item room over here as well item

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.409
rooms have it mixed bag so far best item

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.539
we've gotten bar none absolutely

00:08:29.409 --> 00:08:34.330
small rock but actually skinny odd

00:08:31.539 --> 00:08:37.479
mushroom big DPS up as well this card is

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:41.289
another judgment which actually can

00:08:37.479 --> 00:08:43.150
provide us with some usefulness just

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:47.110
pick up the nickel we can use it for HP

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:48.579
but the virus is good enough I hate the

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.180
speed downgrade and I always forget that

00:08:48.579 --> 00:08:52.060
it exists

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:58.120
but the virus is good enough just in

00:08:52.060 --> 00:09:02.350
getting us towards spun obviously like

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:04.779
obviously I'm not a hundred percent

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:06.220
thrilled with walking into enemies and

00:09:04.779 --> 00:09:08.310
possibly getting black hearts out of it

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:10.870
that just doesn't do anything for us so

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:12.100
we can play him maybe two more times you

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:14.830
could also use this as leverage to get

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:16.480
into our demon or sorry our boss trap

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:20.260
room let's pop this guy down it's a

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:23.350
regular old judgment that's got me

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.880
titillated High Priestess please don't

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:28.750
pay out with the troll bomb that's all I

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:33.490
ask it's a simple premise wouldn't mind

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:35.110
HP okay well well hold off on that one

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:38.080
but that is good we could use any

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:39.250
trinket so that's amazing and if it

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.399
gives a swallowed penny that's even

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.399
better

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.920
we had a feeling that was gonna happen

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:50.410
ads bouncing ball and in the process

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:53.620
they also got another judgment and a

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:55.779
pill trying to get back out of payout

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:58.240
first the tears down as bad but life

00:09:55.779 --> 00:10:00.190
goes on we should have saved the coin

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.220
maybe like the bouncing ball is like

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:07.900
occasionally we get rubber cement tears

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:10.980
take it or leave it honestly you got to

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:13.750
get stomped this room sucks by the way

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:16.209
it sucks for many reasons

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:17.830
this guy's not actually the big problem

00:10:16.209 --> 00:10:19.660
even though he's tanky as heck if you

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:22.360
can only get hit once give me mega fatty

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:26.500
any day of the week over we have to find

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:29.589
him immediately mega ma long time no see

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:33.550
on that impression but yeah yeah please

00:10:29.589 --> 00:10:36.550
keep attacking my best friend not a very

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:38.709
selfless individual on my part he's

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:41.829
being extremely selfish selfless I

00:10:38.709 --> 00:10:46.690
should say uh all right it's also bad

00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:52.649
and we still have no coin so I'm pretty

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:52.649
tempted to blow up these judgments

00:10:53.049 --> 00:10:57.169
there's a very risky maneuver we can't

00:10:56.029 --> 00:11:00.649
afford to take this pill it could be

00:10:57.169 --> 00:11:06.319
paralysis should just about be the worst

00:11:00.649 --> 00:11:09.529
thing ever it could also be full health

00:11:06.319 --> 00:11:12.079
you shouldn't pay attention to that oh

00:11:09.529 --> 00:11:14.479
my god health up okay we'll check this

00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:16.100
cuz it could be anything but greed is

00:11:14.479 --> 00:11:18.619
lovely and actually there is a there is

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:20.839
a good play for us in here yeah first

00:11:18.619 --> 00:11:22.549
take that you're gonna take all these

00:11:20.839 --> 00:11:23.749
we're gonna make our demon or sorry not

00:11:22.549 --> 00:11:27.759
our demon judgement we're gonna make our

00:11:23.749 --> 00:11:27.759
donation machine pretty upset with us

00:11:28.539 --> 00:11:32.419
for the time being at least let's see if

00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:34.669
we can get like a Joker card it's

00:11:32.419 --> 00:11:37.429
actually two of diamonds could probably

00:11:34.669 --> 00:11:40.809
use that intelligently to actually oh

00:11:37.429 --> 00:11:43.249
they're still poins in my secret room

00:11:40.809 --> 00:11:44.989
you could probably use that fairly

00:11:43.249 --> 00:11:47.839
intelligently to like donate more than

00:11:44.989 --> 00:11:49.669
we stole for the time being I'm just

00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:53.539
gonna finish this floor because we have

00:11:49.669 --> 00:11:54.019
taken a lot of time here it's time well

00:11:53.539 --> 00:11:57.619
spent

00:11:54.019 --> 00:12:01.970
oh that's a nasty room dude it was a

00:11:57.619 --> 00:12:04.009
100% nasty when they introduced the the

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:06.229
enemy that split into other oh that's

00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:07.459
very nice the enemy that split ended

00:12:06.229 --> 00:12:08.899
versions of itself because the room is

00:12:07.459 --> 00:12:10.909
already crowded but that dude took up

00:12:08.899 --> 00:12:13.429
the last available real estate and I am

00:12:10.909 --> 00:12:20.209
not happy with you mister leaked hashing

00:12:13.429 --> 00:12:23.779
oh oh it's a reference to the Chinese

00:12:20.209 --> 00:12:24.909
Forbes richest like property owner on

00:12:23.779 --> 00:12:27.589
planet Earth

00:12:24.909 --> 00:12:31.909
means no Carlos Slim but like come on

00:12:27.589 --> 00:12:35.509
here now you get highly dusted two rooms

00:12:31.909 --> 00:12:37.639
of interesting value can't take two of

00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:41.829
those pie I always forget what

00:12:37.639 --> 00:12:46.459
polydactyl does just toss this in here

00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:48.229
easy enough I think I might just ignore

00:12:46.459 --> 00:12:50.869
the demon judgments to be straight up

00:12:48.229 --> 00:12:54.970
with you because I haven't really earned

00:12:50.869 --> 00:12:54.970
my stripes on this one

00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:01.590
just make sure this guy goes down we get

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:03.360
a nickel out of it if it would be so

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:05.010
much better although highly unrealistic

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:14.310
if instead of a nickel that was five

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:16.260
pennies doubled or otherwise good stuff

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:18.540
you get an HP upgrade that means nothing

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:20.580
except it doesn't mean nothing

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:24.060
it just means less than it otherwise

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:25.920
could so here's our end game we're just

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:28.140
trying to get a payout out of one of

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.150
these guys I really doubt that it's

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:33.170
gonna be that relevant but we're gonna

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:35.630
give it the college try regardless

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:38.660
because what let's just see this is

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:40.920
potentially a big floor so that's HP

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:43.080
we've got the two demon judgments back

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.490
here we got one play of this card or of

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.750
this Wooden Nickel which would be really

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:48.930
nice if it worked in it if they did

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:51.510
indeed that was we should not have done

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:56.550
that but it it worked so we'll get some

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:59.340
flies and an evil upgrade essentially

00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:03.510
worth nothing then this guy kept giving

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:08.250
two plays he's been played three times I

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:10.950
think then the next step is you pick

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:13.410
this up please give me some more coins

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:14.970
oh okay okay this is like the most

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:16.920
boring part of any Isaac run but we're

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:19.110
so like we're scraping along the edge

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:21.510
here we're a filter feeder and we want

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:25.410
to rise up the food shake how does one

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:27.240
do that well we got a we got an inch

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:31.500
along you ever play agario we got to eat

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:32.820
enough of the you know garbage before we

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.050
can start eating bigger garbage and

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.120
eventually we become the biggest garbage

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:39.510
of all we have the final coup de

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:41.010
resistance is the HP upgrade which will

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:42.450
give us HP and I figured you know we're

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:43.710
not getting much other value out of it

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:47.310
we might as well shoot for the stars

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:49.970
here we get a card of some sort so Wheel

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:51.840
of Fortune blow up the Wheel of Fortune

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:54.570
gives us no coins

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:56.190
that's nasty we don't want to leave with

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.990
one HP so we're gonna blow this guy up

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:59.280
and at the very least he's giving us a

00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:59.850
lot of money that we can turn to our

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.190
favor

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:03.780
finally after spending eight minutes on

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:05.220
this floor we're going to go to the

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:07.880
right go to the shop see what's inside

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.880
and

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:14.470
if there's more items of some value

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:16.480
we'll be happy but there aren't so what

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:18.220
I'm gonna do is actually and again like

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.350
this is a mechanic I've never fully

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:23.110
realized but we're gonna donate until we

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:24.399
get to our balance being 15 cents so we

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:26.350
can at least put some money back in the

00:15:24.399 --> 00:15:28.540
donation machine we've never gotten into

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:31.020
999 so the closer we can get to that the

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:34.600
better this run is cursed and its doomed

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:36.279
our stats do not allow us to to get a

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:39.180
win here so what it means we got to

00:15:36.279 --> 00:15:41.350
change our stats many ways to do so

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:43.330
easiest one is just getting good items

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:49.180
second easiest one getting some deals

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:52.089
with the devil oh cool sorry I just had

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:53.260
a unimportant and also semi urgent email

00:15:52.089 --> 00:15:55.810
as you know I have an important

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:58.300
businessman who does a lot of important

00:15:55.810 --> 00:16:00.910
business man and that email was

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:02.649
extremely important it definitely was

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:05.440
not junk mail from StubHub that just

00:16:02.649 --> 00:16:09.760
said hey there's a hockey game on planet

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.990
Earth this weekend I got to stop walking

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.760
into enemies if we're gonna have any

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:17.529
chance to get these deals with the devil

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:19.240
you know what's nice is that humbling

00:16:17.529 --> 00:16:21.100
bundle is actually what is this oh there

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.149
was a new booster pack released that's

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.610
right

00:16:22.149 --> 00:16:26.410
so we're gonna see all sorts of new

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:28.120
stuff and buy all sorts I mean like very

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:34.079
very occasionally we might see one or

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:34.079
two new things but that's cool though

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:40.940
we're we're suffering a little bit here

00:16:39.649 --> 00:16:46.540
and it's a suffering that I've created

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:49.130
for myself dude that was the greatest

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:51.259
like I'm a little mad but I'm also

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:53.089
extremely impressed because that bony

00:16:51.259 --> 00:16:56.000
never stopped shooting

00:16:53.089 --> 00:16:59.990
it was like a finding Dory moment there

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.610
and though I'm a little upset by the

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:04.010
fact that I got hit and almost died I'm

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:09.049
more impressed with the fact that he was

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:13.429
firing to begin with so I like to I look

00:17:09.049 --> 00:17:14.510
at things logically you know there's

00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:15.770
many different kinds of people people

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:16.760
always say there's two different kinds

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.439
of people in the world as long as you

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.150
structure it is like an either/or that's

00:17:18.439 --> 00:17:22.059
always gonna be true there's many

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:25.280
different kinds of people in the world a

00:17:22.059 --> 00:17:26.539
lot of people you know the kind of

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.760
person if your friend says all I'm gonna

00:17:26.539 --> 00:17:29.900
fail this test you go what's your mark

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:32.690
in the class going in and they're like

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:34.220
you know 80 oh how much did you study 20

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:35.539
hours you're not gonna fail the test

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.580
that's what you've just said is a

00:17:35.539 --> 00:17:38.630
ridiculous statement how much did you

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.539
study zero

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:43.159
what's your mark going in 40% you ain't

00:17:41.539 --> 00:17:45.049
probably gonna fail I'm sorry dude

00:17:43.159 --> 00:17:46.730
if only there is some way to prevent

00:17:45.049 --> 00:17:48.740
that like I don't know if you need me to

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:52.280
be a bastion of support maybe I'm a bad

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:55.520
dude I'm but I'm a realist I'm not

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:57.770
suggesting that this run is doomed to be

00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:00.140
negative it's more you know looking at

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:04.190
the stats and judging things that way

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:06.520
now mind you dull razor does nothing but

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:08.809
we got a we got a great setup here um

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:10.010
mind you we got a lot of opportunities

00:18:08.809 --> 00:18:13.100
to turn it around let's take black

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:14.690
candle if we ever get the bird feather

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:18.710
as a trinket we're gonna get a nice

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:20.419
damage upgrade rather not spend bomb

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:21.679
spending money seems more valuable right

00:18:20.419 --> 00:18:24.679
now we'll check for its 2a diamonds

00:18:21.679 --> 00:18:27.919
didn't get it bogel bombs is irrelevant

00:18:24.679 --> 00:18:29.419
so recycle extremely good showed up

00:18:27.919 --> 00:18:31.370
relatively early I'm a happy camper

00:18:29.419 --> 00:18:34.480
check for two of diamonds again didn't

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:37.730
get it got card against humanity instead

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:39.820
what we're gonna do is pop cards against

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:42.340
humanity' in here

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:46.930
just hope for some extra money um we

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:48.190
don't really care abouts about anything

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:51.760
else here to be honest new so we're just

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:53.200
gonna keep going one of these days this

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.970
thing's gonna blow up should we check

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:58.120
for another two of diamonds why not

00:18:54.970 --> 00:19:01.180
ace of clubs is not bad - ace of clubs

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:03.160
is not good now we got to think about

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:05.620
maybe using bombs add blew up anyway

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.550
okay so car battery you want to buy it

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:10.480
but first we'll check for it - a

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:13.950
diamonds damn we'll get car battery and

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:16.150
you know what you mean ace of clubs here

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:17.860
fine by me

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:20.140
and I'd like to check for a two of

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.880
diamonds one last time as ridiculous as

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:28.630
that might seem so actually petrified

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:30.820
pukas like extremely good mostly on this

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:32.680
room only but still where we at dang

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:34.660
Depp's one not gonna do boss rush and

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.130
that's fine it's not really I mean it

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.360
could be the right run for it but we've

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:39.580
slowed ourselves down in such a way that

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:41.800
it probably won't be in that's that's

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:44.140
completely okay we got back up to 94

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:47.230
cents so with restock I think we'll

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:48.640
start buying this place out is that

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:50.590
another to it you got a check right

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.570
after after two of those and we'll hold

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:57.580
off no we won't because we couldn't

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:58.810
easily get a we could easily get greed

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:02.650
on the next shop so I think we should

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:05.020
spend all our money if we can the less

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:07.060
actives the better but sure I mean oh

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:09.070
the battery charge is not relevant we

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:10.660
didn't take this pill did we didn't it's

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.260
a luck upgrade all right let's get out

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.420
of here

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.980
still good I mean we spent a lot of

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:17.800
money and not all of it came back to us

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:20.020
but being able to get possibly double

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.540
the amount of plays due to or due to car

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:25.980
battery here is fantastic

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:25.980
no I'm using the f-word a lot here

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:32.390
the pays out twice that's an

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:35.990
unbelievable amount of money in HP if it

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:39.320
pays out once that's still one cent plus

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:42.049
one HP or two a two cents not two HP you

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:44.059
can't use it to get to HP cuz you've

00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:45.860
already lost it you can only hold two at

00:20:44.059 --> 00:20:49.280
a time so if you need to then you're

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:54.650
already dead no so your keeper is

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:56.720
already dead but we got kind of like a

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:58.370
good Mass Effect going on here so once

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:03.100
every four rooms we should expect no

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:05.390
sense I'm willing to take those odds

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:08.330
once every four rooms we should expect

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:11.650
four cents so I mean I'm willing to take

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:14.000
those odds as well it's really a win-win

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:16.400
this might be a good run to donate to

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.590
what I would love to see is obviously

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:21.350
nun's habit swallowed penny I've kind of

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:23.120
given up hope forth see there's our no

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:24.710
payout so while the penny I've kind of

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.900
given up hope for just cuz it typically

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:32.659
that was a bad play it typically shows

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:35.179
up this is a good time to pop this on

00:21:32.659 --> 00:21:37.220
the first floor when you blow up a pot

00:21:35.179 --> 00:21:39.620
and obviously you know we're kind of

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:41.960
living in a pot four universe here so we

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:45.020
did get a deal with the devil please

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:46.549
don't be Krampus this is actually fine

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:48.559
we don't want to pay for any items

00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:50.419
anyway we're a freeloader like that

00:21:48.559 --> 00:21:52.730
right now we got nothing to we got

00:21:50.419 --> 00:21:55.159
nothing to offer this run in terms of

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:57.049
our own HP what we do have is stats that

00:21:55.159 --> 00:21:59.929
could allow us to acquiesce a victory

00:21:57.049 --> 00:22:02.990
here or we could seize the victory

00:21:59.929 --> 00:22:04.280
instead of acquiescing it will see 36

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:04.940
seconds to make it the boss rush not

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.220
gonna happen

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:09.380
purge that from your your minds it's an

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:11.299
unnecessary situation you know what is

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:13.669
like the the bread and butter of this

00:22:11.299 --> 00:22:17.299
run right now is basically piercing

00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:19.789
shots the fact that we got that leaves

00:22:17.299 --> 00:22:23.860
us extremely well equipped to tackle the

00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:29.260
rest of this run we're within

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:33.669
on all these roles here not greed that's

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:35.620
fantastic news no reroll machine that

00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:37.179
sucks but what we're gonna do again we

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:39.130
don't care about saving money here what

00:22:37.179 --> 00:22:40.779
we care about is seeing as many items as

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:42.760
possible because anything that improves

00:22:40.779 --> 00:22:47.309
our chances of winning as the keeper is

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:47.309
by definition something we want to have

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:53.010
not been viewed something we can get

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:55.779
back to 15 cents we could buy mr. musics

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:58.510
give you mr. musics to steal the item

00:22:55.779 --> 00:23:00.190
that mr. musics allows to come into the

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.929
situation because we have restock so

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:04.600
it's like 50/50 whether it works or not

00:23:01.929 --> 00:23:07.450
you gotta aim it properly and I think as

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.460
time is shown not always the best track

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:11.260
record of that

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:13.330
yeah the bread and butter this run right

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.710
now the thing that allows it to go as

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:16.389
well as it's going and I'd say it's

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:19.240
going well what is going on with these

00:23:16.389 --> 00:23:20.500
odds might be the thing that allows it

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:25.139
to go as well as it's going right now is

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:27.100
the fact that we have piercing shots

00:23:25.139 --> 00:23:29.559
yeah I was gonna say that's probably

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:34.899
gonna dust us without piercing shots

00:23:29.559 --> 00:23:37.120
were in a much much worse position huge

00:23:34.899 --> 00:23:39.820
growth not a bad item to be honest with

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:44.500
you certainly still need to find our

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:46.120
item room not a bad card I should say

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.669
but certainly still need to find our

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:50.080
item room I feel like I'm losing my mind

00:23:48.669 --> 00:23:52.059
because I can't tell that's a dime or a

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:56.440
nickel it's like an optical illusion I

00:23:52.059 --> 00:24:00.940
think it's a nickel but in my head I'm

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:02.950
like aren't the nickels usually like

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:04.240
greater than that then I'm like it's a

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:07.299
dime didn't like aren't the dimes

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:11.620
usually shinier than that place your

00:24:07.299 --> 00:24:14.860
bets it was a dime dude okay okay hey I

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:16.630
must must be losing it I may be picked

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:19.120
up a dime earlier and I picked up a dime

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:22.510
nothing less now I must put its behind

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:26.320
to the test you know the other reason I

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:29.769
know this run is not in a truly awful

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:32.409
place right now is because why why why

00:24:29.769 --> 00:24:35.440
is because I'm not complaining about

00:24:32.409 --> 00:24:38.030
0.85 speed normally that would be the

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:41.410
kiss of death little chubby

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:44.150
okay all right

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:46.370
39 cents that should give us three items

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:49.160
by mr. musics that's one mr. music

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:50.980
steals another item that's two we have

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:54.830
24 cents left to buy one more item

00:24:50.980 --> 00:25:03.220
that's three so effectively two items of

00:24:54.830 --> 00:25:03.220
some usefulness mr. me gives us placebo

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:10.340
nope no it does not

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:11.750
last item piggy bank aka who cares

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:18.020
so we'll donate as much money as they'll

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:21.610
allow us to might have broken even on

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:21.610
that and for a keeper run that success

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:32.090
good we turned two bombs we turned four

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:33.530
bombs in two cents into four bombs in a

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:35.000
troll bomb I don't know if my math

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:41.360
checks out there it seems a little a

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:45.590
little off but hmm well the thing is

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:48.010
with 20 cents we could buy whatever that

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:50.450
item is like AI think it's piggy bank

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:51.800
roll through it we'll have five cents

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:52.970
left plus we get from piggy bank which i

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.890
think is three cents so we won't be able

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:57.110
to buy anything else so I think we just

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:58.640
would prefer to maybe buy a card and the

00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:01.400
card is the world which is useful for us

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:04.730
but remember this for this run to work

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:06.200
we have to beat something we've never

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:07.790
beaten before either hush which is

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.350
probably not gonna happen due to the way

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:15.530
that this run looks right now timewise

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:20.360
or uh the chest or shoul plus or not

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:21.800
plus the negative floor I could have

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.420
explained that much more succinctly but

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.710
we like the things that I've not been

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:27.380
ticked off on the post-it note yet we've

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:29.270
already done that pains me cuz I saw the

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:31.690
shadow and was like I'm above it so no

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:31.690
problem

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:36.620
we've already done the Isaac fight we

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:42.320
just died on the chest on the last greed

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:44.690
run so okay the only greed run I think

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.130
we're gonna go that path anyway all

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:47.900
right all right all right all right all

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:51.770
right all right so huge growth is a big

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:53.540
play when we need it we will use it

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:57.980
there's a real room kind of one of those

00:26:53.540 --> 00:27:03.080
characters for what are you know I would

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:04.210
just walked right into it so just hit

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:07.730
the button do

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:09.140
well that's horrifying um kind of one of

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:11.390
those characters for whom a reroll room

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:12.800
is actually just bad because you can't

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:16.130
afford to lose your starting space bar

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:18.110
item in most situations but I'm not

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:19.280
gonna get too preachy about it this

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:21.830
floor is gonna be over in no time flat

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:26.450
and you know what conquest is worth

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:29.240
using huge growth on dude is mega

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:31.940
annoying then we got relatively lucky

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:33.920
there and who knows maybe the hush fight

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:36.620
is actually practical for us I'd much

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:39.490
rather do it with a chaos card but you

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:39.490
know if we got it we got it

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:52.740
just leave like hey money is not very

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:54.330
relevant to our needs right now we're

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:59.610
gonna try to leave like a little money

00:27:54.330 --> 00:28:01.980
on the ground as is necessary but no the

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:04.380
thing is once you pass the womb - or

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:08.010
sorry once you pass it's another new

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:10.680
room I think once you pass depp's - or

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:14.040
the equivalent oh my lord I gotta learn

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:18.090
that pattern he rotates oh now that okay

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:23.910
okay dinner brain you're like mad broken

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:25.310
good kid maad brain just walk this way

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:31.430
please

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:33.690
lucky me once you it's not a good one

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:36.660
once you pass that floor you don't need

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:40.860
money much anymore sure you could still

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:44.550
use it possibly Garner's some value out

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:48.750
of the blue womb not likely to be that

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:50.220
relevant this is the hold the run this

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:53.760
time is meant to prove that my brain is

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:55.830
not broken so there's like catastrophic

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:57.570
consequences for me right now especially

00:28:55.830 --> 00:29:00.050
given that there's new rooms you know

00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:02.100
I'm mostly coasting off of my earlier

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:03.750
intelligence and due diligence you know

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:07.770
I boot up Isaac and I kind of it's all

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:09.150
stored in the cache instantly available

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:12.000
how do you handle this room you know

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:16.950
load Oh a spike room that bad or

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.120
whatever these new rooms you got a all

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:20.010
of a sudden you're opening up your

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:21.300
dynamic processor this isn't even a

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:23.250
programming thing I don't know what the

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.720
heck of dynamic processors but you know

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:27.300
on the fly you're looking at it and

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:28.440
going oh crap how do I deal with this

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:30.480
enemy I've never seen before

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:33.680
it's like going going back to basics

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.680
starring Amy Winehouse

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:41.760
I'll check the double key room more we

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:47.340
will not check the cursed room this

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:52.110
could be okay bounced and bounced and

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:53.820
bounced and bounced we should never take

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:55.110
those pills hey if there's one thing you

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:56.160
take away from this video I want you to

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:58.050
be better than the person you're

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:59.520
watching don't take those pills it's

00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:00.900
gonna be a health down one of these days

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.580
and you're gonna go and out why didn't

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:05.340
you tell me I did tell you this is me

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:07.740
I'm your sensei I'm telling you as the

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:09.870
keeper don't take those pills unless you

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:12.060
got two of them if you got two of them

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:17.370
consider it because you can leverage

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:18.990
that you only got one don't take it it's

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:20.640
only gonna burn you see those I'm gonna

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:22.500
I'm gonna follow my own example for once

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.820
I'm not gonna take them it's your

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:26.040
parents they always say don't do as I

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:27.720
say do as I do they've built bad habits

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:29.490
they want you to have better ones takes

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:31.170
a lot takes a certain maturity to earn

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:32.490
that or to learn that I should say

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:35.430
maturity that I don't even necessarily

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:37.380
think I even have yet did you see the

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:46.260
outrageous number of flies that we got

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:50.370
there we did get a very lucky deal what

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:52.680
is it see like your boy doesn't want to

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:55.170
take it but he might never see it again

00:30:52.680 --> 00:31:00.330
this is not the right run for Zane I'll

00:30:55.170 --> 00:31:02.340
see you again I don't even know what it

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:03.900
is it's a scroll of some sort will see

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:06.210
it at some point I know yeah NL you're

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:08.010
Zane is dead look at me look at me I'm

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:09.660
the windows of my soul as I say this to

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:11.550
you if my Zane was dead why am I

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:13.500
willingly playing is the keeper here the

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:15.179
Zane is not I'm not going oh well you

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:17.400
know we got to take this Senecas you let

00:31:15.179 --> 00:31:19.140
me plug it into my formula here it's

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:21.270
gold my odds of winning is the keeper or

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:23.370
only 17% we might as well hold our I'm

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:24.179
not doing that okay this is this is a

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:25.530
keeper run

00:31:24.179 --> 00:31:26.940
sight unseen we didn't know what the

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:28.940
heck was gonna show up and yet here we

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:31.560
are making it work

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:33.929
that ain't Zane I don't know what is

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:36.150
dude you know what Zane is just a way of

00:31:33.929 --> 00:31:38.850
creatively solving problems instead of

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:42.150
like logically and analytically solving

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:44.960
problems forces Zane is short for

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:48.240
constrained you know it sure it puts

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:49.140
constraints on your run then most people

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.310
wouldn't go for because they

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:54.240
objectively or subjectively at least bad

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:55.770
that's what we've done here we're not

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.170
just holding our until we start next to

00:31:55.770 --> 00:32:00.500
a room that has like you know Oh

00:31:57.170 --> 00:32:03.120
swallowed penny plus uh brimstone in it

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:06.030
see now this is this is where your Zane

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:10.890
gets on look who've we got our Hanes on

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:11.700
now and not of the Malick variety okay

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:13.080
where's we're safe

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:15.750
I was looking bad for a second there but

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:18.450
we made it and we're not quite good to

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:19.950
go because we don't have a we don't have

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:22.530
anything to back ourselves up with now

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:26.580
we do so try to avoid picking up all of

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:27.660
the money because essentially it's free

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.460
and you're gonna say NL you cost

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:31.620
yourselves an item you cost yourself an

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:33.630
item did I cause myself an item or did I

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:35.670
guarantee myself four items by ensuring

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:38.580
that I would not die right here you know

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:40.650
it's a matter of perspective I suppose I

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:42.510
like to think i guaranteed myself four

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:44.250
items because I would have died right

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:45.960
there so you know your mileage may vary

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:52.200
on that but I'm gonna look on the bright

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:54.210
side of life again would we have died

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:56.550
right there no cuz we would have died

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:57.810
earlier you can't die twice and less you

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:59.670
got some way of coming back to life

00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:05.730
which I don't know about you saying the

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:09.090
Lazarus project still a little

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:10.980
understanded I'll admit but you can't be

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:13.170
upset with any keeper run that just out

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:15.750
of nowhere sort of makes it to the chest

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:17.220
like for a keeper run to get to the

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:19.800
chest something went right and on our

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:21.270
run that was a small rock skinny odd

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:25.980
mushroom with an incredible tears

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:29.070
upgrade plus piercing shots essentially

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:33.350
giving us a great opportunity here so

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:35.850
without this use of the slot machine I'm

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:39.830
feeling fairly confident in saying our

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:39.830
butts would be toast right now

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:50.660
our damage status no that hurts me dude

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.640
that's the first time in a hundred years

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:55.790
I've seen the Isaac icon for getting

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:57.710
killed I blame that last one on our

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:59.630
speed said to be on I mean me being an

00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:00.860
idiot but also the speed stead as I was

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:03.050
getting hit I was trying to move out of

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:04.580
the concentric circles in it every hit

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:06.980
was like nah move back move back move

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:08.869
back still fun run I think I played ok

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:10.159
we got introduced to some new items that

00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:11.149
we didn't get to take but thanks for

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:13.190
