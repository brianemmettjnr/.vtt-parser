00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.110
hey everybody welcome back their own

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.490
landfill I think mines contra plus we're

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.610
on random runs we're having a good time

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.380
let's run well I don't know that maybe a

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.269
Daly has gone up in the interim period I

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.009
never am going to say no to an Isaac run

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.450
but maybe there's been a daily that went

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.580
up during an interim period but the last

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.880
run that I recorded got pretty close we

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.150
very nearly died on an accidental black

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.789
rune boss rush I mean I deliberately

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.880
went to boss rush I deliberately used

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.969
the black rune but the death part of it

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.309
was unintentional I had neglected to

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.920
remember that when you use the black

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.870
room on boss rush it forces you to do

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.059
boss rush I thought I was being a sneaky

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.420
dude and stealing all the items for free

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.370
but anyway long long and short of it as

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.500
we ended up winning so if you sequence

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.219
broke these videos and you watch them

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.710
out of order first off stop hacking

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.910
secondly there you go it spoiled for you

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.489
it's still worth watching though we had

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:04.970
some good times and places that remind

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:08.640
me I'm trying to sum something something

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.520
leaving other than me I don't remember

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.680
the rest of the lyrics everyone keeps

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.020
telling me I'm you know I like to sing

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.850
I'm bad at it but I like doing it not

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.210
easily embarrassed at least not anymore

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.680
at this stage in my life everyone says

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.700
you might have a good voice if you sing

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.950
from the diaphragm

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.540
I require like hyper specific direction

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.619
on how to do that I don't understand

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.400
what it means to sing from the diaphragm

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.930
because I have to sing from my mouth

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.770
like I should be using my diaphragm more

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.540
but then it becomes like like I don't

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.280
know what that I can't not do that

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.640
that's the only thing I can do in that

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.759
voice is that one Metallica song from

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.530
like 2004 when they were in the period

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.049
where you knows pre the Metallica

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:00.149
Renaissance to some extent here I'm go

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:02.460
where some like the app gotta be honest

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.090
they actually sounded like almost same

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:11.719
like that was almost bad but real

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:14.640
singing maybe I figured it out live here

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:17.849
moving to the lucrative world of being

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:22.230
just a fairly bad singer there we go get

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:24.420
dusted mitre is great of course if

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.459
you're not going to use a reroll on that

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.879
what are you going to use a reroll lot

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.670
so mom's toenail is actually really bad

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:36.180
but I'm going to take it and I'm going

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.579
to take it because I never take it I

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.189
don't have anything else taken up that

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.480
slot right now it might cost us our deal

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:45.209
with the devil here but we're in like a

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.650
post-cold I mean it didn't cost us to

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.200
deal with that we cost ourselves to deal

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.169
with the devil we're living in a post

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.150
1,000,000% universe here so what do we

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:57.659
care about you know mixing it up a bit

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.560
in order to kill that guy in fact we

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:03.299
should we should be more brazen with our

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.519
with our choices if they're fun I'm not

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:09.000
saying we should go oh there's Plan C

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:11.459
we're dead wow what a zany run you know

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.230
which is not many people seem to want me

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.049
to do that but there are those of you

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.729
out there where I just think to myself

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.769
like what do you want this video to be

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:23.489
like some people are really like an L

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:27.599
use Plan C it kills you that's just

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:31.530
that's not zany thank you thank you

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:33.870
mom's toenail to just die like without

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.819
any benefit is not saying but I'm rag on

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.099
Plan C so much it could be a spot on the

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:42.440
NL bingo card you know so you don't have

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:44.250
to go down that road that's okay but I'm

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.590
you know when a comedian gets

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.849
pretentious they stop talking about

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.609
telling jokes and they start to say

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.949
things like really into the science of

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.590
comedy you know that's where I am with

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:58.079
zaniness I'm not in designing this

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.750
anymore Zayn eNOS is very old hat what

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.939
I'm into is what makes an efficient sane

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.370
you know what makes a genuine sane

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:06.840
because just doing something random is

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.000
in zany it has to be something that's

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.889
like a low percentage chance to be

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.759
disproportionately great for you but the

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:17.849
median payout is bad I think that's

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:21.169
that's my distillation of what makes a

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:24.180
sane appropriate is if there's a very

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.690
low chance that it works out for you but

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.190
if it works

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:32.850
for you it's great vs or you get some

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.410
reward at least versus it just being bad

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.300
to begin with I will take mom's perfume

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.550
mom's perfume lowers our rate of fire

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:44.460
but also lowers our tear cap it is a

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:46.560
very boring but decent upgrade and we

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.260
might be kind of saddled with those for

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.730
a while here because I did cost myself

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.060
the deal at the devil mind you we got a

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.560
lot of spirit arts after that point I'm

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.720
eager to use those this will be small

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.950
rock if somebody up there likes let's

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.270
get out of there um yeah so we kind of

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.830
whipped on our deal with the devil at

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.050
least it seems like we'll probably whip

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.390
on our deal with the devil but life goes

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.520
on looking for a seven cent item did not

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.070
get one I would probably take jar flies

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.930
there if we have the cash v6 it's not a

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:19.070
dime a dozen but jar flies is a really

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.420
nice shortcut to having decent damage

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.920
probably save one bomb for our boss

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.690
fight here instead of a second secret

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.330
room that's it could have something good

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.090
but probably better served helping me

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.520
out immediately on this boss fight but

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.110
can't really complain it would be really

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.540
really nice to get a deal with the devil

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:45.240
though undeserving but very very nice

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:48.570
okay where you going here buddy you just

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.919
want to make sure we're not dropping a

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.110
bomb on him rate as he's about to

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:55.140
teleport every time I think we might

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:59.040
have gotten them anyway but dudes is

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.810
never not teleporting there we go didn't

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:05.669
get a deal didn't deserve one you know

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:09.210
what I do want to speed upgrade can you

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:15.200
engineer a worse caffeine pill like it's

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:17.520
actually good but it's just so petty

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:21.060
we got a speed upgrade that came with

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.130
the speed downgrade lovely well we get a

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.540
bomb we'll probably do that but yeah

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.970
spirit arts are crushing it right now

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.460
but running on Isaac's base stats plus a

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.560
single tears upgrade is not really my

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.300
idea of a fun run long term it's not

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:37.620
even really my idea of a fun run on the

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:40.110
flooded caves one so I am eager to

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.150
press forward from this position onwards

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.220
did you see that I was really hoping

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.890
that would reveal magic mush and then we

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.470
could as an applied science of Zain

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.940
right there if we've gotten a good

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.620
mushroom item out of that thanks to

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.300
holding on to mom's toenail which at

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:59.400
present has done almost nothing for us

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:04.530
but one day dude one day it may hit an

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:05.940
enemy oh jeez that's embarrassing dude

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:09.510
that's the ticket right there speed

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:12.180
upgrade plus piercing shot I would take

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:14.580
piercing shots over almost any single

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:17.210
damage upgrade it just doesn't help that

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:24.930
much our most bosses but it makes rooms

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:26.280
so much easier on some rooms like if we

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.870
can hit three enemies as far as I'm

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:32.130
concerned we're doing 10.5 damage per

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:33.450
shot beginning six enemies as far as I'm

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:39.540
concerned we're doing twenty-one damage

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:43.770
per shot just makes your life that much

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:46.770
easier bomb when we get a bomb we got a

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:50.280
lot of it down the secret room for me

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:53.430
the same is real I really like I wrote

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:57.600
off that trinket mom's broken toenail

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:59.280
because I used it maybe the week that

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.590
rebirth came out and it stepped on a

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:04.020
boss and I went this is amazing and then

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:07.560
two rooms later it's stepped on me and I

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:09.150
said I'm never using this again we might

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.060
be going where they was up here you

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:16.620
might be going down the same Road

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:18.720
eventually here that's fine but for now

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:20.460
it did find a secret room for me how

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.560
does that fit into the science of Zain I

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:25.080
don't know maybe if you pay me $20,000 a

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.760
year I will you know give you a

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.710
bachelor's degree in Zane from the

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.140
University of thank you for your money I

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:33.840
mean you got to take it for four years

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:36.000
obviously and if you get a 49 in a class

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.340
instead of a 51 then you got to take it

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.100
again it's a complicated situation you

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:42.780
know it's all politics I'm sorry

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:46.980
hematemesis it's actually good we have

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:48.989
been rolling on no red hearts ever since

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:51.720
I lost a bunch of come by being an idiot

00:08:48.989 --> 00:08:53.279
I think this is our floor because we got

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:56.040
100% deal to devil chance this is the

00:08:53.279 --> 00:09:03.179
floor where we're going to make our best

00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:04.529
effort to get ahead all that sucked so

00:09:03.179 --> 00:09:07.619
we're going to take our time here I

00:09:04.529 --> 00:09:08.850
might go back to the mob trap room if we

00:09:07.619 --> 00:09:14.339
find ourselves in a lucky enough

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:20.549
situation to be able to blow those

00:09:14.339 --> 00:09:22.739
things up we do have one luck it's

00:09:20.549 --> 00:09:24.419
enough to expect maybe getting a bomb I

00:09:22.739 --> 00:09:26.819
don't know if I want to spend a key and

00:09:24.419 --> 00:09:28.799
then spend five cents to buy a bomb and

00:09:26.819 --> 00:09:30.449
then spend that bomb to open two stone

00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:32.429
chests which then requires us to fight

00:09:30.449 --> 00:09:33.299
three waves of enemies it's starting to

00:09:32.429 --> 00:09:35.579
get to the point where the value

00:09:33.299 --> 00:09:39.359
proposition it turns a little bit in the

00:09:35.579 --> 00:09:41.759
other direction but wow not necessarily

00:09:39.359 --> 00:09:47.040
bad though that was a bad room on my

00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:50.040
part Joker card is good rear old spider

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.569
mod is not great it's just okay but I

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.790
think it is worth holding in most

00:09:51.569 --> 00:09:55.799
situations now one bomb for two spirit

00:09:53.790 --> 00:10:00.989
arts might be fine but honestly with The

00:09:55.799 --> 00:10:03.149
MITRE not too worried about it is there

00:10:00.989 --> 00:10:06.419
a battery charge in the shop because you

00:10:03.149 --> 00:10:07.739
could you could use one knowing that

00:10:06.419 --> 00:10:09.799
we're definitely going to get the deal

00:10:07.739 --> 00:10:14.939
with the devil

00:10:09.799 --> 00:10:19.410
I'm all-in in that department come on

00:10:14.939 --> 00:10:23.429
come on though and what are we looking

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:27.449
for tears or damage please both are not

00:10:23.429 --> 00:10:29.429
in a dire position but there is a

00:10:27.449 --> 00:10:32.189
battery charge both are not in a dire

00:10:29.429 --> 00:10:34.919
position but I would desire them there

00:10:32.189 --> 00:10:37.019
in a desire position is that a subreddit

00:10:34.919 --> 00:10:39.869
yet I don't even want to know okay Big

00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:42.089
Horn it's actually it has been a while

00:10:39.869 --> 00:10:44.609
since I came up with a new liens law you

00:10:42.089 --> 00:10:46.350
know there's some lion laws of Isaac way

00:10:44.609 --> 00:10:48.779
back in the day you always fought

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:51.179
monstro first and that's a blast from

00:10:48.779 --> 00:10:52.739
the freaking past dude seriously it used

00:10:51.179 --> 00:10:54.480
to be like first floor so you know we're

00:10:52.739 --> 00:10:56.100
going to fight monstro and then it was

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.789
monstro it happened with alarming

00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.060
regularity

00:10:56.789 --> 00:11:01.620
maybe his confirmation bias but I was

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.720
longer and more naive at that time so I

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:07.980
thought I had superpowers not really

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:14.100
maybe like a little bit the new Lions

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:16.620
law and this is like lions law 81 if you

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:19.860
have poor damage you will fight bighorn

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:21.300
it's just this boss only shows up when

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:27.060
you're like I could really use a damage

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:29.580
upgrade okay I would like to submit an

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:31.940
appeal about that damage I feel like the

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:34.590
hitbox on that was a little jacked but

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:36.540
it's like the number one complaint now

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:37.980
used to be like testing didn't hit me

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.690
now it's oh excuse me

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.700
game developer your hit boxes are

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:43.380
slightly yeah I've got to give this game

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:46.890
a five like the hit boxes just don't

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:47.940
feel right like I think that I didn't

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.250
hit him now player unknowns

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:55.860
battlegrounds shirt occasional hit box

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:58.460
janky miss Isaac I don't know this boss

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.460
fight man

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:09.320
let's go let's let's go

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:12.350
you can't touch those I forgot magic

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:15.620
mush everything is in its right place

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:17.600
okay I mean thank God we didn't take

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:20.240
magic much first I think you go this

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.500
then this because we definitely want it

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.710
although we don't get to like double

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:26.510
down on it that then we leave and then

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:28.400
I'm going to be a little silly because

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:29.750
our d6 is already ready and hope there's

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:33.430
a teleport room it doesn't seem like

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:33.430
there is we're going to do this oh okay

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:40.940
work with me work with me

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:52.570
he's done it okay you know what I got

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:55.040
nine lives let's go let's go hook I

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:59.030
don't even think I want to use this once

00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:12.800
but I will now go pretty deep on this

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:16.160
one did you have to do that he act I'm

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:17.510
so mind flooded right now not I'm not

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:22.490
worried about losing the life the life

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:25.220
is irrelevant dude but I can't believe

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:27.380
that's the time that mom chose to come

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.300
down I was just about to use the d6 on

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:33.950
the potato peeler the only reason I had

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:35.420
not done it was because there was the

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:37.070
chance that we could get him to pay out

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.870
with something first and if he paid out

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:40.760
with something bad we would have rear

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:45.950
old two items for the price of one

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:47.450
but sadly mom had other ideas there but

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:50.210
you know what that's a great situation

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:52.340
in terms of humor at least because it's

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:56.330
like not catastrophic but also hilarious

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:58.220
and bad for me so that that fits all the

00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:00.050
bills of like if you were submitting

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:01.670
that as your zany dissertation I'd be

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:03.800
like you know this guy probably deserves

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:05.390
his degree or you know this girl

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:08.030
physically deserves her degree but

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:10.130
demographically speaking slightly more

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:13.100
likely it would be a dude hey thanks for

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:14.690
the extra deal with the devil chance I

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:17.480
would like to get back in there

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:19.610
and you know I could potato peel myself

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:26.570
like a bunch of times and get some

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:28.190
bonuses there this might give us a

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:29.110
second level cube of meat hilariously

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:31.370
enough

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:33.050
Maggie's beau is also good that means we

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:35.450
are going to probably stick with this

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:37.070
life but if it goes uh if it goes

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:40.970
terribly wrong I'm not going to worry

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:43.930
too much we are going super fast which

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:46.490
is awesome for bas fresh purposes I

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:49.150
would like to fight greed we got Seven

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:51.920
Keys I think it's worth a check not um

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:54.590
mama mega is irrelevant that's an item

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:56.240
that the more I play the more I realized

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:58.370
that there's like two big reasons to use

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.320
mama Mega one of them is somehow you've

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:02.930
taken it all the way down to the void

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.610
the other one is you really want to make

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:07.580
bas rush or you would at least like to

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:11.110
make boss rush and that makes that

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:14.480
possible dude greatest bomb ever place

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:15.530
real talk oh dude let me into this deal

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:18.680
with the devil I know I've only got a

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:21.680
17% chance but it's the least you could

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:26.150
do after you use me as the butt of your

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:27.820
cosmic joke they're good bomb dude you

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:31.430
almost got me with that one

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:33.770
no deal you know what we rolled it I

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:35.210
don't want to deal with the devil or

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:37.940
sorry I don't want a second level cube

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:41.060
immune I want a regular first level cube

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:44.180
of meat we are going to make boss rush

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:46.520
and with ten point four a damage we have

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.960
a pretty good shot of even wanting to do

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.970
boss rush believe it or not even though

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.710
we did it on the last run I could see I

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:53.390
could see there being a case for it on

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:55.850
this run ten point for a damage is

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:58.250
excellent rate of fire leaves a little

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:59.600
bit to be desired and our bosses are the

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:03.380
hardest part for us because of the

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:07.040
piercing shots but we can hit two bosses

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:07.460
at the same time something to be said

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.010
about that

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:12.820
you know what just notice thanks to this

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:15.560
room I would be relatively psyched

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:18.710
compared to the value of the item to get

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:23.800
Ouija board hook me up with some form of

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:23.800
spectral tears obviously if I could get

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:29.999
spirit of the night I'd be happier

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:32.459
dead onion sure why not dude you kidding

00:16:29.999 --> 00:16:35.490
me with this I will probably reroll

00:16:32.459 --> 00:16:41.430
little Gish cool Easter Egg not the

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:43.050
greatest familiar in the game if we get

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:45.029
a deal with the devil as I mean it

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:47.519
sounds ridiculous but I actually would

00:16:45.029 --> 00:16:49.499
love lump of coal synergizes pretty well

00:16:47.519 --> 00:16:51.180
with piercing shots obviously you know

00:16:49.499 --> 00:16:54.209
mom's not brimstone full guppy

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:57.050
transformation etc but barring those I

00:16:54.209 --> 00:16:57.050
would accept that

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:13.059
it's not good enough tempting because I

00:17:11.199 --> 00:17:14.350
do like the variable value of whatever

00:17:13.059 --> 00:17:17.530
the card could be you know could be

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:18.970
Joker it could be chaos even chaos would

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:20.260
be worth getting to give us a free hush

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:22.540
kill and you know we can get all the

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:25.660
stuff that's down there certainly worth

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:29.320
holding at the very least but I don't

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:30.580
think as an item it's good enough we

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.260
need to go for something a little better

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.790
not that we're in tight here like

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:37.540
because our damage is so good we're

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:39.549
actually really well equipped but it's

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:44.230
getting a little close to crunch time

00:17:39.549 --> 00:17:46.419
for our damage like I don't that was

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:48.970
terrible we're actually going to win

00:17:46.419 --> 00:17:51.040
this run and almost nothing can stop it

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:54.160
I mean it's only been like a floor and a

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:55.990
half since that like completely stupid

00:17:54.160 --> 00:18:00.429
ridiculous

00:17:55.990 --> 00:18:02.470
death that we had just due to

00:18:00.429 --> 00:18:03.610
circumstance and we're already at max HP

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:05.890
and we're you know stronger than we've

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:07.809
ever been so I feel like there's very

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:13.510
very low percentage chance of a death

00:18:07.809 --> 00:18:15.250
here overall on this run we could die

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:18.280
again but I don't think we're going to

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:18.940
die permanently yeah that's a good

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:23.320
plague

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:32.220
magnet is still pretty bad doesn't do

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:32.220
much for us safety camp

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:38.139
hoping maybe we can get a it's a little

00:18:35.389 --> 00:18:40.759
short-term as far as usefulness but

00:18:38.139 --> 00:18:42.649
hoping our shop maybe contains a nun's

00:18:40.759 --> 00:18:45.980
habit use that to generate a lot of

00:18:42.649 --> 00:18:48.799
rerolls of course a teleport card would

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:53.480
be on the list of things that be

00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:59.659
interested in right now we got a few

00:18:53.480 --> 00:19:01.909
different options though so big floor

00:18:59.659 --> 00:19:06.169
we're very lucky we found almost all the

00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:07.580
special rooms so early so we can almost

00:19:06.169 --> 00:19:09.980
certainly have a good chance to make it

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:13.730
the boss rush here if we so desire do I

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:17.720
so desire I mean the damage is really

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:22.759
good admittedly we did just do boss rush

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:26.299
but so what oh that's a good stuff okay

00:19:22.759 --> 00:19:28.039
well worth two bombs honestly would have

00:19:26.299 --> 00:19:31.549
been worth the spirit heart even

00:19:28.039 --> 00:19:40.879
especially because we have too many stop

00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:43.970
with the spirit hearts unnecessary just

00:19:40.879 --> 00:19:47.230
waiting on this last men money is hard

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:50.360
to come by but just waiting on this last

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:52.279
special room which it's liable to be a

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.230
shop although I would definitely go to a

00:19:52.279 --> 00:19:56.899
curse room if it shows up as well there

00:19:54.230 --> 00:20:01.639
we go we've got enough bombs to get to

00:19:56.899 --> 00:20:09.289
15 cents it is greed it's bad timing for

00:20:01.639 --> 00:20:11.000
a greed fight it's also a tough call on

00:20:09.289 --> 00:20:13.009
what you do with the d6 at this point

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.950
because we could use it to reroll are

00:20:13.009 --> 00:20:18.200
shot speed or not sorry we can use it to

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:19.789
reroll the shot speed up or we could use

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.919
it to reroll the magnet or we could use

00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:23.210
it to reroll whatever we get from a

00:20:21.919 --> 00:20:24.679
potential deal with the devil or we

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:26.419
could use it to reroll boss rush so you

00:20:24.679 --> 00:20:28.059
can see my conundrum here you know

00:20:26.419 --> 00:20:30.590
there's a couple of very very

00:20:28.059 --> 00:20:32.899
potentially viable options that's an a

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:36.440
was it was the ticket out of boss rush

00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:40.039
no matter what so I am for that that's

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:43.070
great this gets reroll into the d100 I

00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:46.320
don't consider the D 100 that zany

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:48.150
anymore sometimes we will use it

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:49.860
but it shows up so much and there's so

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:52.260
many opportunities to re-roll that I

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:53.820
think we can also afford to say no to it

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:55.230
now and then and honestly I've been

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:58.530
fighting for this run so I'm going to

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:59.880
keep it it's not a cool run but I'm

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:02.150
going to take it nonetheless so that was

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:04.740
like the worst shot speed up of all time

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:06.540
point one six shot speed and a rules

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:15.980
card it's the way the cookie crumbles

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:15.980
but I'm okay with that

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:20.970
we should have rear old the Magnum I

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:23.340
suppose dude the damages a little silly

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:25.530
to slow your roll on that front okay do

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:30.090
that we did get the deal I'm going to

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:31.740
take both of these now we have permanent

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:33.900
polaroid invincibility after we take the

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:35.490
Polaroid Elyse and we can come in here

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:40.560
what do we get out of here if a CAC

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:42.660
great item mr. mega is a good item evil

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:45.240
I know you just pop a waz for certain

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:46.920
grab a pickaxe get the heck out of here

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:55.440
and we're sitting pretty I mean we have

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:57.870
72 damage now it's really nice when your

00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:00.260
damage equals your deal with the devil

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:02.460
chance that's on then say about that I

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:04.350
guess there are some situations in which

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.730
you can have like a 0.5 deal with the

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:07.590
devil chance for this the same one of

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:10.770
those situations it's not being pedantic

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:12.660
okay we are going to accept that

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:16.440
sometimes you can't make an omelet

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:20.000
without breaking a few eggs hematemesis

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:20.000
can save us a lot of trouble here

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:27.809
I'm basically unconcerned about our HP

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:33.750
even though it's not amazing right now I

00:22:27.809 --> 00:22:40.380
think we can live easily on one HP x

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:43.200
eight lives I think we've got to stick

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:45.809
with hematemesis so how's it feel moon

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:52.200
dad's okay yet I think we got to stick

00:22:45.809 --> 00:22:54.470
with hematemesis which if we find our

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:57.179
secret room second secret room rather

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:58.289
could stand to give us a bunch of HP

00:22:57.179 --> 00:23:02.039
upgrades I can't believe we're still

00:22:58.289 --> 00:23:04.049
rolling mom's toenail he's gonna shake

00:23:02.039 --> 00:23:06.929
your head and she's not going to be

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:08.640
wrong is the thing this is like the only

00:23:06.929 --> 00:23:11.279
trinket no we could have taken safety

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:13.260
cap which would have been better watch

00:23:11.279 --> 00:23:15.149
battery or super magnet whatever it's

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:18.330
called it was super magnet you know what

00:23:15.149 --> 00:23:22.289
I do that and I know it's a huge damage

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:27.270
downgrade there what is going on with my

00:23:22.289 --> 00:23:30.950
knives why did I do that because the

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:34.169
thing was a d100 is that it's too safe a

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:37.010
six-room is permanent and that's what

00:23:34.169 --> 00:23:39.570
makes it special in my opinion we have

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:41.850
we have a strange situation I don't know

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:45.870
if this is monstros lung mom's knife or

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:48.450
what but it's also one of those rare

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:51.480
situations in which you can't be mad at

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:54.890
me for having mom's knife because it's

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:58.320
actually worse than what we started with

00:23:54.890 --> 00:24:00.390
like at some point you got to accept

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:02.870
that this is the rare situation in which

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:05.760
mom's knife is actually substantially

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:07.110
worse did that that did hurt we had to

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:11.580
wait for oh you know we do have the

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:13.500
infestation to infestation no one

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:16.440
breathing something something something

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:18.299
into something into something didn't

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:20.190
want to waste my time coming up with

00:24:18.299 --> 00:24:22.340
lyrics there who bothers with that you

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:22.340
know

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:32.820
No Deal a little bit unhappy with the

00:24:27.809 --> 00:24:39.659
lack of a deal life does go on we do

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:40.950
have perhaps the mind also I love Midas

00:24:39.659 --> 00:24:44.250
touch we can get the permanent Polaroid

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:48.139
instability then we're going to be love

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:48.139
and life here with - touch mom's knife

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:56.549
worth it we do no matter what we still

00:24:51.809 --> 00:24:58.559
got the guppy chance it slow but we do

00:24:56.549 --> 00:25:05.129
have 100% deal with the devil chance not

00:24:58.559 --> 00:25:06.929
so low we've asked it baby we do was

00:25:05.129 --> 00:25:08.279
like we popped a pill that was bad but

00:25:06.929 --> 00:25:11.639
the enemies got poisoned and that was

00:25:08.279 --> 00:25:16.679
temporarily very confused so we should

00:25:11.639 --> 00:25:23.399
try to use pills when relevant I can't

00:25:16.679 --> 00:25:27.500
offhand see explosive immunity so I'm

00:25:23.399 --> 00:25:31.200
thinking that I will probably not worry

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:36.450
blind rage versus mom's toenail I've had

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:45.230
this pilfered for years man I wouldn't

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:45.230
dare excuse me

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:52.090
I am going to check the curse room

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:55.900
I'm unconcerned about HP I said it

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:57.430
earlier I'll say it again or Babylon is

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:58.690
it it gave it oh and it gives us no

00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:01.120
standstill we go into the next room

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:02.680
don't freak out yet that's the

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.540
moneymaker right there good speed

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:08.830
increase which is honestly really

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:10.870
important at our present speed or at our

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:13.270
previous speed rather which was 0.88 and

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:14.530
then combine that with the damage

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:15.100
upgrade them feeling like that was the

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:16.540
right call

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:20.820
I don't know if we have the relic or if

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:23.290
that's just excuse me if that's just a

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:25.360
dark bomb paying out from these red

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:28.090
hearts that we saw earlier but this is

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:31.750
good this is like we left a sweep

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:34.300
startup that we founded ourselves close

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:36.370
and then we found an opportunity to go

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:41.470
join another startup and we just made

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:46.180
that startup awesome you know a very

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:48.580
relatable anecdote there for all of

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:52.090
those amongst us who have started up to

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:54.520
successful companies I'm in negative one

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:55.900
right now so I just need to find

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:57.520
somebody out there who has three and

00:26:55.900 --> 00:27:00.060
we're good to go I'm not gonna fight

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:05.470
hush I'm not gonna fight hush cuz

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:07.930
doesn't want to I took the whole resent

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:10.300
having to say it but there are runs of

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:13.630
which I like fighting hush namely runs

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:14.980
in which I can crap on him there's runs

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:18.990
in which I don't like fighting hush

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:21.850
she's basically all the other ones oh

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:25.530
come on you were already dead I would

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:25.530
love some soup to have action

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:32.679
and I would continue to love some

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:34.480
shootable backs because we aren't

00:27:32.679 --> 00:27:36.249
getting any here now I did get rid of

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:39.490
permanent polaroid invincibility chance

00:27:36.249 --> 00:27:41.200
I also got rid of hematemesis we're

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:44.830
going to roll just fine

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:46.659
on spirit arts because we do have the

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:48.190
relic I mean you could I said earlier I

00:27:46.659 --> 00:27:49.690
don't know if we have the relic suppose

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:52.299
I could have just looked for the

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:56.740
enormous Blue Cross surrounding or the

00:27:52.299 --> 00:28:05.529
like trailing behind our character seems

00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:09.220
to be a successful choice you cannot

00:28:05.529 --> 00:28:10.869
hurt me Midas touch is going to get the

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:12.279
job that okay we didn't take today you

00:28:10.869 --> 00:28:14.830
know I'm getting cocky and there were

00:28:12.279 --> 00:28:15.999
some times where this run was looking a

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:21.279
little bad we shouldn't be getting

00:28:15.999 --> 00:28:23.590
conscious it's a needlessly tone-deaf

00:28:21.279 --> 00:28:25.720
right now is a good word for it that's

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:29.230
fine let's get the heck out of here

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:31.029
there's no reason we have to finish your

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:33.129
run quickly with mom's knife and then

00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:34.919
also do more things to make us the enemy

00:28:33.129 --> 00:28:37.419
here

00:28:34.919 --> 00:28:39.610
sister Maggie's okay we did get

00:28:37.419 --> 00:28:41.350
conjoined lucky foot is good five Lux

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:44.110
should give us new items skinny odd

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:46.090
musher sorry fat on mushroom is actually

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:49.389
terrible for us which I didn't even

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:54.059
think of but a zero point one speed

00:28:49.389 --> 00:28:58.860
downgrade is fairly awful right now with

00:28:54.059 --> 00:29:00.759
0.78 speed after the fact but again

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:03.700
presumably all we're going to have to do

00:29:00.759 --> 00:29:08.110
is worst-case scenario be blue baby with

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:10.450
one HP I think that that is beyond

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:12.580
plausible in all likelihood we will

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:16.379
probably have to beat blue baby with

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:16.379
like six HP

00:29:18.049 --> 00:29:22.620
still worth popping pills get a little

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:27.720
poison damage out of iron okay where's

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:29.220
my items well you can't get your items

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.470
until you finish your meat I never

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:34.200
understood that in the song the wall you

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:37.020
know it because I'm a kid dude while I

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:39.090
was a kid who liked me but didn't like

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:40.559
desserts that much I know it sounds like

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:43.020
I'm putting on airs but it was the

00:29:40.559 --> 00:29:45.570
honest-to-god truth so when the Pink

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:47.670
Floyd song the wall when they go you

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:50.220
know you can't have your pudding till

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:51.960
you finish your meat I'm like there's an

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:57.780
opportunity for capitalism to prevail

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:59.850
here you give me your meats ha ha ha and

00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:02.790
I'll give you my pudding ah ha ha ha ha

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:09.179
you know that's the basis of econ 101

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:11.100
we're getting gains from trade here I'm

00:30:09.179 --> 00:30:17.429
just saying those idiot kids in the song

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:20.910
are missing out we have conjoined end

00:30:17.429 --> 00:30:22.860
also triple shot we have created a

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:27.510
situation in which you know we got a

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:30.390
little too many knives if I'm being

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:32.910
honest with you it is also taking us a

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:34.620
hundred years to charge up enough knives

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:39.059
that we can actually shoot some out and

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:40.710
our range is not good when the knives

00:30:39.059 --> 00:30:42.990
hit they do a lot of damage but that

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:49.070
triple shot is destroyed our rate of

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:50.540
fire we're still going to win

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:52.010
thank you for not making me go to

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:54.170
delirium which I think might have made

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:55.370
