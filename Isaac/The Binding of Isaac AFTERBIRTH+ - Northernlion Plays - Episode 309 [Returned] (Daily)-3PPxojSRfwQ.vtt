00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.049
hey everybody welcome Aaron lamb please

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.720
planning wisely androids plus I did not

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.490
do the daily yesterday I basically ran

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.340
out of time but two days ago I ended up

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.380
in purgatory on the daily and was in

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.049
terrible spot as I spent about 45

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.320
minutes on the last floor alone just

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.670
endlessly doubling things today is the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.140
blue baby daily that goes to shoal

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.820
scores are between forty three thousand

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.080
and sixty three thousand on the front

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.059
page let me take a sip of this coffee

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.760
here I see you up there on the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.260
leaderboards egg that's not my face in

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.649
the avatar I don't even know this mentum

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.030
reference me it might be Dutch for like

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:45.059
Daniel G or something like that I got no

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.620
idea but anyway forty three thousand let

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.340
me crank up the volume here a little bit

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.989
forty three thousand two sixty three

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.030
thousand sixty three thousand is a great

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.850
score forty three thousand is a very

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.710
good score but not high enough that I

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.989
would be like we have no chance to get

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.329
there but it means that if there's a way

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.930
to break it it's probably pretty

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.040
difficult because if there's a way to

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.720
break it it's probably pretty difficult

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.729
because not a whole lot of people found

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.830
it but I mean this is all conjecture

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.060
based on the start of this run you know

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.490
we're working on the Heisenberg

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.970
uncertainty principle you know you can

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.380
know the score of a run but not how to

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.640
get there or you can know how to get

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.259
there but you don't know the score now

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.840
that may sound smart but I basically

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.250
just made that up but all theories and

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.659
science were just made up I mean that's

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:37.579
just a theory a game theory see you next

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:43.680
time don't sue me oh dude

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:46.409
seven cents right off the bat and that's

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.850
interesting I did from doing this you

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.399
know every day of my life for the past

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.159
27 years well it isn't been quite that

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.829
long I was older than one when Isaac

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.049
came out but I know that we will not be

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.710
able to open that Stone chest by using a

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.360
bomb unless we get a second bomb I don't

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.909
think the blast radius will reach it

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.950
repeating of course actually a milestone

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.420
chest only entered into the eyes

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.390
equation with the release of The Binding

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.790
of Isaac rebirth in 2014

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.340
well clearly you must have egg on your

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.720
face listen here you little Poindexter

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.790
give me your lunch money

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.110
I'm going to spend it on burritos with

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:32.160
extra block that's the kind of lifestyle

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:35.310
I'm living um wow I am very glad that we

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.780
came in here don't take that out of

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.590
context gross

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.069
so where we going on today's path

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.680
because this is an interesting situation

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:51.570
tempted too he took one sin from us I'm

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:54.150
tempted to not buy a spear at heart but

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.350
admittedly we don't have to buy a bomb

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.739
anymore so that actually opens things

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.570
wide wide open wait we don't next we

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:05.489
definitely do not need a bomb here so

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:10.410
blow that up worth blow this up not

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:13.560
worth okay 13 cents we're going to get

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:17.489
to 15 is the map worth buying it's an

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.940
interesting question for Daly's Wow duct

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.530
tape

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.570
that's not duct tape it's toilet paper

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.730
as far as I'm concerned can't tell me

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.130
otherwise there we go that's what I was

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.840
looking for enough money that we can

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.579
make the decision and not feel weird

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.230
about it so what I cannot fly

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.060
consistently that's correct so we come

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.510
in here you probably want the 9-volt

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.690
instead right then we'll take the

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.060
battery charge as well and I think with

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.060
the bomb we should look for our secret

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.299
the room and the hopes for getting more

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.340
money Wow yeah you know I should have

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.959
guessed that it wouldn't be there that's

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.239
the conventional wisdom but this just

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.850
feels way more like a secret room anyway

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.700
where are we taking a lot of dumb damage

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:03.630
on this floor and I'm not pleased about

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:06.150
that but we did manage to get well we're

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.920
not too far down on HP it should be

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:13.410
obvious this is one large Larry jr. here

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.180
now we we have the 9-volt with the poop

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.380
which is not a great setup but the idea

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.459
is that maybe in the future we'll have

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.870
the opportunity to get you know a book

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.640
in particular Book of Revelations

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.170
Satanic Bible we can make other books

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.700
work but those are the those are the

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.910
for blue baby if you can make them pop

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.230
anything that has I mean the 9-volt is

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.270
strongest if you're dealing with two

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.990
room charges but you don't always have

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.360
that opportunity of that luxury you very

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.920
very rarely get money out of pop on

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.810
these rooms may be petrified poop makes

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.730
it more likely but I'd say we got pretty

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.010
lucky there you know what we might as

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.270
well try to create an arcade we didn't

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:53.700
get it and that's fine we got a range

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:56.310
plus lock upgrade it's okay more useful

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.500
later but this floor is kind of like for

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.540
all the marbles right now because if we

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.010
get a great deal with the devil we're

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.850
off to the races keep in mind this is a

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:08.940
run in which you know it's our it's our

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:13.080
honest-to-god dream to fight delirium so

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.700
we really sadly would like to get good

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.260
as quickly as possible because we've got

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.620
to make boss rush we got to make the

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.360
hush fight and we got to you know be

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.150
able to kill delirium or at least die

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.190
trying in a respectable fashion so try

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.170
not to do like a million percent due

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.080
diligence here power pill is totally

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:37.710
fine and then relax it basically changes

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:39.600
nothing why do i why do I shoot the poop

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.430
that I make but not always shoot the

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.440
poop it's going to be tight there we go

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.930
that the enemies make because I have

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.850
ownership over that poop you know you

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.950
become attached to your own property and

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.680
I think that's natural it's like if I

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:56.280
make a dinner for myself at home I mean

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.840
everything 100% I made it I know the

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.730
blood sweat and here is not literally

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.010
hopefully that went into the dish oh

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:06.300
dude this is what you want a million

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:08.820
percent oh it's not that great because

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.190
the HP upgrade is the big deal I with

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.350
this one I think as as characters that

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.990
aren't blue baby but it's still very

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.280
very very valuable for us so I am into

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.830
that there's also a tinted rock so we

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:25.640
can just get a bomb preferably not by

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:25.640
buying it then we can

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.250
you know what I don't know what toilet

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:31.150
paper does this is a great opportunity

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:35.440
toilet paper

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:37.330
Isak no not mysterious but I was not

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.370
it's not toilet paper it's duct tape

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:44.800
duct tape is this the one that causes

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:49.569
our familiars not to spin stops orbitals

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.650
from rotating around Isaac I mean this

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:53.889
episode has been sponsored by The

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:56.710
Binding of Isaac wiki I think that it's

00:06:53.889 --> 00:07:00.630
not great in some situations that might

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:05.069
not even be good but it's better than

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:08.349
it's better than Pulse worm which just

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:10.750
doesn't do anything really like I like

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:12.400
pulsar and I take it fairly frequently

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:17.530
spending the game forever it's like an

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:19.479
old family friend but it's not the most

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:23.139
useful trinket in the game it really

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:25.240
does almost nothing so we got three luck

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:26.979
I'm begging for consumables here an

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.750
extra key to make the shop easier to

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:30.669
stomach more money to make purchasing a

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:33.969
bomb easier to stomach or just give me

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:37.240
the bombs directly that we don't have to

00:07:33.969 --> 00:07:38.979
go through this elaborate whoo halo fly

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:41.319
saved me there this elaborate song and

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:44.080
dance furred for no reason here there's

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:46.360
another key come on just give me a bomb

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.650
I really don't want to backtrack too

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.169
much because we might be tight to make

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:53.289
it the boss rush okay well we're

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:56.289
probably gonna have to backtrack on and

00:07:53.289 --> 00:07:57.669
maybe we should have done so earlier so

00:07:56.289 --> 00:08:01.750
that we're more comfortable when it

00:07:57.669 --> 00:08:02.949
comes to our when it comes to our deal

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.120
with the devil but you know what if we

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:07.029
have to go deal with the angel on this

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:10.210
run that's also fine albeit not

00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:12.909
preferred and every every bone in my

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:15.550
body is going hey just leave don't

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:19.000
backtrack and buy a bomb but we we

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:21.400
really really really really really

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.360
should even if it makes us two minutes

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.330
behind schedule

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.710
you know we need the HP especially if we

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:30.599
take a deal with the W this guy just

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:30.599
never summons a bomb huh

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:42.349
I had to think about it

00:08:40.209 --> 00:08:50.720
good good good everything's good there

00:08:42.349 --> 00:08:52.730
except a minor speed downgrade I you

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.350
know what I'm out I'm out maybe we're

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:58.220
missing out on small rock as a result of

00:08:54.350 --> 00:09:00.470
this but I got a I I know who literally

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:04.430
a minute ago I was like we can't but we

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:07.100
have to anyway experimental treatment is

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:09.890
actually good for us in all ways except

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:12.170
for the minus speed I was going to say

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:14.529
modest speed downgrade and I said mine

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:16.279
and somehow my brain filled in the

00:09:14.529 --> 00:09:17.440
contingency plan there and actually

00:09:16.279 --> 00:09:21.829
worked which is good but yeah this is

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:24.380
saline okay right now really the big the

00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:25.790
big get for us was picking up the halo

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.260
you know sort of kick started it and

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:31.070
then experimental treatment not being

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:32.899
bad was extremely helpful so don't feel

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:35.750
like we're massively behind schedule

00:09:32.899 --> 00:09:37.790
right now that's the good stuff and you

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:40.690
got to think about this because you get

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:46.209
this these six rerolls but the guppy

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:46.209
ability is also like pretty solid right

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:54.529
so I think we're going to go for the

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.160
rear oh oh I know no don't kill them yet

00:09:54.529 --> 00:09:56.750
don't kill them yet

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.730
you want to re-roll first we do not want

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:00.170
strange attractors I'm even happier that

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.010
we rear old we should have rear old

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:02.449
faster though because we would have

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.949
gotten the charges instead of just

00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:05.300
summoning three flies per wave we can

00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:07.220
kill these guys easily enough we don't

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.570
need that there are a ton of battery

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:11.000
charges now that I think about it mister

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:15.589
boom is irrelevant don't walk on the

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:18.410
spikes ah there we go bloody lust is not

00:10:15.589 --> 00:10:21.110
that amazing as blue baby but that's you

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:23.660
know not that terrible either because we

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:26.449
could respond as a different character

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:29.899
and get HP or we could just accept this

00:10:26.449 --> 00:10:31.760
as giving us a bonus either way I don't

00:10:29.899 --> 00:10:33.220
know if dull razor works with bloody

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.620
lust I don't know if that's even

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:38.180
efficient but certainly I find it hard

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:42.320
to be like now we're not going to take

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:44.329
bloody lust on this run probably deserve

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:47.750
to take damage from the creep there if

00:10:44.329 --> 00:10:49.670
we get a bomb do we want Gemini I think

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:52.569
it's worth using our only bomb on that

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.569
if our HP is good

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:58.070
obviously if our HP is bad we don't

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.290
really have a choice we got to you know

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:02.690
play the cards that were dealt we have

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:04.880
the range necessary to all that was a

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:09.610
smart play we actually use tactics in

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:12.200
Isaac is the first time for everything

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:15.080
score credit I actually made like an

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:20.540
excited sound they're like but store

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:23.720
credit is extremely useful and we will

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:25.580
use a heck of course we get a chance to

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:28.760
get dull razor I think you just take

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:30.350
nuns have it and then try that to a

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.290
spades I think it's worth it I think

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:34.400
it's worth it

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:37.370
but yeah none Tabet is the safe choice

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:39.110
dull razor is the I mean especially with

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:42.740
bloody lust you like well we could use

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:44.840
it once per room but nuns have a 9 volt

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.730
v6 it gives us the ability to mill

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.230
through so many items that you know

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:51.380
otherwise might be bad that I think it's

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:53.330
this is completely ok again this is the

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.860
the Bighorn law everybody's familiar

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:57.410
with this at this point if your damage

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:59.000
is bad on a run you're going to end up

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:01.520
fighting Bighorn it's just you know one

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.230
of the three certainties in life they

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:06.590
always everybody knows the two

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:07.910
certainties in life death and taxes but

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:10.010
there's also the third one that's rarely

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:11.150
talked about because it's you know much

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:17.060
longer it's like one of the laws of

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:19.040
thermodynamics and that's that if you

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.150
have below 6 damage by the time you get

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.400
to the third floor you will fight

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:25.460
bighorn it's the rule of the engagement

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.690
that's the name of the game as that song

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.190
said that I forgot but we're only going

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:32.470
to be like a minute behind schedule

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:34.640
which is actually surprisingly good

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.080
considering that we were way more than a

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.490
minute by on schedule when we originally

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.410
came down here well we were like I'm a

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.910
minute and a half behind schedule so we

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:42.290
made up some time we got some extra

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.730
damage out of it and we're good to go

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:50.780
we're building a run here we need

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:54.260
defense and by that I mean I'm also like

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:56.420
some bombs wouldn't hurt but we need

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:58.940
some defense by that I mean specifically

00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:02.080
the relic a space bar item that

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:02.080
generates spirit hearts

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:11.150
The MITRE dark bum you know anything in

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:13.070
that in that category of you know game

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:14.900
winning spirit our generators is fine by

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:18.500
me I'm not going to be too picky about

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:19.940
it you know I mentioned the laws of

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.230
thermodynamics I don't remember the laws

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.540
of thermodynamics you're going to be

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:25.310
cocky about it and you're like you know

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:28.460
in a high school right now just you know

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:29.840
refer back to my earlier rants about you

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.130
being the smartest you'll ever be

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.200
probably like in high school or your

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:34.880
first or second year of university after

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.340
that you become a highly specialized and

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:40.220
you start to you start to lose that

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.970
general knowledge okay he's a genius how

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.430
do we do that

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:45.230
I mean also I'm not maybe the normal

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:46.280
case considering I spend my days hunched

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.780
in front of the computer playing one

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.830
game that I'm not even that specialized

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:52.130
at if we're being honest

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:56.360
dad's tempting maybe we'll get some sort

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:57.920
of veal here that'll Oh mad that'll make

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.420
it faster to complete that room because

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:03.290
it's very tempting especially with two

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:04.550
of spades but anyway you know I was

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:07.910
talking about this side I did like a

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:09.980
battleground stream the other day and we

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:12.530
got into some ridiculous like NL SS

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:14.060
arguments like we got to the point we

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:16.850
were talking about like vegetarianism

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:18.260
which was it is actually people will

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:19.580
they always go why are these guys

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.320
talking about things they don't

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:23.090
understand on the show I hate it you

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.170
know I was a vegetarian for a while HD

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.970
Justin was on the show he was a

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:29.750
vegetarian for a while we're familiar

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:32.450
with vegetarianism and then someone was

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:34.730
like do vegetarians he plankton you know

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:38.260
do they need help and I was like well

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:42.920
Calvin is part of the animal kingdom but

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:44.480
it's like so rudimentary I'm not trying

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:48.140
to insult Kell but if they're able to

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:49.700
take offense to it then prove it getting

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:51.530
closer to spawn the virus is actually

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.410
very nice for us to generate some spirit

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:56.510
out so I'm happy about that but like

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:59.750
fundamentally sure kelp are alive but so

00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:02.240
are plants what's the difference on a

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:03.860
cellular level besides like a cell wall

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.210
like what's the difference on an ethical

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:09.860
level between eating kelp and like

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:11.360
eating a kale or something like that I'm

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.270
gonna I'm gonna try it I want spirit

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:17.890
arts much Oh

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:19.870
item okay and I want to tackle this from

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:23.110
actually lat all I should have been hit

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:25.750
I want to tackle this from like a real

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:28.330
standpoint because I mean obviously

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:30.100
people are going to say and and they're

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:32.620
not wrong if you're a vegetarian you

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:34.570
shouldn't need help or plankton for that

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.920
matter because it's an animal it's in

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:38.080
the animal kingdom so if you don't eat

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:41.890
animals you shouldn't eat kelp but it's

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:46.050
like a plant animal right like it's what

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:48.850
about you know would you eat an amiibo

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:51.040
it were is like I just don't understand

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:54.280
what the difference is between I guess a

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:58.090
very primitive form of animal life and

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:59.080
plant life you know it's all life and

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:02.230
I'm not trying to say that this means

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:04.030
that you know QED vegetarians and I'll

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.110
just got you know it's not like that

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:06.970
because I understand the ethical

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:09.850
concerns of like you know consuming

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:11.500
dairy or you know eating things that are

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:13.570
sentient they're eating animals in

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:15.940
general to some extent but the plank

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:17.320
then I just got a no I'm actually I'm

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.600
throwing this out there without judgment

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:21.220
plankton kelp let me know this is not me

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:26.260
trying to catch you in a god shit like

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:28.210
if you're a if you're a vegetarian let

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:30.760
me know what your perspective on kelp is

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:35.520
I'm genuinely just curious but anyway we

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:38.170
were talking about that on the show and

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.430
and as we talked more and more about it

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.990
people were like how does any I'll have

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:43.750
a biology degree and the truth of the

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:45.790
matter is I don't know I mean I mean I

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:49.180
know I know how i got the biology degree

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:51.870
i studied hard enough in university and

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:54.100
i never failed a class and i passed

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:57.010
every exam i ever took

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:59.830
even some that were pretty pretty tricky

00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:02.080
you know but that a lot of that

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:04.780
information because it's fairly specific

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:06.459
is now gone forever

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:09.310
oh i mean this is the easiest decision

00:17:06.459 --> 00:17:12.480
of all time so i wish i could fight the

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:12.480
angel statue but i cannot

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:19.050
judge see you later buddy and we

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.820
obviously need to move on but the Sacred

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:22.829
Heart pickup is stellar and especially

00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:25.290
if we could complete the guppy dream in

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:28.920
the near future I'd be a very very very

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:29.760
happy camper is Sacred Heart I'm here

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:32.580
the thing I was going to take damage

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:37.650
from the poop anyway so is Sacred Heart

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:39.690
a speed downgrade because they're just

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:44.340
getting buck wild with these speed down

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:46.590
grades man you don't need to throw a

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:48.840
speed downgrade behind every single

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:51.570
pickup that you get you know you're

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:54.350
abusing the trust that we the players

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.350
are placed in you

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:05.760
they're both great but we got to go for

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:07.140
spun in my opinion get a power pill out

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.270
of it which is not necessarily bad but

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:12.210
spun has taken us to 22 damage that

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:13.620
might admittedly be the wrong call what

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:16.260
we did there might be the wrong call but

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:18.540
I think it's probably not the wrong call

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:21.480
and we are hoping to get some

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:23.520
consumables but we're so focused like

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:26.430
laser focused on boss rush right now we

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:28.500
are going to make it so what do I think

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:30.060
the seam has been for us so far I mean

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.920
we didn't even get the opportunity to

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:33.870
take a deal with the devil so that helps

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.280
out a lot than the angel deal obviously

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:37.680
you know we took what I would consider

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:40.380
to be the consensus right choice without

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.550
a doubt but then the we're just going to

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:45.690
go forget the shop we'll get it next

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:47.880
floor if we can the the other thing is

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:49.290
not everybody is probably going to take

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:52.080
experimental treatment and I think those

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:56.000
people will still be fine on today's

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:58.620
daily like there's enough good stuff but

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.930
we definitely benefited from taking

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:02.310
sponge so okay we're down to the next

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:05.030
floor basically on schedule I'm going to

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:05.030
copy up here

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:11.330
there is an element and I say this is

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:13.010
someone you know who may one day have to

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:15.230
lean on his degree to get a job but

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:17.690
there's an element of if you don't use

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:19.640
it you lose it I'm not saying that to

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:22.310
alarm people I mean I'm just putting

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:25.070
myself because I mean there are people

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:26.630
in this world that are like you know I

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:29.720
have a degree in biology so everything I

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:31.190
say about biology is right I yeah I

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:34.580
talked about this on the show as well

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:36.080
but when people were like NL how could

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.850
you ever use your biology degree I was

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.560
like you know the thing with science is

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:41.000
once you get to a certain point if

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.350
anybody asks you a question you don't do

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.700
the ant you don't know the answer to you

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:45.950
just go I don't know I just look it up

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:47.480
in the literature you know I'll just do

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:51.200
a journal review of that and get back to

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:55.760
you you know it becomes a I mean

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:57.290
dim-bulb is probably just better but the

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.480
thing is with nine-volt dim bulb is

00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:01.150
never going to be good for us but or is

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:06.350
it rarely going to be good for us but

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:09.020
the flip side of this is that you know

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:09.680
duct tape is doing nothing so doesn't

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:13.190
really matter

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:15.620
um but yeah you know I feel that with

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:17.060
with programming as well and I know

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:19.610
everyone's like please they'll make

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:21.470
another you know 50 minute treatise on

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:24.980
programming like we're so sick of it

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:27.440
but it is true you know I have the works

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:31.850
with people academically at least that

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:33.290
you know they only program when there's

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:34.430
like a test coming up or when they have

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:35.930
an assignment due or something like that

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:38.420
they don't do any in their spare time

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:39.890
and like you know over a six-week break

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:41.630
from class or something like that they

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:43.160
atrophied like crazy or at least they

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:44.750
can't atrophy like crazy so you got to

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:50.390
you got to keep those skills up it's

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:53.900
like exercising when I was running a lot

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:55.370
at least a lot for me I read this report

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:58.400
that was like how long does it take for

00:20:55.370 --> 00:21:01.160
your body to revert back to its like

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:03.470
resting state after you stop a running

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:06.260
habit and it was depressing but also you

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:11.240
know realistic it was like after after

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:13.160
like a month you lose like 50% of the of

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.870
the built up running experiences this is

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.310
paraphrasing of course because I don't

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:17.650
think built up running experience is a

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:19.690
real mess

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:21.970
then after like three months it's like

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:23.170
you've lost the benefit of having ever

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:24.640
done it in the first place

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:26.050
that doesn't mean you shouldn't do it

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:28.750
what it means is that you should keep it

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:30.220
up and even if you didn't at least you

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:33.280
did for the time that it was available

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:35.740
like you know I'm not being hypocritical

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:38.860
here at all I stopped running but does

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:40.480
because I tore my meniscus and unbending

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:43.480
my leg made it feel like I was going to

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:45.760
die so okay we are going to make boss

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:48.100
rush I'm going to be a little bit cheeky

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:52.420
here come back and grab a battery charge

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:54.070
and I'm going to grab the card I was

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:56.470
looking for something that gave us a leg

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:58.090
up on the boss rush and I don't know if

00:21:56.470 --> 00:22:00.340
we got it I'm not worried about a secret

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:02.220
room we got it we got to kill mom here

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:04.840
we're going to get through this in time

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:06.070
with more than enough time I will

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.080
actually fight Krampus if you get

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:09.340
Krampus we didn't and that's probably

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:12.700
for the best

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:14.050
take this pop the magician we're going

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:19.140
to use it in here no matter what and you

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:19.140
pry yeah you 100% want the wafer and

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:28.480
then we got 40 damage so I think that

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:30.460
we're in a good spot here we are a

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.780
little bit lighter on points than we

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:33.820
would normally expect to be by this

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:40.090
point in the run and that's a hundred

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:41.440
percent I think a result of good good

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:42.880
damage there at least we got eight

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.740
damage for walking on the creeps but

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:47.680
still and that's 100 percent of result

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:49.240
of the damage that I've taken so anyway

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.460
I don't know it's kind of been I haven't

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.900
made you I pride myself in these videos

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:55.060
when I get so boxy I like to make

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:57.850
concise elegant points and I have not

00:22:55.060 --> 00:23:01.150
done that today I guess what I'm trying

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:03.070
to get at is you know if we're going to

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:06.700
reach for something kind of soapbox II

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:11.350
when I was younger I was very progress

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:12.970
oriented you know if I wanted to get fit

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:15.190
for example it's like I'm going to go

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:18.220
online and I'm going to figure out the

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:21.100
most efficient way to get fit work smart

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:22.930
not hard right so you're like oh yeah

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.820
well you know you could do like a full

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:27.400
body workout you could work out your

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:29.170
individual muscle groups you know for 40

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.940
minutes each and then alternate every

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:33.370
day that's like you know

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:35.410
the first picture of the brain expanding

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:37.720
meme and then the second one is like one

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:41.290
full body workout that's 50 minutes long

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:43.450
with compound lifts every every other

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:44.260
day and then the final one is like I

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:46.780
just do

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:49.390
Tabata which is when you just go as hard

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:51.490
as you can for four minutes I do I do

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:52.990
five sets of Tabata a week with pull-ups

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:55.930
and you're like man I'm only working out

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:58.240
20 hours a week by the way I don't know

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:59.470
if Tabata is still like it sounds like

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.300
something you order in a Japanese

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:03.490
restaurant but I don't know if Tabata is

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:07.090
still like a trendy Fitness thing but it

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:09.280
is actually hell I I tried it for like

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:11.140
six weeks the principle of Tabata could

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:12.670
not be easier it's like you know why are

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:14.320
you wasting all your time how much time

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:17.080
if you're in the gym do you actively

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:19.180
spend lifting things probably like 40%

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:21.070
of your time you know you got to walk

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:23.080
over to the machine or the free weights

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:25.390
you got to get them you got a you know

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:27.220
you do a set of ten then you rest for a

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:28.780
minute then you do a set of ten you rest

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:30.520
for a minute then you set at any rest

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:32.170
room in a tree rack the weights it's a

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:35.830
lot of downtime in between doing those

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:38.680
lifts so Tabata is like hey set a timer

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:41.800
and for four minutes just do as many of

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:43.300
one exercise as you can and if that

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.490
sounds too good to be true it is it's

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:48.570
actually you know you might think that

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:51.690
you're a fit individual and you may be

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:54.370
let me know how you how many how many

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:56.800
pushups you do in four minutes I would

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:58.180
bet that 50% or more of those push-ups

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:01.960
come in the first minute and the next

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:03.520
180 seconds are you going ah you know

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.780
you'll you'll wish for an hour-long

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.230
workout after I don't even know if it

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.270
works

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.710
it was just anyway I'm getting

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:10.390
tangential to the point here

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:11.860
the dailies going well though we're a

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:13.720
few thousand again below where I'd like

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:16.380
to be but my own fault this is where we

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:19.120
get goofy and just steamroll hopefully I

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:23.050
was so progress oriented I'm like you

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:24.850
know I want to learn you know economics

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:26.950
how do I learn economics the fastest way

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:32.140
possible that's actually like before I

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:34.960
went to Korea I did like for maybe like

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:36.760
a month I did like six hours of rosetta

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:38.440
stone every single day I was just I was

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:40.810
the kind of person who got motivated in

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:43.340
short bursts but to an extreme degree

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:45.350
I'm sure a lot of people can relate to

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:47.000
that because you know it's not just

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:48.980
about looking for a quick fix it's like

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.280
when you get into something you're like

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:54.020
this is all I want to do and and even

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.790
though it seems like it could be

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:57.200
perceived as work like I get enjoyment

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:58.970
out of it it can be a really productive

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:02.060
thing when you focus that it's something

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:06.530
that's productive but the problem is you

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:08.600
know after after three weeks of doing

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:10.220
Tabata you go I don't really want to do

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:14.630
Tabata anymore and then you just fall

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:15.770
off so there is a secret room here I

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:19.280
would have thought that these borders

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:22.700
does but but how no no this is this is

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:25.340
wrong the secret room is here but it's

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:26.810
the same right what I'm losing my mind

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:28.700
if they're two different secret rooms

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:30.500
here first off let's go to the let's go

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:34.100
to the curse room get that bloody love

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:35.600
penalty up at least I'm here to tell you

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.960
that it will exactly have the wafers so

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.180
good

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:42.170
I'm here to tell you that if you're the

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:44.780
kind of person who gets motivated in

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:46.910
that specific way don't be afraid to

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:48.500
take things slow you know it's how it's

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:52.970
been going for programming for me I feel

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:55.400
like sure there are people who probably

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:56.600
started college after I started learning

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:59.480
how to program and they're doing like a

00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:01.160
you know full time scholastic thing

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:03.470
they're going to get their degrees like

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:04.970
next year and I'm still puttering along

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:06.410
like maybe I'll start learning

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:08.300
JavaScript next year you know I

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:11.450
understand you are going to be left

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:14.000
behind but the to some extent but you

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:18.140
build great habits and the skill I feel

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.970
like stays there like when I think of

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:21.910
like my ideal form of like exercising

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:23.930
now it's not like you know I'm going to

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:25.850
do a high-intensity interval training

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:27.110
and then get myself up to the level

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:28.430
where I can like you know I don't do an

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:30.320
Ironman or something like that like that

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:33.070
appeals to me because it requires a lot

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:35.030
of motivation but and obviously I'm not

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:36.590
bad-mouthing anybody who does because

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:37.970
this actually is like an incredible feat

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:40.820
of human endurance but for me it's like

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:42.350
and you know be nice if five years from

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:47.180
now I could look back and be like I

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:48.850
judged you calamity almost every day for

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:52.280
the past five years that would be like

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:54.440
perfect for me I'm finding balance in my

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:55.210
life I thinking you know it takes a week

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:57.789
to

00:27:55.210 --> 00:28:00.789
some time to get there even when it

00:27:57.789 --> 00:28:01.990
comes to making videos like I'm not

00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:04.240
going to say that I'm the hardest worker

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:07.480
on planet Earth but I'm very productive

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:10.840
and and some like earlier you know for

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:12.640
talking like 2013-2014 largely the way

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:17.070
that would manifest itself is like on

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:20.350
one day I would make like 12 videos and

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:22.659
then you know maybe the next day I

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:24.549
wouldn't make very many at all but by

00:28:22.659 --> 00:28:27.700
having sustained bursts like that I

00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:30.250
would maintain my productivity now I

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:33.880
have a much gentler structure we might

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:36.039
want to reroll that that's even soul

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:38.860
thoughts arrive like butterflies go on

00:28:36.039 --> 00:28:40.510
c'mon c'mon c'mon I'll um

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:41.740
we're going to take the relic we could

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:44.080
have rear old them and look for Godhead

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:46.179
in it that's like the the risky play but

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:48.130
the relic is something we need to have

00:28:46.179 --> 00:28:54.039
because if we she leave your ass she's

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:55.929
going to leave what half perfect

00:28:54.039 --> 00:28:57.490
actually perfect and the speed upgrade

00:28:55.929 --> 00:28:58.960
is nice we still need to make the Hoss

00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:00.640
fight so we are worried about that but

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:02.440
anyway I'm going to stop talking about

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:05.529
myself cuz it's getting it's a bad look

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:06.549
but suffice it to say you know if you're

00:29:05.529 --> 00:29:09.659
if you're the kind of person who's

00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:12.340
productive in a in in short bursts you

00:29:09.659 --> 00:29:14.620
know I'm here to tell you you know get

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:16.450
over it or you know use it productively

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:18.370
because I think this as a young person's

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:20.440
game and that's cool but don't be afraid

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:22.299
of them living a more balanced life

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.110
either we're going to get a reroll at

00:29:22.299 --> 00:29:25.390
the end of this so we're going to be

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:26.830
very close at least and I'm hoping you

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:32.100
know somehow it manifests as a guppy

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:35.380
dream but oh okay

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:36.850
Bartz am i right anyway the thing is we

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:43.690
got so many spirit outs just for being

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:45.159
on this room you ever one oh ass so I'm

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:46.809
going to do it and I'm actually happy

00:29:45.159 --> 00:29:48.850
with how this went down but I wanted to

00:29:46.809 --> 00:29:51.909
not waste the battery charge but we also

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:53.169
are a little concerned about time I

00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:54.340
wouldn't even say we're tight on time

00:29:53.169 --> 00:29:55.600
we're just concerned about it but

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:58.590
actually our HP is going to be

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.590
completely okay now

00:30:01.309 --> 00:30:08.940
which is why I feel like we're basically

00:30:05.249 --> 00:30:10.830
destined for success on this run now as

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:12.899
long as we make it to the hush right

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:15.330
hush we'll die we will definitely make

00:30:12.899 --> 00:30:16.649
it to the void floor and if we make it

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:19.259
to the void floor we should have no

00:30:16.649 --> 00:30:20.849
problems bleeding delirium and bye no

00:30:19.259 --> 00:30:22.289
problems I mean like we'll take some

00:30:20.849 --> 00:30:24.389
hits and probably lose a couple thousand

00:30:22.289 --> 00:30:28.859
but we'll at least get the the value of

00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:32.479
having finished the the run in what I

00:30:28.859 --> 00:30:34.979
would consider to be the Honorable way

00:30:32.479 --> 00:30:36.599
you know what we have been sort of I

00:30:34.979 --> 00:30:38.489
don't want they starved but what I

00:30:36.599 --> 00:30:42.059
haven't been super stoked with on this

00:30:38.489 --> 00:30:45.889
run is the the trinket game we've had a

00:30:42.059 --> 00:30:49.769
lot of trinkets that are more or less

00:30:45.889 --> 00:30:51.059
basically useless and dim bulb is not

00:30:49.769 --> 00:30:52.169
basically useless it's just useless

00:30:51.059 --> 00:30:56.009
because of the way that we've structured

00:30:52.169 --> 00:31:02.580
it but I'd like to I'd like to amp it up

00:30:56.009 --> 00:31:05.719
a little bit if if possible I took the

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:08.339
quarter by the way because the quarter

00:31:05.719 --> 00:31:10.109
sounds like chicken cordon bleu which is

00:31:08.339 --> 00:31:10.789
a great dish although dangling doesn't

00:31:10.109 --> 00:31:13.109
like it

00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:14.700
no I to be honestly I don't think I've

00:31:13.109 --> 00:31:17.940
had chicken cordon bleu since I was like

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:19.409
8 which one is so there's chicken with

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:22.109
stuffed with like Swiss cheese and ham

00:31:19.409 --> 00:31:24.469
and then there's chicken Kiev which is

00:31:22.109 --> 00:31:26.519
like cheese and spinach I don't know

00:31:24.469 --> 00:31:28.259
it's been a while I haven't had a

00:31:26.519 --> 00:31:31.859
chicken breast stuffed with anything in

00:31:28.259 --> 00:31:33.749
a long time I will say you know you're

00:31:31.859 --> 00:31:37.139
familiar with the establishment known as

00:31:33.749 --> 00:31:40.409
Nando's Nando's I don't know Nando's I

00:31:37.139 --> 00:31:42.960
think is Nando's because of this cheeky

00:31:40.409 --> 00:31:45.179
Nando's you know meme slash marketing

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:47.609
campaign they have one in Vancouver I

00:31:45.179 --> 00:31:50.129
ordered from her recently it was

00:31:47.609 --> 00:31:54.509
positively ok that's not meant as an

00:31:50.129 --> 00:31:56.099
insult I was like this is sure I was

00:31:54.509 --> 00:31:58.289
like this is pretty good I don't know

00:31:56.099 --> 00:32:01.289
what all the fuss is about but it's like

00:31:58.289 --> 00:32:02.789
I would I would order it again are you

00:32:01.289 --> 00:32:05.099
going to say would you get to the sides

00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:06.029
I got potato wedges is that wrong or

00:32:05.099 --> 00:32:08.129
right I don't know

00:32:06.029 --> 00:32:09.749
I prefer potato wedges to fries and

00:32:08.129 --> 00:32:11.639
these were good potato wedges it wasn't

00:32:09.749 --> 00:32:12.260
the potato wedges were not the problem

00:32:11.639 --> 00:32:14.030
there was no

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:15.800
problem but I was like it's just this

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:18.890
place is like a million locations around

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:21.170
planet Earth how they manage that it's

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:23.300
impressive to be honest with you okay

00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:28.520
we're going down here 40,000 within

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:29.420
reach I think possibly feel free to tell

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:33.470
me I don't know what I'm talking about

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:34.580
that's part of my brand it just barked

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:40.730
did you hear that what is it what does

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:47.120
that bark mean blow this guy up what is

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:55.460
it boy I don't underst does it mean that

00:32:47.120 --> 00:33:00.680
one of these has like a crawl space he's

00:32:55.460 --> 00:33:04.010
done it now was that worth it highly not

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:12.290
at this present we are like three cents

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:18.140
damn you crawl spaces every time I think

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:20.360
we want neither now this is a tough one

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:22.700
man but I think you want piercing shots

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:24.710
so I mean let's crack two of these I'm

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:26.180
hoping for more keys we did get one more

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:28.160
key so we can keep the dream alive and

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:30.920
we crank this only got drain D we don't

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:35.510
want that so the question becomes what's

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:38.080
more valuable reeling that or reroll in

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:40.880
this and I think it's rerunning this

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:41.990
taro cloth and then we're going to buy

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:44.810
the card as well

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:48.950
excuse us hermit chariot will keep the

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:51.170
devil card for now and then in here we

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:56.330
could get a reroll so let's just play it

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:57.740
cool for now so we got four damaged up

00:33:56.330 --> 00:34:01.370
which is not as much as I would have

00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:03.500
loved but life goes on we've got the

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:06.760
range necessary to land these so this

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.760
guy's is done and dusted

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:14.030
we've had a lot of like really really

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:16.070
good choices on this run like we got a

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:20.330
great rate of fire great damage and it

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:21.230
gives us shielded tears versus uh versus

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:23.929
piercing shots

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:27.379
I mean shielded tears x+ evo basically

00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:28.940
makes it so hush can hit you you just

00:34:27.379 --> 00:34:30.919
surround him on all sides with the

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:31.970
shielded tears but the piercing shots I

00:34:30.919 --> 00:34:34.129
think are going to be very useful for

00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:37.700
clearing rooms on the next floor so it's

00:34:34.129 --> 00:34:44.510
a calculated cost I wish I could have

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:46.010
taken both way no it's I mean the

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:47.510
problem with decks placebo is shielded

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:49.159
tears is that the the shields eventually

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:51.230
explode I mean we can continue to stack

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:52.790
up more and more but it would be better

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:56.179
if we had booger tears but I digress

00:34:52.790 --> 00:35:00.110
anyway I don't know this Daly has just

00:34:56.179 --> 00:35:01.430
been like really really Pleasant it

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:02.690
didn't always look like that when we

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:03.710
were at one and a half spirit arts on

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:05.150
the first floor it looked like we might

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:07.040
brick it up and put ourselves in a

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:08.810
horrible position but instead we've come

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.990
through smelling like a rose here

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:10.990
honestly

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:24.400
and really like if I'm looking back on

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:25.810
the dailies for for May and June we as

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.849
far as I'm concerned except for the

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:28.839
slump performed really well we had a

00:35:27.849 --> 00:35:32.410
couple dailies that were in the

00:35:28.839 --> 00:35:34.300
thousands but I was mad because many of

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:35.800
them were just finding ourselves unable

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:37.980
to find a scene but a couple of them

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:40.440
were like Oh technical difficulties so

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:43.060
you know the one where we accidentally

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:45.160
blew up the mirror at the same time that

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:46.960
we played it and froze the game that one

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:48.339
bums me out but it's not like I'm going

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:50.050
to ask for a refund or something like

00:35:48.339 --> 00:35:58.000
that do they still do steam refunds

00:35:50.050 --> 00:36:01.000
after 2200 hours in the game probably

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.579
not huh do they still do steam refunds

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:09.730
for 2200 hours in the game with a press

00:36:03.579 --> 00:36:14.890
copy I doubt it that looked like it was

00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:21.010
going to hit me but we're totally set

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:26.200
right now having not taken damage here

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:29.589
you know it's mostly just for like bare

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:31.720
minimum like point gain at this point we

00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:35.349
really can't be mad at anything on a run

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:37.420
in which we have 28 damage base still

00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:38.829
safe I think uh what are we going to

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:39.760
take if we don't get a charge because it

00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:44.170
looks like we're not going to get a

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:47.770
charge well I will I'll probably take

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:52.000
the shot speed up I can't remember what

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:54.940
the other item is but we could we could

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:58.720
deal with speed ball speed and shot

00:36:54.940 --> 00:37:00.700
speed up is like at least okay no

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:03.970
battery charge just a red heart all

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:05.319
right all right all right all right well

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:07.030
yeah we don't we don't need blue baby's

00:37:05.319 --> 00:37:10.030
only friend it does contribute to

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:12.490
beelzebub I think but so what so now

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:19.109
we're out this way to get top 30 we're

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:19.109
going to need 43040 3000

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:26.280
Rick Dees in the weekly top 30 that's a

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:28.710
reference that I don't even know if it

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:31.170
makes sense see I thought Rick Dees was

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:34.980
Canadian then I realized that Rick Dees

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:37.230
is an American radio DJ that at least in

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:40.079
my adolescence had a very populated

00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:43.829
syndicated reality not reality radio

00:37:40.079 --> 00:37:48.420
show where he counted down the the top

00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:50.280
40 songs on the on the Billboard Hot 200

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:54.109
I think or maybe he made up the songs

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:56.309
the listing himself I don't know but I

00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:57.599
didn't really realize how syndication

00:37:56.309 --> 00:38:02.880
works so I always thought Rick Dees was

00:37:57.599 --> 00:38:03.960
Canadian yeah we're lucky that's not the

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.790
way it works so just because they're on

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:07.650
Canadian radio doesn't mean they're

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:08.609
Canadian Rick Dees Islamically top 40

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:10.349
was always weird because I'd be

00:38:08.609 --> 00:38:12.510
listening to it in like the year 2000

00:38:10.349 --> 00:38:15.119
and then he'd be like we're bringing it

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:17.160
back to a classic all the way from 1998

00:38:15.119 --> 00:38:20.369
this is you know Monica and Brandi the

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:22.440
boy is mine and you're like let's when

00:38:20.369 --> 00:38:25.410
you're when you're 12 you're like man

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:27.869
two years ago ancient history but as an

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:31.170
adult I'm like Rick Dees and the weekly

00:38:27.869 --> 00:38:35.549
top 40 that's not that old that's a

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:36.869
relatively contemporaneous track so I'm

00:38:35.549 --> 00:38:39.660
throwing caution to the wind

00:38:36.869 --> 00:38:42.720
I don't like backtracking that much sure

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:47.250
it is important I prefer not to do it

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:49.950
whenever go all you jerk so we're we're

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:52.109
in heck right now I'm apologizing for

00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:55.440
the strong language but cursed I makes

00:38:52.109 --> 00:38:57.510
it nearly impossible in my opinion to be

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:59.700
delirium with our present setup but we

00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:01.559
could rule that was close we could mix

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:04.470
it up if we get like some extra

00:39:01.559 --> 00:39:06.450
invincibility somehow like algae's for

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:08.490
example helps out a lot apart from that

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:11.450
I don't know dude we're going to we're

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:11.450
going to feel the burn here

00:39:12.369 --> 00:39:26.599
she's probably done magic mush lovely 12

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:28.130
damage up that's pretty solid dude yeah

00:39:26.599 --> 00:39:31.880
that's fine I just held the charge

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:35.329
because I didn't want to want to screw

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:37.510
it up their box good trinket it's not

00:39:35.329 --> 00:39:42.380
bad but it's not good

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:45.290
addicted it's better than dim bulb right

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:47.720
now probably should have played that but

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:53.990
you know we could spend 10 years playing

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:57.980
that if we wanted to listen for the for

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:59.500
the wolf you know what at least cursed I

00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:01.730
means that if we teleport out of the

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:03.380
Delirium fight here if you find the

00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:04.790
Delirium fight early and we teleport out

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:08.809
accidentally we don't have to go back to

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:09.380
it right away how to jump not good for

00:40:08.809 --> 00:40:13.400
us right now

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:17.210
reroll it a little Steven exactly okay

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:19.160
for us aka makes no difference I mean

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:21.880
when you've got 35 damage you're

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:26.900
probably not overly concerned with the

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:30.470
little Stevens damage come on you know

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:32.510
there's a guppy item on here Steven so

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:34.540
three damage up that's actually worth

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:34.540
something

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:47.540
Oh secret room it's gotta be here okay

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:52.640
I mean it gives us points right yeah

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:53.960
like ten points about exactly enough to

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:56.420
make me care without making me

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:58.010
particularly excited about it so again I

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:59.090
I think the important thing to keep in

00:40:58.010 --> 00:41:00.590
mind for like tempering your

00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:03.320
expectations here because I know so many

00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:05.480
people are like NL I am you know my

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:07.100
happiness completely depends on your

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:08.870
self-esteem from ranking well in this

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:09.830
daily obviously I'm being facetious you

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:11.690
know I hope you're having a great day

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:15.410
regardless whether or not my runs trash

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:18.770
or not but the thing to keep in mind is

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:21.110
that we don't get bonus points after we

00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:24.260
finish a daily that ends on delirium so

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:25.430
we will have whatever we have when we

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:27.140
touch that trophy is what we're going to

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:31.640
have when the score screen pops up so

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:33.320
just be aware of that I get people and

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:35.780
you're going to think that this is

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:38.120
putting on airs a little bit but I get

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:39.320
people to send me messages specifically

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.940
I got one this week on Twitter that

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:42.350
where a dude was like hey I don't really

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.970
know why but when you called yourself a

00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:45.530
garbage human being it really made me

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:48.530
feel a little bit better about myself so

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:50.240
thanks a lot for that dude you might

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:52.250
think that I mean I don't think that's

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:54.980
meant to be taken offense to I think

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:59.480
that's honest you know everybody you

00:41:54.980 --> 00:42:03.260
know one knows yourself better than

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:04.640
yourself right if we all judged

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:06.230
ourselves harshly I think we're all

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:09.470
garbage human beings I mean I'm I've

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:12.230
done well for myself and you know a

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:13.670
people seem to like listening to me and

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:18.590
watching my content which is very

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:22.130
flattering 11 damage up from cracked

00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:23.900
crown so like my self-esteem is pretty

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:26.540
good at the same time in my a garbage

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:32.150
human being yeah when my wife went away

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:34.100
for two days I ate a hard taco shell I

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:35.840
put shredded cheddar cheese in the

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:38.180
middle and microwaved it for 30 seconds

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:40.160
to make the world's worst nachos you

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:41.570
know obviously you know if you know that

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:43.130
those intimate details about yourself

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:44.900
you're a garbage human being we're all

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:47.540
garbage human beings we're just trying

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:49.350
to be like the least stinky version of

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:51.630
the garbage that we can be

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:54.570
and that's what I aspire to on a daily

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:57.600
basis you know is like you know

00:42:54.570 --> 00:43:00.150
obviously none of us are free from sin

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:02.550
and we've all strayed far from God's

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:04.380
light what can I do to minimize that

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:07.410
today you know one day at a time

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:09.210
and today is one day at a time thing

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:11.010
that I'm doing is is playing pretty well

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:13.520
in today's daily hopefully bringing you

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:13.520
some entertainment

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:18.150
we haven't been hit on this Floria I'm

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:22.490
bagging for the gup-b out of moms

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:25.560
contacts is lovely but I'm bagging for

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:26.940
this goofy action dude we got 50 damage

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:31.200
done we have been hit on this floor

00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:35.070
we've been here once by by brownie the

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:37.800
hardest boss in Earth's history not a

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:43.530
copy item who we can't even get it I

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:45.870
can't even get to it it's nice we got a

00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:48.180
little like sky bridge here that was

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:49.980
terrible damage we only got one damage

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:56.490
up from it as well which is the worst

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:59.390
thing do I think we can beat delirium

00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:59.390
yeah

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:14.430
infant great item I do but it is going

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:16.770
to depend on not teleporting and it's

00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:19.380
not the easiest thing to guarantee you

00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:21.410
know delirium is a tendency to tell a

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:23.360
frag

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:26.060
and you know there's explosive shots

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:29.420
that that pop off on the regular not for

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:31.070
me from delirium infamy you know will

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:36.080
help negate some of this damage which is

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:40.010
really nice but it's not necessarily

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:41.000
going to be easy for us you know this is

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:45.130
kind of a nightmare

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.130
like mama Gerty is a nightmare for us

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:51.830
because I don't think it's conceivable

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:59.120
for me to dodge the spikes on the

00:44:51.830 --> 00:45:04.850
regular about halfway through and I

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:06.740
think it's good to stay stay loose here

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:08.240
and remember that halfway through is

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:13.720
really only like a quarter of the way

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:15.260
there we've still got a focus on not

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:18.140
teleporting you know it's like when

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:19.730
you're halfway through a course you're

00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:21.620
not really halfway through a course you

00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:23.540
know and sometimes the university you

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:24.890
have a final exam where 70% of your

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:27.500
overall mark sometimes you got a final

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:28.730
exam ooh we got very lucky to have a

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:30.650
full charge there sometimes you've got a

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:38.090
final exam worth 100% of your overall

00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:40.400
mark those are great situations because

00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:41.960
it means you you don't do any work

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:43.370
through the rest of the course okay so

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:51.410
we had a full charge there I made sure

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:53.950
that one oh let's go that one could have

00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:53.950
gotten me

00:45:58.450 --> 00:46:01.940
just stay like in one phase for a minute

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:13.520
here

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:15.920
I don't like when you teleport no beams

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:18.500
please that's fine that's fine we did it

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:21.440
okay so we're going to be like 39,000

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:25.700
good score on today's Bailey there's

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:27.589
work to be done but that's fine we just

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:29.420
got a little bit more stuff to take care

00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:32.869
of your grab that we're going to finish

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:34.790
it as daily like 40,000 I also

00:46:32.869 --> 00:46:38.030
personally guarantee that we are going

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:45.320
to become guppy because that's just the

00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:47.300
way she goes on a run like this you've

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:48.530
got to become guppy and especially after

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:56.180
you fought delirium it's the perfect

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:57.650
opportunity any run on which you you

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:59.630
have the opportunity to fight delirium

00:46:57.650 --> 00:47:02.060
and you choose to I think you can rest

00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:03.619
easy especially if you uh if you win you

00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:05.960
know we took the honorable approach here

00:47:03.619 --> 00:47:07.190
and the honorable approach didn't pay

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:08.750
dividends now we're probably going to

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:10.910
lose points as a result of having fought

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:15.680
delirium but dude I'm just amazed we

00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:17.780
didn't die on the Delirium fight let's

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:20.839
burn died not die but get teleported at

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:23.030
the very least like that is that's easy

00:47:20.839 --> 00:47:25.609
money I would have bet my life savings

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:26.869
on a teleportation there and I mean it

00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:28.130
would have been a conflict of interest

00:47:26.869 --> 00:47:29.599
because I could have made it happen but

00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:30.920
at the same time anyone willing to pay

00:47:29.599 --> 00:47:33.500
fit to take that bet

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:35.390
please do too bad we didn't get the to

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:38.869
Gaza rune earlier but we got one room

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:41.990
left let's do it maximize this total

00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:46.640
score and there we go this is basically

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:48.680
going to be our score forty thousand one

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:50.390
hundred and fifty let's say as a as an

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:53.690
approximation so I think we're gonna be

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:56.119
top 100 top 150 at worst and it's a long

00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:57.829
daily but it's a nice daily and it was

00:47:56.119 --> 00:48:01.369
surprisingly comfortable for like the

00:47:57.829 --> 00:48:04.420
whole thing I mean we should just pop a

00:48:01.369 --> 00:48:07.990
bomb down and then grab all this so

00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:10.180
might have just pushed us best egg on

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:12.730
the day they on the leaderboard so 151

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:13.840
