##

00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:08.610
everybody welcome back your dreams with

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.349
your chicken and welcome okay you get

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.950
the idea we're gonna do as asel greed

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.369
because we can do as asel greed and I'll

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:22.619
show you our seed here our zaidel seed

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:26.279
VMC b22 NP this is not the most a lot of

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.560
money and the luck do we've to luck and

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.170
twenty four cents from our first room

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.809
that's madness

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.610
so oh my god we got thirty cents in free

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.079
money to start this right now no machine

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.899
unfortunately no reroll machine I should

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.329
say but still it's pretty solved do kind

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.450
of bomb out it this is like so great to

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.649
start with let me come in here and it's

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.360
okay yeah it probably is aggregate gonna

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.559
contribute you know a decent amount of

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.270
money over the course of this run which

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.469
is important the whole point is to win

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.629
greedy your mode and then we unlock

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.780
Lilith and I think it's every character

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.390
except the lost in the keeper on much so

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.780
again those usually come much later but

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:14.010
for now look at this it's like just

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.140
every possible role has come to a good

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.400
head for us here I'm going to try it - a

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.930
heart so it's not what we were looking

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.430
for but I figured for five cents it's

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:28.100
not a bad deal so you know the drill

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.100
here essentially every time we can use

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.140
our Wooden Nickel we're going to use our

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.299
Wooden Nickel now we can run like a

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.310
pretty easy analysis they're like 10

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:43.259
waves on every floor we'd expect 50% of

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.990
them to payout to five extra cents per

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.520
floor and then add in the chance that we

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.990
could get a nickel out of it let's say

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.490
like we're probably going to average 6

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.420
cents per floor just for holding and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.899
using this item it's not a ton pardon me

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.400
congestion there it's not a ton it's

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.050
something

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.460
combine that with a chance to maybe get

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.130
luck upgrades out of it I think this

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.810
could have like a deceptively valuable

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.780
impact over the course of this entire

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.150
run not quite you know shears leveled

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.960
but you know what is in today's modern

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:20.490
world I probably I don't intend to buy

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.490
anything else on the rest of this floor

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.340
quite a lot of money right off the bat

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.310
though 46 cents we don't care about

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.110
pills is the thing and we don't really

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.070
care about using bombs to find secret

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.330
rooms I'd rather just get them for free

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.980
we can afford to be a little picky about

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.150
it because we know on the next floor you

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.520
know it's not like there's limited

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.160
supply on the next floor we're probably

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.900
going to be able to self-select

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.130
things that we actually want as a result

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.290
of the fact that there's more likely to

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.840
be a reroll machine than not be a really

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.930
sheen now the problem we had in our last

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.570
run as the days old we won but we didn't

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.750
win as asel it manifested itself after

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.430
the deal with the devil so we probably

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.520
no matter what the deal with the devil

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.680
is I think we just want to avoid it here

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.510
hopefully we get lucky and it's like

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.020
just a regular old like Krampus deal or

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.020
something like that

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.390
just because our HP is bad

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.800
so if it's a truly amazing item well

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.910
actually you know what we kind of put

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.160
ourselves in a situation where I just

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.130
can't take it unless it gives us HP so

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.660
you know something like the pact would

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.010
be amazing right now and we would we

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.080
would go for it and probably try to make

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.120
it work but anything else we just can't

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:39.220
afford without dying probably so I think

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.870
it is worth our it's worth noting we

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.320
kind of adhere to our strategy

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:48.850
accidentally so let's see what we got

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:50.470
it is two items we can't take Carol

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.300
cloth is lovely I would be I mean I'd be

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:57.000
tempted to take the nail honestly - but

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:59.620
there's neither one is is good enough

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.790
like literally on an objective level to

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.280
keep us alive so we're just going to

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.260
bounce instead now Kirsten the blind

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.510
dangerous especially when we do want to

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.760
be spending on this floor eco lies okay

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.470
if we can get some invincibility

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.880
breakfast is like free deal with the

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.640
devil pickups

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.360
and I mean I'm glad we have HP so we can

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:22.290
do a little of this and little this as

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:27.250
well and maybe get something paid out

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:29.230
sorry buddy he lived I don't mean

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.730
there's any reason not to buy seven cent

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:35.440
items come on

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.890
let's buy the seven cent item potato

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.660
peeler it's not actually terrible but

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.080
obviously as you might expect it's not

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.910
exactly what we're looking for

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.470
[Music]

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.530
I'll keep spending this is not that bad

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.000
to spend six cents to get a potential

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.430
deal with the devil item is completely

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.170
okay nine cents maybe we were waiting on

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.400
some HP now instead you know what just

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:05.560
use the two of Hearts which we got for

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:07.870
free chaos every run apparently is now a

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:12.640
chaos run in our world

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:14.890
lots of seven cent items very thankful

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.970
for that you paid out you paid out a

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:20.980
Book of Shadows probably really really

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.120
good with e.coli so let's use potato

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.790
peeler to get as orbital which

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.480
synergizes as well grab this spelunker

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:31.990
set sprinkler fun item potato peelers a

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:34.690
little better here Sacred Heart Sacred

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:38.080
Heart copies collar dude this was like a

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.630
ten out of ten area already that's

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.160
absurd

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:45.730
we've actually like completely changed

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:49.200
the tone of this run right now so I am

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:51.640
going to preserve my HP by doing this

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.380
it'll take us a couple extra waves here

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.030
but do I need to point out we have a

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.750
Sacred Heart and mini brimstone right

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.970
now this is like 10 out of 10 and this

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:05.020
is again like a problem I have agreed

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:07.950
mode is that it's kind of like I don't

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:10.900
want to say that every run is the same

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:14.650
but there are like some common elements

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:16.750
to essentially every greed mode run that

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.870
compromised its replayability a little

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.860
bit we should probably not play it like

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.409
zero percent of the time but

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.360
you do run into a little bit of the same

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:28.400
stuff over and over you might as well

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.650
just finish this off here you know we

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.770
got so much damage we can walk into

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.930
enemies without them being able to do

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.520
anything to us

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.409
kill them basically just by contacting

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:44.060
them or coming into contact with them

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:45.979
rather this is probably pretty close to

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.780
an unbeatable run at the present moment

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:49.699
and for this to happen on the floor with

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.129
curse of the blind is kind of ridiculous

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:53.750
but they lucky up so we had to deal with

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:56.300
the angel with the old the angel has

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.949
given us a HP which is completely fine

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.139
and it's not like we need key pieces so

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:01.729
I honestly think we should keep buying

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:04.310
$0.07 items as long as they keep

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:09.560
presenting them Cuba meets totally fine

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:11.569
here odd mushroom is good ham II said is

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.759
actually perhaps even better than Book

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:16.550
of Shadows book of Belial at least takes

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:20.150
us closer to bookworm and sister Maggie

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:23.569
was not worth it really but I mean we

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:27.080
should go Tami's head right it's again a

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:28.909
little a little say me but kind of so be

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.339
it like we've created a run that's

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:32.930
absurd and this is good you know we can

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:34.900
we can actually get Lilith unlock and

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.949
Lilith is a character there's before

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:40.129
Lilith is the character that I have

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:42.319
basically like never played as willingly

00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:43.759
except for when she first got introduced

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:50.930
to the game to there's some good items

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:53.360
in here so might be might be fun to give

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:56.210
ourselves some Lilith runs and remind

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:59.000
ourselves of what it takes to win as

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:00.199
Lilith we basically have guppy that'll

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.990
be our first pick up there unless we

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:05.000
just got it right there but I'd like to

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:08.560
get all of the items that are on display

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:13.180
as you might expect that might not be

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:16.960
plausible but so he basically traded a

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:19.789
synergy that was amazingly good against

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:22.699
enemies for a synergy that's amazingly

00:08:19.789 --> 00:08:25.540
good against bosses or single-target

00:08:22.699 --> 00:08:29.990
foes whatever you want to call them

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:31.550
it's a little silly of me there and I if

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:35.570
I'm being real with you I sort of regret

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:37.099
it here because we had an almost

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:40.280
guarantee that we were never going to

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:42.500
get hit previously that's gone away in

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.360
favor of a synergy we've seen many times

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:47.090
but you like Tammy's head Brimstone's

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:48.520
like one of the immutable laws of Isaac

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:51.260
like if you see if you take it

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:53.930
especially if you can get guppy out of

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:56.960
it and the shears is also amazing this

00:08:53.930 --> 00:09:02.390
you know is in the running for I think

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:04.330
best best chaos I've ever had especially

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:07.520
considering again I got chaos

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:11.000
accidentally as a result of persons of

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:13.370
blind like it's ten out of ten but yet

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.230
meanwhile I'd said maybe a monster mend

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:17.240
I mean I'm getting bitter at this play

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:19.130
but you know I remember I was like maybe

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.630
monster Manuel should be a little bit

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.100
better like allow you to use it once per

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:24.080
room and people were like now I would

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:26.270
make green mode too easy okay but chaos

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.320
allows you to become guppy on the second

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:29.570
floor everything yeah but that's

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.370
different in some arbitrary way that I

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:32.780
can't represent because you're using me

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:36.710
as a straw man right now which is not

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:38.960
really productive NL you're really being

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:40.640
overly reductive with respect to the

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.870
entire situation you know what I respect

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.030
that I should have met you on the

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.620
playing field as equals instead of

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.940
taking an air of superiority right off

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:50.210
the bat that's a bad habit and I

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:51.830
apologize no problem okay everybody does

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.120
it from time to time as a shorthand to

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.320
make their argument seem better than it

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.120
actually is you know what it's been a

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.420
pleasure talking to you that's because I

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:05.840
am you what Tyler Durden Fight Club - we

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:08.000
just wrote it funded I I think I have a

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:11.200
least favorite genre of movie and it's

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:16.000
taken me a while to realize it but I

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:16.000
watch Zoolander too you know

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:21.459
six months ago something like that I

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:23.290
hate it I like Zoolander one I didn't

00:10:21.459 --> 00:10:26.560
love it but I was like it's like a six

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:28.269
and a half seven I'm okay with that

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.589
and I know you're going to say you

00:10:28.269 --> 00:10:33.639
weren't there whenever I saw it in

00:10:29.589 --> 00:10:35.290
theaters when it released okay we need

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:37.269
anything here there reroll machine there

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:39.819
is a reroll machine

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:41.319
I saw Jude Lander - I thought it was one

00:10:39.819 --> 00:10:43.269
of the worst movies I've ever seen bar

00:10:41.319 --> 00:10:45.970
none I thought it was horrible I hated

00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:47.949
almost every second of it we already

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:53.230
have homing tiers I think this is like

00:10:47.949 --> 00:10:54.370
five cents well-spent and then I'll be

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:57.089
the first to tell you I think that's

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:59.649
worth it I I'm not a hole we need that

00:10:57.089 --> 00:11:04.870
and then maybe just start saving at this

00:10:59.649 --> 00:11:05.949
point uh we got HBO go or HBO Canada

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:13.959
recently so we could watch Game of

00:11:05.949 --> 00:11:15.850
Thrones and that came with in Canada

00:11:13.959 --> 00:11:18.069
came with the movie network as a way to

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:19.930
justify the absurd price point we're

00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:23.139
basically paying like four dollars a

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:26.589
week to watch one television show it's a

00:11:23.139 --> 00:11:28.810
little too far but anyway we buying

00:11:26.589 --> 00:11:30.610
anything else in here so I like to put

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:34.060
on like mindless stuff in the background

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:35.439
while I'm doing programming so I just

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:38.050
put on the movie Network last night and

00:11:35.439 --> 00:11:40.120
I watched a live free or die hard which

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:42.720
I haven't seen since 2007 and I was like

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:46.589
this movie is like absolutely just okay

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:51.670
should you see live free or die hard is

00:11:46.589 --> 00:11:53.110
it on how frictionless is the ability

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:55.630
for you to watch it dude we got to check

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:58.060
out a new trinket hahaha what a

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:59.259
coincidence I can't even tell you what

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:03.279
it's a coincidence for because it would

00:11:59.259 --> 00:12:05.649
be a spoiler so we're if you if it's on

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:08.110
and you don't have to do much effort to

00:12:05.649 --> 00:12:11.350
watch it why not dude why not give it a

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:12.850
shot so check this out I'm going to try

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:14.769
this on for size we're going to open

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:16.480
that yeah I don't really like butter as

00:12:14.769 --> 00:12:19.839
an item so we're going to use our

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:22.360
rerolls here get a bomb and what makes

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:24.550
you larger pill not what we're looking

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.139
for so let's just save our money we're

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:27.220
actually in a great spot we might want

00:12:26.139 --> 00:12:29.860
to check this just because we can

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:31.269
without being in a bad place

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:33.850
and I guess we'll go to our secret room

00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:36.660
as well and hope that it's not a while

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:40.300
that was closed not an internal heart

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:42.700
after live free and die hard Bad Santa -

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:46.060
was on I watched it and it was like I

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.649
hated actually even more so than

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:49.660
Zoolander - which there was some moments

00:12:47.649 --> 00:12:50.370
in it where I was like this has a good

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:54.970
heart

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:57.550
Bad Santa - Bad Santa one which you know

00:12:54.970 --> 00:13:00.070
hereafter referred to as bad Santa is a

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:03.700
movie about a deplorable human being who

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:07.149
has by the end of that movie he's come

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:09.089
to appreciate family in his own unique

00:13:07.149 --> 00:13:12.579
and messed-up way

00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:14.079
Bad Santa - is just like you know a

00:13:12.579 --> 00:13:15.910
bunch of Hollywood executives got in the

00:13:14.079 --> 00:13:18.160
room and we're like what if the worst

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:21.250
human being on planet Earth

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:23.110
was surrounded by the other worst human

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:28.300
beings on planet Earth for like 90

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:32.230
minutes it's unfathomably cynical and

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:33.970
just the whole movie is just one liners

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:37.750
look hey want to go get some lunch ah

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:40.000
your vagina smells like an old tuna can

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:44.170
and then you're like you laugh track and

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.800
like it's just it's just heinous cynical

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:50.079
filmmaking so I think my least favorite

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:55.390
genre movie right now is like nostalgic

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:57.190
sequels I actually like I kind of like

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:59.230
Bad Santa one which is not a

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:02.290
controversial opinion there's a reason

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:06.310
it got a sequel you know 15 years after

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:09.279
the original came out the Bad Santa -

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:11.800
made me want to die dude it's just like

00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:13.870
the worst thing it didn't make me want

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:17.560
to die that's too fun but I'll spend

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:19.990
three cents on this that's okay we still

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:22.140
got to be green so I might have worked

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:22.140
out

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:30.350
the talent that they have in that movie

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:31.220
is absurd Kathy Bates I believe she has

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:33.529
an Oscar

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:36.130
I'm not going to begrudge her being in

00:14:33.529 --> 00:14:38.779
Bad Santa too because you know

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:39.980
essentially if you wanted to know how I

00:14:38.779 --> 00:14:42.500
would be in Hollywood

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.430
I would sell out in a heartbeat you know

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.080
everyone thinks when they go to

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:46.700
Hollywood they would be if they were an

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:49.190
actor or an actress they'd be like I'm

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.940
Tilda Swinton I only take amazing ten

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:52.339
out of ten roles

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:54.650
yeah well there's like eight Tilda

00:14:52.339 --> 00:14:56.900
Swinton's on planet Earth there's Tilda

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:58.460
Swinton Cate Blanchett I'm not convinced

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.850
yet that they're not exactly the same

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.850
person

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:04.940
both have roles in the Marvel Cinematic

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:10.160
Universe right now so the plot thickens

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:15.050
but anyway how do we not get it there I

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:16.250
want to preserve this never mind you

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:17.870
know I'm trying to think of like other

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:21.200
Hollywood actresses you can choose any

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:24.140
role they want and and like primarily

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:26.780
only do stuff that's like good I don't

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:30.620
know Vera Farmiga or something like that

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:34.580
either way the point is in the Anne

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:36.940
Hathaway fits that bill now come a long

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:39.950
way since the Princess Diaries - what

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:40.580
this was just that it just ended that's

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:44.300
lovely

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:45.740
a bomb will probably pay for itself if

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.450
we can get one but you know what to

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:50.560
spend three cents get the heck out of

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:54.050
here I think we're ready to fight green

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:56.150
still like a bomb but that's okay uh

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:58.490
wonder if that's what the whole tour

00:15:56.150 --> 00:16:03.650
knows keeps the oh maybe it keeps the

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:07.430
dad mega satan door open I will also say

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:10.640
that by not liking Bad Santa - you

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:12.920
really do I recognizes 100% I've opened

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.870
myself up to the idea like Oh what was

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:19.700
the movie - offensive for you

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:23.750
no it's like I say offensive things all

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:26.660
the time sometimes intentionally and

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:28.190
sometimes not but I you know I like to

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:30.410
think I'm not saying I'm better than the

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:34.310
collective talent you know at work on

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:37.790
- however I try to make it like clever

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:40.009
you know the joke can't just be you

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:42.589
can't say that the jokes got to be like

00:16:40.009 --> 00:16:44.360
it's funny and it's funny enough that

00:16:42.589 --> 00:16:49.009
he's okay with making himself look like

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:52.279
a bad person sort of I can't just be

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:54.350
like man did you put a stick of butter

00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:57.889
up your butt because your farts smell

00:16:54.350 --> 00:17:03.309
like popcorn you know that's just that's

00:16:57.889 --> 00:17:05.809
just wafer-thin humor like either way

00:17:03.309 --> 00:17:10.520
Christina Hendricks from Mad Men is in

00:17:05.809 --> 00:17:13.610
that movie she plays a charity owner who

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:16.939
is married to a jerk she sleeps with

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:21.819
Billy Bob Thornton in like two seconds

00:17:16.939 --> 00:17:24.169
and not I'm not trying to be you know

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:25.789
sex negative here at all

00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:27.230
yeah I know the first reaction every

00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:28.640
time about some of this maybe her

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:29.990
husband or in an open marriage

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.159
now they're both cheating on each

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:34.340
other's the thing they're terrible

00:17:31.159 --> 00:17:36.950
people but like Billy Bob Thornton has

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:39.020
done nothing in this movie to warrant

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:43.820
anybody having a good opinion of him

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:46.130
like he is drunk all the time while

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:50.299
working as a charity he beats up another

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:52.130
Santa just just to be a jerk basically

00:17:50.299 --> 00:17:55.340
and then also because that santa may or

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:57.740
may not be a pedophile but again it's

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:59.570
just something the movie is like not

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:01.400
really interested in exploring at all

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:04.850
it's more just like Billy Bob Thornton's

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:06.169
gonna punch you in the head anyway she

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:08.179
takes him to an Alcoholics Anonymous

00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:09.890
meeting where he proceeds to just not

00:18:08.179 --> 00:18:11.299
exhibit any character growth at all

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:12.770
which I understand is part of the Bad

00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:13.100
Santa formula that he's never going to

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:15.500
change

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:17.480
um and then after it he's like I'd

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:19.340
really like to you know put my straw in

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:21.289
your tank and she goes that's gross get

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:23.299
out of the car it's ten minutes later

00:18:21.289 --> 00:18:25.700
she drives up and goes actually let's do

00:18:23.299 --> 00:18:31.429
it and then he just has intercourse with

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:35.090
her in an alley it's it's completely

00:18:31.429 --> 00:18:39.049
unearned both from a romantic sense and

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:40.610
from a from a cinematic sense and if

00:18:39.049 --> 00:18:42.790
you're going to NL if so naive that's

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:45.160
how the world works no it's not

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:47.460
Christina Hendricks is not going to go

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:50.590
around Navin

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:53.890
but intercourse with the homeless

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:55.450
alcoholic duty in an alley in the bus

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:58.450
naked in the middle of the Chicago

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:59.050
winter this is where people go it's just

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:03.370
a movie

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:06.820
no but the movie has to make sense and

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:09.910
play by the rules that have any

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:14.890
coherence whatsoever and so like the

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:16.960
first bad Santa is like this guy is but

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:18.880
grudgingly he has a heart

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.760
despite being terrible the second bad

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:25.500
Santa is like here's three sociopaths

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:27.700
special shopkeepers heck yet anyway I

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:31.060
don't want to talk about what they do to

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:34.360
the the kid from the first bad Santa in

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:36.370
Bad Santa - they gave them like a

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:39.400
frontal lobotomy or something like that

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:41.650
anyway don't watch Bad Santa to watch

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:47.140
live for your die hard instead which are

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:48.430
both like exactly okay well no one of

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:50.170
them is okay one of them is terrible

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.100
anyway bit of a shorter episode today

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.630
