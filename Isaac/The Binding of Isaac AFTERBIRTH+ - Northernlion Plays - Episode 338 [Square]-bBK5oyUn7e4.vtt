##

00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.440
hey everybody welcome back to normal and

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.109
plays The Binding of Isaac after birth

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.650
plus where the game has been very good

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:16.049
to us recently like for like a month

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:18.449
basically mystery sack linger bean 2 HP

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.740
good damage adequate rate of fire good

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.970
speed PV 1/8 HSS one doesn't ain't

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.890
nothing wrong with this run we also

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.539
start with 5 cents I don't know why does

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.030
it even matter how hard we try keep that

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.320
in mind I was a little concern that

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.480
something like that could happen but

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.730
that's alright um I'm going to keep game

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.040
kid over book of sin basically because

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.649
in most situations we probably keep book

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.629
of sin over game kit now if that might

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.370
sound a little ridiculous but basically

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.270
what I'm getting at is we have a chance

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.340
to make an item a little zanier

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.960
than it would otherwise be not the game

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.030
kid is particularly saying but you don't

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.469
forget the idea here it pretty much

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.590
comes down to the idea as well that

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.409
invincibility from a tactical targeted

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.780
invincibility standpoint might be more

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.540
valuable and also more fun than like

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.280
well we get an extra consumable once

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.290
every four rooms you know that's that's

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.270
not particularly exciting in the whole

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.600
scheme of things I think so

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.920
we should check for a narrow room we got

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.310
lucky that means we don't even have to

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.689
chance the the damage that we take even

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.340
though we'd probably get our HP back we

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.659
also got both of our bombs back there

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.689
and that was a garbage room so I'm

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.130
fairly happy that we ended up getting to

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.990
go to it for free but this is we're

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.009
gunning for win 15 right now which is

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.170
pretty exciting we have had streaks of

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.549
this magnitude before have we had them

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.220
recently no not really

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:52.590
always minute 20 into the run since

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.030
Invicta he says and it's I'm not blaming

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.860
him for having a conversation he says I

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.719
spent the last three hours in darkest

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.479
dungeon looking for a specific trinket

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.579
and I found it I feel you dude and by I

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.540
feel you I mean a couple idea what

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.900
you're talking about

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.820
darkest dungeon is a game quite like

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.649
you might think I don't because of the

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.060
fact that it's one of the only rogue

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.550
lights ever released that I haven't

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.030
played you know 800 episodes of but no I

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.370
actually quite liked that game I just

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.990
know the one thing that kept me away

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.940
from it long term two things one is it's

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.010
very difficult admittedly but it's not

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.500
just a difficulty that kept me away it's

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.900
it's the even though we did play a lot

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.350
of it to be honest but it's the the fact

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.020
that it's got such a slog towards the

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.020
end and slog is a negative term I mostly

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.330
just mean you know in order you've got

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.040
so much grinding that you have to do in

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.050
order to get your party up to a certain

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.530
level and then if you lose somebody you

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.970
got to back up and do like 30 missions

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.200
to get another person up to that level

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.600
though that was the thing that really

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.540
kept me back it's a persisting campaign

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.570
like XCOM style as opposed to a rogue

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.980
light which is completely fine but I

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.190
think we know where my allegiance is

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.170
live for the most part anyway still a

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.750
great game made in Vancouver although I

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:14.459
think they've moved to the United States

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.780
now but made in Vancouver so I got

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.239
nothing but respected ever tell you by

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.739
the time the dark is one of the darkest

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.110
dungeon developers saw me in the gym

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.570
changing room saw my twitch shirt and

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.790
said you know are you northern lion and

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.190
I was like this is how I died but no it

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.780
was a very nice gentleman and I was like

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.510
oh this is before darkest dungeon came

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.880
out I I know your game it's the one that

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.380
looks amazing and everybody can't stop

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.790
talking about because the art style is

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.470
wonderful and then you know like six

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.510
months later it came out in early access

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.209
and everyone was like this is amazing

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.959
and it did indeed was but anyway that's

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:51.239
that's the gist of that story yes the

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.750
developer of darkest dungeon has seen my

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:57.230
butt cheeks by the developer I mean one

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.000
of the people on a many talented team

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:04.190
there might be an arcade for us and this

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.190
floor I kind of went in this direction

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.340
financially speaking for us to have that

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.860
opportunity we're really like I mean we

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.950
got three HP we got good damage rate of

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.519
fires fine mystery sack hooking us up

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.790
with good utility and blue map I mean

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.530
I've

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.380
botted so I shouldn't be complaining but

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.230
it's not ten out of ten but if we get

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.460
bombs it does help us out so with

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.500
respect to maybe getting a little bit

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.820
extra HP or at least some extra utility

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.580
over the course of the run what do we

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.870
need what are we missing

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:40.320
basically rate of fire in particular but

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.490
bps in abstract like our rate of fire is

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.370
probably the easiest way for us to

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.630
improve this run because 10 is good but

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.870
it's not good forever

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.760
I mean it's similarly for damage is good

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.680
but it's not good forever but I don't

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.480
know I sort of feel like rate of fire

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.950
has more importance for whatever reason

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.360
that might be correct or incorrect

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.720
depending on your perspective

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.340
because it scales with the peer effects

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.560
and I don't know if many tier effects

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.240
are affected by damage the most of them

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.000
are affected by the amount that you can

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.740
fire spirit heart and bomb please spirit

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.330
heart that's fine because I've been

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.850
throwing away spirit hearts by being an

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.320
idiot and how long we had keys why

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.420
didn't I go to the I was telling a butt

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.740
cheek story so I didn't go to the shop

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:25.770
or the item room which is a little silly

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:28.230
on my part probably you take the compass

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:31.050
there is an arcade the arcade is going

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:34.080
to give us so much money even though so

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.430
good even though we won't have the game

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.860
kid ready for it actually we will

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:41.100
exactly have the game kid ready for it I

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.020
don't think we should use the game kid

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.210
for it until we get down to the point

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.330
where we need to use the game kid for it

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:52.650
what I basically mean why obviously you

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.480
got to try this out what I basically

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.840
mean by that one bomb is good because it

00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:02.970
gives us a spirit heart access but oh I

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:04.620
always get too attached you know I get

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.820
so attached the idea of the room being

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:12.449
useful no no I'm Oh something something

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:16.759
head over you Claude room

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:21.169
when I'm Hannah Levine's ex of hearts

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:23.219
just garbage dude garbage inflation

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:25.680
basically there's been a lot of trash

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:28.050
inflation on on playing cards they used

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.610
to be like a safe bet you're like well

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.189
worst-case scenario I'm going to double

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.319
a consumable now it's like you know

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:40.039
viewer beware you're in for a freaking

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:45.210
scare another spirit heart again

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:46.529
basically exactly the expected value key

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.719
and some coins ain't nothing wrong with

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:52.080
that the loss of that arcade is going to

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:53.310
haunt me though man and by loss I mean

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.650
the fact that the arcade was not as

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.779
useful as I wanted it to be what never

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.240
mind dude good things come to those who

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:02.009
wait am i right bro

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.139
I don't know why I adopted this voice

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:06.439
for this bit and now I've become like

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:10.909
British instead I don't really get it so

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:10.909
paid out with IV bag right off the bat

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:18.629
which mostly is good financially let me

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.159
grab game kid we want to do this first

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:25.730
because we might end up giving away like

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:26.839
all of our HP dude life is good

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.610
[Music]

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:33.689
we only got the 19 cents which seems

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:38.399
like very low so then I'm going to you

00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:40.740
know just kind of go wild on it here and

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:46.339
we're at 34 cents you will take

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:46.339
polydactyl loves to hold two things no

00:07:47.719 --> 00:07:55.919
why do I only turn mm head of a he

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:57.360
becomes like I can't believe the the

00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:57.749
twists and turns of this run has put me

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.050
through

00:07:57.749 --> 00:08:03.149
either way deal with the angel it's not

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:05.939
a bad thing I don't know what the

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:08.069
shouting is from the other room usually

00:08:05.939 --> 00:08:09.509
shouting of that magnitude indicates

00:08:08.069 --> 00:08:12.779
something's going wrong in Final Fantasy

00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:15.709
14 or one of the cats has thrown up so

00:08:12.779 --> 00:08:19.139
we'll find out soon I'm sure

00:08:15.709 --> 00:08:21.060
- Ace of Hearts or two of Hearts mairzy

00:08:19.139 --> 00:08:24.509
doats and dozy doats little Lansing IV

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:26.639
you know got a spear at heart

00:08:24.509 --> 00:08:28.620
I mean this is kind of like not the most

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:30.960
exciting play you could ever conceive of

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.820
in your entire life here but at the same

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.890
time it's doing good work for us you

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:36.329
can't deny we're at the forty three

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:40.200
cents and we bought the shop out

00:08:36.329 --> 00:08:42.180
completely so I think we might be able

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:45.810
to sleep in the bed

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:47.880
whoa what a novel concept all I do in my

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:48.990
bed is he'd crack her see it's a meta

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.360
you thought it was going to be about

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:53.430
sexual intercourse and then I brought it

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.440
back to something else altogether

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.940
no no they let us back in the shop which

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.110
is nice or in the in the devil deal

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.350
which is nice even if the item is

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:03.570
garbage we've gotten like way out of our

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:05.310
way to do some deals with the angel

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:07.440
lately and I usually get paid back with

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.850
a kick in the teeth so you know what

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.700
we'll stick with what we got for now I'd

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:14.760
be bad game kids fine but the IV bag is

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:17.760
cooler it enables a lot more interesting

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:21.029
stuff as well a four-room rerolls all

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:26.160
item pedestals super magnet I don't even

00:09:21.029 --> 00:09:29.160
I couldn't pretend to understand it's

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:31.980
pretty terrible for now our dps has not

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.050
improved at all since we started the run

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:36.149
we're not in a bad spot we're lucky that

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:39.120
our starting stats were above average so

00:09:36.149 --> 00:09:41.820
we're not like even close to being

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:44.339
screwed but we're going to use a sack

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:47.370
dagger to do like pretty much all of the

00:09:44.339 --> 00:09:48.720
damage that we have to do and as soon as

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.370
we get red hearts we actually have the

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.130
ability to do that with a lot of safety

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:55.980
built-in we if we ever feel like reading

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.490
close to taking damage you just pop IV

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.310
bag

00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:00.959
get some money but also get a period of

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:03.449
invincibility that allows you to run

00:10:00.959 --> 00:10:12.310
into enemies basically you know

00:10:03.449 --> 00:10:17.199
guilt-free can you just like thank you

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:20.019
if you see like the problem if you could

00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:23.350
stand still so I could oh my lord he's

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:24.939
the greatest dodger dude you should be

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:26.980
playing the game not me like that's

00:10:24.939 --> 00:10:29.139
madness what you just done to me right

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:34.230
there some of the greatest plays I've

00:10:29.139 --> 00:10:39.059
ever seen it's a bad room to do this on

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:39.059
yeah like that was not smart at all but

00:10:40.199 --> 00:10:47.339
does get ya can't tonight okay extra

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:49.449
dime out of mystery sack that's why

00:10:47.339 --> 00:10:51.069
earlier I was like you can't count

00:10:49.449 --> 00:10:53.499
mystery sack out dude it's a good

00:10:51.069 --> 00:10:54.670
utility item you can mystery sack out

00:10:53.499 --> 00:10:56.920
that's like when you go to the grocery

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:59.110
store you're at the grocery store and

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.670
you know your wife's like should we get

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:03.699
cheese and in your head you're like of

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:05.470
course not we got so much cheese I make

00:11:03.699 --> 00:11:06.910
the sandwiches you think I don't have

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.559
much cheese we got but then you go oh

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:11.589
you know we could always use more cheese

00:11:08.559 --> 00:11:13.149
and you buy that cheese and then later

00:11:11.589 --> 00:11:15.939
you know it turns out a bunch of things

00:11:13.149 --> 00:11:19.059
you know come up can't go to the grocery

00:11:15.939 --> 00:11:20.889
store or you haven't found a convenient

00:11:19.059 --> 00:11:22.329
to go to the grocery store all you got

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:23.829
left in the fridge is a block of cheese

00:11:22.329 --> 00:11:25.500
and you know what you're happy to have

00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:28.779
that cheese because it makes for a great

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:30.670
snack in your time of need

00:11:28.779 --> 00:11:33.459
it's exactly what that's like right

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:35.910
there NL are you okay look we need to go

00:11:33.459 --> 00:11:38.559
grocery shopping is the gist of it but

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:41.199
this I mean it's I'm speaking from

00:11:38.559 --> 00:11:42.519
experience as a true story we got that

00:11:41.199 --> 00:11:45.480
block of cheese in the fridge and it's

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:45.480
helping me out a great deal

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.860
I could you know I was always the kid

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:53.140
who like you'd learn about medieval

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:56.170
history and they'd be like old prisoners

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:58.180
in the Tower of London only eight ration

00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:02.470
of bread and cheese and I was like sweet

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:04.209
a sense that sounds awesome that's like

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:07.779
my ideal dietary plan

00:12:04.209 --> 00:12:10.830
now of course I'm pretty sure that they

00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:14.950
didn't get to like eat a lot of it and

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:20.410
they were mostly tortured and killed but

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:24.810
like on a dietary level one man's trash

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:28.779
is another man's filet mignon you know

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:32.020
mignon go make me lose my mind up in

00:12:28.779 --> 00:12:36.670
here up in here we all go to make my

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:38.620
mouth water okay we got to actually go

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.209
like there's no reason for us to be on

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.709
that floor we got an arcade chance on

00:12:40.209 --> 00:12:44.110
the next floor I don't care about blood

00:12:41.709 --> 00:12:46.029
bags so much but we have an arcade an

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:51.940
exploit of an arcade chance now that we

00:12:46.029 --> 00:12:56.050
can see me on go to places tries again

00:12:51.940 --> 00:13:01.480
me y'all gonna make me eat oohs you up

00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:06.160
in here up in here let's oh you you know

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:09.730
like even the roast beef sandwich minyan

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:12.870
gonna make me sound real cool up being

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:16.480
here okay so that's like enough of that

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:20.320
which is way way better than our most

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:26.110
recent player unknowns battleground

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:30.490
songs y'all got that m249 up in here up

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:32.279
in here y'all got that new leus okay but

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:34.630
we don't need to go down this road I can

00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:36.339
that's you know they say the curse of

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:38.290
broadcasting or the poison of

00:13:36.339 --> 00:13:42.850
broadcasting is dead air I think I've

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:45.760
invented a new form of poison or a new

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:50.829
form of solid freaking gold who knows

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:53.649
man it's run still good but we need more

00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:54.940
than ghost baby if we're going to pop

00:13:53.649 --> 00:13:56.470
off

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:58.630
we're due for a deal with the devil

00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:06.970
smart money's on a deal with the devil

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:10.800
I don't need DPS I try to use the phrase

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:14.230
or the term need clothes too literally

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:17.020
there are times in Isaac that it becomes

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:19.270
a literal need if you don't have it the

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:21.190
odds are you will die you know I'm not

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:24.280
it's not like you straight-up needed to

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:27.610
survive but you needed to live in game

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:32.050
I'm going to use that as my literal you

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:37.720
know overloaded need word here we don't

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:41.470
need that yet yes y'all mind if I roll

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:43.450
need okay I still something to do with

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:46.600
World of Warcraft but mostly just loot

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:48.340
hoarder mind if I rolled need that's my

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:55.950
missile plague voice as well cancel

00:14:48.340 --> 00:15:00.340
claim no okay little Gertie is fine fine

00:14:55.950 --> 00:15:02.410
just not incredibly desirable I think

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:07.300
this is where our boss rush dreams

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:12.340
probably go to die we do have above zero

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:14.770
luck but not necessarily anticipating an

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:18.280
enormous payout here red hearts please

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:21.340
half a red heart is fine fine I don't

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:24.270
think we'll get much out of that but you

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:27.220
got a try and that's why you got to try

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:27.880
we just got quite a lot out of it

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:31.350
actually

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.350
we should go P this

00:15:32.369 --> 00:15:41.249
first off ridiculous amounts of money

00:15:35.699 --> 00:15:43.749
then what how did that bomb get kicked I

00:15:41.249 --> 00:15:46.089
placed it and kicked it simultaneously

00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:50.109
what I am I you know I'm the Brazilian

00:15:46.089 --> 00:16:00.089
national football team I'm not in case

00:15:50.109 --> 00:16:01.989
you're unaware so here's how like

00:16:00.089 --> 00:16:04.720
psychologically this run goes off the

00:16:01.989 --> 00:16:06.999
rails I'm not doing much DPS but I have

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.529
sac dagger so I look at sac dagger and I

00:16:06.999 --> 00:16:10.269
go we should use this all the time

00:16:08.529 --> 00:16:13.239
what's the safest way to use it all the

00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:15.429
time use IV bag to back it up what's the

00:16:13.239 --> 00:16:17.980
problem there you lose out on red hearts

00:16:15.429 --> 00:16:21.339
and eventually you know as our spirit

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:25.809
hearts slowly get lost here we end up

00:16:21.339 --> 00:16:27.429
basically you know robbing tomorrow to

00:16:25.809 --> 00:16:30.759
pay today which is not an expression

00:16:27.429 --> 00:16:32.679
that actually makes any sense so I need

00:16:30.759 --> 00:16:35.019
to get comfortable with using my own

00:16:32.679 --> 00:16:37.379
tears to deal damage I'm like a

00:16:35.019 --> 00:16:40.449
fledgling baby bird and we've got to

00:16:37.379 --> 00:16:46.869
gotta learn how to fly even if we ain't

00:16:40.449 --> 00:16:49.299
gettin Wings coming down this is my Tom

00:16:46.869 --> 00:16:56.079
Petty impression I don't think it's that

00:16:49.299 --> 00:16:58.569
bad it's the hardest thing right in the

00:16:56.079 --> 00:17:01.829
fly it's like if you're going for bad

00:16:58.569 --> 00:17:03.970
Tom Petty that's actually pretty good

00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:07.019
you're going for good Tom Petty it's

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:08.760
just extremely offensive just downright

00:17:07.019 --> 00:17:13.209
disrespectful

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:15.519
so black bean IV bag sac dagger who

00:17:13.209 --> 00:17:18.010
would have thought enemies get close we

00:17:15.519 --> 00:17:20.939
fart get some money get some

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:24.510
invincibility and frighten the enemies

00:17:20.939 --> 00:17:24.510
it's working

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:33.380
weirdly enough we desperately need some

00:17:30.919 --> 00:17:39.350
and by need I mean of course not mean

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:42.980
but want some DPS I'm going to stay away

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:44.740
from using IV bag just because if we can

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:55.600
use it on our boss I'm a much happier

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:57.740
camper sick sick not so sick that's fine

00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:02.149
honestly you don't even need to use IV

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:03.259
bag against this guy because he's so

00:18:02.149 --> 00:18:06.230
predictable

00:18:03.259 --> 00:18:07.759
he says right as he gets hit but this is

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:11.840
a moment for us this will be utmost

00:18:07.759 --> 00:18:13.759
importance we got the D part of DPS we

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:18.590
did have brimstone recently but I feel

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:23.240
like no desire not to take it again that

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:27.259
was pretty stupid and the reasoning is

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:29.600
we sort of needed so I hope you've been

00:18:27.259 --> 00:18:32.059
watching you know 3000 episodes of me

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:33.970
play this accursed game which is

00:18:32.059 --> 00:18:39.019
actually one of the best games ever made

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:43.360
you you respect that my overall goal

00:18:39.019 --> 00:18:45.620
even if the muddies get watered sometime

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:49.179
even if the water is getting muddied

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:52.700
sometime is to provide entertainment I

00:18:49.179 --> 00:18:55.519
will willfully not notice I actually

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:57.409
think that like no other issac creators

00:18:55.519 --> 00:19:00.799
I know do this which doesn't make me

00:18:57.409 --> 00:19:04.610
feel Noble it makes me feel stupid but I

00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:07.820
deliberately nerf myself sometimes by

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:10.340
not taking you know the best item

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:12.830
available because oh that was so dumb

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:15.529
that's a cap of spirit heart because of

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:17.539
the reason that you know I want to

00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:20.539
provide entertainment above just

00:19:17.539 --> 00:19:22.820
watching me win so I hope that you'll

00:19:20.539 --> 00:19:25.429
respect that I only take brimstone in

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:27.649
this situation because I feel like we

00:19:25.429 --> 00:19:32.179
should take brimstone for survival

00:19:27.649 --> 00:19:35.090
purposes we should also stop mucking

00:19:32.179 --> 00:19:36.230
about with IV bag because we're making

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:41.840
mistakes

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:44.929
as a result of its inclusion even our

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:47.390
brimstone is not necessarily crushing it

00:19:44.929 --> 00:19:49.400
so we got a lot of good stuff going in

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:51.049
our favor it's up to us to not squander

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:54.140
it I think doctors remote is useless

00:19:51.049 --> 00:19:56.390
right now I don't think we need red

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:58.429
candle it's the thing I could think

00:19:56.390 --> 00:20:00.679
we're completely fine it's what we got

00:19:58.429 --> 00:20:03.340
maybe we can get a luck upgrade no okay

00:20:00.679 --> 00:20:06.860
who sent luck upgrade okay well you know

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:11.419
when you're good you're good that's a

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:15.970
much better use of IV bag do I can't

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:15.970
pick up sack of sacks when I'm hurt so I

00:20:16.929 --> 00:20:23.330
want to pick it up we can do so we can

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:25.790
do so we just need to get one more half

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:27.410
red heart and then we're fine I thought

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:29.350
about it for literally like a quarter of

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:32.299
a second and I was like I'm an idiot

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:39.049
so right now double yarra rune appeals

00:20:32.299 --> 00:20:41.270
to me it means that we have 16 items on

00:20:39.049 --> 00:20:43.730
the chest which is really nice for

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:45.980
trying to get a cool synergy to work

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:48.669
with brimstone basically you know one

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:48.669
direct hit

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:55.660
makes all reroll machine or all item

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.660
rooms have a real machine

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:08.740
we could use the the cube of mead we do

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:13.840
have kind of like a tactical

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:15.880
invincibility thing going on we got a

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:21.250
long way to go before it's our principal

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:23.440
concern though I don't think we should

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:26.890
take anything but I'm going to take

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:28.540
black powder because I'm a moron uh and

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:31.330
you know what that means that I'm not

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:35.580
going to take sack of sacks because I

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:38.260
can't exercise my my cool trick anymore

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:41.200
so fine you don't you don't want me I

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:51.490
can take it in let's go down here I'm

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:52.990
actually frightened about this run which

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:55.030
is pretty sad to say considering we've

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:58.660
gotten two of the luckiest like blood

00:21:55.030 --> 00:22:00.760
bags of all time we've gotten like

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:02.050
really good utility stuff and now our

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.360
damage is great but it hasn't always

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:05.950
been there but this is a if we come out

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:08.470
of this with a win which is let's be

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:10.420
honest probably likely I'm just given

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:14.490
the caliber of items that we got here we

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:17.260
should maybe relax a little bit on the

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:18.820
orbital damage it is kind of a nice

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.740
feather in your cap when it works but

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:22.900
when it doesn't it's kind of needlessly

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:25.870
jeopardizing the run here so and that

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:28.090
shoehorned us into this boring you know

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:32.470
let's try to make a third blood bag show

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:37.780
up sort of situation that is again a

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:39.820
little embarrassing in its own right old

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:44.920
bandage should be a very nice pickup as

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:47.100
well 87 cents is great though don't get

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.100
me wrong

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:51.769
we are suffering a little bit from like

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:55.100
a lack of damage of brimstone like five

00:22:51.769 --> 00:22:58.789
point six nine damage is enough but when

00:22:55.100 --> 00:23:02.299
you're not one shotting all basic

00:22:58.789 --> 00:23:05.809
enemies you have to take a look at

00:23:02.299 --> 00:23:07.970
yourself and be like is this what we

00:23:05.809 --> 00:23:10.369
want to be in our lives we want to be

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:13.100
you know the mediocre brimstone boy or

00:23:10.369 --> 00:23:16.009
do we want to be the more than enough

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:22.840
brimstone man when I hear that on song

00:23:16.009 --> 00:23:22.840
they used to flu then I began streaming

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:31.970
because it's Monday Wednesday or

00:23:26.179 --> 00:23:35.360
Thursday boots weenie I was a three in

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:37.279
shoes it's you know more than a feeling

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:43.460
except it's called

00:23:37.279 --> 00:23:45.889
when NL streaming just just workshopping

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:48.159
some stuff here this floor is all big

00:23:45.889 --> 00:23:48.159
rooms

00:23:50.310 --> 00:24:00.570
easiest money ever made no spirit hearts

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:02.490
it only takes like fighting brownie for

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:06.450
this run to be in a horrible position

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:08.160
less than three is really good in this

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:10.530
exact situation don't take that out of

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:14.340
context now I ain't ever cared about an

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:17.060
HP upgrade HP is for babies just started

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:18.960
playing The Binding of Isaac this week

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:20.790
but I guess if you're going to give me

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.530
an HP upgrade I'll take one experimental

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:30.860
treatment also find moving box

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:30.860
I mean moving box is kind of a weird one

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:38.790
there's no we had no actual literal

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:42.960
benefit out of moving box right now why

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:48.210
am i holding it then don't have a good

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:52.790
reason for you the idea is you can

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:52.790
reroll it later or black ruin it later I

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:01.950
guess we could hold onto a little bit

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:04.950
more stuff as a result - I don't know

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:09.840
moving box it only works well if you get

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:12.960
black room I find so I sort of but we

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:17.670
don't need IV bag so do we really care

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:20.370
about making IV bag come down with us

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:22.350
like for four floors suppose not maybe

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:24.180
we'll find a good reason to do something

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:25.500
with this but for now I don't know I

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:29.910
don't see it I'm going to ignore it

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:31.440
basically on this floor out of laziness

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:34.710
but also out of the fact that we don't

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:36.030
have we need to get to battery charges

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:37.580
basically

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:39.480
[Music]

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:41.790
Polaroid and nothing else will head

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:44.040
downwards here what should we do the

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:46.080
idea I suppose is that if you find an

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.700
item you don't like curse be unknown

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:49.710
means we can at least see our items oh

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:52.950
we got a library too so we had a lots of

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:55.100
potential for putting stuff we don't

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:59.510
want or picking up stuff we don't want

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:59.510
but we need a black rune to make it pop

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:06.570
otherwise we get nothing out of it I got

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:09.870
to remind myself basically about how to

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:12.590
use moving box the first play is going

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:12.590
to pick stuff up

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:21.900
and then from that point onwards every

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:23.820
other play is going to alternate between

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:28.640
picking stuff up and putting it down so

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:31.080
we need to finish with a pickup always

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:33.480
if we want to take stuff with us at

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:41.280
least we have 41 keys this is our

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:42.900
advantage right now why even come close

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.700
to risking I don't know how that bombs

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:51.600
getting pushed around I'm very confused

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:55.710
okay go ahead dude thank you probably

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:57.240
will avoid going to the curse room and I

00:26:55.710 --> 00:27:00.120
know that's like sacrilegious but this

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:02.160
runs like weirdly on NLE

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:05.070
like I'm taking every possible advantage

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:07.920
I'm gambling to get HP which I never

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:09.990
don't like any time we play a slot

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:12.300
machine that's like a once a month sort

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:14.070
of thing for me

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:19.820
we should get bookworm from this which

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:23.280
is great and then we'll take this and

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:24.810
the battery charge is useful so we suck

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.670
all this up including the battery charge

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:34.290
now we're going to spit out the battery

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:36.390
charge when we spit out everything out

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:40.110
so if we don't like our boss item that's

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:44.040
what we'll do there and it really only

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:49.260
works if we get a per throw or a black

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:50.760
room or the d6 I suppose but I wouldn't

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:52.470
hold out a lot of hope of that happening

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.900
so I guess the easiest thing to do is

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:57.560
you probably buy this just for sports

00:27:54.900 --> 00:28:00.270
and then you spit everything out and you

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:02.880
buy this suck everything up and it's

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:05.310
kind of like a guilt-free pickup there

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.410
and we will do the same here because

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:09.830
it's an active item we don't really want

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:09.830
I guess

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:16.230
but we need to charge to spit everything

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:17.880
out first we want to take everything

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:22.020
here I don't know what our HP is like

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:24.380
but it's at least like three so we can

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:27.270
afford to play you twice grab this and

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:35.360
then play you twice again if we give the

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:37.650
opportunity to okay that was botched I

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:40.760
picked up the mark by accident but it's

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:43.559
fine because we're leaving regardless

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:47.700
with nine lives which might be a

00:28:43.559 --> 00:28:49.320
negative at this point but we're going

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.400
to we only need one more charge because

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.260
when we spit it out we're going to spit

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.669
out a battery charge I don't know we're

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:55.350
going to get one more charge though we

00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:57.750
got three more rules of combat before we

00:28:55.350 --> 00:29:00.179
qualify we also will have the chance to

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:02.669
fight we're going to get it we will have

00:29:00.179 --> 00:29:09.809
the chance to fight hush I don't know if

00:29:02.669 --> 00:29:11.580
that's desirable at all we do have a lot

00:29:09.809 --> 00:29:12.990
of money we might not get the chance to

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:17.070
find out it depends on how the rest of

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:19.159
the run goes but it's right now looking

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:22.080
like that's conceivable timing wise a

00:29:19.159 --> 00:29:24.570
lot of consumables I don't want to fight

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:27.240
hush with nine lives and very little HP

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:34.770
we might be on like actually one HP

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:36.510
right now times nine but still you know

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:39.929
we got to make some deductions here whew

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:42.450
that's I mean it's pretty good just give

00:29:39.929 --> 00:29:47.490
me an HP upgrade and I'll be a very

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:51.750
happy camper you know there's something

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:53.880
about that double temperance has got me

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:57.570
interested power pill please

00:29:53.880 --> 00:30:00.630
pheromones we do have PhD but I don't

00:29:57.570 --> 00:30:05.520
care that much about this although we

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:07.910
should take that instead of the yeah

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:14.610
hear me out here

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:16.380
we should take that instead of the white

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:17.549
pony the white pony could be good but

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.080
I'd rather take down something that

00:30:17.549 --> 00:30:20.520
guarantees me good pills and something

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.890
that gives me a passive ability to fly

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:24.900
even though both of them have a purpose

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:26.640
this is a weird run and you know I do

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:31.559
appreciate the moving box or keeping me

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:33.330
like neuroplastic but I just worry if

00:30:31.559 --> 00:30:37.980
it's all for naught and if we're going

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:39.510
to end up getting no pay out for putting

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.980
in a little bit of effort here but we

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:45.690
haven't really given up a great space

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:50.250
bar item to enable it so stop the hand

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:53.460
ring in a little bit almost certainly

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:55.230
worth it you know what it's actually

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:57.570
ghost baby that's pushing the bombs

00:30:55.230 --> 00:31:02.480
because I've mentally filter out the

00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:05.669
existence of ghost baby I think I forget

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:07.350
so obviously you know I'm not holding

00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:09.750
out a ton of hope for the guppy dream

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:12.660
but we do have at least one more

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:15.179
guaranteed deal with the devil turns out

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:18.150
that we will definitely not fight hush

00:31:15.179 --> 00:31:21.240
on this run unless we go like super fast

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:22.950
I don't think we care about fighting

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:28.320
gosh we had chaos would be a different

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:30.600
story but we had

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:34.170
not overly concerned about it right now

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:38.850
now we've got to be on 1hp which means

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:40.890
that I can't be so laissez-faire about

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:45.420
just ignoring every consumable that

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:50.430
drops as much as I'd like to be okay BOM

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:53.400
bag is okay probably we should have just

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:56.630
thrown it into the moving box but it

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:59.760
doesn't really matter until we get that

00:31:56.630 --> 00:32:04.170
black rune anyway we get a black room a

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:07.260
little weird I can't believe that sort

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:08.760
of work it's sort of weird but the

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:10.290
proper thing to do is actually suck it

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:14.610
up in the box so we can hold both the

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:20.490
arrow rooms we're going to start to get

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:23.220
into some little finicky when it comes

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:25.830
to making it work here I don't know if

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:28.200
we can afford to go in here because if

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:31.380
we die and then respawn inside of the

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:33.720
room we might just respawn in an endless

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:35.280
cycle of death it's something that has

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:37.650
happened to me before

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:41.550
it just depends on whether you die on

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:47.570
the way in or on the way out I think so

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:47.570
it is important to be a little bit more

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:55.010
conservative to be honest with you about

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:55.010
whether or not we go in there

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:03.879
had to be a luck upgrade we're still

00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:06.009
only a 1.41 luck but it's actually fine

00:33:03.879 --> 00:33:07.450
all now we're good okay so obviously

00:33:06.009 --> 00:33:09.039
we're gonna fight this guy because you

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:12.070
know I don't know better and this Kanye

00:33:09.039 --> 00:33:14.490
West said wait a minute was you saying

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:16.870
something you can't tell me nothing but

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:18.759
this is a no-brainer as far as I'm

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:22.049
concerned because we get bragging rights

00:33:18.759 --> 00:33:25.149
for making the run like 0.05% harder

00:33:22.049 --> 00:33:26.710
without any actual consequence so throw

00:33:25.149 --> 00:33:34.299
two of these spirit arts away probably

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:37.869
oh let's go so we can't actually take

00:33:34.299 --> 00:33:39.610
Guppies head what we can do the reason

00:33:37.869 --> 00:33:40.419
is if I put moving box down in there and

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:42.549
try to suck it up

00:33:40.419 --> 00:33:45.909
we're done you know I don't have enough

00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:48.909
HP to get back in there we don't have a

00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:51.369
battery charge sucked up anymore so we

00:33:48.909 --> 00:33:59.580
are sucking power in general is a little

00:33:51.369 --> 00:34:02.679
inhibited right now let's go this is

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:06.129
sort of the moment of truth because I

00:34:02.679 --> 00:34:07.690
could see myself being on well no we

00:34:06.129 --> 00:34:09.849
should have one spirit are protecting

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:17.490
our internal heart so if I can get hit

00:34:09.849 --> 00:34:17.490
once we should be fine yeah

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:32.240
okay now I'm like my brains turning in

00:34:23.399 --> 00:34:37.649
on itself i okay hear me out

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:42.000
you take void and if you take that it

00:34:37.649 --> 00:34:45.929
will probably kill you it didn't kill me

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:56.640
and then use void to suck up the moving

00:34:45.929 --> 00:35:01.680
box I don't know where the other items

00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:04.710
are what I do know is that if they exist

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:07.670
void allows us to suck up the actives

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:13.530
and turn the passives into stat upgrades

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:16.260
so I think this is a logical albeit also

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:20.520
ridiculous decision that we've made you

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:23.370
know what I'm saying you're like what

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:27.530
I'm getting at is if we voided the

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:30.780
moving box the next play of void should

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:32.670
the next play of void should drop all

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:36.750
the items and then the one after that

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:38.280
should suck them all up now we don't

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:42.210
really want the active effects of the

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:44.990
items necessarily it's not a bad thing

00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:44.990
probably but

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:53.310
still this is without a without a per

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:55.230
throw and without a black room this is

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:57.090
like one of the only ways we can

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:59.250
actually get moving bucks to pay out but

00:35:57.090 --> 00:36:01.920
the other alternative and honestly I've

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:03.840
got myself a little convinced that this

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:05.970
is how it's actually going to go is that

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:07.530
maybe we just lost all of the items

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:09.420
inside the moving box forever because

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:12.270
the game went that's an edge case that's

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:13.760
rarely going to show up so don't sweat

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:16.110
it too much

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:18.960
hopefully that is not the case though

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:21.060
because this has the potential to be you

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:24.630
know we're performing like it roguelite

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:25.830
science right now we haven't had a run

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:27.750
it's weird because like that

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:29.580
statistically the run is uninteresting

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:33.150
you know it's a brimstone mid to your

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:38.100
damage run dime-a-dozen right but in

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:41.280
terms of like its level of interest it's

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:48.540
one of the strangest runs we've had in

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:51.030
like quite some time and as a result I'm

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:54.510
very interested to see where where the

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:56.370
world takes us here we should yera

00:36:54.510 --> 00:37:01.230
everything to start with we should get

00:36:56.370 --> 00:37:03.720
to like 16 items for bomb back there

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:05.870
trying to kick me it was a troll bomb in

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.870
there

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:15.700
and beyond this like roguelite science

00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:23.290
you know we still got a run to win

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:26.600
there's a little light on the HP front

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:29.660
and I'm not talking about a brown sauce

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:32.690
of British origin that tastes excellent

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:34.040
on roast beef and ham that's right we've

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:36.110
got HP sauce up here

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:44.870
but-but-but how because we're your

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:48.020
Commonwealth brethren okay for God that

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:58.330
was so worth it not but sort of yet okay

00:37:48.020 --> 00:38:01.580
let's go so start with the doublings and

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:03.730
then I think open and take what you want

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:08.210
like we want to get spun of course

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:11.720
that's not spun I think we want the luck

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:15.110
upgrade thing we want bloody lust we

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:16.970
don't care about Sagittarius actually or

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:18.860
GB bug or glaucoma we don't care about

00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:21.200
Sagittarius because we're there already

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:23.060
we have top speed and we don't need

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.980
piercing shots we would love the extra

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:27.140
spirit arts dead onion is irrelevant

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:31.190
blood of the martyr is not the trail

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:34.580
probably is that is spun damage is

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:37.730
looking good now okay so next is

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:40.010
spitting out all the items I think note

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:42.410
instead it's I think we've lost the

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:44.060
items in moving box forever or possibly

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:45.890
when we voided the first time they gave

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:49.310
us sad bonuses and we didn't notice but

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:52.160
I'm skeptical of that so I think void

00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:54.830
moving box has contributed to us losing

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:56.660
all of our stuff which is fine because

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:59.080
it was all about the experimentation to

00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:59.080
begin with

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:10.210
and honestly like the stat increase that

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:13.750
we got from the void role there is

00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:15.370
enough to make me not at all

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:19.720
disappointed without things look right

00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:22.800
now you might think this is a bit of a

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:25.990
cheap way out and indeed it sort of is

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:30.460
but I've got some mental fatigue from

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:32.110
the from the void moving box plays like

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:35.800
my brain is like just zone out for a

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:39.790
minute man go watch some Morgan Mindy

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:41.410
I'll get one more room as penance but we

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:42.370
got to win here and it didn't always

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:43.990
seem like it was going to be a

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:46.120
guaranteed despite having brimstone

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:50.350
which is a little embarrassing either

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:51.580
way we out good run though fun run hope

00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:52.810
you enjoyed it if you did click the like

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:53.860
button it helps out a great deal and of

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:54.700
course subscribe don't see more in the

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:58.920
future but for now thanks for watching

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:58.920
and I will see you next time
