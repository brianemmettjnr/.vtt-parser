00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.950
hey everybody welcome back northern

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.509
Lions The Binding of Isaac after birth

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.250
plus one day we're going to accidentally

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.889
select a lost and that will be a happy

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:16.379
day but for now got big job and I am

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:19.260
actually kind of like to lqq x PPK it's

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.160
not a bad seed in terms of in terms of

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:28.529
its alphanumeric composition this is

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:32.090
halitosis the answers halitosis gooses

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:37.920
halitosis medically bad breath

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:43.440
this is halitosis biologically bad

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.870
breath your whisper smells like death

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.840
but it's not your phone it's bacterial

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.940
infection they look there's there's

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.559
something there I can feel it I'm not

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.449
going to say down on my plums but I can

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.899
feel it either way this is me

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:03.870
this is halitosis is like a Saturday

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:05.460
night well maybe a madtv level skin I'm

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.260
not going to write the whole thing I

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.570
don't know if halitosis ISM is a

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.220
bacterial infection I was just I was

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.540
essentially spinning my wheels there

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.939
looking for something to rhyme and we

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.119
found something so I'm very happy about

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.869
that but now I'm talking in this voice

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.310
exclusively how does halitosis work for

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.759
us well I mean first off let's look at

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.040
our other stats right now it's not

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.829
necessarily 10 out of 10 speed is good

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.090
like first off great Michael Douglas

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:39.630
quote from the movie uh wall speed speed

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.340
is good speed is good though the 1995

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.680
film started starring Keanu Reeves and

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.740
Sandra Bullock that's a classic man so

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.420
many people go you know lo the bus that

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.070
couldn't slow down and that's fair it's

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.240
also it's good Simpsons joke

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.329
you know there could be two good things

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.790
that play off one another but speed

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.680
itself is an action classic you don't

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.329
like it you can just get out as far as

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.670
I'm concerned did we have unlocked in

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.580
Ted I don't believe so

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.379
I want to use our temperance card on the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.210
next floor to get a doubled blood bank

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.630
if we get

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:21.030
- excuse me if we get an arcade on the

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.710
next floor we can make that happen

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.270
but we need money and we got nothing out

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.370
of that so now it's time to look for a

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.960
secret room and then we didn't get

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.940
anything there either so I guess we say

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.760
goodbye temperance we could use

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.260
temperance potentially to get a blood

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.210
bank on the next floor if we're able to

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.680
get enough red hearts to to finance us

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.890
playing it until we get the five cents

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.540
that's kind of like a weird you know

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.190
we're using our home as collateral to

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.590
get a second mortgage on our home it

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.330
doesn't really look I don't know if that

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.980
sound financial advice or financial

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.230
idiocy I honestly don't know the answer

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.970
to that question so we can just leave it

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.710
right there I chose the metaphors which

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.530
I'm not well-versed and as a result I'm

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.660
paying the cosmic price right now speed

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.070
is good rate of fire is average damage

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.480
is a little bit below average and luck

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:12.470
is negative so I would give this like a

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:15.030
5 hour speed being up there is nice

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.100
I'm sorry temperance cars just not in

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.650
the Temperance cards for us today to be

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.090
with one another so instead we're going

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.460
to use our stars card right off the bat

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.540
to hopefully get a little stacked and I

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.550
would suggest that that did not work but

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.580
it did save us a key one way or the

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.580
other

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:40.489
I hate it I actually am mad genuinely

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:45.120
I'm a little cheese is the second time

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:46.950
in like two weeks well in like a week

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.030
actually that that room has had an

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.560
impact on our success I don't know why

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.049
you're supposed to do when they start

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.450
exploding I tried to keep myself like

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.420
equidistant but maybe I was slightly in

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.939
one direction either way dude I was

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:07.560
feeling a lost run let's do a lost run

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:10.230
I'm not upset again in the end I I don't

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.370
say this to degrade the hobby of gaming

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:17.039
you know I'm too old to get emotionally

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.440
invested in the outcome of a game and

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.729
found myself doing it some extent like

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.970
been playing a little heroes with a

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:26.460
storm and the MOBA salt came back I saw

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.340
like the first stages of MOBA salt and I

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:33.030
was like he's this even fun anymore like

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.350
or is it like our MOBAs just and if you

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.250
like playing them this is not an insult

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.680
you know you're talking to somebody

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.479
who's got like 900 hours in DotA 2

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.010
and stays away for that reason but I saw

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.560
the first stages of dota salt coming

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.910
back and I said to myself I think this

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.710
is just like psychologically

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.580
manipulative like it's a fun game when

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.940
you're winning and when you're losing

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:55.260
you feel like you're like the worst

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:57.080
person on planet earth so I put a nip in

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.639
that bud which I don't think is that

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.300
expressions canonical way of being used

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:06.479
but I I'm just I got too many like real

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:10.260
things in my life to be like we lost due

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:12.389
to some BS and I'm mad about it you know

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.970
I'm not saying obviously like I'm not

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:17.580
saying oh you probably do play 37 do you

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:21.240
little baby like it's it's okay for

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.500
games to make you emotional but be super

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.970
invested in the outcome it's not

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.470
something to interest me that much at

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.349
this point in my life I want to play

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:31.620
well and I want to get better on a broad

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:34.430
level but mostly I want to provide

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.430
entertaining content

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.430
I am a little mad at that room though

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:44.340
because I don't think we deserve to die

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:46.419
but we did not just die because of the

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.220
because of that room we died because we

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.630
took damage against Stephen of all

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.040
enemies which is a little embarrassing

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:55.150
in and of itself

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:57.460
I digress so alright so we're a lost run

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.710
but law starts with basically

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.960
fundamentally exactly average stats

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.510
which is actually sort of nice I guess

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:08.500
to have a consistent level of stats

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:14.950
right now we could probably use one bomb

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:17.860
to get a lot of value I'd love to get

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:20.050
one more bomb for finishing the room we

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.990
got a key which is also pretty good but

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:26.260
you know I'm thinking like one bomb blow

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:30.419
these guys up we got seven cents back

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.419
for five cents and the full shop re-roll

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:39.460
tell you what is a weird purchase but it

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.140
works basically for two cents we don't

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.080
need keys to go to item rooms and shops

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:47.919
anymore we don't care about having an

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:51.940
arcade so I think I'm going to shoot for

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:53.500
the moon here we should tell you what

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.919
tell you what tell you what drop it

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.900
right here

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:58.419
I want small rock obviously that's the

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.400
only thing that matters there but it

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:01.750
didn't work out and that's a-ok I'm

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.100
going to look at that even loss as a

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.770
blessing because it allows us to maybe

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:08.889
go back to random runs for a while I

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:10.479
prefer that was real bad I prefer Eden

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:13.479
runs to random runs from being a hundred

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:15.460
percent with you but I like them both

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:18.850
it's like an eight versus an eight and a

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.380
half for me but even thing is just it's

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.760
more fun when you start the run because

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.260
anything could happen you know you could

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:27.610
be any combination of items and

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:30.250
characters and stats but I like mixing

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.600
them up that's just not an item we're

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.460
looking for but anyway down to the next

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.940
floor and feeling fine we didn't improve

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:40.600
ourselves but the lost value proposition

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:43.990
is all about I guess like a not losing

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:46.390
focus and then B because it could be up

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.500
and up in smoke in an instant right like

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:50.240
a not losing focus and B

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:53.270
your deals with the devil if you can get

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.950
good deals with the devil and especially

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.120
the earlier you can get them you can win

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.140
I don't think it's tough to win with the

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.860
loss anymore and I don't think I'm

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:02.390
surprising anybody by suggesting that I

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.490
think the loss might actually be in the

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.870
easier third of characters in the game

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.760
to win with or maybe the easier half

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:09.950
like it's probably easier to limit

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.720
Azazel probably easier to limit Isaac

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.460
and then after that I don't know I don't

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:17.180
think a loss comes third necessarily you

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:20.720
know maybe you got Cain maybe you got

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:23.300
Samson I think those are probably the

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.650
next ones Judas though I think it's

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.510
harder to win with you just than it is

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:30.850
to win with the loss there's just more

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:36.979
tolerance for for inconsistent errors as

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:38.450
as the lost 48-hour energy but anyway we

00:08:36.979 --> 00:08:39.890
don't need to the first rule of eyes

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:43.310
because you don't discuss Isaac at least

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:46.700
not at this point so will we use a key

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:48.860
to go sorry a penny to go to our shop

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:52.910
that seems very sensible to me and Tarot

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:56.810
cloth is like an actual 9 out of 10 item

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:58.600
so many useful Tarot cloth enablers so I

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:01.490
think we've got a great chance of

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.960
winning this run or at least getting

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:06.440
things off on the right foot if we can

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:09.710
just not die against little horns which

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:11.300
should be more or less automatic at this

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:13.720
point but I don't know did you see me

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.800
fight little Steven recently I

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:18.220
admittedly that damage should have been

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.300
somewhat consequence-free it was just an

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:23.420
unfortunate series of events that kind

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:25.540
of put us in a tight spot but anyway I

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.540
digress

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:33.550
good a damage upgrade and then came

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:35.380
being conception is actually meaningless

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:39.850
and the Satanic Bible is actually

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:44.620
meaningless if Danny bottle is not fully

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:47.080
meaningless because we do get some we do

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:50.350
get closer to bookworm but it's one

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.550
third of almost being as good as 20/20

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:54.730
so I'm not even going to dignify that

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:56.770
with like a thank you for giving a

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.600
satanic Bible I am happy for precedent

00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:02.440
that's about it so we will get Tarot

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:03.880
clock and that's that's reassuring cuz

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.410
that item can do a lot for us a Tarot

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.480
cloth algae's ruin and the world's your

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:10.900
oyster if you can get blank card taro

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:12.370
cloth algae's rune like cancel my

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.990
appointments for later this afternoon I

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:23.020
don't have a point nobody wants to meet

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:24.340
with me on a Friday no less now spend

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:27.490
one penny to go to our item room and

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:29.170
then we're out of this floor though okay

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:31.150
I'll tell you what I'll use Data Miner

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.830
once and there you go we got a speed

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:35.140
upgrading the shot speed downgrade and

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:40.120
that's fine it's actually completely

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:42.190
okay but it's I still die will never be

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.410
a data miner fan somebody sent a fan

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:45.700
mail and I can't tell if it was

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:48.280
satirical it's not like it was offensive

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:49.420
at all but they sent me fan mail and

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:52.330
they're like you know you've got to

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:54.700
embrace that a minor as a good item nah

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:59.230
son I don't that's that's where you're

00:10:54.700 --> 00:11:03.220
wrong I think can be a good item in our

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:04.210
present situation but when I what I mean

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.220
it can be a good item

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:10.720
I mean basically if the if the variants

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:15.220
gods are on your side absolutely but if

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:17.620
they're not on your side I think you're

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:19.210
likely to end up in despair that's not

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:21.070
true for every item I know you're going

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:23.440
to say well it's Rasmus is on your side

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:26.070
then your your any item could be good or

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:31.030
bad no no no but like a damage upgrade

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:33.720
is is a constant you know it's a scalar

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.720
value

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:41.199
Data Miner is is throwing you're

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:44.199
throwing your life away here kidney

00:11:41.199 --> 00:11:46.480
stone by the way I realized we've got

00:11:44.199 --> 00:11:48.790
two items that maybe some people like it

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.220
some people dislike but can be conceived

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:53.290
as like zany showing up all at once here

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:55.300
and I'm going I don't really want tank

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:56.709
it I don't want to take kidney stone I

00:11:55.300 --> 00:12:00.160
have a good reason not to take kidney

00:11:56.709 --> 00:12:02.740
stone kidney stone has betrayed me I've

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.570
used to like it I used to think sure

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.980
sometimes it stops you from shooting but

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.139
then you unleash all your shots at once

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:10.000
and it's kind of nice

00:12:07.139 --> 00:12:13.480
instead kidney stone now comes with a

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.160
speed downgrade it's like some art of

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:17.199
the deal stuff that I have no tolerance

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.880
for like we had a good working

00:12:17.199 --> 00:12:20.769
relationship and then all of a sudden

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.029
kidney stone is like bone so now I've

00:12:20.769 --> 00:12:23.829
got you right where I want you I'm also

00:12:22.029 --> 00:12:25.750
gonna slow you down how do you feel

00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:29.380
about that so I'm taking a personal

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:34.540
stand against kidney stone because it's

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:36.100
trying to I forget there's like in my

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.420
first year of university I think a

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.209
psychology class where they talked about

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:46.180
like common sales techniques I think

00:12:40.209 --> 00:12:47.649
this is called a a lowball camera give

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.790
me a second let me Google what I think

00:12:47.649 --> 00:12:57.490
it is just to make sure that it's

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:58.440
correct no that's not that's not what it

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:03.310
is anyway

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:05.980
I've forgotten what it means but it's

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:07.420
like a sales technique where you know

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.339
you shake and make you're buying a

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.410
fridge or something you shake hands a

00:13:09.339 --> 00:13:12.970
car is a much better example you're at

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.829
the dealership and they you know you're

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:17.110
negotiating with one another and you go

00:13:14.829 --> 00:13:18.370
and really like that price would be nice

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:20.380
but at that price I'm going to need you

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:22.420
to throw in leather seats and the the

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:24.819
car salesman you're talking to is like

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:26.199
you know what let's shake on it I can't

00:13:24.819 --> 00:13:28.149
guarantee it yet but I think that deals

00:13:26.199 --> 00:13:29.649
going to be doable and then you come the

00:13:28.149 --> 00:13:30.940
code gives you a call and he goes hey

00:13:29.649 --> 00:13:32.019
come on over to the dealership we can

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.160
get the papers signed and you're all

00:13:32.019 --> 00:13:34.720
happy and then you get there and he goes

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:39.130
by the way we couldn't make that leather

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:40.779
seats thing happen well the well the pen

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:42.880
is in your hand and the contracts in

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:46.339
front of you you know he's made it so

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:49.610
frictionless for you to sign the deal

00:13:46.339 --> 00:13:51.110
that has changed the terms of it and he

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:53.199
thinks that your inertia is just going

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:55.430
to lead to you signing it

00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:57.019
that's what kidney stone is doing to us

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:59.509
right now you know we had a deal in

00:13:57.019 --> 00:14:02.329
place you're going to be weird but

00:13:59.509 --> 00:14:04.279
occasionally half-decent and as a result

00:14:02.329 --> 00:14:07.749
I'm not going to plan see you which is

00:14:04.279 --> 00:14:10.550
when I slander you with my propaganda

00:14:07.749 --> 00:14:12.259
instead it goes oh by the way you know

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:13.730
how you used to have like decent speed

00:14:12.259 --> 00:14:15.110
when you picked me up yeah we're gonna

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:17.089
have to take that off too - sorry you

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:18.499
know dealer invoice pricing just isn't

00:14:17.089 --> 00:14:20.120
gonna be possible this year because of

00:14:18.499 --> 00:14:23.149
the recession you know how it is you're

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:24.499
a big shot so you know you that's how

00:14:23.149 --> 00:14:25.550
it's gonna be and then you know what

00:14:24.499 --> 00:14:29.990
that's not how it's going to be I'm

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:31.309
taking a stand I think I don't know how

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:32.779
many of these episodes recently have

00:14:31.309 --> 00:14:36.319
been like this is how Millennials think

00:14:32.779 --> 00:14:38.629
but it's mostly because I you know we're

00:14:36.319 --> 00:14:40.730
all adults now when I was 18 my fellow

00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:42.769
Millennials were like you know between

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:44.660
the ages of 12 and 18 so hard to have a

00:14:42.769 --> 00:14:46.339
conversation you'd be like hey how do

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:48.050
you feel about social anxiety and maybe

00:14:46.339 --> 00:14:50.959
like I really like Naruto and I'd be

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:53.949
like okay I'll check back on you in 2017

00:14:50.959 --> 00:14:55.670
so there's anything wrong with Naruto I

00:14:53.949 --> 00:14:57.110
don't even know if that's how it's

00:14:55.670 --> 00:15:00.259
pronounced but I know when I say Naruto

00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:02.209
everybody laughs to me it's like the

00:15:00.259 --> 00:15:04.429
inverse of how things work in the real

00:15:02.209 --> 00:15:08.089
world we talk about anime but anyway I

00:15:04.429 --> 00:15:11.720
digress so the point is Naruto or know

00:15:08.089 --> 00:15:13.610
Naruto Naruto or Naruto or tuomo roots

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:16.429
ooh former Chicago Blackhawks right

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:20.269
winger I support you I don't understand

00:15:16.429 --> 00:15:23.779
salesmanship what is it you walk into a

00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:25.309
clothing store at some places I get if

00:15:23.779 --> 00:15:28.269
you walk into a car dealership you're

00:15:25.309 --> 00:15:30.230
not just gonna like oh that's good stuff

00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:31.759
you're just going to walk into a car

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:34.220
dealership and go to the front desk of

00:15:31.759 --> 00:15:36.889
it I will take one Ford Focus please

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:39.949
with you I get extra leather in that

00:15:36.889 --> 00:15:43.279
like that's just not conceivable however

00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:45.309
are you walking to like a clothing store

00:15:43.279 --> 00:15:48.019
and they go hey you guys need me help

00:15:45.309 --> 00:15:50.720
yeah I'm looking for clothes do you have

00:15:48.019 --> 00:15:54.860
any like I'm I can use my eyes I'm aware

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:57.620
of the situation in this establishment

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:59.660
one type just actually happened and

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:02.060
you're going to think that this okay I

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:06.019
had a little inkling that I was going to

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:07.850
get a Skype message but you're going to

00:16:06.019 --> 00:16:11.450
think that this is not something that's

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:13.250
happened you know and that's I'm not

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:15.290
again suggesting I'm a comedian

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:16.970
necessarily what I will I'm gonna die

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:19.459
I'm just gonna die in here

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:21.950
I took damage and as a result I can't

00:16:19.459 --> 00:16:26.029
escape is it because I went over the

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:34.209
spikes I've got it I've got to re-roll

00:16:26.029 --> 00:16:34.209
my run I'm probably still gonna die what

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:46.640
so your boy NL had a knurled

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:48.709
disengagement of some sort and thought

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:51.980
that he was on a curse room when in

00:16:48.709 --> 00:16:54.560
actuality he was not on a curse room you

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:57.079
can see the conundrum now we no longer

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.769
have holy mantle and this presents a

00:16:57.079 --> 00:17:01.820
problem

00:16:57.769 --> 00:17:03.770
see this how's this looking pretty bad

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:06.740
we got we got to get something good as

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:08.449
quickly as possible this almost seems

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.890
appropriate we have Beelzebub right off

00:17:08.449 --> 00:17:12.640
the bed we don't have holy mantle so

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:15.140
this is an old-school Las Tron now

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:17.089
anyway you're gonna think a story is

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.500
fake because this often times story

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:20.600
start will I was walking down the street

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:23.480
last week and it never happen it's just

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:25.250
a pretense for the bit but every other

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.240
time I've been to a clothing store when

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:29.570
they go hey do you need help with

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:31.490
something I have said no I'm just

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:36.080
browsing thanks because I'm an adult

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:37.429
who's capable this is not that good I'm

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.990
an adult who's capable of clothing

00:17:37.429 --> 00:17:44.450
shopping for himself please tell me

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:46.400
that's not if attack this is also not

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:51.950
very good but I mean we're a slave to

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:54.350
the run at this point one time I went

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:56.360
clothing shopping by myself I'm not

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:58.010
really lie was that Old Navy or

00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:01.090
something but keep in mind I was 10

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:03.169
years ago so the preppy style was in man

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:05.240
anyway it was more than 10 years ago

00:18:03.169 --> 00:18:07.920
actually at this point probably I went

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:13.080
to I went to Old Navy

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:17.070
and I had picked out like a shirt or

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:18.270
something and the sales clerk came over

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:19.710
and today can I help you with anything

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:21.300
and I was like yeah can you let me know

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:24.530
what do you think would go well with

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:27.120
this shirt and she just went like uh-uh

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:31.220
I mean I don't really know

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:33.870
so like the gist of it was like I

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:36.030
actually to this day don't understand

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:39.540
maybe I just got a bad dice roll I'm not

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:44.670
trying to throw a shade at that sales

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:47.160
consultant necessarily but I if not for

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:50.880
that question I don't understand the

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:53.310
purpose of people asking you that at a

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.690
clothing store unless you're like do you

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:56.580
have pants and then I get out of pants

00:18:54.690 --> 00:19:00.020
or in the pant style and you're oh all

00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:02.160
right of course Oh silly me right I

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:03.720
don't know what I'm trying to do here I

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:06.740
guess we should open these and a hope

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:09.150
that we get nine lives or something but

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:11.670
like the one time I was like I'm gonna

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:13.260
I'm gonna ask a genuine question because

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:16.230
I'm not sure I was like you know what

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:18.990
would go with this eight dollar t-shirt

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:21.660
and she was just like she had no

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:24.510
valuable information to present to me

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:26.970
and as a result I've been forever jaded

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:29.700
on the on the clothing store sales

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:31.200
associate the shuffle more or less I

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:35.520
can't afford to take this because it

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:41.910
could be paralysis now I'm imagining in

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:44.550
my in my advanced adolescence here I'm

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:47.550
imagining I probably just got a bad dice

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:48.930
roll on a sales associate and I'm given

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:51.690
the rest a bad name that's not my

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:54.300
intention my intention is just to divine

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:56.910
what what an actual normal interaction

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:58.260
in this situation would be we're still

00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:01.410
reroll in by the way even though this

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:05.370
run is good because we need we need to

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:07.740
be so strong that we can't be stopped or

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:11.280
we need to like we need to get dark

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:12.310
Judas and then die basically this is not

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.110
good

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:15.550
we need something that we can respawn

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:16.330
with and we do not have that at the

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:20.740
present moment

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:23.280
oh no no kidding there's a secret room

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:25.660
there I never would have expected that

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:29.800
who would have thought all this a 1-up

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:31.120
so one up is actually very huge because

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:33.910
of curse of the unknown

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:36.070
I can't tell or I won't be able to tell

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:38.260
if we get to keep the one up if we die

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:47.230
for sorry not if we die but if we reroll

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:50.530
I'm unsure like I've for one I

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:52.690
understand at least on a broad level the

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:56.500
implications of automation it's a very

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:59.740
scary thing and you might not appreciate

00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:01.660
that necessarily if you're if you're on

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:03.370
the younger side like you know you're

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:06.010
like 14 or 15 right now you're like

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:08.260
automation is a hundred percent good how

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:10.030
could it not be you get faster service

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:12.640
you get better service sure people lose

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:14.770
their jobs but like you know get with

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.270
the time is grandpa it's all well and

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:17.530
good with your 14 I mean and sincerely

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:19.390
it's probably all well and good when

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:21.670
you're 28 as well so I feel you on that

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:24.760
one but you got to think like if you're

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:30.430
a 58 year old truck driver you know you

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:31.780
got a job driving trucks 37 years ago or

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:33.790
something like that and you're like I'm

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:35.800
just gonna here's the contract planet

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:37.390
Earth I'll do this job it's not

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.040
glamorous but it's got its got some

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:42.580
perks it's got some negatives I'll do

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:45.190
this job until I'm like 65 then I'll

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:48.190
retire I'll live modestly and that'll be

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:50.350
fine and instead now we're like we're

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:52.030
gonna replace like the whole industry

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:54.250
with self-driving cars very scary you're

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:57.130
like I've got a I've got a mortgage you

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:58.540
know my I've got to help my kids get

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.890
through college because you know they

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.240
the Lord knows they can't get a job

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:02.920
these days either thanks to automation

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.930
I'm just I'm not saying automation it's

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:07.450
a bad thing just as scary you know what

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:09.240
if you're if you're like an

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:13.150
undereducated

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:14.800
50 or something man or woman and you

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:16.570
work it like a fast-food restaurant your

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.370
jobs are being phased out by kiosks or

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:18.790
something like that is it a sign of the

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:22.620
times

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:25.299
yeah like definitely you know we

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:26.590
progress is is

00:22:25.299 --> 00:22:28.840
porns you know we're not all using the

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:30.759
horses and buggies anymore and we can

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:33.940
mostly agree that that's probably a good

00:22:30.759 --> 00:22:35.830
thing but it was very disruptive to the

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:39.279
furrier industry I'm sure you know the

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:42.549
horse shoe salesman horse cobblers

00:22:39.279 --> 00:22:44.259
please be algae's pair throw is also

00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:47.649
potentially pretty valuable

00:22:44.259 --> 00:22:49.749
we need the reroll though but you can

00:22:47.649 --> 00:22:56.700
see how to be scary but like I for one

00:22:49.749 --> 00:22:59.200
am basically all for it because I

00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:00.850
selfishly it's going to be hard to

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.460
replace YouTube with automation you know

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:05.440
I I think I've benefit from having a

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:09.009
very unique not necessarily good but

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:14.039
very unique set of neural misfires that

00:23:09.009 --> 00:23:17.710
oh it's got to be done nine lives we are

00:23:14.039 --> 00:23:20.019
so much more well-equipped now wow we

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:22.239
got a range of great amazing we can't

00:23:20.019 --> 00:23:25.200
reroll this anymore well we might keep

00:23:22.239 --> 00:23:27.429
nine lives now that I think about it but

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:30.009
we don't have crispity unknown either

00:23:27.429 --> 00:23:35.919
that's just how the loft is right yeah

00:23:30.009 --> 00:23:37.210
okay so good one um you know I think I

00:23:35.919 --> 00:23:38.919
have a unique brain that's going to be

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:42.600
hard to emulate in a robotic level but

00:23:38.919 --> 00:23:42.600
the spectre may come for me eventually

00:23:43.259 --> 00:23:47.350
the idea being that once we can make

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:50.289
robots that can eventually make better

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:52.269
robots you know I'm get out of here get

00:23:50.289 --> 00:23:54.730
that trash out of here once you can make

00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:57.159
robots that can make better robots you

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:59.019
know computer programmers they're like

00:23:57.159 --> 00:24:02.249
we're kind of done unless you need as

00:23:59.019 --> 00:24:04.629
they hit the off switch oh and just a

00:24:02.249 --> 00:24:08.580
dystopian robot just set that flag to

00:24:04.629 --> 00:24:11.019
false so we do get to keep our our

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:13.480
respond ability here which is nice on

00:24:11.019 --> 00:24:16.239
the reroll so now we can just play as if

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:18.100
we have the v4 in nine lines and not the

00:24:16.239 --> 00:24:19.059
lost and we can try to re-roll into a

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:22.269
run that's amazing

00:24:19.059 --> 00:24:25.029
which hopefully hits before we find

00:24:22.269 --> 00:24:26.649
ourselves being like super flip and dead

00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:31.330
because we're having some problems here

00:24:26.649 --> 00:24:32.859
in case you haven't noticed not that I'm

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:34.450
a professionally employed computer

00:24:32.859 --> 00:24:37.630
programmer you know I'm putting in the

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:40.970
time right now is what I'm saying

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:42.200
okay done this room is so not worth it

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:44.450
if you can't get hit at all what are you

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.590
thinking here you might think what

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:47.210
happened you just thought you were doing

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:50.240
fine you didn't take any damage and then

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:51.740
you've come down here and you've lost so

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:54.050
many lives to enemies that are not that

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:56.090
hard yeah well our full run reroll took

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:58.850
something away from every single stat

00:24:56.090 --> 00:25:02.000
gave me curse died and reduce my speed

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:05.330
by like 60% so I'm dealing with a little

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:08.090
bit of an adjustment period here like

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:17.840
wake up by the Arcade Fire you know I'm

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:19.790
trying the problem is I don't know this

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.960
is good to say but the problem I have an

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:23.300
automation now is that there's still

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:25.760
like a human element at some point like

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:29.810
all the McDonald's near here have the

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:32.060
kiosks so that you can order manually on

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:33.920
the kiosk or to automatically I should

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:36.800
say on the kiosk you you make your order

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:38.660
and then great items by the way you make

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.070
your order and then the order when

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:41.420
you're done and it's paid for gets sent

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:44.660
to the kitchen and then humans make your

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:46.760
food and present it to you there's still

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:49.010
an element of human error if you enter

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:50.570
the order improperly of course that can

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:52.760
Institute some error but I don't know

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:56.000
what you do about that but the other one

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:57.620
is the people who read the order off the

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.650
screen could end up making a mistake

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:03.350
like and this is not a revelation

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:05.440
anybody and nor is it a damnation of the

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:08.000
service industry I hate when people go I

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:09.080
went to McDonald's and I ordered

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.940
barbecue sauce but they gave me

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.290
sweet-and-sour I ate those idiots you

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:13.940
know there's people trying to make

00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:16.720
trying to make it work you know they're

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:18.830
working a 12-hour day at McDonald's

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.880
they're not they don't have it out for

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:21.740
you they don't have like an anti

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:27.260
barbecue sauce agenda all right they

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:28.640
made a mistake it happens but like three

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.320
weeks ago Kate was like hey can you pick

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.670
up some food for McDonald's on your way

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.560
home and I was like yeah well you

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:39.350
haven't you still have a ten-piece meal

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:41.690
oh but 10-piece chicken McNuggets Rhys

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:42.330
and you know a drink it doesn't matter

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:43.649
with a drink

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:45.750
this context and I said you know what

00:26:43.649 --> 00:26:48.990
that sounds good all the same thing so I

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:51.840
placed the order it was two identical

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:54.269
meals and then I picked up the bag and I

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:56.220
got in my car and I went home and then

00:26:54.269 --> 00:26:59.070
when I got home they had provided only

00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:00.269
one meal and I completely on a human

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:02.340
level understand how that could happen

00:27:00.269 --> 00:27:05.490
because there was literally no

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:09.299
difference between the orders you go oh

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:10.590
my lord I just okay we have a charge

00:27:09.299 --> 00:27:13.890
just reroll it dude

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:16.769
plus 40 damage if a CAC if a CAC scary

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:20.630
but also good because there's literally

00:27:16.769 --> 00:27:33.330
no difference between the order what

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:38.549
what let me offer my hypothesis for what

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:40.639
happened there no I don't have one I

00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:46.019
don't I don't have one

00:27:40.639 --> 00:27:48.870
what is shooting I'm not shooting

00:27:46.019 --> 00:27:50.549
there's like an invisible boy behind me

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:55.080
who's shooting

00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:58.289
I need to reroll this ASAP like when I

00:27:55.080 --> 00:28:00.630
shoot the shot comes from like an

00:27:58.289 --> 00:28:03.149
incubus at the back of the screen or

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:06.330
something oh because we have monstros

00:28:03.149 --> 00:28:08.159
long we must also have like a face

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:13.529
reward or something like that

00:28:08.159 --> 00:28:17.100
this is horrible this reroll cannot come

00:28:13.529 --> 00:28:20.659
soon enough I think we may also have

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.659
kidney stone but I'm unsure

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:30.080
yeah this is this is scary dude who

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:32.030
might be on like three lives it's kind

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:38.480
of a weird way to squander a run but I

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:41.830
mean have you seen it been - both item

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:44.270
rooms they were both basically worthless

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:46.490
the shop is important we can get another

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:47.870
reroll in there and obviously like case

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:49.880
you haven't noticed this probably isn't

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:51.559
like the run that I want to stick with

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.510
right here we have four point five

00:28:51.559 --> 00:28:56.330
damage if we shoot once every forty five

00:28:53.510 --> 00:29:00.669
years anyway the point is from the

00:28:56.330 --> 00:29:03.350
McDonald's story before I went excuse me

00:29:00.669 --> 00:29:04.940
is an understandable order to make

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:06.799
because the orders that I presented

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:09.890
where it was two of the exact same thing

00:29:06.799 --> 00:29:12.380
so I guess you know it's somewhat easier

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:14.299
to understand how they could perceive

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:14.659
that as being only one order and it's on

00:29:14.299 --> 00:29:15.620
me

00:29:14.659 --> 00:29:17.480
I should have checked it when I was in

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:19.940
the restaurant but I was in a hurry and

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:22.780
I use the term restaurant loosely but

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:25.460
also as the term of endearment and I

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:27.020
left without doing my due diligence and

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:29.360
as a result you know there's an element

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:31.190
of buyer beware there for certain but at

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.960
the same time I was like when the robots

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:34.940
read the orders and prepare the food

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:37.039
that's not going to happen and I don't

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:39.140
take that as an indictment of the people

00:29:37.039 --> 00:29:41.240
who work in this food service industry I

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:43.640
take it as an indictment of humankind in

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:45.890
general we're error-prone creatures I

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:50.990
wish I wish we weren't but we you know

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:54.169
we lose focus even the best baseball

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:55.940
players make like an error a season

00:29:54.169 --> 00:29:58.370
basically even if it is such a

00:29:55.940 --> 00:30:00.730
noteworthy thing that it's like it has

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:02.390
its own spot on the scoreboard like

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:04.159
that's the thing

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:06.740
it's there's nothing you could do about

00:30:04.159 --> 00:30:08.570
it it's just the way we is what a

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:11.770
strange way to phrase that it was

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:11.770
perthro okay

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:21.740
I I think we will lose this run Oh Bob

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:23.930
is building an army sweet we got the Bob

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:25.790
transformation everybody nobody fear we

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:30.070
got them all good and we're stopping on

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:32.330
marks exquisite

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:34.490
well judgment I don't know what you've

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:37.270
got for me this this run is absolutely

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:39.260
mind flooded me past the point of like

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:41.420
sensibility I don't understand what's

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:43.370
happening here I wish I could see how

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:48.620
many lives we have we do still have the

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:55.340
cat head so we've got at least two of

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:59.770
course HP this is halitosis to sue so

00:30:55.340 --> 00:31:01.970
Lucas is Shannon and then and then I

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:03.650
don't know we live in interesting times

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:07.490
I guess is what I'm saying from that

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:10.780
perspective but I feel for you like

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:14.690
sincerely I'm definitely not like a

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:16.820
progress Trump's everything sort of dude

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:18.350
so if you would you know lived your

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:21.320
whole life as a truck sure especially if

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:23.900
you're like you know you're even 58 was

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:25.760
not a good example because maybe you

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:26.900
could just run it out

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:29.600
you know it might be some time before

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:32.000
self-driving cars hit that level of

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.530
zeitgeist and you can still be there and

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.660
that's that's fine there's nothing wrong

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:38.870
with that at all but you know if you're

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.950
like 39 and self-driving you're like

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:42.230
okay I see the writing on the wall

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:45.980
within 30 years like my jobs not going

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:47.420
to exist then yes I mean it's easy if

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:50.030
you're very young you can say like oh

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:51.680
you know just go back to school and get

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:53.420
reeducate another field that's not a

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:55.120
easy once you have some inertia in your

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:58.400
life you know once you got people

00:31:55.120 --> 00:32:01.730
relying on you and you know maybe you

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:04.040
got kids you got bills etc etc it's not

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:06.860
anybody's fault necessarily but it's a I

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:10.460
have sympathy for that it's remarkably

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:13.990
real for an Isaac episode right now by

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:17.060
the way I love booger tears but I'm not

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:19.090
convinced that this run has what it

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.090
takes

00:32:19.629 --> 00:32:25.730
with his present setup to make the dream

00:32:22.879 --> 00:32:29.389
work and I'm not talking about the

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:30.399
studio that brought you ants b-movie and

00:32:29.389 --> 00:32:33.739
Shrek

00:32:30.399 --> 00:32:35.210
yes that's DreamWorks correct which I

00:32:33.739 --> 00:32:37.820
believe means teamworks

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:44.139
is involved in some located that's bad

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:44.139
joke we really have stompy Isaac's heart

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:59.769
well Hanson that's an interesting

00:32:49.730 --> 00:33:02.600
situation what would you do here

00:32:59.769 --> 00:33:06.369
we've lost our cat head this is our last

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:10.879
life I think we try to beat mom's heart

00:33:06.369 --> 00:33:15.350
why is this dangerous by the way we have

00:33:10.879 --> 00:33:17.899
fruitcake we're firing infinity shots

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:24.220
per second I tried I genuinely we're

00:33:17.899 --> 00:33:24.220
back okay we're dark Judas what what

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:35.359
it's a miracle but also like still

00:33:29.179 --> 00:33:38.840
pretty bad soy milk fruitcake

00:33:35.359 --> 00:33:42.049
is is just god-awful if I mean Isaac's

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:47.929
heart is not helping anybody but soy

00:33:42.049 --> 00:33:53.480
milk fruitcake dude this is kind of my

00:33:47.929 --> 00:33:56.919
own personal hell please pop up you're

00:33:53.480 --> 00:34:00.470
not touching the fire right now

00:33:56.919 --> 00:34:01.999
pardon me spirit arts please okay we got

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:03.379
one spirit hour why am I doing this room

00:34:01.999 --> 00:34:05.299
even though it's probably likely to be

00:34:03.379 --> 00:34:06.799
harder than the other rooms because it's

00:34:05.299 --> 00:34:09.349
going to give me three charges for doing

00:34:06.799 --> 00:34:13.280
it so it's the fastest way for us to get

00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:15.200
this run under control what's sad is

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:17.119
that the damage output from this is

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:18.919
actually really good if we could just

00:34:17.119 --> 00:34:20.329
get immunity to explosions I would be

00:34:18.919 --> 00:34:22.490
loving life but that's a great example

00:34:20.329 --> 00:34:27.079
of why despite the rose-colored glasses

00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:29.690
I have on we can't make this run like

00:34:27.079 --> 00:34:31.419
work for us consistently nor can we make

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:35.179
this run work for us consistently so

00:34:31.419 --> 00:34:38.480
basically he darned if you do darned if

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:41.149
you don't man we have no shot speed is

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:43.069
what it seems like here so I mean we

00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:46.730
have infestation too which is incredible

00:34:43.069 --> 00:34:48.980
but we have like no shot speed we were

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:50.960
and we got scatter bombs so we really

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:53.409
just like dump these bombs and then run

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.409
for your life

00:34:57.010 --> 00:35:04.460
it's really good until it isn't

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:06.530
we had the reroll basically otherwise we

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:08.210
would have been dead so I don't love

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:09.500
that I rear old there because that run

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:11.480
had some good stuff going for it but

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:15.710
we're in full like d4 is the only way

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:19.550
forward right now sort of mode this is a

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:23.270
very very strange episode we died to a

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:26.510
room that I've come to hate vilified the

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:28.609
working class I hope that's not the way

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:33.319
that that came across it's not my

00:35:28.609 --> 00:35:35.150
intention at all but no we I don't think

00:35:33.319 --> 00:35:36.800
it came across like that anyway we get

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:40.700
another dark Judas what's our what's our

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:42.319
respawn right now can you come back as

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:49.460
dark Judas twice and get the damage

00:35:42.319 --> 00:35:52.430
bonus twice I doubt it so we might as

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:55.990
well respawn like we might as well not

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:55.990
rear old this run is okay

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:10.109
if we could do this like not reroll the

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:11.730
whole run yet respawn as blue baby or

00:36:10.109 --> 00:36:13.740
dodo my see it right there it's Lazar

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:16.410
eggs mmm then the problem is to be

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:18.359
reroll into Lazar eggs on the next room

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:20.310
we're going to Ord like after we die we

00:36:18.359 --> 00:36:23.910
could get no HP and hate it so let's

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:27.950
reroll again we still have one life this

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:30.690
seems good it's like actual good damage

00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:33.750
ten damage with a five rate of fire it's

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:38.910
perfect it's all I've ever wanted it's

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:49.770
all I ever needed yeah so tell me what

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:58.590
to do now loser how close are we to to

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:59.880
make in the guppy dream hey we should

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:01.380
have stuck with the paw doesn't really

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:03.180
matter I want to keep the D for just in

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:05.359
case but we're only one item away from

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:08.640
making the guppy dream work I think so

00:37:05.359 --> 00:37:11.820
there is a chance there we use nine

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:15.030
lives on like two floors that is

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:17.690
hilarious the run was garbage by we

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:20.340
rolled into so many bad runs in a row

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:26.400
but now it's all coming up you know

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:28.800
roses for us mm-hmm roses might be a

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:31.280
little bit of an exaggeration but get

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.280
the idea

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:38.230
we don't need money we actually can't

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:40.480
make the hush fight all the runs I've

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:42.640
done today have had like no chance at

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.920
boss rush in no chance at hush not

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:53.050
complaining because they've been

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:56.440
interesting more interesting than just

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:59.859
your standard steamroll anyway but I do

00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:02.619
I'm I'm envious of a of the former time

00:37:59.859 --> 00:38:03.990
when it seemed like every single run

00:38:02.619 --> 00:38:07.089
could make boss rush

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:08.650
it's that TNT room man I ain't it built

00:38:07.089 --> 00:38:10.569
like an Isaac mod that just allows you

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:12.220
to practice that room over and over at

00:38:10.569 --> 00:38:18.730
which point I will destroy my own

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:20.380
enjoyment of this game and that would be

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:21.700
that I suppose maybe we just focus on

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.930
the fact that you still like the game

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:25.180
after all these years and you had a

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:30.430
choice of things to play today you chose

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:33.640
to play ice it says a lot we also have

00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:35.349
the wafer right now we took half damage

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:43.450
from that at least is what it seemed

00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:45.849
like to me we got a deal make me Duffy

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:50.170
oh it didn't make me gummy but Incubus

00:38:45.849 --> 00:38:51.790
is also like really good so yeah this is

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:53.349
going to be solid let's take what makes

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:55.240
you larger if you get enough of those or

00:38:53.349 --> 00:38:59.200
if you get enough size upgrades it gives

00:38:55.240 --> 00:39:01.240
you stompy weirdly enough but I don't

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:06.390
think that's good but I do think it's

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:09.510
weird so I'm for it I'm very Pro

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:13.480
weirdness in this situation you know

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:15.790
harmless weirdness like dressing up like

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:20.260
you're from the eighteen hundred's some

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:26.430
kind of weirdo I use weirdo as a term of

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:29.410
endearment sincerely I'm a little weird

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:33.760
28 years old and my job requires me to

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:36.369
sit requires is a negative word here my

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.869
job allows me to sit inside play video

00:39:36.369 --> 00:39:40.810
games and crank jokes to myself for

00:39:37.869 --> 00:39:43.370
hours and hours a day I basically get

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:46.050
paid to talk to myself

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:48.450
that kind of career is existed for a

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:49.910
while I suppose like it's radio DJ and

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:54.090
stuff like that but it's a little

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:55.910
different because sometimes they get

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:58.140
calls

00:39:55.910 --> 00:40:00.810
can you play Miami by Will Smith

00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:03.420
apparently it's all a sham at least on a

00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:06.270
lot of like larger radio stations like

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:08.160
they already have the programming that

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:12.450
they're gonna play which is set by like

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:14.610
some higher up and then they will only

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:16.020
play your request on the radio like

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:18.140
they'll play like you calling and being

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:20.730
like could you play Miami by Will Smith

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:22.380
if they were already going to play Miami

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:23.670
and then it makes them look good right

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:27.780
I'm not trying to be like oh you know

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:29.640
wake up sheeple it does make sense you

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:32.700
know it engenders a little bit of public

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:34.550
good support if you're like they did you

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:39.420
get the impression that you're playing

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:40.860
user-submitted request but really you're

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:45.000
just like I was going to play it anyway

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:47.730
but now it looks sweet so I don't know

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.510
I'm still like 75 25 we're going to win

00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:54.060
here that should be bookworm

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:56.700
it is bookworm and shielded tears do we

00:40:54.060 --> 00:41:02.310
have piercing shots in any way we're

00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:03.990
about to find out I suppose no but it's

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:06.020
good but I'm gonna re-roll anyway

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:10.380
because I can't be stopped

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:14.460
weary rolled into spider baby I there's

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:17.160
a spider baby transformation am I losing

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:22.940
my mind by the way this reroll was

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:25.200
amazing for many reasons the static tear

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:29.700
combination is what's giving me life

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:31.950
right now but I'm also kind of stunned

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:33.540
is there another transformation I was

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:35.910
completely unaware of or am I actually

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:37.590
just forgetting that spider baby was

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:40.200
like a real thing that I've never known

00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:44.400
I know spider baby spider baby is an

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:47.640
item like look at what is that spider

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:49.890
thing walking around here it's not

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:52.140
spider Maude it's not sissy longlegs

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:53.070
it's like it's got the spider baby

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:57.090
hanging out here

00:41:53.070 --> 00:42:00.210
I have no idea so much to do so much to

00:41:57.090 --> 00:42:03.390
see apparently still in this day and age

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:04.920
so I reroll my amazing run with like

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:07.410
half a second left please don't make me

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:09.120
go to the void floor next event dude

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:10.770

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:15.270
lost win that is technically a Lazarus

Rin or wind I don't know

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:18.900
