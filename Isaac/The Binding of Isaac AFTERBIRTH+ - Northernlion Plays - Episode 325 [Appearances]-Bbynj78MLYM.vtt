00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.160
hey everybody welcome ignore the line

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.910
please binding of issac afterbirth plus

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:11.370
we lose we win that's this the duality

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.379
of man right there Polyphemus at a start

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.570
TBH 1 @ NH 1 p j 7c to be honest one

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:24.090
direction that's one word in my world

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.609
please just seven classics you got six

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.400
already just give me the seventh I can't

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.700
name six One Direction songs to be

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.660
honestly I could probably name a few

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.790
first off I have to ask the obvious

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.030
question is One Direction still popular

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.940
I ask this not like you know I feel like

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.100
especially when that was pretty bad

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.570
damage but if somebody's in their early

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.250
20s and they want to come across as like

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.590
counterculture they go with one

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:56.309
direction who's that ha ha ha oh I'm

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:58.320
sorry I only listen to uh Brian Eno's

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.600
and be in volume 1 music for airports

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.510
and effects twin selected ambient works

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.610
to 85 to 92 but that actually is like

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.020
it's a parody of myself but anyway of

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.280
course I'm aware that One Direction was

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.200
popular I just don't know cuz these

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.580
bands sometimes they got a long life

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.250
span sometimes they got a short life

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.100
span is one direction still popular they

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.060
have that song you don't know you're

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.680
beautiful and that's what makes you

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.080
beautiful I'm well aware of that one

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:33.630
because I have ears and have been around

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:34.530
a radio and then they have did I say you

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.189
don't know you're beautiful and that's

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.079
what makes you beautiful I did huh I

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.070
thought they had another one which was

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.750
like hey be your good girl would be a

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.909
bad girl in my hotel room or something

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.590
like that I camera that was like a year

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.970
ago we don't want to take you know we

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.759
should be doing those teleport and every

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.780
chance we get try to make this work

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.229
anyway I should be talking about Isaac

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:05.070
instead of One Direction but I have

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.570
nothing against One Direction I'm not

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.409
I've got nothing for him I mean never

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.569
purchased a piece of One Direction

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.039
merchandiser music before in my life

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.130
mostly I just don't want to anger the

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.410
myriad Twitter accounts

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.420
that are like st. Malik's number-one fan

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.600
and then you know they have like 300,000

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.710
followers and they're like get them

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.000
could be the end of my career you know

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.260
you got to keep them out you might be

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.650
watching this right now and you're like

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.620
you know 2021 you could be 30

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.790
you could be 70 is all good with me

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.520
especially if you don't have at block

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.260
installed but then beyond that you know

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.720
you might not be a fan of my videos

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.250
forever you might seem unfathomable now

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.840
you're like but NL you're the funniest

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.370
person I've ever met in my whole life

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.710
and you're my hero and bla bla yeah I

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.140
know like you're right but the same time

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.270
tastes change and you know popularity

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.720
wanes and stuff like that

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.730
I got a to stay fresh I got to continue

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.680
to appeal to people who are like you

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.470
know across the gambit of age groups I

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.850
got to stay relevant as a 28 year old

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.680
the people who are at the present moment

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.610
half my age and I don't know how you do

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.010
that I don't know what like 14 year-olds

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.740
are into these days and that represents

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.090
like a problem with my marketing to be

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.830
honest with you not because I

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.340
necessarily want to cultivate an

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.510
audience of people who are 14 years old

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.820
but because those 14 year olds will

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.540
eventually be 22 and they'll be like I

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.220
want to watch this guy who knows that

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.300
XCOM enemy within is the best game of

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.460
the last console generation so I don't

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.890
know I got to figure it out I feel like

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.270
I should be anti cynical here like feel

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.770
like the average person would be like

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.010
yeah what are 14 year olds into these

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.450
days digit spinners amines but I don't

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.760
know what are what are 14 year olds into

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.680
it seems like seems like we got a woke

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.950
generation of teenagers coming up what

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:56.420
do you guys into you recycling electric

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.690
cars and solar power keep up the good

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.700
work

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:04.100
see you later you scumbag oh we did it

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:08.590
that was actually like a incredibly fast

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:13.220
and be like why am i fighting this guy

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:16.690
fighting these guys to get angry fly is

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.890
almost like a joke in and of itself but

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.010
there's no reason to fight them to begin

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.010
with

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.569
I don't think we should do this I'm

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.860
going to finish it but I'm just going to

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:28.729
tell you I don't think this is the way

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.590
it should go

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.270
this runs great by the way I mean I've

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.800
really talked about it too much because

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.210
we started with Polyphemus so all of our

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.770
other stats are like effectively

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.240
irrelevant but we're going down to the

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.560
third floor four minutes and we have

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.539
deal with the devil precedent a decent

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.240
amount of HP we pick up since oil which

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:47.259
is great and again the Polyphemus start

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.780
just buys us like a lot of time here but

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:52.849
now that you can't use a missing no word

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.500
or undefined here I mean those are two

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:56.629
different items but they kind of have

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.509
the same graphical theme you know now

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:01.129
that we can't use undefined to to loot

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.530
the chest it's not quite as interesting

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:05.150
because it carries this like it carries

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.530
an opportunity cost whatever it actually

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.669
works and gives you a narrow room and

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:12.440
that's that you could accidentally miss

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.940
out on like on this floor we can miss

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.680
out on two bathrooms a potential deal

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.690
with the devil to item rooms to shop the

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.550
secret rooms etc etc if we teleport to a

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.560
narrow room too early and then a narrow

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.509
room is not guaranteed to have an item

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.009
and if it has an item and certainly not

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.440
guaranteed to have a good item it's not

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:29.300
like our item pools for air rooms are

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.550
specifically fantastic or anything like

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:36.979
that so at the present moment I'm not

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.289
not sure how I'm going to use this item

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:41.150
by and large but I think we should we

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:43.819
should adhere the rules of Zain if your

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.250
run is good concern yourself as aim not

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:48.710
Zayn Malik you know I just can't stop

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:54.199
talking about one direction see this is

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:56.240
what I was concerned about so we are

00:05:54.199 --> 00:06:00.529
we're fighting Ragman for the second

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.210
time we've like immediately if we if we

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:04.400
don't get a battery charge for this

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.020
which we've almost certainly will not we

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:11.979
have just inhibited ourselves to an

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:14.650
enormous deal please let me out of here

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:16.610
we've just missed out on to item rooms

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.319
potential deal with the devil end to

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.690
boss signs give me the battery oh I

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:22.639
really thought that it was going to give

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.440
me the battery we need to slow at the

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:26.900
eff down but mind you if you have a

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.520
conspiracy theory like onl just he's

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.770
trying to finish this run quick so we

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.240
could go get some lunch first off you're

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.639
very astute judge of character I'm a

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.180
hungry boy right now but I budgeted my

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:37.100
time up

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.320
really so unless this episode takes 80

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.240
minutes I got enough time to get lunch

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.420
before I gotta get the NL s s started

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:49.100
okay with the requisite 1 to 2 minutes

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:51.530
of late that we always are but angry fly

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:55.540
orbiting the shadows a little strange

00:06:51.530 --> 00:07:00.410
anyway how could you have possibly

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:03.530
accused me of trying to rush this run

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:06.350
when we've gotten error rooms on our

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:09.680
only two plays of undefined by the way

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:11.420
we got a I of the keeper or whatever

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.180
it's not head of the keeper there's I

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.190
have Greaves gold tears I have no idea

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:19.160
what makes this different from head of

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.420
the keeper and we should look it up but

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.950
it seems like one of those items that we

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:26.120
might be able to just figure it out as

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:28.610
we play anyway this floor and we're on

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.530
the Deaf's one so like this is too fast

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.610
to be on the Deaf's one I'll just own up

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:34.070
to it right here

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:36.130
I'm going to tempt fate because when

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:39.320
you're going through hell keep going

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:41.660
I'm not going to tempt fate yet though I

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:44.240
want to go into the curse room and then

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.460
teleport out to save ourselves 1/2 spear

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.970
at heart in order to do it all you're an

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:52.340
idiot in order to do this though it's

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.350
very sensible for us to have a spear at

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:57.410
heart first so that's what I'm waiting

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.940
on is that potentiality we might just

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:01.130
want to go to our item room as well but

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:03.710
that would you know I'm kind of I'm

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:06.410
embracing the role right now of like how

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:08.720
many times could it possibly backfire on

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:12.590
us and I recognize that that answer is

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:14.930
you know variable but still also it

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:17.360
would be prudent for us to visit our

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:21.890
shop you know we've gotten a lot of

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:25.750
money out of out of I of the keeper

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.750
ahead of the keeper whatever it's called

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.760
just give me some special rooms this is

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:35.660
probably our secret room

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:39.560
our secret room I mean oh right I forgot

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:41.360
ghostpepper actually destroys a statues

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.860
wait a minute I was like I forgot about

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.000
that thing that we're all aware of and

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.770
then I thought about it for two seconds

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.100
and I was like I don't think that's

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:52.880
actually something I knew in the first

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:55.670
place well they seem to want me to come

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:58.370
this way so I will come as you are as a

00:08:55.670 --> 00:09:01.460
friend as I want you to be another great

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:03.230
one direction song but bombs oh you know

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:06.860
what okay now we got to go to our shop

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:10.100
and we got we got all the tools to carry

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:13.400
us here so here's what you do you go to

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:14.690
the shop you get a spirit heart you go

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.610
to the secret room and you go to the

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:18.170
shop and you there's no spirit art for

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:20.780
sale but there will be a spirit heart

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:24.590
for sale Ace of Hearts that's not

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:26.930
particularly strong here we like we

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:29.330
really really would like to get a spear

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:30.950
at heart so ancient recall gives us

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:37.510
three cards I think so I'm just going to

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:37.510
pop it two spades justice and the lovers

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:42.440
got 12 cents we can probably pretty

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:44.240
easily get the 15 on this floor if we

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.190
don't teleport but tell you what I'm

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.780
actually just going to kind of go for

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:51.350
broke on spirit hearts here even though

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:53.600
if we get money I would love to I would

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:55.340
love to buy chaos and and ideally steam

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.960
sale as well but the just stacking of

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.940
spirit hearts was relatively intelligent

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:01.040
there now what we're going to do is

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:03.320
enact our plan from earlier but actually

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.820
before we enact our plan I am going to

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:07.090
go fight this mini boss down here in the

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:09.320
hopes of picking up maybe the virus

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:11.560
there's a couple good mini boss items

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:15.110
that I'd be I'd be stoked to have but

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:17.720
even just raw HP is fine by me honestly

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:19.970
we're extremely lucky with how this run

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.920
started like the seed of this run giving

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:25.250
us Polyphemus were it not for that we

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:28.910
would be in like actual hell that's

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:31.300
great not actual hell I mean maybe I

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.300
don't know

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:37.120
I think the the the selling point of

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:38.740
hell is that it's bad but I've never

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.050
been there myself you know it's like

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:43.060
someone goes to a town for a week and

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:44.350
then I hate this town it's blah and

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.490
you're like wow if you live there you

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:49.540
know there's actually a pretty good

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:52.270
sushi joint on commercial Broadway it

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:54.070
ain't all that sure I mean the housing

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:58.870
prices but the Windsors are remarkably

00:10:54.070 --> 00:11:01.900
mild hey don't hit me no more okay that

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:04.150
one I basically walked into all I asked

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:06.070
for and the run doesn't have to provide

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:08.440
it for me it's provided for me in a big

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:12.130
way already but I would love a good

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:15.010
tears upgrade we're probably in a great

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:16.360
spot regardless like again we're it not

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:18.340
for the fact that we started out of

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:23.260
control strong here and actually largely

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:25.450
kept it up despite the fact that we we

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:28.300
did end up obviously you know losing a

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:29.650
couple item rooms boss rooms potentially

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.380
a deal with the devil and certainly a

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:34.930
shop as well

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:35.680
we are still killing it well we're still

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:37.270
doing okay

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.650
our speed actually I don't think it's

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.660
high enough to get away from this guy oh

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:46.530
my god did you see shot out like a

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:48.730
freakin supersonic man okay take this

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:50.920
Krampus you better hook me up with lump

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:52.480
of coal here I don't want to fight you

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:56.170
if I'm not getting a lump of coal out of

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:59.860
it you've made an enemy for the last

00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:01.510
time my friend do we have we have no

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.730
battery charges I think we're just out I

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:06.340
think we're gone let's move we got a

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:08.230
strength card for maybe our next deal

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:10.350
with the devil I don't know it's kind of

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:12.520
a weird situation to be in

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:14.470
this floor is super weird as well

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:19.300
because we have had this happen before

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:24.160
where we used undefined and it made it

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:27.130
so we couldn't get to the Polaroid you

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.810
know if you skip this boss fight you

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:31.600
don't get the Polaroid and as a results

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:33.820
I mean I guess now you could find an

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:39.280
alternate path that was pretty dumb you

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:43.810
can find an alternate path and get too

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:45.580
the void but I'd rather not be forced

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:48.220
into doing that because it sounds

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:49.930
terrible okay we're that awful awful

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.850
damage like we're like a three out of

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:56.410
ten level in terms of the quality of our

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:59.140
play right now and this is the true

00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:01.900
Genesis or epitome at least of

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:04.690
northernlion luck is that we have a run

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.850
where we can afford to play like garbage

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:08.710
and still not be in a terrible situation

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:12.220
but let's not revel in that let's work

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:15.010
past it you know it's like being a

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:17.890
student you know for there was a time in

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:20.350
my life I was I was mostly a pretty okay

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:22.180
student there's definitely a you know a

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:24.210
couple of years of my scholastic career

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:27.370
that I fit that archetype of being like

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:28.150
the clever kid always screwed up our

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.520
deal with the devil

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:32.620
the clever kid who doesn't apply himself

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:36.220
and when you're in like middle school

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:38.050
even high school that seems like it's a

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:40.870
mark of great personal pride you know

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:44.020
you're like everybody has to work harder

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:45.790
than me to achieve the same results but

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:47.500
then if you work like a lot harder than

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:49.510
me you can achieve much better results

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:54.070
and that's the thing the older you get

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:56.080
the less the less easy it is and I'm not

00:13:54.070 --> 00:14:00.339
sure if we get a game crash here the

00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:03.630
less easy it is to be proud of yourself

00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:06.760
for being average with below average

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:08.530
effort you know and I'm not that sounds

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.900
like I'm making a case for like NL

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:13.630
exceptionalism or something like oh I'm

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:15.430
you know God's gift to earth but I

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:17.730
didn't realize it until I started trying

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:19.450
to know like everybody is good

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:21.040
disproportionately at different things

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:23.770
I'm speaking specifically from a

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:26.740
Scholastic standpoint right here you

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:28.000
know I know the archetype a lot of

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.980
people out there watching this are going

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.910
to be well not maybe not a lot but some

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:35.730
of you have they're watching this

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:35.730
probably remind me of myself at that age

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:43.210
you know why why would I put in an hour

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:45.520
and night to get straight A's when I can

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:48.280
get straight B pluses with no work well

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:50.860
the answer is because you know it's good

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.240
to challenge yourself it's good it's

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.459
good

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:56.220
to keep yourself on your toes and

00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:59.370
constantly forcing okay stop with the

00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:02.850
damage constantly force yourself to you

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:04.050
know improve and that only happens when

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:08.070
you when you take yourself out of your

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:09.450
comfort zone being comfortable is

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:11.310
awesome but I think being too

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:13.440
comfortable can be like a curse as well

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:14.940
happens all the time you might say won't

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.910
happened to me and it's possible but

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:20.700
some many situations in college

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:23.760
especially people who never learned like

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:26.160
good study habits and then all of a

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:28.560
sudden class is a lot harder to do well

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.959
in earth even past sometimes and like

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:36.990
what do you mean I got a study like four

00:15:30.959 --> 00:15:39.360
hours a week seems inconceivable anyway

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:40.920
this is getting too preachy we've slowed

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.570
down on this run a lot I mean part of

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:45.330
that is inevitable because of the fact

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:47.399
that you know we didn't skip two entire

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:51.959
floors over and over we only skip two

00:15:47.399 --> 00:15:53.850
entire floors once but we should take

00:15:51.959 --> 00:15:55.470
that as a sign that the run is not as

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:57.870
powerful relative to the enemies as it

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:59.850
used to be so if we could freaking pop

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:01.950
off like that would be good first off

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:05.220
start playing better smarten up is the

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:07.700
is the expression okay we're going to

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:09.570
bomb it looking for seven centum

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:13.500
would probably just buy a bunch of

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:15.600
spirit hearts or one spirit heart

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:17.160
because it seems like things probably

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.260
going to get dusted soon come on seven

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.490
cent good item seven cent good item I

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:23.430
don't care if we used all our bombs to

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:26.930
make it happen as ice cold man that was

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:26.930
ice cold we did the me right there

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:35.450
I wish we can take the battery charge in

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:38.160
with us obviously not plausible

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:41.720
okay ghostpepper thank you that was a

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.720
very conveniently timed ghostpepper

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:50.040
keep yourself abreast of where mom's

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:52.220
going to be here that was not pun

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.220
intended

00:16:54.320 --> 00:17:00.090
let's go No Deal and that's completely

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:01.290
fair but easy boss rush access which I

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:03.840
didn't even consider until just now

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:07.800
obviously we want the Polaroid banks tab

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:12.150
spider babby kamikaze Pet X is not even

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:15.209
close it's actually blink so important

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:18.270
that we take tech X here tech Expo Lee

00:17:15.209 --> 00:17:20.250
FEMA is just absurdly good now we're

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:21.900
never going to get like a massively huge

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:24.990
laser in all likelihood because of the

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:27.720
fact that I mean you know there are rate

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:29.400
of fire is not great is the thing but if

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:36.180
anything gets touched by this laser is

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:39.030
done and dusted he has not done it but

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:40.800
that's okay yes okay okay apparently

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.480
what you're supposed to do with this and

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.670
I've probably said this on occasion

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:47.580
before you're supposed to blow up the

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:50.730
greed head in there or the green statue

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:52.470
and then if it gives you an item then

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.840
you use the reroll machine to re-roll it

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:56.400
for the life of me I can't put myself in

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:59.550
the shoes of the developers on that one

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:02.010
it seems like a you know like a 1 in 30

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:04.500
kind of like gamble they're not that the

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:07.830
cost is high but you know it doesn't

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:09.540
seem like it an obvious access to

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:12.840
improve yourself that much is what I'm

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:16.320
trying to get at this is the run that is

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:18.870
like this run is like a trust fund baby

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:21.060
no matter what we did apparently it was

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:22.950
impossible for us to die if we had been

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:26.790
in the average position on this run we

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:28.620
would we're died 20 times over right but

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:30.390
because we started with Polyphemus is so

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:33.840
the silver spoon in our mouth that makes

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:35.490
it impossible for us to take a toke but

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.380
don't choke if you do you get no clue

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:40.170
well me and my homey snoop dogg came to

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:43.559
do with like this in like then like this

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:46.700
sender just walk on the creep

00:18:43.559 --> 00:18:49.590
actually so mad at myself

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:54.059
infamy great item but like it's not

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:57.120
worth the the squeeze here I do like

00:18:54.059 --> 00:18:57.769
this guffy SEC dagger is actually great

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:03.049
as well

00:18:57.769 --> 00:19:03.049
guppy Bob's curse not as good but

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:07.830
wouldn't kick it out of bed for eating

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:09.600
crackers so we did teleport honestly

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.309
kind of hurts because our deal with the

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.990
devil chance was pretty high how many a

00:19:11.309 --> 00:19:19.769
rag men are we gonna fight on this run

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:24.090
like this is getting absurd alright

00:19:19.769 --> 00:19:26.009
alright well we also do not want to I in

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:28.980
a way I don't know whether I should ask

00:19:26.009 --> 00:19:31.049
for your support or apologize you know

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:33.210
if I should be like yeah your plan L

00:19:31.049 --> 00:19:34.860
found another error room or if I should

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:37.820
be like I'm so sorry that we keep

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:41.070
finding error rooms because the runs

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:43.379
it's going too fast it's fast enough

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:46.639
that even our guaranteed win it seems

00:19:43.379 --> 00:19:50.909
like dangerous and that's no good

00:19:46.639 --> 00:19:53.399
this might completely make a hush fight

00:19:50.909 --> 00:19:55.639
like plausible and desirable which is

00:19:53.399 --> 00:19:57.690
why I'm actually taking the time to do

00:19:55.639 --> 00:19:59.999
this right here especially because we

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:01.619
also do not have to shoot every proof

00:19:59.999 --> 00:20:04.230
individually which is always like the

00:20:01.619 --> 00:20:05.909
big problem anyway hoping for some luck

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:09.980
upgrades plus satisfying sound listen to

00:20:05.909 --> 00:20:12.119
this dude that's nice that is just

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:15.990
revitalized my interesting card against

00:20:12.119 --> 00:20:17.909
humanity right there oh my god like I'm

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:20.460
happy because we're getting those fringe

00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:22.049
payouts from from undefined but I'm also

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:27.059
like conscious of the fact that it's

00:20:22.049 --> 00:20:28.860
screwing us so I don't know again

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:31.230
whether to kill you or kiss you on this

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:33.600
run we're at 18 minutes and probably

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:35.419
like four rooms away from possibly going

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:38.279
to the hush fight with a run that is

00:20:35.419 --> 00:20:41.039
shouldn't have done that with a run that

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:45.649
is uh is strong but you know could be

00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:49.230
like a ten out of ten if we had just had

00:20:45.649 --> 00:20:50.909
a slightly different sort of value

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:53.039
proposition here but anyway I mean I'm

00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:53.899
not I'm not too cheesed off by we are

00:20:53.039 --> 00:20:56.179
still rolling

00:20:53.899 --> 00:20:58.429
Polyphemus tac-x

00:20:56.179 --> 00:21:03.109
can't spam the shots our rate of fire is

00:20:58.429 --> 00:21:05.359
not good enough to span the shots but

00:21:03.109 --> 00:21:09.159
still and second I had something in my

00:21:05.359 --> 00:21:12.200
eye here how do we get I am mucus

00:21:09.159 --> 00:21:14.149
it's not like I'm indignant

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:17.090
I actually just don't know why do we get

00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:18.559
IMU cos I know we got mucus in there you

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:21.349
know it's a tear duct or something

00:21:18.559 --> 00:21:22.849
Lowell bio degree don't even start with

00:21:21.349 --> 00:21:24.830
me that's been coming that means

00:21:22.849 --> 00:21:27.139
starting to get me genuinely salty man

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.889
because it not because it implies that I

00:21:27.139 --> 00:21:29.960
am stupid

00:21:27.889 --> 00:21:31.909
or that I have a joke degree or

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:33.379
something like that because you know I'm

00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:36.259
self confident I know what it took to

00:21:33.379 --> 00:21:38.179
get the degree the answer is largely

00:21:36.259 --> 00:21:40.580
showing up the class and studying a lot

00:21:38.179 --> 00:21:42.769
for the exams it wasn't like I had to

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:44.269
live this is like a P o w4 a while I

00:21:42.769 --> 00:21:46.999
mean it's just it's an undergraduate

00:21:44.269 --> 00:21:50.019
degree it's not that absurd but because

00:21:46.999 --> 00:21:52.129
it's unfair to the education system man

00:21:50.019 --> 00:21:54.440
whenever I don't know if this is true

00:21:52.129 --> 00:21:57.080
for like other degrees there's probably

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:58.820
some of them but like for biology people

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.960
ask you all these random questions and

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:02.210
if you don't know the answer of them

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:05.019
they go you know what would you study in

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:08.239
school it's getting crazy you know oh

00:22:05.019 --> 00:22:09.799
well I've got like a rash on my elbow

00:22:08.239 --> 00:22:12.559
what's this I don't know why don't you

00:22:09.799 --> 00:22:14.539
google it slow biodegrade logical see a

00:22:12.559 --> 00:22:15.710
doctor I thought that's what you got no

00:22:14.539 --> 00:22:20.989
you don't understand

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:22.580
these are two very different things you

00:22:20.989 --> 00:22:24.229
get the biology degree when you plan to

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:30.320
go to med school and then when the plans

00:22:24.229 --> 00:22:32.479
fall through you finish it up it's

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:34.219
largely a lot of like I'll look that up

00:22:32.479 --> 00:22:37.909
in the scientific record

00:22:34.219 --> 00:22:41.289
am I getting a steam msgs things like my

00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:41.289
games slowing down like crazy right now

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:50.550
I don't want battery charges if possible

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:52.050
um because I mean I guess maybe I do

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:54.570
want that recharge I'll tell you what

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:56.190
we'll let let God sort them out I don't

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:57.810
know those lives call it I just know

00:22:56.190 --> 00:23:01.800
those sound it makes when it takes a

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:03.000
runs life we first off will get a deal

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:04.830
with the devil here so you want to peep

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.050
that and we can't be Krampus which is

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:08.790
just even more exciting are we going to

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:12.360
do hush or we going to skip hush that

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:15.060
depends on our teleportation oh okay I

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:17.100
think we take a theme then we teleport

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:19.470
we got a narrow room so we're going up

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:22.050
to the cathedral boys which I think

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:25.440
might be merciful for me but at the same

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:30.240
time I could we're going to fight hush

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:32.610
boys if the doors still open boys I

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:34.890
don't know why I keep saying lazy boys

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:40.110
and now I've lifted into a very strange

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:41.820
accent please it's not evocative of any

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:47.060
culture but at the same time we're gonna

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:50.340
take I'm drowsy against hums yeah I mean

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:52.110
here's the thing gara we all love year

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:54.540
we all know what it does we can go one

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:57.210
run without using yera

00:23:54.540 --> 00:24:00.150
in the way we always use ierra to double

00:23:57.210 --> 00:24:02.280
the chest items to see how I'm drowsy

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:03.000
does against hush because I'm drowsy

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:09.450
genuinely

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:11.970
is a is a 10 out of 10 against delirium

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:14.490
so if it's like a 9 out of 10 against

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:17.000
hush then we can save this as a

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:20.610
worthwhile pill I am so turned around

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:24.860
okay is that it I think it's a rock

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:30.990
tinted right there let's flip and go

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:33.320
okay please I just want to exit the

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:33.320
floor

00:24:34.039 --> 00:24:43.200
just take me away okay down to the next

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:45.090
floor but yeah like I'm going to be

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.760
honest with you and like some of you

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:51.990
watching this might be doing a biology

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:54.149
degree maybe you have just applied for

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:55.440
college to be a biology major or

00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:57.899
something like that I'm not trying to

00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:01.260
say like a nice one big mistake idiot

00:24:57.899 --> 00:25:02.940
but an undergraduate degree you know

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:04.679
these days doesn't seem like it's worth

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:06.240
as much as it was back when you know

00:25:04.679 --> 00:25:07.559
during our parents generation where you

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.870
you know you get a high school diploma

00:25:07.559 --> 00:25:11.909
here's you know a job that pays you the

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:14.250
national average salary with like plenty

00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:15.630
of room from upward momentum and stuff

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:19.590
like that I'm not trying to dredge that

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:22.890
up again still sad bombs holding mantle

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:25.919
by the way great pickups here but a

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:28.500
biology degree is not a professional

00:25:25.919 --> 00:25:33.299
degree by itself it doesn't qualify you

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:35.039
for that much on its own merits that

00:25:33.299 --> 00:25:38.669
doesn't mean it's a worthless degree to

00:25:35.039 --> 00:25:40.350
get at all we're good to go here it just

00:25:38.669 --> 00:25:42.390
means that like you know if you if you

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:44.760
are an engineer you get a degree in

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:46.500
civil engineering you can get a job you

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:49.470
know it's probably like a a junior

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:52.020
engineer when you get out of college

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:55.230
with the biology undergrad it's like

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:59.610
you've qualified yourself to you know be

00:25:55.230 --> 00:26:01.529
a lab assistant or to get a master's in

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:04.850
biology you know at which point then you

00:26:01.529 --> 00:26:07.770
can do research and you know eventually

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:09.600
I'm pretty sure that undergraduate

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:11.250
biology degree is largely going to go to

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:13.020
people that are going to be biology

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:16.049
professors when they're when they're

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:17.880
older but anyway it's not necessarily a

00:26:16.049 --> 00:26:21.510
bad thing I'm just people have this idea

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:22.919
that like alright today what's your

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:25.380
what's your first year schedule and

00:26:22.919 --> 00:26:27.659
biology well first I have a does this

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:29.580
animal have hooves

00:26:27.659 --> 00:26:32.789
that's the first class and then finally

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:36.720
we move on to our amoebas sentient and

00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:39.020
then please not not now not now not now

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:41.710
close that message closer

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:45.560
then we move on to is this symptom

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:46.940
symptomatic of cancer you know it's not

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:50.390
really what it is you spend a lot of

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:51.020
time instead being like this is a liver

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:53.420
wart

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:56.690
this is a hornwort this is a nitrogen

00:26:53.420 --> 00:27:02.920
fixing legume you know it's a lot of lot

00:26:56.690 --> 00:27:05.930
of botany a lot of taxonomy a lot of

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:08.270
cultivating Eggar on the plates and then

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:12.340
growing you know bacteria on them and

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:14.630
then you know doing metabolic analysis

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:18.020
I'm not trying to discourage you you

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:21.650
know an education and biology I feel

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:23.300
like we the next generation coming up

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:25.250
because we're already lost you got a

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:27.350
responsibility to not be snobby about

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:29.990
science engineering and you know

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:33.080
technical stuff stem I forget what that

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:35.360
stands for mechanical I don't know the

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:37.580
point is no matter what you take in

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.840
University for the most part I feel the

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:40.670
need to come over the top here because

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:42.950
my colleagues sometimes they're very

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:44.600
anti schools and I understand that they

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:45.440
have different scholastic experiences

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.000
than me to grow up in a different

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.980
country to begin with and I can't speak

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.740
to the American education system but I'm

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:54.590
not cynical about school it helps that

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:56.000
you know tuition in Canada is like 1/8

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:59.660
of what it is at a lot of American

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.590
schools but anyway point is the number

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:02.150
one thing I learned in university

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:05.480
unrelated to my degree

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:07.430
you know skepticism but healthy

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:09.200
skepticism not just being cynical but

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:11.510
being like you know when you see

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.970
reporting about science now I'm like

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:15.440
probably there's a scientist back there

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:17.930
that's like please don't say that this

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:20.390
is a cure for cancer and then they go a

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:23.090
possible cure for cancer found you real

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:25.550
peanut butter on your genitals in rats

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:29.510
in trunk you know 1/8 of one tumor by 2%

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:31.430
you know that and and of respect for for

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:33.020
hard work and just doing the work you

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:35.090
know those are the big things and

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:36.860
honestly that's you know that plus

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:39.560
independent living is probably the most

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:41.420
important lesson I learned in college go

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:43.850
to class do the work because if you

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:46.670
don't like basically not to be rude but

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:50.330
people just unlike high school they just

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:52.150
don't care like in high school if you if

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:55.330
you don't show up for class

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:57.100
the teachers gonna go freaking wild on

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:58.450
you or it sorry your your parents are

00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:00.220
going to go freaking wild on the teacher

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:02.980
you know they're gonna be like how did

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:06.040
you let my son or daughter do so badly

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:07.120
and knew that the teachers like well you

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.500
know do the work they don't show up to

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.780
class and they're like well that's your

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:12.550
job to teach them and then literally

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:16.540
like two months later they might be in

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:19.720
college if they if they flunk out you

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:21.520
know that's on them so there's a degree

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.720
of personal responsibility that becomes

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:24.010
important there because the professors

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.360
they don't even want to teach some of

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:27.010
the time some of them are fantastic but

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:29.020
some of them are like I really just want

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:31.210
to be in my dark lab for the rest of my

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:34.600
life but in order to do that you know

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:38.350
I've got to teach introduction to

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:40.660
calculus three times a year to kids who

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:42.250
don't want to be here and who think that

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.360
they're adults because they can walk out

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:46.330
of the class at any time without

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:52.510
consequence anyway this is it's getting

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:54.370
a little too preachy perhaps I have a

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:55.360
respect for school and I want you to as

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:57.010
well I want you to have a healthy

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.770
respect for it without being without

00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:01.240
being a flipping Keane or you know

00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:07.090
probably not as a Canadian is the Makena

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:10.570
is a brown-noser what it's like June

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:12.130
yeah it is like it's the right time to

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:14.800
be talking about this because many of

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:17.590
you will be going to you know your first

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:20.920
year post-secondary education next year

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:23.590
what are these tips every summer and

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:25.840
nobody listens because it's human nature

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:28.060
I wouldn't know listen either college is

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.290
real simple trying to have fun but also

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:31.120
like go to class

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:32.770
go to every class you're going to say

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.450
it's not reasonable to go to every class

00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:37.030
yeah but if you plan to go to every

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:39.490
class then you'll probably only skip

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:43.150
like 10% proptosis

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:44.800
Gympie magic mush kidney bean again we

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:47.860
don't deserve what we've been granted on

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:51.520
this run but like I'm the happiest

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:55.510
camper regardless we don't deserve to

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:58.970
have 55 damage we played so badly

00:30:55.510 --> 00:31:01.490
and yet here we are stomping on enemies

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:03.770
uber my rated fire is kind of bad I

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:06.500
don't even know what to say about this

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:11.720
run like this is just such a such a

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:14.240
strange run so many times well that's

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:15.830
this is a little self inflating I was

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:17.570
going to say so many times I play well

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:19.460
and I'm just not given the tools to

00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:22.700
reasonably have a chance to succeed and

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:24.290
that is true to some extent dude I love

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:26.830
when you pick up Eden's blessing is like

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:32.690
the capstone to an already excellent run

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:35.740
but anyway cats no nice word this run is

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:40.010
the complete opposite of that

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:42.320
it's exceptional and we have no reason

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:47.030
to have been granted this but that's

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:48.530
life you know sometimes Bill Gates wins

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:49.840
the lottery Bill Gates strikes me as the

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:54.550
kind of guy who doesn't play the lottery

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:54.550
but you know you the example holds

00:31:56.929 --> 00:32:02.010
we we are Bill Gates winning the lottery

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:05.970
here but that Judas run like four runs

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:09.450
ago that was not Bill Gates winning the

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:11.100
lottery you know that was like Hans

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:13.260
Moleman getting hit in the groin with a

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:15.210
football again and again and again are

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:17.970
you going to give me delirium

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:21.360
you're not I kind of want to if I'm

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:23.520
being honest like I don't think there's

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:25.350
any way for us to to create it out of

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:27.630
the ether I'll have us down okay now our

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:30.690
Luck's equal so it's all good

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:32.850
just hit me I don't care well it was a

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:36.030
great ride it was ish it was both the

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:37.320
short end a long run it was like longer

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:38.910
than you'd expect given that we were on

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:41.370
the depths one at six minutes and

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:43.350
shorter than you would think from the

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:44.460
get-go but for now thanks for watching

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:45.510
because I've enjoyed the episode if you

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:47.309
did click the like button I'll set a

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:48.419
great deal of course subscribe if you

00:32:47.309 --> 00:32:50.640
want to see more in the future and

00:32:48.419 --> 00:32:52.020
thanks as always for your support I did

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:53.100
talk about like the future of Isaac a

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:55.260
few episodes ago I'm just waiting for

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:56.910
that backlog to percolate out basically

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.530
and then people will be like I only want

00:32:56.910 --> 00:33:00.390
to see one run a day start over a new

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:02.610
file and then I can tabulate those

00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:03.870
results anecdotally and make a decision

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:04.950
but it might be a few more days still

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:05.910
before that happens but anyway for now

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:07.380
thanks for watching hope you enjoyed it

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:10.910
particularly the like button helps out a

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:10.910
great deal I'll see you next time
