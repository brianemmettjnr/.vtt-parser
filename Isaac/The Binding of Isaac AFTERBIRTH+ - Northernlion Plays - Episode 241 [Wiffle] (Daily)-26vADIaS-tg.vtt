00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.140
hey everybody welcome back northern land

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.750
please finding Mize again to earth plus

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.650
in his daily time I did skip yesterday's

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.519
daily again time got away from me uh but

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.929
two days ago one hundred and second

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.260
place one point to one percent overall

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.939
pretty good score not absurdly amazing

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.420
but pretty good today's run is a Maggie

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.730
run that goes to Mom's foot and the

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.400
highest scores well it's not look at the

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.399
high let's look at like them the median

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.910
of the top thirty is like thirty five

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:41.399
thousand thirty five thousand to me

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.960
indicates it's not a run that ends oh

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.760
man that's an interesting conundrum

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.280
there is the speed upgrade so we should

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.820
just take that right off the bat I saw

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.329
you look know skype messages for four

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.770
hours earlier today I start this runs

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.539
been going for fifty two seconds I got a

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.129
message from bear Flynn hooks room

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.199
difficulty balance is bad this good it's

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.250
I swear to you that I'm not suggesting

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.070
that it's willfully done maliciously I'm

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.650
just saying maybe like they see oh you

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.790
know Isaac baby sign on a play Isaac and

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.460
they're like that reminds me I should

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.229
look at my computer and then they look

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.750
at the sky message just the strange

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.500
coincidence is all I'm saying I'm not

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.979
suggesting there's any malice anyway

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.720
what I was going to say is I think that

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.110
it is conceivable we find a seem a

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.750
thirty five thousand point daily

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.150
indicates I would suggest maybe a

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.220
teleportation after boss rush that also

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.229
allows us to get to a self sacrifice

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.750
room which allows us to get to the lamb

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.060
fight that seems to be roughly a 30,000

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.070
ish point range I mean that those are

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.590
top thirty scores which also you know

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.610
those are great you know the very high

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.770
scores I've had like four day leaves in

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.200
my afterbirth plus like that have hit

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.579
that level so we maybe shouldn't be

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.649
looking at those necessarily as a

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.640
representation I tend to fall somewhere

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.410
between 50 and 150 much of the time but

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.629
okay this room is getting a little silly

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.710
the clicker is such an interesting

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.500
choice but it

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.560
also suicidal if it just rear old your

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.300
character I would use it because you

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.320
know no love loss for Maggie here she's

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.240
fine but you know considering you could

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:33.090
reroll yourself into his nasal or reroll

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:35.880
yourself into not Azazel but also a good

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.830
character such as Dark Judas I would be

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.990
interested the problem is those are like

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.100
two outcomes that are decent but I don't

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.060
want to be blue baby I don't want to be

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.100
the lost that don't want to be the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.700
keeper and then also when you re role

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.020
using the clicker you lose an item I'm

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.930
not sure if you lose an item every time

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.060
or if you just lose an item now and then

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.860
but you do lose items so it's just it's

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.220
not even about the saying at this point

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.960
it's just like it doesn't make sense to

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.340
me now that being said I am going to go

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.050
back and use it because I'm an idiot

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.330
and also because I understand the value

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.770
proposition for watching youtube.com

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.960
slash northernlion is that he is an

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:15.210
idiot so ivory rolled myself I've become

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:20.730
Lilith which effectively is just a 0.15

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:25.400
speed increase apparently without way

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:29.490
did we get HP out of that as well no

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:35.400
which without box of friends is actually

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:36.930
bad like actually bad which is another

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.480
reason we should not have done this

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.130
reroll also it just throws like you know

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.630
for daily purposes it throws a monkey

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.670
wrench into our plans you know because

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.480
we got to get to boss rush we got things

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.120
to do however there are synergies with

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.010
Lilith with little lifts but to be

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.710
honest with you it's probably a

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:01.140
situation where we're looking to re-roll

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:02.430
the character as soon as possible so I'm

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.730
not going to act like this has just cost

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:09.620
us the run because we do have blood clot

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:12.150
which is at least a modestly decent item

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.340
it is a damage upgrade at the very least

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.040
should open that okay we got our key

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.750
back and we've got a lock upgrade which

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.220
is very nice and maybe almost enough

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.200
money to buy a spirit heart which is

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.730
probably the closest thing we get the

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.290
mission critical right now because being

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.280
able to have a spirit hard to ensure

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.490
that our

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.860
deal with the devil goes okay or at

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.810
least exists is fairly important to me I

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.620
don't think we've passed up a tinted

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.380
rock so far can't get that I guess we're

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:44.370
just going to fight the boss then I'm

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:47.370
sort of hesitant because in case it

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.140
isn't abundantly clear I do want to use

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.200
the clicker but the clicker also causes

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.400
us to lose items at least on occasion I

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.140
honestly haven't used it enough to know

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.820
how frequent the item loss is which is a

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.740
little bit of a you know a

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:06.390
reconnaissance problem on my part it's

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:09.090
an intelligence problem however if I

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.280
take a good deal with the devil I can't

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.070
afford to use the clicker because it'll

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.780
cost me you know perhaps the feather in

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:20.520
my cap so we might just stick with

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.100
Lilith's for this whole run but it's

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.950
actually it's probably like on a daily

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.850
it's probably as good to be Maggie as it

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.860
is to be Lilith

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.680
but then combine that with the fact that

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.150
we're not actually Lilith we're like a

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.950
Lilith composite that unfortunately does

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.630
not have box of friends so boss Rush is

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.890
not necessarily going to be as easy for

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.020
us as it would normally be with Lilith

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:48.120
and all of a sudden you can see why I'm

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:51.750
slightly displeased but latchkey is fine

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.490
and I will take I of Belial basically

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.410
because we can and I'm going to go back

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.830
because crack the sky is actually fine

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:09.750
but it's not good enough to write home

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:14.580
about so it's a tough call that probably

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:17.370
should have hit me we could look for a

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.660
secret room which could make the shop

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.370
worthwhile it would also give us two

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.530
cents two cents has a good chance of

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.970
giving us enough money to get another

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.560
reroll from the shop which is what I'm

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.580
gonna cite from the item room which is

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.530
what I'm worried about right now it's

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.880
making sure that I can reroll crack this

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.870
guy into something that's a little bit

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:36.120
more universally useful this is probably

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:41.690
our secret room so let's check oh I

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.690
should have been the other one dang it

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:50.520
four cents was not enough that's a

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:54.030
little maddening we got to check the

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:57.510
shop just in case of sweet room it's not

00:06:54.030 --> 00:07:00.360
sweet room so then the next step is I

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:02.970
think I'm going to click and we lost I

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.890
of the Lyle but we became dark Judas so

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:08.280
that's where we stopped using the

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:11.340
clicker because we hit oil and we really

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:16.050
got lucky to be in this situation about

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:18.750
being honest with you because we have

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.849
seven damage we lost our good item like

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:24.419
we lost I of Belial that we spent two HP

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:26.970
on however we have seven damage so we

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:28.800
don't need aya Belial anymore so I think

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.979
that might be our first seem and if I'm

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.330
going to toot my own horn a little bit

00:07:30.979 --> 00:07:34.440
so seem I don't think a whole heck of a

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.690
lot of people are going to get because

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.360
you'd have to be an idiot to even try

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:41.640
for it so you know sometimes who dares

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.340
wins should be rephrased sometimes into

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.740
you know sometimes the idiots prevail in

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:50.010
spite of themselves so lucky me I

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:51.810
suppose and we'll all that was just

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:55.020
God's right into the shot out of

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:57.060
impatience but it's okay we got a big

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:58.650
lead I would suggest right here

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:02.360
especially considering that you know the

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:06.450
loss of I of Belial is pretty bad

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:08.400
piercing shots is a great item but in

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.750
order to double our damage you know you

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.240
can't make an omelet without breaking a

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:15.030
few eggs probably so I think we should

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:17.220
be relatively happy

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.570
it may be overjoyed with the way that

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.800
this went I mean I suggested there were

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:20.439
a couple of characters I'd be interested

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.879
in

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:24.939
dark Jew just being one is asel being

00:08:21.879 --> 00:08:26.050
another I would take either we got in as

00:08:24.939 --> 00:08:29.349
asel that would have been fine as well

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:31.689
obviously but in fact Azazel might

00:08:29.349 --> 00:08:34.569
actually be better for the purposes of

00:08:31.689 --> 00:08:36.069
like surviving and killing enemies

00:08:34.569 --> 00:08:41.979
quickly except for the obvious like

00:08:36.069 --> 00:08:45.310
range problems but dark judas is also

00:08:41.979 --> 00:08:47.620
also up there at the very least just

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:49.540
keep yourself back here where I would

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.189
say on schedules which means I would

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.800
like to go a little faster just to keep

00:08:51.189 --> 00:08:57.389
ourselves you know as safe as possible

00:08:53.800 --> 00:09:00.009
I think Giga being is a terrible item

00:08:57.389 --> 00:09:01.990
it's even more terrible than items that

00:09:00.009 --> 00:09:05.230
are actually bad because it almost

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:06.550
convinces you that it's good if it's

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:10.689
almost like the opposite of like the

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:11.889
Krampus is head Scituate oh come on it's

00:09:10.689 --> 00:09:15.430
almost the opposite of the Krampus is

00:09:11.889 --> 00:09:17.019
head situation where you're like well no

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:20.199
it's exactly the same as the Krampus is

00:09:17.019 --> 00:09:21.879
head situation post change I wouldn't

00:09:20.199 --> 00:09:24.129
even say nerf necessarily of a post

00:09:21.879 --> 00:09:25.000
change where sometimes it rotates and

00:09:24.129 --> 00:09:27.100
sometimes it doesn't

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.600
it would just be twenty times more

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:33.370
valuable if you knew where the rocks

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.870
were going to go once every three rooms

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.399
to get a really potent you know beam

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:39.839
attack that takes up your space bar item

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:42.040
slot that seems relatively fair to me

00:09:39.839 --> 00:09:43.870
and this is where crack this guy can

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.009
show that it's actually better than I've

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:48.100
ever given it credit for and I

00:09:45.009 --> 00:09:51.370
appreciate that I am going to go I'm

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:53.860
going to go because I don't want to stay

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:56.019
here I don't want to find myself getting

00:09:53.860 --> 00:10:00.550
too far behind schedule basically crack

00:09:56.019 --> 00:10:02.439
this guy might be a good that's fine I

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:03.880
wanted to see if it was a demon judgment

00:10:02.439 --> 00:10:04.540
so we can easily gain access there but

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.490
this is okay

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:10.829
practice guy might be a decent boss rush

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:16.029
item as well I don't know this is uh

00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:17.649
it's not that bad little low on HP no

00:10:16.029 --> 00:10:20.069
question about that I mean the big

00:10:17.649 --> 00:10:23.829
problem right now

00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:24.899
basically hate that is that we find

00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:28.750
ourselves

00:10:24.899 --> 00:10:32.780
unaware of just how the heck

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:38.570
we're gonna beat the seam right now you

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:41.660
know this run goes to help this run goes

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:44.150
to mom we're going to finish with like

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:45.170
less than 20,000 points probably even

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:48.200
less than that but that's you know

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:50.210
secondary right now I am going to take

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:54.620
it this is why I'm stoked that we waited

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:56.240
a little bit longer because now we have

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.380
learned not waited and stoked that we

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:00.400
went a little bit faster than usual

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:03.050
because now we have time to take care of

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:08.810
stuff like this where we can actually

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:11.060
get a spirit hard for free that was

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:12.110
really lucky and we needed that spirit R

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:16.400
because the deal with the devil is not

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:19.460
doing us any favors so dare we roll the

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.930
dice twice you know I know when Yahtzee

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:24.910
you roll the dice three times but I'm

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.910
not sure I'm all about that lifestyle I

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:30.560
always thought that three times seemed a

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:32.360
little brazen to me once sure you know

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.010
live your life like there's no tomorrow

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.990
twice alright you know everyone needs a

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.880
second chance three times what do you

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:41.330
try to sell me on here Parker Brothers I

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:43.100
don't understand but the thing is we

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:45.380
don't really have an option we either

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:47.810
have holy water or data miner data miner

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:50.600
is bad but we could use it once and

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:52.280
possibly get lucky and and I don't want

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:56.470
to say win but you know we could beat

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:56.470
data miner if that makes sense

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:03.550
effectively we could get a good stat

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:05.870
increase without a bad stat decrease and

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:07.430
then that would be like we picked up a

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:11.030
weird like experimental pill or

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:14.900
something in there whereas holy water is

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:17.270
bad but can never actually actively hurt

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:20.060
us like data miner does so it's a tough

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:21.410
call a luck upgrade is nice although not

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:26.840
immediately useful and of course

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:29.810
brimstone is outrageously good we have

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:31.790
to take it but it does raise the

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:36.020
question of what the heck are we going

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:38.480
to do all you jerk I don't know if it's

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:41.550
worth that five cents yet does raise the

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:43.779
question of what we're going to do for

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:46.720
HP especially if we need to play a

00:12:43.779 --> 00:12:48.070
self-sacrifice room later well a good

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.899
opportunity we have dark bomb or

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:51.010
something like that but again I have a

00:12:49.899 --> 00:12:52.450
hard time believing that we haven't

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:54.579
played this run right we have brimstone

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.810
10.38 damage we're about two minutes

00:12:54.579 --> 00:12:58.529
ahead of schedule and I'm going to burn

00:12:55.810 --> 00:13:00.459
up a lot of that goodwill right here but

00:12:58.529 --> 00:13:01.570
look at the speed at which we're going

00:13:00.459 --> 00:13:04.269
through these enemies we've got to see

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:06.670
if this is a lucky shop it's not but

00:13:04.269 --> 00:13:08.649
it's not unlucky to fight greed here and

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:11.500
put us in a great spot for a shop on the

00:13:08.649 --> 00:13:12.790
next floor we also can play this

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:15.100
judgement and there's a good chance the

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:16.600
judgement will actually give us HP if he

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.880
doesn't give us HP could give us mapping

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.110
both of which could be useful I think we

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.610
might be fairly well equipped to perform

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:24.730
well today but we still got to find a

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:29.950
way to get past boss rush I don't think

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:34.060
that I don't think the clicker was the

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:37.120
way I mean it's fast ball said anybody's

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:40.600
use the road as around it is paved in

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:45.339
gold remember as much as that song as I

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:47.560
would like one of my friends in eighth

00:13:45.339 --> 00:13:49.209
grade we had to do like a lyric analysis

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:52.540
thing in English class or we picked a

00:13:49.209 --> 00:13:53.980
song that we liked and then we analyzed

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.779
the lyrics of one of my friends did the

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:58.420
road by fastball that was a great choice

00:13:55.779 --> 00:13:59.500
I did a song called Savior by the Red

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.959
Hot Chili Peppers that I didn't even

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:04.440
really like but I was like every other

00:14:01.959 --> 00:14:09.880
song on Californication is about

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:11.800
fingering someone so you know I chose

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.269
the little deeper cuts like track eleven

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.339
didn't make it on the radio

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:16.570
highly regretful what a wasted the

00:14:15.339 --> 00:14:19.089
assignment on the other hand I had

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:20.920
another classmate that did an analysis

00:14:19.089 --> 00:14:22.630
of the song come on over baby by

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:25.269
Christina Aguilera which is just a song

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:27.370
that's basically like hey babe come over

00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:30.540
I can't my parents aren't home and then

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:32.620
a gift of a rally car going over a hill

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:35.029
if you know what I mean

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:38.399
well

00:14:35.029 --> 00:14:41.190
what should I say here you know Zayn

00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:43.290
eNOS has served me well on today's I

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:44.459
mean I guess we'll take US has served me

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:47.370
well on today's run

00:14:44.459 --> 00:14:50.970
maybe we should mine for data just once

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:53.939
just one time we got a luck downgrade

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:55.279
for a shot speed Oh we can still take

00:14:53.939 --> 00:14:57.569
this

00:14:55.279 --> 00:14:59.009
I'm not going to roll data miner long

00:14:57.569 --> 00:15:01.439
term cuz that's stupid

00:14:59.009 --> 00:15:04.829
basically we picked up holy mantle and a

00:15:01.439 --> 00:15:08.550
lockdown so be it that's not bad really

00:15:04.829 --> 00:15:13.019
a lockdown is obviously worse than holy

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:15.089
mantle is good but by the way this value

00:15:13.019 --> 00:15:19.129
proposition here might be bad our only

00:15:15.089 --> 00:15:22.139
bomb for a nickel but I did it anyway

00:15:19.129 --> 00:15:24.750
hoping that we can you know use that

00:15:22.139 --> 00:15:26.149
nickel to help us disproportionately as

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:29.069
well

00:15:26.149 --> 00:15:32.160
mystery sack could potentially be an

00:15:29.069 --> 00:15:34.139
item that pulls us out of the darkness

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.360
here I mean we're not in it's one of

00:15:34.139 --> 00:15:38.279
those things where I've got to clarify

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:40.170
it's only the fact that we're on a daily

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:44.939
that makes this run sort of questionable

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:49.560
right now if this run just went we would

00:15:44.939 --> 00:15:51.660
be fine because we would easily be able

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:53.850
to win I mean two HP is still a little

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:56.519
dicey but probably it would be

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:58.410
relatively easy for us to win now you're

00:15:56.519 --> 00:16:00.180
not going to like this decision too much

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:01.680
I think but I'm going to choose not to

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:03.630
take Samson's chain because it's too

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:06.930
much of a liability around mushrooms and

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:09.779
it's with a heavy heart that I say that

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:12.380
because cracking skulls could give us

00:16:09.779 --> 00:16:18.509
the tools that we need to survive on

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:22.529
this run like every single one of those

00:16:18.509 --> 00:16:25.439
skulls could have an a waz room it could

00:16:22.529 --> 00:16:27.240
have a teleportation card that allows us

00:16:25.439 --> 00:16:29.519
to get to a self sacrifice room or

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.829
something like that after boss rush you

00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:34.199
know you see my conundrum here but right

00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:37.500
now our HP is not in a place where we

00:16:34.199 --> 00:16:41.699
can justify doing it that's the simple

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:45.220
long and short of it really bad use of

00:16:41.699 --> 00:16:49.240
that by the way getting hit by that bomb

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:50.740
is basically catastrophic we now have

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:57.460
one spirit hard left

00:16:50.740 --> 00:17:01.800
I think the eternal heart is nice if we

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:04.780
survive the eternal heart is nice and

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:06.459
the bomb was just honestly a failure in

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:09.490
terms of positioning so a speed upgrades

00:17:06.459 --> 00:17:12.300
good a health upgrade is also good now

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:15.640
we go back to the red hearts so really

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:19.180
we have beaten the odds ridiculously

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:20.949
with that HP upgrade right there the

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:23.980
eternal heart you know is nice it's not

00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:25.390
not nice but it didn't help us

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:27.130
immediately and the health upgrade on

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:29.410
the other hand was a huge get for us so

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:33.880
we will take the quarter and this runs

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:35.410
kind of starting to pop off now with 48

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:39.150
cents I am hoping that at some point we

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:39.150
give the ability to use that for good

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:44.440
don't want to just fight grieves

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:45.760
endlessly in every single shop but not

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.740
that I'm complaining for now things have

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.990
been pretty solid mystery sack also came

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:54.280
through in the clutch I think I'm just

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:56.980
going to go and that went very well as

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:59.740
well okay we do have HP we have we have

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:04.540
one HP in an eternal heart i told me we

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:09.250
should take that just yet sure we could

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:12.250
become guppy here's how you do this you

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:14.950
take up these collar then you take the

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:16.330
mark which gives you HP back which also

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:18.370
gave us Leviathan I wasn't even thinking

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:19.900
about that but then you take magic mush

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:22.630
which also gives you a stat upgrade so

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:23.860
this is like a way for me to kind of get

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:25.630
a little bit of everything

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:27.430
guppies collar is unlikely to be too

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:28.810
useful oh we had we had more HP than I

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:32.110
thought oh no that's because the HP

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:33.310
matured right there we have more HP now

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:34.690
than I thought we would I thought we'd

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:40.540
have one read hard on one spear at heart

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:43.150
but and this is I imagine we got a date

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:44.200
tech X obviously this is I imagine what

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:46.030
happened to a lot of people on today's

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:49.270
run you're now sitting in a position

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:51.870
where the run is so good are we going to

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.870
get trapped

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:59.620
on boss rush if we're going to get

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:01.690
trapped on boss rush maybe it's better

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:03.430
to just play the self-sacrifice room

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:05.020
instead of going but we should really

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:06.190
look for a teleport card because if we

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:08.590
can do both

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:10.660
you know life is going to be pretty

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:12.940
sweet for us not dead

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:15.370
it's portable slot or the jar give us

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:16.990
what we need I don't believe so so yeah

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:19.870
we're very lucky cuz we get a lot of

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:22.930
time if a teleport card exists on this

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:24.700
floor I should really look for it tears

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:29.590
upgrade is wonderful I mean especially

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:31.720
considering we have a brimstone the fact

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:35.550
that our tears upgrade is now taking us

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:35.550
down to an eight rate of fire is awesome

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:40.750
got to go to the cursed room may if

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:46.690
there's a guppy item I will be slightly

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:49.330
regretful but there is and the thing is

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:52.030
our HP at present does not allow us to

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:55.600
play the self-sacrifice room either so

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:59.830
oh we could have been Gumby but does

00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:02.260
that really matter in a situation in

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:05.790
which the run will probably end right

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:08.830
now anyway we can't think like that

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:13.480
unfortunately so what's the game plan

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:14.860
now well straight up I think you play

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:22.890
this thing a lot you're trying to get

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:22.890
bombs the keys for money is fine but

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:28.090
we're trying to get bombs and teleport

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:33.760
cards we only have the opportunity at

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:36.720
the present moment to blow up like a

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.720
couple of skulls

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:53.150
well there is another place we get

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:55.160
payouts from what's the pill you can't

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:58.580
rely on that being tell appeals we get

00:20:55.160 --> 00:21:03.100
payouts from mystery sack on the boss

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:09.020
fight or on boss rush I should say

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:10.280
changes things ever so slightly alright

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:13.310
I think you've done enough here what

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:14.960
makes you small is okay we're still

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:17.750
easily going to be able to make it to

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:21.410
the boss fight you got to check this

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:23.270
just in case because we might end up

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:25.280
again playing self sacrifice room which

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:30.620
throws this whole thing into question

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:33.620
here there's no great opportunities to

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:35.390
place bombs and get multiple skulls so

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:40.970
straight up we're just going to take the

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:45.350
ones that are available to us we already

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:47.180
bought our tarot card from the from the

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:50.600
shop we should kill mom in like no time

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:53.750
flat that's no concern you could go

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:55.220
broke anak and I mean at this point I

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:56.840
think we straight up just have to try

00:21:55.220 --> 00:22:01.670
this but and we're looking for a

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:04.160
teleport card primarily take the

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:08.750
polaroid use a bomb here because we may

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:10.220
need that demon heart in order to play

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:13.250
the self-sacrifice room eggheads good

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:14.690
black holes good not good enough though

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:17.240
I'd say you got to go egghead here for

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:19.780
thee which is actually conehead but

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.780
forgive me

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.570
so you should pretty easily be able to

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:27.940
figure out what the game plan is here

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:29.049
we're trying to get as many mystery sack

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:33.730
payouts as we can

00:22:29.049 --> 00:22:36.700
I think mystery sack just paid out with

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:39.340
a penny if we don't get it we don't get

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.870
it and maybe we but you've got a to some

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:44.640
extent put yourself in my shoes on this

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:46.870
one if we played the self-sacrifice room

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.490
first up there's no way of me knowing

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:49.960
that that's the only way for us to get

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:51.460
off of this floor if it ends up being

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:53.230
the second best way for us to get off of

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:55.570
this floor that's pretty bad but

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:58.059
secondly it didn't look like we

00:22:55.570 --> 00:23:02.710
necessarily had the HP to make it a

00:22:58.059 --> 00:23:05.380
guaranteed to work regardless maybe we

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:07.750
mean this is a long shot maybe we could

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:09.940
use black hole to open the boss door on

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:12.940
the mom room and it would have been my

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:15.100
mistake for not doing that I would be

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:18.690
bummed if that were the case but I'm not

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:20.770
necessarily saying it's impossible

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:22.210
yeah our game plan right now it's

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:24.730
finished this hopefully teleport out a

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:26.230
boss rush if we get out of boss rush

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:31.630
will play the self-sacrifice room and

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:36.880
hopefully live and if we don't we don't

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:39.040
but there is a chance as low as as I am

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:41.049
to admit it there is a chance that the

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:43.240
right play was actually to take Samson's

00:23:41.049 --> 00:23:47.260
chain and crush every single skull we

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:48.940
came across and that's what makes it

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:52.679
daily a daily fortunately or

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:54.760
unfortunately we got marked which is I

00:23:52.679 --> 00:23:57.549
mean I don't even know how that works

00:23:54.760 --> 00:24:00.100
with this assuming yeah just a really

00:23:57.549 --> 00:24:03.640
really nice tears upgrade but weird

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:06.850
we're traps we got no way out dude

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:08.559
that's a super bummer what that means to

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:10.059
me though is that the seam is probably

00:24:08.559 --> 00:24:14.020
pretty tough to get so let's see what

00:24:10.059 --> 00:24:17.320
our score is today hides the weed number

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:19.150
um yeah that sucks I guess I I missed

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:21.580
the seam that was relatively obvious for

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:23.380
now sorry for the short episode but I'm

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:25.000
