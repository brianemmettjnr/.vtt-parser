00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.470
hey everybody welcome back northernlion

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.760
afterbirth sluts

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.610
slowly but surely may be filling in this

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.349
post-it note that's the dream anyway

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.299
Eden is the last of the characters we

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.310
have an unlocked at the present moment

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.189
that we need to get something done with

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.510
and oh my god we started some things

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.970
never change why is that aw bad it's

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.040
almost like vac but not quite we're

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.630
starting with brimstone nothing else

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.329
really stands out to me but nothing else

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.399
has to stand out it's well you know what

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.290
actually that's not fair it's actually

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.079
brimstone with a pretty good rate of

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.600
fire as well like it's taking half a

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.050
second or so to charge up our brimstone

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.000
shot to maximum so actually probably

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.860
well above average you had we had the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.260
longest Larry jr. on the last run now we

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.180
got the shortest Larry jr. all we need

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.320
is a Larry jr. that always lies in ER

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:05.309
Larry jr. that always tells the truth

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:10.590
obviously I'm about 0% excited to have

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.090
breath of life but we'll find a way

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.010
perhaps to get rid of that at some point

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.869
in future and at least you know we have

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.030
gotten breath of life I'm not going to

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.320
say that there's a good chance that this

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.850
is going to be the last item we would

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.380
ever be able to pick up in the game you

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.150
know what I'm like I don't think there's

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.770
a good chance that this would be the one

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.619
that would give us real platinum God or

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.820
a million in 1% or whatever but now we

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.799
don't even have to worry about it it's

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.150
an item that could conceivably have that

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.939
fate attached to it because I would

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:41.159
almost never willfully pick it up and

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:43.680
keep it at least but two clubs yeah I'll

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.409
go up to 14 bombs I think 14 bombs early

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.060
is very very nice you know you can only

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.240
save the two of clubs maybe get more

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.350
value later but I don't think it's

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.420
necessarily super prudent to our

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.909
existing situation and finally our pill

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.590
is one makes you larger which I mean

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.340
wait our hairstyle flips there did you

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.290
see that we had like tornado hair where

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.610
it's the guy from the blondie righted

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:15.290
Dagwood that's it I got confused

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:18.800
because the star of the blondie comics

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.080
is blondie but actually his Dagwood you

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.030
know he's the one making the big

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.350
sandwiches that are you know not even

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:30.170
plausibly Blondie's just sort of they're

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.820
that sounds like it's been a long time

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.340
that red blondie okay I'm not trying to

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.170
accidentally be misogynist here my

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.120
impression of the blondie comic strip

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.830
from all the rich lore that I was able

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.500
to glean from it as a child was that

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.390
Dagwood he always wants to relax he's

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.460
always like oh I just got my hard day at

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.790
the insurance Factory so he makes like a

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.490
big sandwich and then when he goes down

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.940
to eat like sits down to eat Marmaduke

00:02:52.490 --> 00:03:00.010
just eats his whole sandwich our

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:02.350
Marmaduke and blondie the same comic

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.560
blondie

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:10.100
it's a American comic strip

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.370
it ran oh my god it started in 1930

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.590
that's absurd that explains his haircut

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.730
is there really no Marmaduke in blondie

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.040
those are two different things

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.830
running gags give me the sandwich

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.750
Dagwood sandwich I said Dan speaking my

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.470
language

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:31.370
he just meant give me a leg it would

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:34.360
sandwich anyway they're not a dog cookie

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:38.239
Bumstead what the heck is going on here

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:42.950
all right dude I haven't read a

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:45.110
newspaper comic page in probably like 20

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:49.970
years that's absurd

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:53.030
I really in a way I admire newspaper

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.220
comics because it's the most

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.940
constricting form of comedy media I

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:03.380
could possibly imagine you have four

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.720
frames to set up a punchline get people

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.640
to sit like set up a joke get people to

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.090
believe in your world and then also

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.340
deliver on the punchline like no word in

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.440
those four panels can be wasted and yet

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.269
you know so many of them turn out turn

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.640
out to be kind of garbage right I'm not

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.739
trying to be rude there's some classics

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.739
you know I grew up reading peanuts

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:33.580
trying to think of well Family Circus is

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:37.210
just solitude I fell on my mom Family

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.220
Circus number 1199 there and I don't

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.470
begrudge them because it to some extent

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.210
it's a self caricature there have been

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.460
isaac episodes that have just been like

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.020
you know caricatures of myself almost i

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.210
try to bring my a-game but you know

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.890
sometimes you just have you finish an

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.200
isaac episode you go i didn't talk about

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.270
anything in that i hope that it was

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.390
entertaining on some level but i didn't

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.710
talk about freaking anything

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.180
we saved nine lives by the way cuz we

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.650
might as well take it laughs just in

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.800
case we had a huge deal there or

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.900
something like Abaddon for example um

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.190
but anyway i digress

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.240
what item is back here that I did not

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:15.160
take that's not that's just the look of

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.020
the item what item is here that I didn't

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.450
take nine live that's right now we can

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:23.140
go in here and crack this open NL are

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:24.940
you feeling ok there was actually the

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:29.680
worst television program I have ever

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:33.669
seen was the family's well I don't know

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:36.310
there is one show I saw an MTV a long

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:38.979
time ago called yo mama where it was

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:42.400
really just an insult staged insult

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:44.560
battle between two made up posses 2004

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.700
was like a weird time dude you got

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:51.300
served was popular so everybody was like

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:54.490
well kung fu fighting obviously but like

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.140
insult rap battles and dance battles

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.640
were like I'm not going to say that they

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.580
were a thing but they were part of the

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.110
public consciousness briefly it was very

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:06.850
strange to be growing up in that in that

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:10.900
time period but anyway what was I saying

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:13.330
I digress regardless there was a cartoon

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:17.050
version of Family Circus that aired on

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:19.660
TV and it was always on before my

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:24.850
so-called life my so-called life was

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:28.660
like 11:55 to 1225 Family Circus was

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:31.240
like 11:40 to 11:55 and accidentally

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:34.220
tuning into Family Circus for like even

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.230
10 seconds was the low light of my week

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.090
I didn't watch my so-called life when it

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.310
aired a Terran like 1995 or something

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:45.530
but I watched it you know during its

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:47.450
rerun just before I think it started

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:51.440
hitting that level of like everybody

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:54.040
should watch this Jordan Catalano of

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.410
course I was ruined from Brian Krakow

00:06:54.040 --> 00:07:01.270
how could I not

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:04.490
he had the white 15 year old afro that

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:06.020
everybody's best friend had Maya well

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:10.430
maybe not my best friend but definitely

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:12.320
one of my friends had a curly sort of

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.360
pseudo afro thing going on like what was

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.090
the guy's name for my school musical he

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:21.860
had that but with like brown - blonde -

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:24.770
hairs again blender years not that I was

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:27.010
killing it to a larger degree like hey I

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.940
like to always turn the gaze of

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.290
criticism inward so you know that I'm

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.500
not just laughing at other people I can

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:35.000
laugh at myself in ninth grade I have

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:38.510
not been bald forever that should be

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.770
clear close to forever I noticed I was

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:42.980
balding for the first time when I was

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:44.450
like 17 which is why when I you know

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.180
sometimes I see posts on the Internet

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:49.310
where they're like oh my god I'm 24 and

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:51.500
I noticed a little hair loss in the

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.150
shower what do I do and I'm absent

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.040
bethey for you because I've been through

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:57.919
it but I also went through it like you

00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:00.169
know my senior year of high school so

00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:01.729
you'll figure it out you know I have

00:08:00.169 --> 00:08:05.620
confidence that you're dealing it with

00:08:01.729 --> 00:08:07.880
the tools of an adult you'll you'll

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.950
solve the problem I have the utmost

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.380
faith anyway

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:14.450
but any of you in ninth grade full head

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:17.350
of hair relatively probably not but like

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:20.150
pretty full at least unnoticeably

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:24.169
thinning grafts this is irrelevant the

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:26.410
situation but I bought hair gel that was

00:08:24.169 --> 00:08:29.840
also like paint

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:33.200
sort of so it was like colored hair gel

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:37.070
basically and I put I used it to put two

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:39.530
white lines and my temples as if I was

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:41.719
like you know a man in his late 30s just

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:43.039
starting to go gray it's one of those

00:08:41.719 --> 00:08:46.610
things where like you think it's going

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:48.290
to be cool I mean I was also like 13

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.730
I do give myself a little bit of slack

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:52.040
in this compartment this is obviously a

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.510
hindsight not at all cool but at the

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.250
time I was like this is going to be cool

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:57.019
what a bold fashion statement

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.850
and then I went to school and like as

00:08:57.019 --> 00:09:00.620
soon as I got on the bus why not take it

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.269
here as soon as I got on the bus

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:05.660
somebody was like what the heck's wrong

00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:08.089
with your hair and I was like oh it was

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:13.100
going to be a long day and it was a long

00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:14.750
day so once I got home I showered and

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:17.570
then I never did that again because that

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:21.170
was stupid but see like we all make

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:24.140
decisions like that in our many of us at

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:26.769
least make decisions like that in our in

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:29.089
our youth well even like middle school

00:09:26.769 --> 00:09:32.089
you know what the most popular piece of

00:09:29.089 --> 00:09:34.940
clothing was for like the the girls in

00:09:32.089 --> 00:09:39.620
our class was a shirt that had the Spice

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:41.360
Girls but they were mice and it said you

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:46.519
guessed it mice girls

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:48.140
I don't want anything there all we

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:49.820
should bond our way into the shop and

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.620
then probably gotten the key Ganzi item

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.420
oh that's that's bad form on my part

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:55.670
there but that's okay

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.740
I mean when you're like you know 11 or

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:59.149
12 it's not that big of a deal but I

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:01.930
think you'll look back at that and go

00:09:59.149 --> 00:10:06.740
mice girls real cute

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:08.870
I'll as late as like 11th grade I would

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:10.940
sometimes wear a long sleeve shirt and

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:12.560
then a t-shirt on top of it instead of

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.589
the other way around

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:19.100
and I have to say in a hindsight not

00:10:15.589 --> 00:10:21.019
cool at the time a little cool that

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.970
people were doing that you know so you'd

00:10:21.019 --> 00:10:27.230
have like a t-shirt and then your

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:28.279
sleeves would be a different color you

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:30.920
don't understand because you're looking

00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:34.579
back on it with the eyes from the future

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:36.620
you know you're going that stupid and I

00:10:34.579 --> 00:10:38.660
agree with you but at the time I'm not

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:42.670
saying it was a good look but it wasn't

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:46.790
a horrible look and I'll stand by that

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:48.140
the the hair gel that also made me look

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:50.600
like I was 30 years older than I

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:53.290
actually was not a smart idea I'll level

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.290
with you on that one

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:59.500
we should donate and also buy a key so

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.500
save five cents

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.160
as far as I'm concerned if you don't

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:06.220
have a story like that you haven't

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:08.260
really lived you know I'm trying to

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:10.810
think of some other examples I had a

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:13.240
friend and I don't know this might still

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:16.300
be something that's done but I had a

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:18.010
friend who had you know these sweaters

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:20.260
or sweatshirts that were like longer

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:22.180
than his arms and he would cut holes

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:26.020
where the thumbs were so he could put

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:28.510
his thumbs through the through the hole

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:30.100
and wear it like a shirt glove I don't

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:31.930
even know how to describe it really and

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.120
you're going to say like wow NL you

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:37.750
really hung out with like some losers

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:40.840
right well this this guy was actually

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:44.260
like pretty normal

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:46.210
land is a popular necessarily prising ly

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:48.220
not that clean to be honest with you

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:52.440
like everybody was relatively accepted

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:55.930
but like he had friends and a girlfriend

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:58.120
it was a pretty normal situation I'll

00:11:55.930 --> 00:12:03.670
consider No Deal that hurts me deep in

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:05.650
my soul and everybody used to do the

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:08.110
hair flip the boy band hair flip it's

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:09.220
true and at the time we were laughing in

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:14.170
pictures of our parents from like the

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:18.040
1980s who uses hairspray all you need to

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:21.340
know about my generation is that we made

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:23.830
Carmen Electra famous for workout videos

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:25.750
where she teaches you how to stream that

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:31.130
was our generation the Paris Hilton

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:32.870
generation the sextape generation

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:36.460
not that there's anything wrong with

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:36.460
that and we're working it out you know

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:43.700
we're growing up figuring out life in

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:46.610
the world now without colored hair gel

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:51.050
and Paris Hilton to guide us into how to

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:52.520
be a talentless garbage fire look no

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:54.560
disrespect meant to Paris

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:56.750
the stars are blind is you know and

00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:00.050
three out of ten songs I didn't say one

00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:01.900
out of ten it has some merit some talent

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:04.010
was involved in the production of that

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.800
somewhere along the line I don't know

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:11.330
maybe the CD was just manufactured well

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:13.130
but it's a start I always bring this up

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.690
as I want you to if you're younger if

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.550
you're on the younger generation side of

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:18.230
things I don't want you to be bossed

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:21.320
around by our generations it'll happen

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:23.180
eventually you know first I was raised

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:26.030
by the post baby boomers you know the

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:28.130
echo generation they were the people

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:30.800
printing out the participation trophies

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:32.720
for us at every sporting event you'd be

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.120
like only came fifth place in the

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.670
baseball tournament owner oh no no no no

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:41.870
no you weren't fifth place you were seed

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:45.640
champions this is the truth and in the

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:49.280
baseball league that I was in growing up

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:51.830
it was there were six teams you could be

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:54.500
a 1st place with a champs 2nd place with

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:57.190
a runners-up third place B champs

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:59.720
you won the B championship it means like

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.980
very weird way to set things up I don't

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.630
know why they did it like that except

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:05.150
that you know you got a trophy at the

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:06.830
end I feel a little bit betrayed my

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:08.360
parents generation was the one paying

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:09.470
for the trophies printing them out and

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.990
making sure that everybody got a trophy

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:13.340
and then now they're like you know all

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:15.260
these Millennials do you win a

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:17.540
participation trophy with that I didn't

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:19.160
shoot I just wanted to play baseball get

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:22.030
outside I didn't care if we believed got

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:24.740
a trophy guy he's all these weird little

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:26.270
crappy baseball bats with like a small

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:29.930
plaque on them that says like you know

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:32.900
see runners-up it's the grave memory of

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:34.700
the time when I came sixth place in our

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:36.500
baseball tournament that had six teams

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:38.960
in the league got to make sure we

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:41.330
commemorate it

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:42.290
that's that's what you know it's like

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.270
we're getting stabbed in the back

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:45.800
eventually I'm going to turn I'm going

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:47.120
to have my hail Hydra moment where I'm

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.220
going to be like Oh kids these days

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:51.110
always sudden each other you know nude

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:54.620
photos okay it's maybe not the best

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:58.040
example for a nuanced conversation but

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:59.300
you know what I mean like yeah this is

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.070
way better I didn't shouldn't have even

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:04.010
had to think about it there will be a

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:06.620
moment where I will and I actively at

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:08.839
least in my age which is so relatively

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:10.820
young I fight back against being out of

00:15:08.839 --> 00:15:12.880
touch except for comedic effects in

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:15.500
these videos and on the show I try to

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.580
you know stay relatively current I'll be

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.980
honest with you I don't understand

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:21.620
Instagram I've talked about this a few

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:23.240
times but I don't I don't really get it

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:24.800
I don't want to look at photos that much

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.470
I want to read words but if you like

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.520
Instagram I keep myself with a I at

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:31.420
least know what it's called I don't go

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:33.800
you know insta app or whatever you know

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:38.300
but one day I'll be like oh yeah you

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:40.279
know these young Millennials here's my

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:42.649
impression of a young millennial I can't

00:15:40.279 --> 00:15:45.080
do anything but sell my cell phone and

00:15:42.649 --> 00:15:46.970
then you know as soon as I do that

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:49.459
you've got to remind me of all the

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:52.279
stupid stuff my generation did we

00:15:49.459 --> 00:15:53.600
invented Healy's Keeley's are not cool I

00:15:52.279 --> 00:15:56.089
see people on the internet saying

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.940
Healy's are cool don't buy Healy's I'm

00:15:56.089 --> 00:16:00.560
looking out for your future you know

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:03.470
chances of having intercourse don't buy

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:05.600
Healy's unless you're shooting like a

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:07.970
viral video you don't need shoes to turn

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:11.390
into rollerskates that's an idea

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:14.360
invented by either an eight-year-old or

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:16.820
Rob and as much as I love him I would

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:18.589
never give him financing out of my

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:21.140
pocket for a business idea that he comes

00:16:18.589 --> 00:16:26.089
up with like that it's just the economic

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:28.850
suicide cell phone radio suus way is of

00:16:26.089 --> 00:16:33.829
course going to say there okay good good

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:34.940
pickups there Chris kind of sounds so we

00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:36.770
can still have a good chance to make

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:41.149
boss rush this it is our sixth floor

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:42.890
we're actually cruising here I don't

00:16:41.149 --> 00:16:44.209
know maybe maybe healings are cool maybe

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:45.770
you shouldn't be taking advice on what's

00:16:44.209 --> 00:16:46.930
cool from the guy who gave himself Reed

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:49.490
Richards hair

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:51.680
you know a month in the ninth grade I

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:54.590
also remember I got a lot of

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:57.530
cringe-worthy memories from my from my

00:16:54.590 --> 00:17:00.710
early high school years just trying too

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:03.140
hard remember in my computer technology

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:05.240
class in ninth grade which basically

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:06.650
boiled down to play flash games and you

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.850
know occasionally a future would be like

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:12.589
here's how you do a Google image search

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:17.990
again weird era Google was like 5 years

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:19.490
old at this time anyway I we had to do

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:20.750
this survey for our teacher our teacher

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:22.610
was like I don't want to know more about

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:23.780
you guys because you know you're just

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:25.220
coming into high school for the first

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.689
time so why don't you do this survey and

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:28.640
tell me a little bit about yourself and

00:17:26.689 --> 00:17:31.640
I remember vividly that one of the

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:34.010
questions was I like to read about blank

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:37.730
really just a nice way of asking a

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:40.340
question about like what you're

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:42.250
interested in and I wrote and I it pains

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:46.250
me to even bring this up it's still raw

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:48.560
you know 15 years later I wrote I like

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:54.860
reading about the human condition

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:57.200
who doesn't what a just terrible answer

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:59.000
to that question first off I have no

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:02.300
idea what reading about the human

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.250
condition meant I clearly had just they

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:06.020
heard someone else say it and was like

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:09.730
that person sounds smart I want to be

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:13.010
like them I want to impress my teacher

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:14.210
Leonard up in Cairo you know not my

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:18.700
favorite person on the planet Earth

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:22.190
anyway but I digress just a smarmy

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:25.100
crappy answer to put there but I'll load

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:28.120
up to it you know we can all laugh about

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.120
this stuff

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:35.020
I grew out of that phase thankfully not

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:36.250
everybody has you see it on you know I

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:39.190
am very smart

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:44.289
our / I am very smart you know the wrong

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:45.429
generation etc etc you've had that chest

00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:46.630
before but don't remember what it is but

00:18:45.429 --> 00:18:49.330
with ten cents we're going to try to hit

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:54.820
150 here let's be closing in on another

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:57.970
shop upgrade maybe candles appeared in

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:59.470
the basements a good item we got so much

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:03.669
time here if we want to live through

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:06.850
boss rush though we got to we got to

00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:08.289
pick up some HP in the process here I'm

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:10.270
still holding out hope this is our tenth

00:19:08.289 --> 00:19:13.870
run to kill mom's hard-on as well and

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:17.919
unlock more progress I mean ah why'd you

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:20.530
why'd you pick it up there's just no

00:19:17.919 --> 00:19:22.900
reason to pick it up is the thing what

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:26.740
there is a reason to do is we get one of

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:29.230
them blow yourself up respawn in the

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:31.480
devil room grab this one yeah see that's

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:32.740
like we redeemed ourselves slightly but

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:36.789
we did lose a black card we had no

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:39.549
reason to lose that's the that's the

00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:42.130
last really embarrassing high school

00:19:39.549 --> 00:19:44.429
story that I can think of they were all

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:50.620
like ninth grade which i think is

00:19:44.429 --> 00:19:53.230
acceptable you know you're young it's a

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:55.929
big leap from going to middle school to

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:58.510
high school especially because you know

00:19:55.929 --> 00:19:59.500
my school was so small my elementary

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:01.510
school is so small I went from

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:04.179
kindergarten to eighth grade you spent

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:06.820
10 years in this school and you graduate

00:20:04.179 --> 00:20:10.240
as top dog and then you go to a school

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:12.789
where you know you're a little puny you

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:14.470
know nothing again you're watching this

00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:15.789
in your Nathe grade first of this very

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:17.830
precocious of you don't make the same

00:20:15.789 --> 00:20:19.390
mistakes I made don't say I love reading

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:24.010
about the human condition who doesn't

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:24.940
make you an idiot come on come on I know

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:25.960
you got some performing here we

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:30.400
shouldn't have done this we shouldn't

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:32.530
have done this but let's go it's not

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:34.630
that good you're going to be fine

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:36.839
everybody's gone through your make it

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:40.929
out okay don't sweat it

00:20:36.839 --> 00:20:44.009
I'm very lucky I think I'm the only

00:20:40.929 --> 00:20:47.080
person out of the round table crew who

00:20:44.009 --> 00:20:49.029
had like a good high school experience

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.679
I'm not bragging I'm just saying my high

00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:57.039
school experience was pretty okay

00:20:50.679 --> 00:20:59.769
I studied decently hard I had an okay

00:20:57.039 --> 00:21:01.869
social life and things were not all

00:20:59.769 --> 00:21:03.190
together that bad are you restricted

00:21:01.869 --> 00:21:05.409
yeah you don't have a whole lot of

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:07.509
freedom compared to where your n is an

00:21:05.409 --> 00:21:09.070
adult but in its own way that's kind of

00:21:07.509 --> 00:21:15.309
nice sometimes anyway else we got a

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:16.749
focus here please stomp this anyway not

00:21:15.309 --> 00:21:18.369
everybody has that same experience but

00:21:16.749 --> 00:21:19.719
if you're saving the same for college if

00:21:18.369 --> 00:21:21.369
you're getting ready to go in that the

00:21:19.719 --> 00:21:22.839
Department right now you're going to be

00:21:21.369 --> 00:21:24.099
fine you're going to figure it out or

00:21:22.839 --> 00:21:25.749
you're not and then you're still going

00:21:24.099 --> 00:21:27.089
to be fine in the end are you going to

00:21:25.749 --> 00:21:29.440
convince yourself that you're fine

00:21:27.089 --> 00:21:32.349
either way it's going to work out for

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:33.639
you most of the time except for the

00:21:32.349 --> 00:21:38.859
people that it does see I'm not really

00:21:33.639 --> 00:21:40.509
good the cool comforting thing people

00:21:38.859 --> 00:21:44.109
learn pretty quickly to stop coming to

00:21:40.509 --> 00:21:47.440
me in their time of need I feel bad

00:21:44.109 --> 00:21:50.529
because I might surprise you but oh this

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:54.070
is pretty good I genuinely have sympathy

00:21:50.529 --> 00:21:56.039
for people I'm not going to say on like

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:57.999
a deep level like when I see like a

00:21:56.039 --> 00:22:00.039
person that's like hey can I have a ham

00:21:57.999 --> 00:22:01.599
sandwich and then the deli is like where

00:22:00.039 --> 00:22:05.229
are the ham sandwiches I don't like

00:22:01.599 --> 00:22:07.719
start to cry but you know I do feel I

00:22:05.229 --> 00:22:11.309
feel empathy I guess is the is the word

00:22:07.719 --> 00:22:13.690
but then when people like feel bad and

00:22:11.309 --> 00:22:17.049
have talked to me in the past I'm just

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:19.059
no good at giving comfort I'm too I'm a

00:22:17.049 --> 00:22:22.419
robot basically is what it comes down to

00:22:19.059 --> 00:22:25.989
to some degree I'm a hyper literal and

00:22:22.419 --> 00:22:29.979
I'm solutions oriented ooh talk dirty

00:22:25.989 --> 00:22:33.849
more to me baby please but it's at least

00:22:29.979 --> 00:22:35.889
sincere like in my head I'm like someone

00:22:33.849 --> 00:22:39.249
feels bad find the way to make them feel

00:22:35.889 --> 00:22:41.139
good know maybe you should you know just

00:22:39.249 --> 00:22:43.679
relax that's not going to help okay well

00:22:41.139 --> 00:22:43.679
I'm out of ideas

00:22:47.309 --> 00:22:51.490
maybe I'm good at distracting people

00:22:49.809 --> 00:22:54.190
from their problems see that's kind of

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:56.049
like I'm a professional at that in my in

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:58.630
my youtube and twitch line that's maybe

00:22:56.049 --> 00:23:00.159
that's where I belong here by the way

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.870
we're going to do boss rush and we're

00:23:00.159 --> 00:23:04.690
probably going to live but the run has

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:06.909
become kind of a garbage fire I didn't

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:08.080
keep the stat change due to experimental

00:23:06.909 --> 00:23:09.429
treatment but I'm going to go out on a

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.730
limb and suggest that it was kind of

00:23:09.429 --> 00:23:11.730
horrible

00:23:17.299 --> 00:23:21.479
I'm always in these people that can

00:23:20.099 --> 00:23:24.539
comfort other people because I think

00:23:21.479 --> 00:23:26.639
it's a good skill to be able to you know

00:23:24.539 --> 00:23:28.470
act as a solve emotionally to other

00:23:26.639 --> 00:23:30.210
people who said is something I'm a

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:31.830
little envious of I never I never found

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:34.590
that skill myself personally at least

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:35.639
not on an intentional level if you're

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:37.169
watching this for any kind of

00:23:35.639 --> 00:23:41.489
therapeutic level and I'm very

00:23:37.169 --> 00:23:43.679
appreciative of that honestly I don't

00:23:41.489 --> 00:23:45.599
possess that skill on a one-to-one level

00:23:43.679 --> 00:23:49.409
cuz I always feel like I would be lying

00:23:45.599 --> 00:23:51.450
to people you know if you're like oh I

00:23:49.409 --> 00:23:53.489
think I'm gonna fail chemistry my first

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:55.049
inclination is like that sucks

00:23:53.489 --> 00:23:56.820
are you okay they're like I don't know

00:23:55.049 --> 00:23:58.739
when I'm like well you can always take

00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:00.090
it again and just study harder that's

00:23:58.739 --> 00:24:01.769
not what anybody wants to hear in the

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:04.409
moment that's like a very I know like

00:24:01.769 --> 00:24:06.599
it's tough oh wow what an incredible I

00:24:04.409 --> 00:24:08.999
got too much Larry David in me I think

00:24:06.599 --> 00:24:10.979
you know if you didn't want to say oh

00:24:08.999 --> 00:24:16.919
you should have studied more it's not

00:24:10.979 --> 00:24:20.070
really helpful in the moment I think

00:24:16.919 --> 00:24:23.429
it's the only child thing I grew up my

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:25.289
parents were stable I didn't have any

00:24:23.429 --> 00:24:29.970
brothers or sisters going through crises

00:24:25.289 --> 00:24:31.909
so I never developed like that that

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:34.349
skill that was necessary

00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:37.309
the only person having crises in my

00:24:34.349 --> 00:24:37.309
house growing up was me

00:24:41.429 --> 00:24:46.690
not just a large extent anyways it's

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:48.279
getting too personal but who doesn't

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:52.389
love to listen to the human condition am

00:24:48.279 --> 00:24:54.340
i right that was a bad one those

00:24:52.389 --> 00:24:56.289
incidents that and the hair gel incident

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:58.149
probably happened within like a month of

00:24:56.289 --> 00:25:00.460
each other is the most embarrassing one

00:24:58.149 --> 00:25:01.929
months of mine of my existence on planet

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:04.659
Earth and I think it's around the right

00:25:01.929 --> 00:25:07.799
age if you have our most embarrassing

00:25:04.659 --> 00:25:11.980
months of existence when you're like you

00:25:07.799 --> 00:25:15.389
know 28 you either messed up bad or

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:15.389
you're me playing Kerbal space program

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.729
[Music]

00:25:20.879 --> 00:25:29.289
anyway now the hair gel dab well there

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:33.369
was actually one time when I worked in

00:25:29.289 --> 00:25:35.679
South Korea I came to school and I was

00:25:33.369 --> 00:25:38.309
this I was again I want to point out I

00:25:35.679 --> 00:25:40.119
was barely an adult I can't believe they

00:25:38.309 --> 00:25:42.970
contracted me to work in a foreign

00:25:40.119 --> 00:25:46.509
country at the age of 20 this is absurd

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:51.070
but anyway I guess it was 21 but it's

00:25:46.509 --> 00:25:53.470
like barely 21 I came to school I was in

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:55.119
the office and I was like what smells

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:57.009
bad everyone in the office was speaking

00:25:55.119 --> 00:26:01.720
Korean now you know let's know that and

00:25:57.009 --> 00:26:03.999
eventually I realized my pants smelled

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:06.940
like terrible like a smell not like

00:26:03.999 --> 00:26:10.809
fecal matter just just a horrible odor

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:13.119
like tree resin and so I don't even know

00:26:10.809 --> 00:26:15.309
what it was to this day but I had to

00:26:13.119 --> 00:26:19.149
like I sniffed it in the butt I stood up

00:26:15.309 --> 00:26:20.529
and I was like sorry my fam smelled

00:26:19.149 --> 00:26:22.149
really bad but I don't have time to go

00:26:20.529 --> 00:26:23.590
back and get like new pants and I just

00:26:22.149 --> 00:26:26.440
notice that right now that was a

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:28.210
sobering moment for me in my life quite

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:30.399
embarrassing especially because that's

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:32.649
at that point I had to teach like 7 one

00:26:30.399 --> 00:26:34.029
hour classes full of kids and the kids

00:26:32.649 --> 00:26:36.299
were like what's that smell and I was

00:26:34.029 --> 00:26:41.200
like I don't know you're talking about

00:26:36.299 --> 00:26:43.419
you guys must be crazy but the smell was

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.399
me it was my pants and to this day I

00:26:43.419 --> 00:26:48.129
still don't know what it was but it was

00:26:45.399 --> 00:26:50.019
foul it was the only item of clothing

00:26:48.129 --> 00:26:52.240
that I had that had that smell

00:26:50.019 --> 00:26:56.740
it was not vomit it was not

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:59.800
poop on deaf word it appeared in the

00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:01.870
basement I'm not saying that just to

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:03.430
make myself look like more innocent than

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:04.990
I actually am like I should have noticed

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:07.300
that the pants smell bad but I was in a

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:09.850
rush I still to this day it's a

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:12.630
mysterious aroma that it's like my pants

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:17.110
got a hit by some kind of smell ghosts

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:19.330
then I don't understand so that was

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:22.540
that's a more recent embarrassing memory

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:26.140
not a great one but since then it's

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:27.670
largely been pretty ok fewer in the you

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:29.110
can have fewer and fewer embarrassing

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:31.000
moments the older you get I think that's

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:32.500
that's trending upwards until you reach

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.040
like a certain age and then everything

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:37.930
you do is very embarrassing I think

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:39.280
that's the way it goes is like when

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:41.320
you're a kid you embarrass your parents

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:44.410
when you're a teenager you embarrass

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:45.850
yourself and a young adult I guess you

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:47.560
embarrass yourself when you're a

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:51.610
middle-aged adult you embarrass your

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:53.820
kids and then why not when you're a

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:55.810
senior citizen you just embarrassed

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:57.550
society that's not where I met that

00:27:55.810 --> 00:28:02.460
punch line to go I have nothing but love

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:02.460
for the nation's elderly out there I

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:07.690
worked in a not in a forward-facing role

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:10.900
but I worked in a Senior Center at one

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:13.870
point in my life you'd think that I have

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:17.710
some stories I have no stories that's it

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:19.480
was just a nice place people would show

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:21.100
up you know they'd meet their friends

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.810
there they've read some books they'd

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:27.190
take classes on how to use Microsoft

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:28.840
Word I mean look at least they're

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:30.460
learning right you know they're trying

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:33.160
to stay contemporary you got to keep

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:35.530
yourself busy I'll take an Instagram

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:37.060
class when I'm 70 I got nothing better

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:39.600
to do and you know it helps me converse

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:42.670
with the younger generation why not

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:44.560
start an Instagram account for grandmas

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:47.480
with big bottoms or something like that

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:53.809
that's what's hip on the Instagram right

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:58.190
oh we need that every Friday was fish

00:28:53.809 --> 00:28:59.480
and chips day he didn't get a free meal

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:01.519
for working there though which I always

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:03.500
I kind of took that as a slight to be

00:29:01.519 --> 00:29:06.380
honest with you but that's okay I'm not

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:08.179
going to take dart Judas because again

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:09.820
we don't want to respawn as dark Judas

00:29:08.179 --> 00:29:13.880
at least not yet

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:17.480
rotten baby's a great kid but dark do

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:20.919
this not yet once we get to every posted

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.919
note thing unlocks we can go for it

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:32.650
the worst place I ever worked was

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:34.810
definitely goodwill working in goodwill

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:37.690
if anybody out there works in goodwill

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:40.300
or Value Village right now speaking of

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:43.150
which I worked at Goodwill for like six

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:45.220
weeks not a long time I applied at Value

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:47.380
Village which is just slightly upscale

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:48.880
goodwill and they turned me down who's

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:51.280
laughing now Valley Village who is

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:54.940
laughing now anyway

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:58.650
take this but that was a great blow to

00:29:54.940 --> 00:30:01.390
my ego when I was like the most perfect

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:03.520
candidate to apply for a job at like a

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:05.910
donation fulfillment center and then

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:09.640
they turned me down I was like this is

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:11.410
darn recession am i right but anyway if

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:14.320
you work at Goodwill or anything like

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:15.940
goodwill right now you have not only my

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:18.640
deepest sympathy but can I offer you

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:21.100
like some of my limited amounts of inner

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:23.920
strength because that is a hard job you

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:25.480
know long hours physical labor and every

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.860
once awhile it's like the worst version

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.720
of Christmas it's like a hell's

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:31.780
Christmas because people show up and

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:33.700
they drop off like garbage bags so it's

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:35.620
not the best wrapping paper for one this

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.760
is a step one of Christmas maybe we

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:37.660
should've just gone for it oh no we

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:40.240
still have a hundred percent deal with

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:42.220
the devil go fine and sometimes you open

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:44.050
it up and you're like hey there's an

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:45.880
okay shirt in here we could probably

00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:48.160
sell this for like five or six dollars

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:52.000
and sometimes you open it up and you go

00:30:48.160 --> 00:31:00.010
oh this one's just trash that's the work

00:30:52.000 --> 00:31:02.550
people are awful sometimes I still to

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:07.330
this day I don't fully understand it but

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:08.890
every day at Goodwill people overnight

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:10.180
when the goodwill is closed for anybody

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:12.160
not aware of this facility by the way

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:14.290
goodwill takes in donations primarily of

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:16.360
clothing and household goods sells them

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:17.800
and then donates the money to charity it

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.570
takes as much money as it needs to fund

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.800
its own operation it gives the rest of

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:22.410
money to charity I think it's the March

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:25.320
of Dimes but I can't remember

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:27.660
was literally the job interview was like

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:29.400
can you lift 30 pounds above your head

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:31.610
and I said yes and they were like you're

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.610
iron

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:39.090
anyway you unlocked glitch baby every

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:40.680
night when the goodwill closed I guess

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:42.450
overnight people would leave their stuff

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:44.190
in garbage bags in front of the goodwill

00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:46.350
they're like I got to donate the stuff

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:47.580
but the goodwill is closed I don't blame

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:49.140
them you know we didn't have like a

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:50.580
drop-off box there that you could just

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:52.080
put it in and they're saying you want to

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:53.610
get these garbage bags out of your truck

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:56.010
the problem is sometimes they're like

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:58.290
rain I don't they didn't create the rain

00:31:56.010 --> 00:32:00.990
but I mean they didn't do what they

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:02.760
could have done to protect us from ended

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:04.620
up inheriting some bags of garbage and

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.600
the other thing is sometimes people

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:10.290
would just literally toss garbage in

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:12.540
front of the goodwill I cannot fathom

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:17.880
the motivation because the garbage was

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:20.730
banged up it's almost like benevolent

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:23.130
maliciousness it's like they think that

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:25.170
the goodwill is a place that takes in

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:27.090
garbage sorts it and then sells the

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:30.090
stuff that has any value I still don't

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:31.500
understand why would you ever

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:33.210
there's dumpsters if you're trying to

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:35.400
commit some kind of weird garbage fraud

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:37.170
why would you give it to Goodwill I'm

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:39.480
not talking about you open it up and

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:42.060
it's like oh this this stuff is trash

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:43.860
I'm talking you open it up in like you

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:48.680
know potato chip wrappers and you know

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:53.870
glass bottles fall out of it anyway

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:57.390
so that's you know if you have no other

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:58.380
options I'm sure you could do worse I've

00:32:57.390 --> 00:33:00.180
never had to work in like a

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:02.280
slaughterhouse or something like that or

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:04.350
no that strikes me is possibly being

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:06.510
worse I did work as a mover for a day

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:09.150
that was also terrible but that could be

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:12.000
just because I'm a weakling and I really

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:14.700
don't fit in with the blue-collar you

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.460
know like wake up at 5:00 in the morning

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:20.790
drive truck and crack jokes about ladies

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:22.590
butt holes sort of crowd I'm not one of

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:24.840
the bullies necessarily is what I'm

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:26.580
trying to say and a lot of it well on

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:28.380
the one day that I did the job the

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:30.440
people that I was grouped with we're

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:35.629
definitely some of the boys

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:37.220
either way I digress again if you've got

00:33:35.629 --> 00:33:39.320
no other obviously probably worse I've

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:41.149
made some good people work in there but

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:47.330
I was also like I have to get out of

00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:51.759
here as fast and I think they went out

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:55.029
of business which always I was like how

00:33:51.759 --> 00:33:55.029
your chair

00:33:56.020 --> 00:34:02.740
maybe people stop shopping I guess it

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:04.450
makes you know it is a store people stop

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:08.770
buying stuff I suppose I understand how

00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:09.850
it could happen just just surprise it's

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:11.080
always we are but in place you worked

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:14.980
for goes out of business because you're

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:18.700
like I spent a couple thousand terrible

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:22.990
hours there and now the specter of my

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:25.330
rage is disappearing I just feel bad for

00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:29.710
my previous tormentors that's not really

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:32.500
a good way to look at it that's not a

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:36.970
healthy healthy way to think about it in

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:39.480
all likelihood yet that's how I know I'm

00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:42.520
the inverse of the round table crowd I

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:44.260
had great experiences with school wasn't

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:48.700
the biggest fan of many of the jobs that

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:50.950
I held feel like bears the opposite bear

00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:53.710
didn't really enjoy school all the time

00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:54.940
at least but he loved a couple of the

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:56.679
jobs that he had pre-youtube

00:34:54.940 --> 00:35:07.119
we're like mirror images of one another

00:34:56.679 --> 00:35:18.609
so he fits together yep that's us nope

00:35:07.119 --> 00:35:22.359
don't have that guy yet just on the 40

00:35:18.609 --> 00:35:25.630
oh good yeah that's what I meant

00:35:22.359 --> 00:35:27.609
