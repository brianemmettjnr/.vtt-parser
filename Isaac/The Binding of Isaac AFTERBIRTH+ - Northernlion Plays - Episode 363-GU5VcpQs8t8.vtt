00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.859
everybody welcome actor on the line

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.130
plays well it's the runks a filed old

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.010
habits die hard what can I say what can

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.410
I say you know what I'm feeling - Judas

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.519
run I want that glass can in action cuz

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.949
you can be a joke

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:31.140
this hero gets doesn't isn't hae Cates

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:34.260
y7q 7 I hate your seven questions 7 of 9

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.870
from Star Trek Deep Space nine anyway

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.120
that made it's effectively no sense here

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.180
but if you think about it didn't it make

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.300
all the sense in the world great dodge

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.980
dude I got to be 100% clear and honest

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.219
with you I feel like I've been really

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.110
bad at Isaac ever since we switched save

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.100
files and I don't know what it is about

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.899
this thing we can do this what it is

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.570
about like psychologically being on a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.550
new save file that's got me so mind

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.710
fluttered I can't perform anymore but

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.659
I'd you know Edmond tells me it happens

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.950
to lots of guys so I'm just going to try

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.110
to work through it the only way I know

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.520
how by playing one episode of Isaac

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.040
every single day from now until the day

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.479
that I die we will still get the look of

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.790
Belial charged up for our boss fight

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.860
which is yes thankfully we will which is

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.200
actually like compulsory as far as I'm

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.670
concerned it's non-negotiable we we

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.229
might not need it for the boss fight but

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.610
there's a good chance we'll want to have

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.740
it in case we end up going up against

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.509
like the haunt for example not the kind

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.380
of guy you want to go up against with 1

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.270
hp and no other means of progress here

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.590
we will check out our shop quickly and

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.409
just want to say thank you for the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.180
support on the new save file I think

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.320
it's done a little bit to refresh the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.610
series as much as is conceivable some

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.500
people have asked you know why not do

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.729
mods and I don't have a great answer for

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.619
that except that it's a lot of research

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.810
to get mods that are good they don't

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.430
come out all that frequently although I

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.320
do I appreciate all the efforts of my

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.750
community puts in and some of them are

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.069
not transformative enough for my tastes

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.450
and some of them are too transformative

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.700
for my tastes you know some of them are

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.590
like you know we've tweaked all the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.300
add-ins to make them slightly more into

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.590
with the balance we feel should be and

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.680
then like that's pretty cool

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.349
and some of them are like all the tears

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.090
are now you know cans of Pepsi and you

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.739
play as Kendall Jenner and I go okay

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.900
well like at this point I don't know

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:36.080
about that one hey thanks for the time

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:42.629
you've given me cuz it's once twice

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:47.150
three times a mushy damage times two

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.150
that's once twice three times a lady by

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.790
did I know who that's fine once twice

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.829
three times a lady plate maybe I don't

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:01.410
know once twice three times the lady is

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:03.780
by you shouldn't make a sequel to that

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.540
song it'd be called once twice three

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.519
times the lady fourth time we had space

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.180
alien it's like the first three times we

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:14.430
met she was very ladylike after that I

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.040
realized it wasn't a lady at all it was

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.769
a 100-foot monster from the locks of

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.230
Scotland something something three fit

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.329
look I was like ten when that episode

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.340
first aired I remember watching it I

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:31.410
don't remember the entire Loch Ness

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.849
monster mean and it's been supplanted at

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.459
this point by mankind throwing the

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.840
Undertaker through a at the top of the

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.760
hell in the cell or was the vice versa

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.650
the Undertaker to remain kind of Hell in

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.010
a Cell I don't know there's a lot of

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.599
wrestling memes you know do you smell

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.769
what The Rock is cooking as an original

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:53.730
meme John Cena's theme was a meme John

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:56.880
Cena mean mankind with hell in the cell

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:00.389
there's a too many wrestling needs to

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:04.950
keep up with at this point mean I

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:06.750
watched a WWF when I was younger Macho

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.389
Man Randy Savage ultimate warrior Hulk

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.329
Hogan the 1-2-3 kid

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:15.209
Yokozuna etc etc yo you don't remember

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.590
etc etc he was a wrestler but nobody

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:21.989
liked him because his matches just went

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:23.960
on and on finish making me do over here

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.750
all lifetime

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.580
making these Isaac episodes and that's

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.340
fine by me you know there's worse Lots

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.740
in life than playing a game you like

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.390
once a day until the day that you die

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.140
I'll trade a bomb for a key ain't

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.820
nothing wrong with that we should

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.660
probably double our bombs because we

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:50.160
have 14 of them if we double them so

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.870
let's do that and then makes it a lot

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.390
easier to justify giving two more of

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.160
these up I keep looking to see if chats

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.750
got any feedback on this episode so far

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.090
how do you feel about this episode chat

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:06.120
let me know and in four days I'll

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:08.730
respond to your criticism you know first

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.730
we had YouTube video on demand then we

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.080
have twitch live-streaming you know

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.560
we're going to have soon thought

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.450
streaming even faster than live as soon

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.250
as you conceive of the commentary it

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.150
exits your brain you know this would be

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.620
a bad thing I think of a lot of things

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.510
that I shouldn't say over the course of

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:31.230
an Isaac episode I think oh I will

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:33.930
absolutely take that you know we try to

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.850
keep the show free political events

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.520
current events and stuff like that we

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.380
try to keep it I like to make a show in

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.720
which I am the most controversial person

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.690
on the show as well so I like to kind of

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.990
be the guy who sets the tone oh that's

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.640
scary for that sort of stuff so I

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:55.260
usually we're going to crack in all this

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:57.240
and then maybe teleport out I want my

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.660
co-host to feel like they can't say

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.280
absolutely everything although Robert

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.870
sometimes brooches that level of trust

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.640
and then it makes it all the more

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.050
surprising when I say and basically I'm

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.990
stealing the good joke formula for

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.240
myself I'll come on mate at this point

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.650
we might as well finish the room so we

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.710
can grab this stuff without having to

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.930
worry about it anymore but still they

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.790
trying to keep things not super

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.190
controversial because I think it colors

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.750
the quality of the show and also you

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.330
know dates the episodes I'd rather talk

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:33.120
about like hey if you let's say you wake

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:34.560
up in the morning you don't shower I'm

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.820
not asking you a question I'm saying

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.470
this in this particular morning you

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:41.310
didn't get a chance to shower you go

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:43.110
to work you come back you shower do you

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:47.160
put the same pair of socks on that you

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:49.080
had before I'm not saying you wore socks

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.640
overnight and then put them back on in

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.730
the morning lord knows they get crusty

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.020
and weird but I often times you know

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.330
I'll put on a pair of socks at 10:00

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.650
a.m. I'll shower at 4 p.m. and just put

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.960
the same socks back on

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.730
I told us to my parents of all people

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.410
once and they looked at me as if like

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:09.180
they had no son I didn't realize that's

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.860
strange underwear I mean I can say I can

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.200
understand why it's strange because I

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.120
would never do it with underwear as soon

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.170
as you apply underwear too dirty

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.880
nether-regions

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.470
the underwear is dirty even if you just

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.000
wore it for 10 minutes you know you're

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.680
not putting that back on after a shower

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.750
and negates the purpose of being clean

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.570
there's some reason I feel like like

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.980
feet are different

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:30.660
everyone goes probably they listen I go

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.780
you got gross feet I actually don't have

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:37.169
normal feet show them what is you

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:39.000
weirdos tell me to show them just

00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:42.360
noticing I'm looking on the preview here

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.669
and I'm like is Isaac a little Frei me

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:47.790
or is that just me maybe it's just me I

00:07:44.669 --> 00:07:50.880
don't know I hope it's not fray me if

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:52.680
it's fray me I'm I'm apologetic well

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.390
sort it out before the next episodes no

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:57.990
computer problems at least it's not mr.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:08:00.540
green man you know that seems fine it's

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:02.070
one of those things where I think if I

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.140
hadn't even mentioned it people wouldn't

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:07.140
have even noticed it if this computer

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:08.550
started to get framerate issues whenever

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:11.760
I got a Skype message I would be like a

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:14.490
little concerned anyway forgot what I

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.080
was saying earlier I like to give you

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:18.169
little glimpses into the life of

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.030
Northern Line right now I mean this is a

00:08:18.169 --> 00:08:22.710
simple explanation you know or here's a

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:25.380
good example is what I mean to say woke

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:29.250
up today streams went to the grocery

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:32.130
store haven't showered yet I'm clean but

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:34.320
I haven't showered yet you know it's the

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:36.330
middle of summer boo we got a/c the

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.640
winter's know remarkably mild so it's

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:41.250
like you know relatively temperature

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.360
controlled here I'm going to shower and

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.800
then I'm going to go out and see a movie

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.500
later I'm going to put on the same socks

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:49.530
I got on right now every other article

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:51.000
of clothing it's foreboding but the

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:53.160
socks I'm not sure

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.629
because the socks then go into shoes

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:59.189
anyway it's like if they were going to

00:08:54.629 --> 00:09:00.779
be dirty I guess they're supposed to be

00:08:59.189 --> 00:09:02.490
the layer of protection between the

00:09:00.779 --> 00:09:08.879
shoes and the foot that makes sense and

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:11.069
we'll say you ever like wear shoes with

00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:12.600
no socks you might do it there's always

00:09:11.069 --> 00:09:14.430
one person out there who goes like I do

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.199
that all the time it's weird

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.970
I don't I don't know how you do it I

00:09:16.199 --> 00:09:19.379
guess if you're wearing like high heels

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.759
or something I understand it but there's

00:09:19.379 --> 00:09:26.370
a lot of female fashion I don't

00:09:20.759 --> 00:09:30.389
understand I'm trying to think of them

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:32.339
at the present moment well I feel for

00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:34.769
women when it comes to utilitarian

00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:35.879
fashion because I don't know that a lot

00:09:34.769 --> 00:09:38.089
of people might not be aware of this

00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:42.629
depending on you know your age and

00:09:38.089 --> 00:09:45.029
fashion preferences women's pants have

00:09:42.629 --> 00:09:46.529
smaller pockets than men's pants and

00:09:45.029 --> 00:09:49.970
there's only a couple of different

00:09:46.529 --> 00:09:49.970
reasons I can think of for this one is

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:55.259
they hold less things because they have

00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:56.579
a purse okay but why make the pockets

00:09:55.259 --> 00:09:58.680
smaller when you want them to be large

00:09:56.579 --> 00:10:00.629
regardless to hold whatever you can have

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:03.120
I'm not talking Jenko jeans size but

00:10:00.629 --> 00:10:06.439
like normal you know men's jeans size

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:10.709
and the other possible option is maybe

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:12.480
smaller pockets look more feminine when

00:10:10.709 --> 00:10:13.470
you don't have stuff but I honestly

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.269
don't know I should have gone back to

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.319
the emperor card as well I honestly

00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:18.089
don't have a good answer to your

00:10:16.319 --> 00:10:21.629
question to my own questions here is

00:10:18.089 --> 00:10:23.840
what I mean to say I wish I did but I

00:10:21.629 --> 00:10:26.920
don't

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:30.440
[Music]

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:32.390
also like women's shoes it boggles my

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:34.580
mind and this is I mean this I wouldn't

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:36.650
describe this as current events but in

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:39.230
British Columbia recently they passed a

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:41.030
law that means you can't make

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:43.520
high-heeled shoes a part of a dress code

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:46.490
for a business anymore which means that

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:49.910
you know if you run a bar or restaurant

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:52.610
and part of the appeal was you had like

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:53.960
you know waitresses in high heels now

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.280
you can't do that anymore and you're

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.500
going to say who does that there's a lot

00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:00.260
of places that do that that's I've never

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.760
seen that a new placebo icon or am i

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:05.120
losing it I might be losing it let's

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:07.670
grab this and when I read it I was like

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:11.600
I can't believe that wasn't already a

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:14.420
thing I get it you know I understand

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:16.640
that it seems a little antiquated but

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.150
there's a the idea that wearing high

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.460
heeled shoes

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:21.560
you know emphasizes the female form and

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:23.330
if you're a restaurant that for whatever

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.580
reason is selling sex even though I

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:27.500
think that sex and food should remain

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:30.410
disparate unless you're into that sort

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.790
of thing no king shaming but I know I'm

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:35.330
not I'm not going to Costanza the

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:37.880
situation okay but like hey we got a

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:42.140
good job for you the only downside is

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:43.610
you have to like irrevocably destroy the

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.680
architecture of the tendons and bones

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:47.300
and muscles within your feet no big deal

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.890
though because we are going to pay you

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:54.170
lower the minimum wage and then have it

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:55.790
be subsidized by customers who will then

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:58.370
ask for pictures of your feet in return

00:11:55.790 --> 00:12:00.050
maybe maybe not depends how recently

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:05.390
Quentin Tarantino has been there anyway

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:06.560
I know every time I try to come over you

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:08.270
know the top on an issue like this

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.310
people go well there's some people who

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:11.750
like wearing high heels more power to

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:14.780
you I'm just saying to make it part of

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:16.820
the dress code is wild I've worked at

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:20.780
offices that have had a pretty strict

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:22.490
dress code you know like when I worked

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:25.190
at Disney World they would not let me

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:26.930
take off the Gaston uniform now this

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:29.090
obviously never happened but I've worked

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:33.820
at offices where you know like office

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:33.820
attire is required not

00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:38.129
well it's like a step above business

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:40.290
casual but not necessarily a full-on

00:12:38.129 --> 00:12:43.040
suit and tie but like a dresser that's

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.040
high every day

00:12:43.399 --> 00:12:50.459
men's dress clothes are fine as far as

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:52.319
I'm concerned it's like you know could

00:12:50.459 --> 00:12:54.749
it could it be more comfortable yeah

00:12:52.319 --> 00:12:56.579
absolutely like Austin is not a fan of

00:12:54.749 --> 00:12:57.959
men's dress clothes and I understand

00:12:56.579 --> 00:13:00.029
where you're coming from here you got to

00:12:57.959 --> 00:13:01.709
tuck in your shirt a tie I don't know

00:13:00.029 --> 00:13:03.360
people sometimes they treat it as if

00:13:01.709 --> 00:13:05.639
it's like noose they call this ties so

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.620
constricting it ties this will loosen it

00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:09.389
up a little bit so it's not literally

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:12.689
choking you no one will notice you'll be

00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:15.029
fine I don't mind wearing a suit and tie

00:13:12.689 --> 00:13:18.240
dress shoes you know they tend to be a

00:13:15.029 --> 00:13:19.860
little rigid sometimes they can irritate

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:22.319
the skin like around my Achilles tendon

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:23.970
not a huge problem you know it's a small

00:13:22.319 --> 00:13:28.680
price to pay the high heels or something

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:31.649
altogether different so I got nothing

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:37.309
but respect for ladies out there that

00:13:31.649 --> 00:13:39.660
have to wear high heels because I I

00:13:37.309 --> 00:13:42.899
can't imagine I'd be too pleased if I

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:44.399
had to plus you got to learn how to walk

00:13:42.899 --> 00:13:46.259
in them you can't just show up on day

00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:48.089
one of wearing high heels and then be

00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:49.829
like walking around like that famous

00:13:48.089 --> 00:13:51.389
video of the model who falls off the

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:54.209
catwalk after her legs turn into

00:13:51.389 --> 00:13:55.860
competing sine waves you know you gotta

00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:57.809
you're gonna had you're supposed to not

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:59.309
only walk in them you know putting them

00:13:57.809 --> 00:14:01.160
on is only half the battle you've got to

00:13:59.309 --> 00:14:04.920
walk gracefully as well otherwise you

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:06.149
look like you know two kids stacked on

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.470
each other's shoulders wearing a trench

00:14:06.149 --> 00:14:09.720
coat trying to get into a movie theater

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:15.930
for you know something rated R that they

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:17.160
can't see not supposed to see and that's

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.800
the end of that tangent I don't have

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.000
anything more to say about that I

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.439
disagree with Austin's notion though

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.029
that there should never be occasions

00:14:22.439 --> 00:14:27.089
where you have to wear dress clothes you

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:28.829
know some decorum is appreciated I guess

00:14:27.089 --> 00:14:30.269
maybe I'm old school like that but I

00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:34.410
don't think so most of Chad seem to

00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:37.499
agree with me like to a funeral you

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:39.149
should wear some like nice clothes not

00:14:37.499 --> 00:14:41.429
to be respectful of the person who died

00:14:39.149 --> 00:14:43.059
because lord knows if I die first off

00:14:41.429 --> 00:14:44.769
almost nobody listen to this

00:14:43.059 --> 00:14:47.109
but in my funeral please don't show up

00:14:44.769 --> 00:14:50.949
this might sound mean but the reasoning

00:14:47.109 --> 00:14:52.959
is that's for my family you know that's

00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:55.119
an opportunity is that it no it's not a

00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:58.389
tinted rock that's an opportunity for

00:14:55.119 --> 00:15:00.639
you know my friends and close family

00:14:58.389 --> 00:15:02.709
wait I got that reversed my family and

00:15:00.639 --> 00:15:03.819
close friends to mourn it's about them

00:15:02.709 --> 00:15:05.199
it's not about me

00:15:03.819 --> 00:15:06.909
you know you honor the life you get a

00:15:05.199 --> 00:15:08.439
slight sense of closure at least from

00:15:06.909 --> 00:15:10.269
the castle going into the ground and

00:15:08.439 --> 00:15:11.529
then you know you get to thinking about

00:15:10.269 --> 00:15:13.719
how you're going to you know live from

00:15:11.529 --> 00:15:17.199
this point onwards if you show up

00:15:13.719 --> 00:15:19.599
wearing a no fear t-shirt and like a Guy

00:15:17.199 --> 00:15:21.459
Fieri Sun Visor or something like that

00:15:19.599 --> 00:15:23.499
you've taken some of the attention for

00:15:21.459 --> 00:15:25.179
you you've made it less about the

00:15:23.499 --> 00:15:28.209
occasion and more about like well this

00:15:25.179 --> 00:15:33.579
is just who I am mom diners drive-ins

00:15:28.209 --> 00:15:35.079
and dives we need to explore some more

00:15:33.579 --> 00:15:38.769
this run is going well though I've

00:15:35.079 --> 00:15:40.809
actually played okay and take it from me

00:15:38.769 --> 00:15:43.029
I'm I've been talking about this in

00:15:40.809 --> 00:15:45.879
episodes I usually underdress I feel bad

00:15:43.029 --> 00:15:48.909
I feel self-conscious which is the other

00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:50.409
thing I am and I know that you know

00:15:48.909 --> 00:15:55.509
should you feel self-conscious maybe

00:15:50.409 --> 00:15:58.509
maybe not but I think part of growing up

00:15:55.509 --> 00:16:00.879
is you start thinking about well we got

00:15:58.509 --> 00:16:02.319
one key back you start fighting the

00:16:00.879 --> 00:16:05.559
important battles instead of the

00:16:02.319 --> 00:16:08.139
unimportant battles like an unimportant

00:16:05.559 --> 00:16:10.539
battle that I've talked about a lot in

00:16:08.139 --> 00:16:12.609
the Isaac episodes was when I worked at

00:16:10.539 --> 00:16:14.709
an office and I would take lunch as

00:16:12.609 --> 00:16:16.269
close to quitting time as possible so

00:16:14.709 --> 00:16:17.739
that when I came back from lunch I only

00:16:16.269 --> 00:16:19.389
had like 10 minutes of work and then I

00:16:17.739 --> 00:16:22.469
got to leave that's an unimportant

00:16:19.389 --> 00:16:25.239
battle what's an important battle

00:16:22.469 --> 00:16:27.339
calling your mom is an important battle

00:16:25.239 --> 00:16:31.629
you know making sure your friends are

00:16:27.339 --> 00:16:34.419
okay that's an important battle going to

00:16:31.629 --> 00:16:36.219
McDonald's and ordering your french

00:16:34.419 --> 00:16:37.959
fries specifically with no salt so they

00:16:36.219 --> 00:16:41.309
have to cook up a fresh batch and then

00:16:37.959 --> 00:16:44.679
you can salt them yourself first off i

00:16:41.309 --> 00:16:46.389
looks donate first off i resist the

00:16:44.679 --> 00:16:47.769
notion that it makes for better fries i

00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:50.649
think they have to be salted near the

00:16:47.769 --> 00:16:52.269
time of creation otherwise you know you

00:16:50.649 --> 00:16:54.579
might be running the risk of to some

00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:55.929
extent compromising the quality of the

00:16:54.579 --> 00:16:56.250
fries to begin with by enforcing the

00:16:55.929 --> 00:16:59.730
cooker

00:16:56.250 --> 00:17:01.500
fresh batch now I've had uh like older

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:02.910
fries for McDonald's we they clearly

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.160
didn't just make them right then I

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:07.890
understand this appointment don't get me

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:10.470
wrong I'm saying this it like it's not

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:17.160
the Barack Obama voice but it is the

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:18.810
Barack Obama cadence anyway I think I

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.579
think you're robbing yourself with

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.839
respect to that but anyway that's an

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:22.500
unimportant battle I'll tell you

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:24.240
straight up

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:29.190
secret menu actor the fast food

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:31.110
restaurant unimportant battle leaving a

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:36.660
nice review for a local business that

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:40.920
you enjoy important battle no this is

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:42.060
stupid don't do this put a bomb here put

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:45.090
another one maybe we can get another

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:47.550
arcade on the next floor oh wow more

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:51.000
than an arcade when I hear that on some

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:54.000
they used to play I have a deli story by

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.940
the way it's a small one and I want to

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.910
preface this by saying it's your time

00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:02.880
and everybody else's time but you can

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:04.530
literally do whatever you want to do at

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:06.210
the deli counter I'm not going to stop

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:08.040
you this is a tough choice by the way

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.960
but I'll err on the side of taking

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.920
damage for myself and immediately fight

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:17.160
a room where I would rather have

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:19.410
piercing beams but anyway we were at the

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.910
grocery store today I'm not going to say

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:22.980
which one but there's a common joke

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:24.510
about it being so expensive that you can

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:27.180
riff on the name of the grocery store

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:28.800
and call it blank paycheck instead that

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:33.110
almost hit me because I'm dumb but

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.110
anyway I'm sure kidney bean is garbage

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:37.830
deli counter there leaves a little

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:39.720
something to be desired I prefer a

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.770
little mom-and-pop delicatessen sort of

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.750
thing you know where they got a couple

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:44.700
of freshly made you know in-house meats

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:45.990
but either way you know I'm not going to

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.670
to grocery stores I'd rather just

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:48.870
overpay at the one grocery store for a

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.330
little bit of deli meat get home and

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:54.510
play an extra game of balla grounds I

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:55.560
digress crowded very crowded very busy I

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.270
don't know if it was built when they

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.520
expected Vancouver to only have like you

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:01.110
know 25 people living in the whole city

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.850
but it's tight in there so we're about

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:05.610
to go up to the deli counter in this you

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:07.530
know middle-aged woman pushes in front

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.580
of us she she borderline muscles in

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.140
front of us to the point where like

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.570
we're ahead of her but she's like

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:14.190
sideling in you know she's trying to

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:15.390
like angle her shoulders so she has a

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:17.550
little bit of leverage so we're like

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.870
we're fine okay we did the hand wave so

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:20.700
you go ahead she goes up to the front

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:24.480
and they go excuse me can I help you

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:26.880
ma'am and she says uh which kind of

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:29.040
salami would you recommend and I just

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:31.650
looked at my wife and she looked at me

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:35.790
and she was like don't do it and I

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:37.710
didn't do it because I'm a pussy but in

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:39.960
my head I was like he muscled in front

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:43.890
of us you're in such a hurry then you go

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:45.330
up and go which kind of salami would you

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:48.450
recommend you don't even know what you

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:49.980
want yet and then the you know poor lady

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:51.270
who worked there was just like I don't

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.620
know whether you think when I got this

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:54.510
job at the deli they were like hey

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:56.960
sample all the salami so you can give

00:19:54.510 --> 00:20:00.120
recommendations to people anyway

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:01.860
they talked it over for like 45 seconds

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.300
and then lady was like do you want to

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:06.180
serve the worker was like do you want a

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:07.950
sample not that she's not a lady as well

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:10.080
but you know she's a worker in the

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:13.770
context of this because I'm the

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:15.450
capitalist but anyway I mean I'm

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:19.200
shopping at Whole Foods of course I'm a

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:21.270
capitalist okay the point is she goes do

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.580
you want samples so the lady puts a big

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:25.350
old slab of salami up there slices one

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:27.870
slice cleans it off puts of the other

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:31.110
slab of salami slice is one slice gives

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:33.390
her two slices I kid you not she ate

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:37.350
those two slices of salami and then went

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:40.880
oh just take the honey ham I thought I

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:43.650
was going to lose my freaking mind

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:45.870
here's me at the deli counter when I go

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:48.450
up hey sir can I help you yeah can I get

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:50.040
300 grams of the roast beef they're like

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:52.800
oh yeah sure and then no matter what

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:54.060
question they ask me I'm Pro workers

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.060
sometimes they go you want that sliced

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:59.250
thinly or thickly I'm like whatever

00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:02.760
setting the machine is already on works

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:04.200
for me and I give me a little look and

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:07.800
they're like this guy's on the level and

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:10.410
I'm like I'm on the level I haven't I'm

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:13.560
not saying you should be out of your

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:15.330
rights to ask for a sample at the deli

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:19.410
counter but I think once you get a

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:22.080
sample of something I I'm not saying you

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:24.670
have to buy it but come on

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:26.810
like we sometimes we

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:30.170
there's all these like craft breweries

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:31.400
in the rough vicinity of our area in

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:32.690
Vancouver sometimes we'll go there and

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.100
they'll have something new don't be like

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:35.510
any can we get a sample of that they

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.160
give you a sample of it as far as I'm

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:39.740
concerned I've purchased the good at

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:41.030
that point do we know what was in here

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:44.540
there's a little brim right

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:47.810
half price little brim yeah well yeah

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:49.820
yeah half price little bring this is a

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:53.570
good opportunity to do boss rush oh it's

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:55.690
a great opportunity to do boss rush and

00:21:53.570 --> 00:22:01.030
we get to see the little charge bar to

00:21:55.690 --> 00:22:05.630
charge bars for our days and our nights

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:10.640
charging bars charging bars for the runs

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:14.090
that are nice and I think I want I want

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:16.910
bars to charge for me I don't know where

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:19.190
I'm going with this but I feel I've done

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:20.690
it before but I feel a sense of guilt if

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:23.150
I take a sample of something and then

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:25.540
get something completely unrelated like

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:28.070
if you can I get a sample of the

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:29.600
Hungarian blood sausage and then they

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:32.330
give you that nearly I'll just pick the

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:35.420
honey ham actually I'll take I'll take

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:36.890
whatever's cheapest now can I get a

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:40.070
slice of each of your kind of prosciutto

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:42.800
as a sample mm-hmm yes I'll take the

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:46.820
macaroni loaf actually you popped up

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:50.770
right on top of me disrespectful I feel

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:50.770
like there's an unspoken contract that

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:54.020
you know if you get a sample of

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:55.970
something that means you have an

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:58.180
intention to not purchase it but

00:22:55.970 --> 00:23:00.680
possibly consider for your in the market

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:03.500
it's like going into like a Mercedes

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.910
dealership when you got a Honda budget

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.620
and you're like I can just take a

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:08.540
test-drive of that you know eClass

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:10.220
Mercedes I don't think there's anything

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:13.460
wrong with it certainly Daimler Chrysler

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:15.710
is making enough money that I think

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:17.120
anyway you know that they're not going

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:19.640
to be hurting as a result of your test

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:24.350
drive but you're violating the social

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:26.920
contract of that dealership in my

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:26.920
opinion at least

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:35.279
not to mention and you know I get

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:38.520
blasted for being pro corporate all the

00:23:35.279 --> 00:23:40.620
time but there are human beings that

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:42.600
work at that dealership you're wasting

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:44.730
their time you know they work on

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.960
Commission you're taking away time that

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:47.789
they could be spent in talking to a

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:49.020
paying customer and feeding their family

00:23:47.789 --> 00:23:51.510
you know they might not be driving a

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:54.419
Daimler Chrysler Mercedes E Class C

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:56.130
Class I don't know any Mercedes I met

00:23:54.419 --> 00:23:58.230
well I don't know the names of any

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:59.760
Mercedes I just know the sound they make

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:02.010
when they cut in front of me in traffic

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:05.120
without using the freaking signal lights

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:05.120
but I digress

00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:13.110
we could die the runs good enough that

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:16.580
we shouldn't die but that doesn't mean

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:16.580
we won't but I don't think we will

00:24:17.419 --> 00:24:24.570
what oh we killed all the first floor

00:24:22.169 --> 00:24:26.700
bosses dukkha flies was the last first

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:28.730
floor boss who would have thought well

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:31.020
the game sucks for Robert now because we

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:32.840
unlocked his least-favorite floor the

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:37.340
cellar

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:45.350
would you like to unlock the cellar

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:49.140
ololo how to version of the intro floor

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:53.580
you'll fight the haunt hope he's no

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:58.830
champion Santa Santa doors sound a

00:24:53.580 --> 00:25:01.760
cellar door I come undone that was not a

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:01.760
great note at the end

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:13.640
that was my deli story I don't have any

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:15.410
other stories well there was a kid it

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.630
was like a 1 year old at the Whole Foods

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:19.340
there's a bunch of popcorn on the ground

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:21.020
and you just started eating it and like

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:22.670
I wasn't going to stop him

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.950
his mom was on her cell phone which I

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:27.070
don't mean like I didn't say that with a

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:29.210
tone like his mom was on her cell phone

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:30.590
you know maybe she's got a message from

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:32.540
her dad who's in the hospital or

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:34.880
something you know I'll accept it but I

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:37.610
was not going to be like a lady your

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:40.760
kids eating popcorn off the ground I

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:42.440
just sort of looked at him and then when

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:44.270
his mom saw she was like hey don't do

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.530
that it was in a different language but

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:49.190
I'm assuming she said don't do that

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:51.380
could be stopped maybe she said you know

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:53.570
save some for me I don't know but then

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:55.280
she looked at me like I'm supposed to oh

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:58.040
I don't know what to look men but in my

00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:00.440
head because I'm accusatory and have

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:02.060
anxiety I thought that she was looking

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:06.620
at me to say like you know why didn't

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:08.090
you stop my son from Eden popcorn off

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:11.390
the ground I didn't want to tell her but

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:12.710
the real reason is because you know we

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:14.750
know that we're hurtling towards some

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:16.850
kind of either automation AI or

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:19.010
environmental focused apocalypse right

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:21.680
so if Kate and I ever choose to have

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:24.380
children her son eating popcorn off the

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:26.000
ground might lead to a situation in

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.620
which our child is a competitive

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.820
advantage in the future I'm not

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:31.510
suggesting he's going to get sick and

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:33.860
die just that is like potential employer

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:34.880
might have been watching and he's going

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:38.930
to be like weren't you that kid even

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:40.490
popcorn off the ground 22 years ago you

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:42.320
don't get to be part of my Cormac

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:44.360
McCarthy of the raid style roving band

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.580
of mercenaries I'm taking this kid

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:48.440
instead with the pop-culture references

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:51.650
who just did the parody of the undone of

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:55.520
the sweater song it sounds like you'd be

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:57.860
good for morale in the apocalypse who

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:59.300
does this taste funny to you you think

00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:01.610
you can't see but in my version this

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:04.390
joke we're eating a clown or a stand-up

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:11.060
comedian preferably Dane Cook get it

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:12.980
because wooju legs to consume Dane Cook

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:18.610
a little

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:18.610
does this damn tastes funny to you

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:26.390
anyway it was a fun trip to the grocery

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:30.260
store that's about it there's nothing

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:33.669
else not that I can think of at least no

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:33.669
parking lot shenanigans

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:42.320
I've been encountering this I don't know

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:46.520
if this is a common thing necessarily

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:49.100
I've small talked I'm a good small

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:50.419
talker might surprise you I don't like

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.950
the small talk it's not my favorite

00:27:50.419 --> 00:27:56.990
thing to do in the world but I don't

00:27:51.950 --> 00:28:00.500
mind the small talk but I don't like

00:27:56.990 --> 00:28:02.150
small talk with cashiers at a grocery

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:04.910
store for one very specific reason

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:08.090
oftentimes the I grocery shop for my

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:11.360
wife and myself so I'm buying things

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:12.770
that we both want which is great for me

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.090
because it means I can guilt free buy

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:17.150
snacks I probably shouldn't be eating

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:19.760
because she's not there to stop me and

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:22.040
it's a perfect time for for me to

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:24.679
exercise what little autonomy I have and

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:26.090
I actually appreciate that because

00:28:24.679 --> 00:28:27.740
living with restrictions I think is

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:30.710
important otherwise you know I'd be oh

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:32.630
you know ten for thirteen dollars I got

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:34.870
to get ten family size bags of Doritos

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:37.490
you know it's nice to have some level of

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:41.890
societal guilt to kind of hold you in

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:43.400
place there I think anyway the point is

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:45.380
nothing there

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:50.480
child Tarr was okay because we were kind

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:53.150
of using that to boost up dark bum here

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:56.240
but so what ends up happening is Kate

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:57.950
drinks these like what are effectively

00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:02.240
meal replacement drinks for breakfast

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:04.520
sometimes they're convenient and you

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.660
know not horrible although I'm like if

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.970
you ever had a breakfast sandwich

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:09.740
because this is like 180th as good as a

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:11.780
breakfast sandwich but I understand they

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:13.490
are convenient so it should get like

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.720
these drinks called Rumble or you know

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:18.380
soiling which is another meal

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:21.520
replacement drink and without fail I

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:24.110
would say like 75% of the time the

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:26.570
cashier at the grocery store will go oh

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:28.580
are these good and then I have to

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:30.710
an internal quandary then should

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:34.610
illustrate to you what goes on in my

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:37.490
brain on a regular basis I have to say I

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:40.100
don't know my wife drinks them which is

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:43.070
a bad conversational thread to leave it

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:45.049
on because there's no way for them to

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:46.610
respond easily that's like I think

00:29:45.049 --> 00:29:49.250
that's the trick to conversation is you

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:51.019
always want to you know people dangle

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:53.029
something to you and then you take it

00:29:51.019 --> 00:29:54.380
and you respond and you dangle something

00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:56.720
back that gives them like an easy thing

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:58.399
to catch on to so they can respond like

00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:00.529
when you say hey what's up and they go

00:29:58.399 --> 00:30:02.419
I'm not too much how are you you go I'm

00:30:00.529 --> 00:30:03.919
doing pretty good but how about this

00:30:02.419 --> 00:30:06.139
weather we're having and they go oh I

00:30:03.919 --> 00:30:07.639
know right we were going camping this

00:30:06.139 --> 00:30:10.070
weekend but I don't think we can do it

00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:11.419
anymore and you go camping that's really

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:13.789
cool where you guys going and now you're

00:30:11.419 --> 00:30:15.279
off on a flow you got no problem so you

00:30:13.789 --> 00:30:17.929
I'm committing the cardinal

00:30:15.279 --> 00:30:20.960
conversational sin of replying to their

00:30:17.929 --> 00:30:22.730
question with just a no it's like anti

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:26.169
improv you know you're supposed to do

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:29.419
yes and but instead we're doing actually

00:30:26.169 --> 00:30:33.409
unmarried and you were coming on to me

00:30:29.419 --> 00:30:36.049
it's accusatory right or I have to lie

00:30:33.409 --> 00:30:39.169
and act like I oh I didn't mean to do

00:30:36.049 --> 00:30:40.909
that but I feel a compulsion to lie and

00:30:39.169 --> 00:30:43.879
just to keep the conversation going

00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:45.529
better and be like oh yeah no they're

00:30:43.879 --> 00:30:47.659
really good like I like the Dutch cocoa

00:30:45.529 --> 00:30:49.100
one's better than the vanilla ones even

00:30:47.659 --> 00:30:51.559
though the vanilla ones have real maple

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:53.419
because that's like you know then a real

00:30:51.559 --> 00:30:54.799
maple on that yeah can you believe it I

00:30:53.419 --> 00:30:58.340
mean at that point I'm probably checked

00:30:54.799 --> 00:30:59.600
out with some you know I'm not getting

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:00.679
paid to hang out the grocery store

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:05.570
unlike the other party in the

00:31:00.679 --> 00:31:06.799
conversation but anyway like 90 percent

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:09.789
of people listening to this are going to

00:31:06.799 --> 00:31:09.789
go NL you're so weird

00:31:10.059 --> 00:31:13.669
eight percent of people are going to be

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.470
like you're my spirit animal what about

00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:17.240
the other 2% they're going to say you're

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:18.679
so weird without realizing that they're

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:20.509
also that person as well you got to

00:31:18.679 --> 00:31:24.289
build in a little error there I'm going

00:31:20.509 --> 00:31:26.740
to roll the whole run of course you got

00:31:24.289 --> 00:31:26.740
fungi

00:31:28.509 --> 00:31:34.850
it's a weird one but our damage is still

00:31:32.119 --> 00:31:38.149
great so I ain't sweating it at all we

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:39.619
no longer have a dark bum which

00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:43.249
obviously like it would be for the best

00:31:39.619 --> 00:31:45.019
if we did but we have a host hand for

00:31:43.249 --> 00:31:46.519
explosion immunity as well which is very

00:31:45.019 --> 00:31:50.149
useful because a lot of our shots are

00:31:46.519 --> 00:31:52.789
exploding so do we have the if it's the

00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:54.200
end I can't remember one day we'll get

00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:58.039
past this being the end it's gonna take

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:59.989
us like 10 episodes I guess but oh they

00:31:58.039 --> 00:32:04.759
have been given me so many free outs

00:31:59.989 --> 00:32:08.619
lately I'm a moron I went back for the

00:32:04.759 --> 00:32:11.480
black heart well here's what we'll do

00:32:08.619 --> 00:32:13.460
that that was actually an accident I

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.989
hope that that's abundantly clear we'll

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:16.700
find the secret rooms that could give us

00:32:14.989 --> 00:32:17.779
a way out we'll look for self sacrifice

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:20.359
rooms that could give us a way out

00:32:17.779 --> 00:32:27.980
although a dangerous one a surprise to

00:32:20.359 --> 00:32:31.129
be sure but a welcome one and on top of

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:35.029
that we might be able to find a red

00:32:31.129 --> 00:32:36.460
chest that just takes us back to the for

00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:41.659
the devil room and that would function

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:43.609
appropriately as well but I really

00:32:41.659 --> 00:32:46.399
shouldn't have gone down it's one of

00:32:43.609 --> 00:32:49.039
those situations where like you would

00:32:46.399 --> 00:32:51.350
only care about that if you had recently

00:32:49.039 --> 00:32:53.570
gotten a new save file because if you

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:54.379
hadn't you'd be like well I can just go

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:58.789
down there anyway

00:32:54.379 --> 00:33:00.889
but sadly obviously things are different

00:32:58.789 --> 00:33:03.619
now and that's it was good you know

00:33:00.889 --> 00:33:09.919
keeps us keeps us on our toes uh he's

00:33:03.619 --> 00:33:12.710
barking he's barking let's go I think

00:33:09.919 --> 00:33:19.249
it's our first crawlspace you know in

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:21.320
the new save we got here I'm drowsy is

00:33:19.249 --> 00:33:26.379
not bad we get anything for a max level

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:26.379
Bumbo I do not recall

00:33:27.169 --> 00:33:31.230
while our final step here is going to be

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.659
it would have been nice actually that

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:34.799
was just an exit but now that I think

00:33:33.659 --> 00:33:36.779
about it I don't think you can just get

00:33:34.799 --> 00:33:39.960
exits like that think they have to be

00:33:36.779 --> 00:33:41.909
crawl spaces it's not just like using an

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:45.150
eihwaz room so we're looking for seeker

00:33:41.909 --> 00:33:46.950
into room which we can find thanks to

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:49.440
dog tooth but otherwise I've caused us a

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:51.750
floor which is really I don't think of

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:54.390
it as being cost a floor think of it as

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:56.429
gaining a whole run because now I have

00:33:54.390 --> 00:34:01.020
to go back and do a run that goes to

00:33:56.429 --> 00:34:04.710
Sheol as Judas that I may or may not

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:06.960
have had to do prior to this trinkets

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:09.210
don't matter yeah I was gonna say I was

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:15.780
waiting for it come on because it's not

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:21.149
a secret room um so I'm going to do this

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:23.760
the goal is really just to get a like we

00:34:21.149 --> 00:34:25.320
can get the dollar bill that would be

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:34.050
really nice so I never have to worry

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:37.159
about it again plus then we got more to

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:40.230
gamble with on these guys I guess but

00:34:37.159 --> 00:34:42.450
come on come on just one dollar let's

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:44.429
get all also I never get so if you just
