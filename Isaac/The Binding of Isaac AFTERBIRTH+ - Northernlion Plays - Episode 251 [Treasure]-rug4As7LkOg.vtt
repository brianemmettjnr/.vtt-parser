##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.470
everybody welcome back northern land

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.600
please biting my skenfrith gloves no I'm

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.670
fine playing pretty well lately we want

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.500
to keep a run recently maybe the last

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.420
run-in excuse me

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.760
random engine I didn't say the lost I

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:25.160
said the last q4y our way qy4 are in

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:29.010
porque a you for real w1 v8 which one

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.420
vapes that's nonsensical alright so as

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.219
you can tell my brain is not at the

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.410
right place to win a lost run but I

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.079
actually disagree with my own assessment

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.530
there I've been playing good Isak lately

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:46.980
again you may agree with me ok good

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:48.539
start you may disagree with me but what

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.260
matters is that we have a chance to

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.300
prove it here it's a tough call and I

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.930
mean this sincerely Bob's our on the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.760
head is what I'm going to take that's

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.440
good actually but Bob's right ahead is

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.470
what I'm going to take because I don't

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:10.500
want to accidentally use the d4 however

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.689
the d4 has value if we find ourselves in

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.580
an otherwise like it's a super Hail Mary

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.320
like we're down by six points and

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.450
there's one second left on the clock

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.750
we're on our own five-yard line like you

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.759
can launch that d4 lose holy mantle

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.400
permanently in the hopes of getting

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:32.700
something that you know saves the run

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:35.430
for you this is a like a really really

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.750
bad start for me in terms of my own

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.159
personal play here but I got to be

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.560
honest I just came off an excellent

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.380
daily and that keeper run that we had

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.909
recently it was easy but at the same

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.409
time it was the keeper you know you

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.130
still got to tick all the boxes on a

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.140
keeper run no matter no matter how easy

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.600
it is so good to know I guess with Bob's

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.369
rotten head we've 100% half to hit an

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.310
enemy or spectral tears we'll just carry

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.570
it off of the screen I guess chocolate

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.070
milk can be a lovely item if you are one

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.680
of the people out there who watch Robert

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.420
play The Binding of Isaac or Austin and

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.920
you're like why did you take chocolate

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.160
milk it's a bad item it's my

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.110
responsibility as a semi learn

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.530
Isak content creator to let you know

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.870
that those guys are out of their minds

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.910
yeah well what do they say about running

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.720
into enemies for no reason just to take

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:39.180
damage well okay you know everybody

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:41.250
hurts everybody crying we're going to be

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.140
fine this is not a tough room

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.420
do it again here's the thing with the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.370
loss you can get hit once on every room

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.840
with no consequences it's just as a

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.860
consequence of getting it that second

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:56.730
time it's going to hurt you real bad but

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.990
the first time so that's free it's like

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.760
you're chatting me for taking too many

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.720
free samples at the Costco you know it's

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.130
built into the cost of the membership

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.380
which we don't have anymore we stopped

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.990
going to Costco I'll explain why this is

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.840
I feel like economics is really missing

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:15.120
out what is this High Priestess is good

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.710
in fact I'm going to say that that's

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.150
better than two of keys which I should

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.100
have used to give myself one key at the

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.400
very least but here's the problem with

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.890
Costco every time we went to Costco we

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.650
ended up buying stuff we live in a small

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.750
apartment right I have no doubt I you

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.360
know grew up with my parents shopping at

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.340
Costco all the time we had a house big

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.050
old freezer you go there you pay your

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.850
$100 a year from membership it's not

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.140
that much like two dollars a week you

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.660
save two dollars a week when you go to

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.830
Costco for both groceries absolutely but

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.660
we're going there there I need some

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.020
toothpaste here's 20 tubes of toothpaste

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.390
now we got to buy like real estate to

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.730
find a place to put all the freaking

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.560
toothpaste we just bought God to the

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.989
point it was ridiculous and also is like

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.150
a veggie straws you want some veggies

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.420
drugs yet but want some venue straws I

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.890
like veggie straws I don't think that

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.770
they're healthy I just enjoy the taste

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.209
of them and then we got lucky not to get

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.100
hit there by the way

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.500
well how many veggie straws would you

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.500
like thinking maybe I'll take like one

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.500
big bag oh you won big bang well the

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:23.820
closest unit that we have to that is a

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:26.139
20 small bags I guess I'll take 20 small

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.030
bags of veggie straws please

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.310
and you know what happens when you get

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.469
20 small bags of veggie straws yeah eat

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.689
20 small bags of veggie straws and it's

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:36.370
like you know I don't like veggie straws

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:39.189
as much as I used to anymore as a result

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.050
of that that's a bit of a fib i loved-ed

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:43.030
you straws they're delicious but you

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.860
know you understand this so we just let

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.289
our membership to Costco lapse but it's

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.939
a great company and to be honest with

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:51.069
you if you needed a membership to go to

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:52.659
the food court I might reconsider it but

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:55.719
considering I can still get those

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:58.569
delicious hotdogs for like a dollar

00:04:55.719 --> 00:05:01.870
fifty I'm not sweating it too much right

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:07.029
now right next to the flippin stadium to

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:08.650
bud going to go see 2017 28 teams worst

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:13.740
team in the NHL Vancouver can actually

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.740
get a quick little $3.75 per pin before

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.229
get yourself a little something

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:22.509
something you might be able to afford a

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:23.949
jersey after 10 seasons okay easy fight

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:25.779
against Montreal Bob's running head is

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:27.939
doing literally the bare minimum amount

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:31.389
of work but I respected placenta is

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:36.629
irrelevant but to guppy items has got me

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:39.250
three copy items has got me thinking

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:42.960
he's done it especially because one of

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:46.960
those Goffe items was nine lives so

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.240
we're really really almost completely

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.669
set as a result of the world's greatest

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.279
deal with the devil that is incredible

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:58.479
that has happened to us before but it is

00:05:54.279 --> 00:06:01.389
rare for guppy items okay we're at this

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:03.099
point what even is this world anymore in

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:04.750
two rooms the guys are technically three

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:06.789
I guess we have four guppy items

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.039
that's too many gothic items I'm not

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:10.779
complaining in fact I'm over the moon

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:12.009
this should be one of the easiest loss

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:14.169
runs we've ever had and now that I said

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:20.080
that I've invited the curse into my life

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:24.189
I feel evil creeping in but either way

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:26.500
we're going to be unreasonably well

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:29.949
positioned to have a great chance to win

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.689
today's daily and honestly with a keeper

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:34.390
went in there and a lost went in there

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:37.810
I'm really feeling like feeling

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:40.720
this is the chosen streak we've survived

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:42.370
the strife early on

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.820
well we haven't survived strife on this

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:48.970
run but largely we sort of have it's

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.980
already about as strong as like the

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:57.610
average winning lost run now our PSAPs

00:06:50.980 --> 00:07:01.780
are barely not good well fairly not good

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:03.490
for now pretty okay for a start but an

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.830
even start I guess but you get the idea

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.210
we can still obviously use an

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.040
improvement in terms of our overall

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.300
damage our rate of fire especially with

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.610
chocolate notes the faster we can get

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.840
that charge the better in fact at this

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.160
point it might be better to just get

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.010
something that causes us to lose

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:22.450
chocolate milk much to Robert in

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:26.820
Austin's vindication and I see we

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.820
obviously want to keep a copy said here

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:32.110
simply because it would allow some more

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.340
easily generate flies but not going to

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.770
sweat that too much right now what I am

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:37.840
gonna hope for is another great deal

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:40.180
with the devil and loss runs and keeper

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.060
runs you can ball out of control

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:46.420
with like no guilt whatsoever so moms

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:51.850
knife brimstone particularly brimstone

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:58.270
but by the way we may die a couple times

00:07:51.850 --> 00:08:00.370
on this run great time for that and

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.670
great you know payoff out of that as

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.160
well

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:06.520
obviously I'm a hoping that we don't but

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:10.060
we may die that's what's nice about

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:12.610
having nine lives is that even if we die

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:15.400
to get plenty of opportunities to pull

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:18.160
this run back but we shouldn't die if

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:20.950
only to say thank you to like the rng

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.900
gods for giving us the greatest like

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.890
deal with the devil you could ever have

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.340
is the lost

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:27.880
we shouldn't rebuke them by just like

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.940
failing miserably

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.950
soon afterwards right we also have 46

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:34.210
cents which is ridiculous considering

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:36.190
we're on the third floor which is why

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:40.120
I'm making such an effort to ensure that

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:42.130
we do get into our shop here because I

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.580
mean for one thing I really want hive

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:47.820
mind

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:47.820
I may be compost as well

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.590
of course plenty of other items that

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:56.020
would be good like I'm not going to say

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:57.130
no to a you know Pandora's box or a

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:59.950
champion belt sir

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:01.720
who knows what a Kaos does for us at

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:12.550
this point in our lives I got no idea

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:15.190
nine-volts etc etc but anything that ups

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:17.530
our damage is priority number one steam

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:19.690
sales pretty good and we will spend a

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.860
bomb to get no more money but a better

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:24.510
deal with the devil chance which is

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:27.520
meaningless either way this is an

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:29.320
exceptionally good set up steam sale you

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.120
know what are the odds that we're going

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:33.160
to go fight hush pretty lows so we

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.510
really need to make that work for us on

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.130
one of these future shops but it should

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:37.930
at the very least pay for itself and

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:39.550
under the right circumstances it's a

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:43.330
great enabler for something like reef

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:45.310
stock but even just being able to buy it

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.290
and still have at least four items in

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:48.520
the can that we can get here with the

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:52.330
amount of money that we presently have

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:56.020
is is totally fine and there's like

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:59.620
another two items right there so I do

00:09:56.020 --> 00:10:04.360
think you know prepare your ears for

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:07.890
being mildly annoyed wherever sensible

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.890
I'm going to try to do tap shooting

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.850
there are going to be some situations

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.350
where like if we're fighting pretty

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:16.690
small enemies I don't care how many

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:18.339
slides I generate you know if two or

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.810
three chocolate-milk charges is going to

00:10:18.339 --> 00:10:21.580
kill them anyway I'll just do that

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:23.260
because it's easier on my hands and

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.580
doesn't make too much of a difference in

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.410
our quality of life to begin with but

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:29.350
against bosses we might be doing some

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:31.270
nasty tap shooting so I mean that's the

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:33.400
reason that chocolate milk is I wouldn't

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:36.520
say hated but it's actually a very well

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:39.250
liked item based on the fact that I was

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:40.930
not necessarily well-liked myself for

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.980
saying you know two years ago I'm never

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:47.710
going to take chocolate milk because it

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:48.970
hurts my hands it's better in after

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:51.100
birth anyway so I mean this is obviously

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:53.320
great as well we take the mark we take

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:56.260
ceremonial rose we take Abaddon now our

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:59.620
damage is up in the eight range health

00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:01.740
up is meaningless but that's fine

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:03.640
and you know we're loving life right now

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:06.850
feels like I'm walking on sunshine

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:12.820
hematemesis who cares let's get a move

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:16.030
on so he basically more than doubled our

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:18.460
damage in one deal with the devil and by

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:19.900
basically I mean literally doubled our

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:22.690
damage from one deal with the devil with

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:24.940
no negative consequences whatsoever

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:26.350
don't others tell you straight up this

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.390
runs not getting rear old so if we come

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.190
across a double reroll room you know so

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:32.710
be it

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:35.860
that double reroll room will stay there

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:38.020
until the end of time you got hug allows

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.520
hug allows have a higher upper bound for

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:43.990
usefulness in the chariot but the

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:50.560
chariot is like a classic lost item for

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:52.600
us to roll with here it's not like we

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:56.350
need a saving grace we basically have 10

00:11:52.600 --> 00:12:01.600
failsafe or nine failsafe thanks to nine

00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:06.850
lives but I wouldn't say no to it brown

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:08.710
nugget vs. Guppies head is not a close

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:12.810
call I'm sorry to say dude we just got a

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:14.830
3-cent hive mind so dull razor is

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:16.930
actually what I'm going to take and

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:18.550
that's what I was going to say like you

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:24.600
know it's unfortunate for Brown nugget

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:28.180
but there's really no reason for me to

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:29.290
compromise myself on a lost run I think

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:33.160
that goes without saying

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:35.200
however dull razor has so much potential

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.640
good that could come out of it that I

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:40.440
don't see it as a compromise

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:43.210
I don't think Guffey gives you the

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.980
infestation effect but I keep using dull

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:46.450
razor now and then just in case it does

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.690
like you might as well get the extra

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:48.690
flies

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:56.090
I feel lucky punk do I yes

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:02.130
Dixon balls of steel it's irrelevant

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.690
feels like I'm walking on sunshine is

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:06.440
the same as the chariot basically except

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:08.460
the chariot does contact damage so

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.900
obviously this is much better we got

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.760
such a good run though I'm just waiting

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:13.950
for the dull razor payout that's a tears

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:17.070
upgrade and a fairly substantial one

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:19.380
dude we are crushing it like a hydraulic

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.880
press right now and this is you know I

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.890
talk sometimes I'm like well you know

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.300
the odds of you winning is a composite

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:26.190
of your own personal play as well as the

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.990
quality of the run that you get not in

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:29.730
this case our odds of winning are pretty

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:32.190
much 100% dependent on the fact that

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:34.470
we've our honor percent influenced at

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:36.750
least by the fact that we got like the

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:40.440
greatest possible loss payouts of all

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:42.810
time even on our last deal with the

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.070
devil we got like super good things for

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.110
the loss considering they were free I

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:48.180
mean speed upgrades not that bad mr.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:51.270
mega is sort of relevant for us clicker

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:53.100
is like a you know betrays the spirit of

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:56.250
the random but could theoretically be

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.900
good and take papa fly which should do

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:59.700
almost nothing for us but at least

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:04.160
contributes towards Beelzebub which

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:04.160
should also do almost nothing for us

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:19.130
because we can already fly and generate

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:21.020
flies at our leisure basically I'm just

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:24.020
waiting on like a same a same really

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:26.570
pulls this one into the 21st century not

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:27.860
we don't even need the extra spirit art

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:29.420
that means people as range is good too

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:33.710
but we don't even need the extra spirit

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:35.390
arts via theme we just need a we just

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:36.590
need the extra damage and to be honest

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:38.090
2d we don't need the extra damage I need

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:40.460
to tell from the fact that you know I'm

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:41.750
actually doing my posts Isaac stretch 14

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:46.250
minutes into a lost run that we are

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:51.440
going to win this run there was probably

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:55.130
like a 95% chance we win when we first

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:56.960
got guppy I think it's actually it's

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:58.550
only gone up since then with the fact

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.550
that you know we picked up that super

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:03.380
cheap hive mind and then Abaddonn mark

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:07.790
ceremonial robes for free is an

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:08.990
unbelievable deal so this is you know

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.400
some of you out there might still be

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:11.420
trying to get your lost achievements it

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.880
you're going to be looking at this and

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:18.830
going he's the luckiest man in the world

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:21.260
and I am you know I lead a life that I

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:22.880
enjoy and I find fulfilling as long as

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.140
I'm not being yelled effort accidentally

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:27.830
using the wrong episode number but

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:29.810
either way you know what fishhead dull

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:31.280
razor dude it's got something you've got

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:39.440
to admit it's got something going on

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:41.450
here but you shouldn't expect this if it

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.880
happens to you it happens but this is

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:46.490
even for me this is a little on the

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.980
outrageous side so effectively what does

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:53.120
the Rays are giving us right now it's

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:55.070
twice as bad for half as good is a more

00:15:53.120 --> 00:16:05.060
positive way to describe that we will

00:15:55.070 --> 00:16:07.580
take chaos it's half as good as Guppies

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:10.270
head but it stands to get better in the

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.270
future as well

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:15.710
you know because we can stack up more

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:17.720
things that affect us on hit we just

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:20.420
don't need the ladder so we like what do

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:24.830
we care get the heck out of here we

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:26.180
might want to do boss rush I would the

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:27.860
thing that would make boss rush an easy

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:30.020
do for me as if we got either void

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.190
although losing the dull razor for it

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.980
would sting a little weed you know

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:35.570
examine that at a case-by-case basis or

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.760
a black rune in a black room would be

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:39.350
lovely obviously a teleport card would

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.990
be important as well I got a recording

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:44.270
session scheduled in four hours so let

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:48.590
me check Skype here and see why it says

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:50.030
our IP oh it says our IP because I said

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:53.420
to Austin I couldn't play player

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:55.100
unknowns battleground until later

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.480
tonight when we're doing our recording

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.250
session that's that's a perfectly

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.200
respectable Skype message office I'm not

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:02.180
putting you on blast but you know when

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.740
the Skype preview when it says our IP I

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.750
know that we're on the internet and our

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.610
IP doesn't necessarily mean somebody

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:09.410
died but I was like I better make sure

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:11.570
just in case that would definitely add a

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:17.650
little you know a different tone to the

00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:21.470
rest of the video luckily no worries

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:25.760
so what do we have to do to stay alive

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:28.610
on this run basically as long as we

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:31.550
don't you know our IP ourselves in real

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:33.350
life we shouldn't have a conceivable

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:35.930
chance to die and the emperor card is

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:38.140
like that's free boss rush so I'm

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:41.720
excited and experimental treatment is a

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:45.680
luck upgrade but it tears down grade so

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:46.880
it's the mildest of mild bombers now I

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.080
don't think we've had two tiers upgrade

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.670
on this one I think that was the earlier

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.200
run than ever recorded today but we will

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:52.850
check mom's coin purse regardless you

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:56.440
never know health up is irrelevant

00:17:52.850 --> 00:18:00.200
walking on sunshine explosive diarrhea

00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:01.790
and I found pills and we don't need

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:05.300
anything else unless we'd like want a

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:09.830
bomb for whatever reason which I don't

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:12.080
believe that we do so honestly I think

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:13.970
we're pretty much good to go although we

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:16.400
will go to the item room as well it's

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:19.700
weird but I have to remind you that it's

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:23.060
extremely blessed if you have a lost run

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:25.520
that has the luxury of being boring you

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:29.300
know I'm just realizing now that maybe

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:32.540
the fishhead actually does not give us

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:36.640
oh you know what dull razor actually

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:38.750
stinks as the lost because we're not

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.500
simulating taking damage we've had this

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:41.510
happen before

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:43.190
instead of simulating taking damage I'm

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:45.500
pretty sure it actually just cost you

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:47.360
your holy mantle charge so we should get

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.220
rid of something we should have stuck

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:52.820
with guppies head but you know it's not

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:54.230
the biggest loss in the world what we

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:59.870
should do is look for a space bar item

00:18:54.230 --> 00:19:03.440
to replace it again not a not a big

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:05.540
problem and if we ever lose our like you

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.280
know walk into that then we get the

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.960
extra flies we saw the circle expand

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:12.980
there but it's not an efficient way to

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:15.770
handle this item so we're going to need

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:20.140
a better way to take advantage of this

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:25.400
rule ok our item room is just bereft

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:28.520
where where could it be now is that has

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:31.010
that episode gone up yet the player

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:35.270
unknown battlegrounds episode who could

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:36.050
it be now from current plan down who

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:39.200
could it be

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:43.240
ok it's a good episode but without my

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.240
backup singers I can't carry it as much

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:50.809
well ok I'll steal with the devil

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:54.710
as peter baelish said you know chaos

00:19:50.809 --> 00:19:58.910
isn't a pit it's a ladder it would be

00:19:54.710 --> 00:20:00.980
ironic if we got the ladder after saying

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:05.120
that but let's go over going polaroid

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:08.840
going in here Hadrian ever knew about

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:16.040
this one is also you'll be very barely I

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:19.460
mean why not I guess but mystery sack is

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:21.470
our item of choice unfortunately anyway

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:23.450
yeah I almost bought them but then I

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:25.520
thought better of it because I mean we

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:27.920
are still compromising ourselves

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:32.179
slightly to make that work and even

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:35.040
losing one life means something albeit

00:20:32.179 --> 00:20:40.870
very very little

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:42.880
mostly it's a needless use of time if we

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:44.830
were unbelievably strong like if we had

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:48.940
shoopdawhoop which might actually be the

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:51.190
most likely and excellent replacement

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:53.380
for dull razor I would probably do it

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:59.530
because I imagine she would probably

00:20:53.380 --> 00:21:01.150
lead to us killing every wave instantly

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:02.230
except for the ones that obviously like

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.700
start underground

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:05.700
we've got golden bombs so I don't feel

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:09.010
too bad about that at the time

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:11.290
Samson's lock I guess in theory there is

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:14.410
a play there what we could do is like

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:16.870
get one enemy left walk into these guys

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:18.340
then use that and as Samson's lock give

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:22.260
us a damage bonus for that because

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:22.260
that's kind of what I'm banking on here

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:27.910
you know an opportunity for us to take

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:34.800
damage in a safe environment is actually

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:37.210
very nice real fortune temperance both

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:39.610
not that amazing but Wheel of Fortune

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:43.330
does have relevance if we go down to the

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:44.080
shop bombs and money less likely to have

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:46.600
relevance

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.590
the only time money will have relevance

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.900
is that we choose to go to the hush

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:52.600
fight in all likelihood and that's not

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:55.150
going to happen unless we get a chaos

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:57.550
card which as we know is not even a

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:58.690
chaos card it's a ladder but either

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:00.900
would see that's not a good peter

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:00.900
baelish

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:09.390
he has many different voices this is the

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:09.390
one in what you should not trust him

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:14.770
you're right by the way I said that was

00:22:13.179 --> 00:22:22.030
a Bobby Boucher voice but it's really

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:23.740
more of a little Nicky voice we care

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:27.670
about that unless we can get a chest on

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:29.620
that room dude for room plus butter is

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:31.300
what we need like for room gift butter

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.410
you know the gift that you get from the

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.690
shop that allows you to endlessly

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:39.520
recreate items that's the moneymaker

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:41.650
right there I finally found a use for

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:43.830
four rooms on the womb and they use for

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:43.830
butter

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:53.090
and you can also use it as a spread for

00:22:50.299 --> 00:22:55.730
your bread based foods or as a fad in

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:58.820
cooking to crisp up foods nice okay yeah

00:22:55.730 --> 00:23:01.160
you sure okay we're gonna take the son

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.929
card and use it as a map and again we're

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.750
losing an item by doing so we're also

00:23:02.929 --> 00:23:07.280
regaining part of our sanity because

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:09.830
there's no reason for us to do all of

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:11.750
the Cathedral just so we can get what

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:17.390
might amount to being a pretty crappy

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:19.730
item Plan C is garbage admittedly maybe

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:23.630
9lives is the right time to use it but I

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:24.650
don't think so I think Lazarus rag is

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:26.419
the right time to use it because you

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:28.669
respond on the same room in that way if

00:23:26.419 --> 00:23:32.210
the animation to kill the enemy probably

00:23:28.669 --> 00:23:37.820
a boss takes too long you're still going

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:39.200
to be fine so we want to go this way I'm

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:41.000
not going to go to the arcade because I

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.020
am never going to play a blood bank and

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
I don't care about playing a slot

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:47.480
machine or a three skull Monte as much

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.190
and I'm not going to go I will go to the

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.950
curse room and I will look at the dice

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:55.520
room but I'm being straight up with you

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:56.960
I will never reroll this run if I could

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:59.510
reroll it and guarantee we would still

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:01.640
have nine lives I would be okay with it

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:04.429
because I think we could make almost any

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:07.190
run work right now I'm going to go to

00:24:04.429 --> 00:24:08.750
the girls room I can't resist and this

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:10.220
might be the best payout for us bureau

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:12.140
dogs do nothing and we're already guppy

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:15.380
so a son and an emperor dude

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:16.610
sign me up so we'll use the emperor card

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:23.049
on the cathedral and this is going to be

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:25.100
like rapid fire loss shenanigans and

00:24:23.049 --> 00:24:28.130
anon susurrus we're getting a little

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:32.059
ridiculous but we did get the key okay

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:33.640
well check the double key room I knew

00:24:32.059 --> 00:24:36.049
they were going to ask me to do it and

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:37.669
you know that I'm going to do it but

00:24:36.049 --> 00:24:43.280
first I'm going to kill the boss so we

00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:44.929
will maintain our gubbeen as' kill the

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.419
boss first we will maintain our

00:24:44.929 --> 00:24:54.559
governess

00:24:46.419 --> 00:24:56.179
however we will change this run-up and

00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:57.470
we'll probably lose nine lives I assume

00:24:56.179 --> 00:25:01.789
and we'll never know if we have a one up

00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:03.919
unless we spot it got to take it dude

00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:05.299
why not I guess we get Leviathan we

00:25:03.919 --> 00:25:06.440
should stick with that transformation as

00:25:05.299 --> 00:25:08.030
well we're the law so we're going to be

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:11.530
able to fly regardless but you're gonna

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:11.530
say what was all that talk about not uh

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:16.490
what was all that talk about not re

00:25:14.659 --> 00:25:20.870
rollin the run well you should know by

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:23.330
now that my word is worth nothing and

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:25.669
that was before I knew we were going to

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:26.870
have a reroll item or a reroll room I

00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:28.880
should say now that I see that we got a

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:33.559
rear roller room you got to do it that's

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:35.630
just as easy as it comes so we will not

00:25:33.559 --> 00:25:40.549
even have the holy mantle anymore which

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:43.010
is hilarious but you know what as far as

00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:45.590
I'm concerned we already won this run by

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:48.070
default we won now we're doing the slam

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:48.070
dunk competition

00:25:53.269 --> 00:26:00.360
it's up to us to have an interesting run

00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:05.870
no no that is actually suicide but the

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:08.730
reroll is as far as I'll go here okay

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:13.380
and these are decent items dude maybe

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:15.510
not tiny planet but without holy mantle

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:18.990
and without knowing whether or not we

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:21.750
have lives a pretty reasonable chance

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:23.970
that we will just die the first time we

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:28.559
get hit and not come back to life so I

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:31.440
mean I'd rather not our damage is great

00:26:28.559 --> 00:26:32.370
that doesn't really protect us I don't

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:34.889
know if there's any way I mean we could

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:36.600
look into the menu and see if there's a

00:26:34.889 --> 00:26:38.669
chance we'd come back to life lay we see

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:40.320
if we have a one-up I can't remember one

00:26:38.669 --> 00:26:44.070
up actually manifests itself as a

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:46.139
familiar or not but when you rather just

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:48.210
discover it on the fly and kind of live

00:26:46.139 --> 00:26:50.490
with this uncertainty until the moment

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:55.919
presents itself the way I choose to live

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:57.659
my life here and this makes the wind

00:26:55.919 --> 00:27:00.659
that much more impressive and you know

00:26:57.659 --> 00:27:01.710
what again we already get the credit for

00:27:00.659 --> 00:27:04.860
the wind as far as I'm concerned the

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:11.070
streak wont increment if we die but we

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:15.510
won that run there was almost literally

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:16.380
zero chance of a loss so we've sold that

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:19.230
run hi

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:21.899
we bought low as the lost where nobody

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:23.279
well nobody would have given us like an

00:27:21.899 --> 00:27:24.630
80% chance that way and people probably

00:27:23.279 --> 00:27:26.940
would have given us you know two-thirds

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:33.090
maybe based on previous loss play I

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:34.559
suppose but and we sold high weary

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:37.889
rolled it from a guaranteed winner to

00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:43.309
something else to try to make the dream

00:27:37.889 --> 00:27:47.100
happen so far can't complain

00:27:43.309 --> 00:27:49.679
22 damage with a 14 rate of fire pretty

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:52.409
solid but all it takes is one all dude

00:27:49.679 --> 00:27:55.409
this is actually huge all it takes is

00:27:52.409 --> 00:27:58.639
one a Burin room two one aberrant attack

00:27:55.409 --> 00:27:58.639
really to kind of throw it

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:06.289
that scared me who could it be

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:11.429
dude mob the void is actually crushing

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:13.380
it to such an extreme degree here so

00:28:11.429 --> 00:28:14.970
always whenever possible move away from

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:16.799
the origin point when you're trying to

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:18.929
find the boss room gotta kill him before

00:28:16.799 --> 00:28:21.240
he doesn't attack for maximum certainty

00:28:18.929 --> 00:28:22.919
so just beat this room without getting

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:28.620
hit pop holy card on the box fight

00:28:22.919 --> 00:28:30.240
you're probably fine alright well this

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:32.909
was a great run for my personal

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.110
reputation and I feel excellent thanks
