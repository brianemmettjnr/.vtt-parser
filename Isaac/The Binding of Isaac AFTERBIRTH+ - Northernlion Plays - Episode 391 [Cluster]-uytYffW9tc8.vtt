##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.470
everybody will come back Andrew the land

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.630
please the binding about the birth plus

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:13.139
we finally got something done as Lilith

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:19.670
on today's episode of seen Isaac has

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:22.170
gone all the way Maggie she's got a beat

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.180
basically the entire game on the light

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.949
side and then some I'm not even talking

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.320
about green mode yet or the challenges

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.080
for that matter but you know what let's

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.730
not get some freakin challenges dude we

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:39.210
have about a million of them good lord

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.250
uh we got a lot of them but we should do

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.660
them because they unlock things now I

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.789
know that some of the things they unlock

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.129
suck but I want to do them anyway

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.690
because I you know why not add a little

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.550
bit more in the game right I totally

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.230
forget happenings pitchblack I'm

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.539
assuming curse of Darkness 8 qy 7 3 d WN

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.199
this one only goes to moms hearts oh

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.180
sorry - mom's foot is this just f you

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.110
know what I've already done this once

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.990
where we trying to figure them out on

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.630
the fly let's go pitch black Isaac

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.100
what's the whip this challenge curses of

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.909
darkness and curse of the unknown on

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.040
every level

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.820
unlike other challenges treasure rooms

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.380
are available the shops are not ok so

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.049
curse of the on that we can't see our HP

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.900
and we can't see well anything at all

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.479
really facile wait that's two different

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.460
movies one of them is the Cable Guy

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.430
where he goes into the bathroom and he

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.640
says to a blind bathroom intended you

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.500
didn't happen to see anything at all did

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.270
you and the other one is what does it

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.250
all mean basil Mike Myers

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.990
fellow Canadian comedian and also a

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.970
National Order of Canada holder probably

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.030
provide two guests but different

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.420
different movies came out a distance

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.490
apart

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.990
no no doubt about that either way this I

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.210
mean boluses be real this challenge

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.659
seems extremely easy and I'm still a

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.119
little like self-conscious

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.759
let's be good so little self-conscious

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.989
of the fact that you know these episodes

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.209
have been a little bit shorter because

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.010
they're not endgame them so they don't

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.660
go as far as the other ones agreed Mo's

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.720
easy and we usually end up getting what

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.630
we need pretty early on etc etc and as a

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.459
result maybe we'll be able to fit in two

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.120
challenges because if I'm being real

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.340
with you

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.410
this first one does not seem like a

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:32.120
problem at all I don't know what my HP

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.560
is but I do because it's Isaac we have

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.239
to keep beads on you know how much

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.239
damage we take but apart from that and

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.560
then we also have curses of darkness

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.299
which really doesn't matter unless we're

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.560
on the burning basement for the most but

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.739
one of those curses like you barely

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.540
notice I guess if we encounter like

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.390
enemies that leave red creep that could

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.069
be annoying as well but I'm trying to

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.110
think like are there enemies that leave

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.400
red creep this early on there's

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.769
definitely some in the womb and I only

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.540
remember that because so often I end up

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:04.069
walking on their creep by accident

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.069
I'm walking on their window what the

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:10.340
hell am I doing here

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:12.590
taking bad damage anyway that's what I

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.150
wanted right there crack this bad boy

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.640
open yeah there you go

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.100
look at that turn to turn to bomb and a

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.079
key into a bomb and a key wait nope

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.139
turned a bomb into a bomb and a key

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:26.359
that's a pretty good deal how big was

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:28.549
prozac in America not the antidepressant

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.870
but the band's the Canadian cartoon band

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.720
of course by the way we ended up on the

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.810
burning basement they had a little track

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.290
for on hot show it was called Ambala

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.650
sure a but because we could mix it up if

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.709
it's unaccessible enough anecdote whoa

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:49.580
obama Aniki

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:56.450
you know that Isaac means you got a bomb

00:03:49.580 --> 00:04:00.890
Aniki hang on because I'm on the way I

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.720
didn't see the end of that dude I was

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.450
thinking the other day I know a very

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.010
common NL tangent is how lucky we are to

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.780
live in the future and there's bad

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:13.099
things about it too like the fact that

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:15.019
you know incomes have stagnated for like

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.790
you know thirty years relative to

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.100
inflation so you're effectively making

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.840
like less money now working with the

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.760
bachelors degree potentially than your

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.870
dad was working at a gas station fresh

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.699
out of high school but anyway I digress

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.050
everyone everyone knows about the bad

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:33.710
parts what about the good parts when I

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.690
was a kid maybe like ten years old but

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.000
it is not even like a question here I'll

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.460
take the Apple here which also was the

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.580
tears upgrade I didn't realize when I

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.380
was a kid I went to Nova Scotia with my

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.479
parents or sorry moves my grandparents

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.919
the whole story's falling apart now

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.340
I went to Nova Scotia with my

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:54.110
grandparents from Ontario is like a I

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.849
mean as a kid it felt like months but we

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.250
took like three days or four days to

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:59.870
drive there probably like six or seven

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.590
hours each day it's like it's 30 hour

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:07.039
drive it's no joke my parents were like

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.860
hey before you go you know you have a

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:13.340
discman I'm just a little scared about

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.880
this eh aka a portable CD player so we

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:19.430
call them back in the day

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.419
why don't like we'll buy you a CD if you

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.860
go on this vacation with your

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.240
grandparents and I'm realizing now it's

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.580
actually like the cheapest take care of

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.830
all time it's like a twenty dollar CD I

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.030
didn't get a hot show buy prozac I

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.860
bought that one with my own money a

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.520
little bit later I got Americana by The

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.530
Offspring

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.849
and I had to convince my parents to let

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.070
me get it I was like it's got some

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:37.550
mature themes but I think I can handle

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:42.979
it

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:44.180
give it to me baby haha yeah I don't I

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:46.430
don't know if I would describe that

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.210
album as mature I guess the kids are all

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.650
aren't alright is kind of

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:54.360
anyway this is irrelevant is the thing

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.520
but yeah that was like a gift and I'm

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.020
not saying I lived like a terribly

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.229
impoverished life you know quite the

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.970
opposite to see if I can get in here I

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:06.949
know I have half a spear at art at least

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:09.720
possibly a pole spear at our per second

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:13.289
there are enemies that leave red creep

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:17.009
as we're now intimately familiar either

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:19.380
way but it was like an ask you know it

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:20.759
was $20 to buy one albums worth of music

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.190
I know I guess I'm still living you're

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:26.039
still buying CDs or like full albums on

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:30.900
iTunes but my Google Play subscription

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:33.210
is like 10 or 15 dollars a month I get

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.720
unlimited access to whatever music I

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.669
want

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:39.419
it's like CDs were so expensive oh

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:42.419
here's the start of buying their kids

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:45.539
with razor blade razor blade no but CDs

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:47.910
were so expensive it you know when the

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:50.490
piracy wave hit there was like an

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.470
overcorrection and now it's like it's so

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.810
dang cheap it makes me feel guilty about

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.849
paying for music like I feel like I

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.400
should send you some more money for this

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:02.849
because you know back in the day I was

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:06.349
spending $25 $20 maybe per CD for junk

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:11.130
albums remember in high school

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:12.539
HMV which was like a by the way I'm just

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.550
realizing I still have my Google tab

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:16.710
open in the background and my own video

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.210
of pitch black the Isaac challenge came

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.870
up in the search results so that's

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:22.590
encouraging

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:24.300
keep searching those keep searching

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:27.419
those eyes and challenges please

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:29.849
but either way HMV

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:31.770
you know a meze ik retailer that still

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:35.430
exists to some extent in canada but is

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:36.509
like is having trouble as you know you

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.130
could probably guess from the fact that

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:40.380
don't sell music so much anymore it's

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.620
like posters of Mad Max fury road but I

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.710
digress

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.870
[Music]

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.979
when I was in high school and I got into

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:50.340
being a music snob

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:52.880
HMV had like a three CDs for $15

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:55.560
promotion and I was like this is my jam

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.100
remain in tongues wait that's different

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.050
to different

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.280
Talking Heads albums remain in light

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:01.530
who's next

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.389
my bloody Valentines loveless there's

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:05.460
three right there thank you very much

00:08:03.389 --> 00:08:07.139
it wasn't any three CDs because of

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.240
course then you could use that you can

00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:10.860
scan the system by actually buying a CD

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.580
that was new and should be worth like

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:16.020
twenty two dollars like uh sure's uh

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.530
burned or would have confessions part

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.509
two

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:23.729
okay it's been a while so I'm saying

00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:29.789
Green Day's American Idiot yeah things

00:08:23.729 --> 00:08:30.780
are things achieve sort of there I mean

00:08:29.789 --> 00:08:32.010
they're cheap and they're not cheap

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.930
because I was thinking about it the

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:35.070
other day cuz I wouldn't say it was an

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:38.669
argument but Nick and I had a discussion

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:41.550
about the PlayStation Plus prizes let me

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:45.120
rephrase this PlayStation Plus prices

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:46.709
rising in the UK previously this goes

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.410
into effect like August 31st or

00:08:46.709 --> 00:08:53.490
something like that in the UK it was

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:55.620
like 39.99 you know basically 40 pounds

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:57.540
per year to have PlayStation Plus and

00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.089
now it's going up to 50 that's a huge

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:02.100
there's a 20% incurred 25 percent

00:09:00.089 --> 00:09:03.380
increase I suppose depending which

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.209
perspective you're looking at there

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:09.900
that's a lot but at the same time and

00:09:06.209 --> 00:09:13.770
this is a little anti-consumer of me but

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:16.430
I was paying you know $80 Canadian for

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:18.900
games back in like the year 2000 and

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:20.490
games have just now with like the

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.160
destruction of the Canadian dollar which

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:26.400
is now reversing thankfully for people

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:28.529
who don't get paid in USD Wawa but it's

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:31.980
probably good for my countrymen so

00:09:28.529 --> 00:09:34.680
anyway the point is you know gangs

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:38.370
recently were like price raised up to 70

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:40.320
or even 80 bucks in in Canada up from 60

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:43.529
where they had been since like 2006 or

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:46.079
something like that but I was paying $80

00:09:43.529 --> 00:09:47.670
for n64 games back in like 1998 and I

00:09:46.079 --> 00:09:50.760
understand you know the concept of

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:52.230
inflation stuff like that so I mean it's

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.120
a complicated economic thing I'm just

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.360
saying I for the most part I understand

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.530
price raises

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.840
because otherwise your revenues get

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:02.030
eaten up 100% by the rising you know

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.160
inflation rate not rising inflation

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:05.780
rates for just inflation the same reason

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.720
you don't want to just have you know

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:11.290
your savings sitting in cash in your

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:14.120
bank account if you have an excess I

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:16.340
think we can afford to go for broke here

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.530
I mean we probably should take this

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:20.300
because we haven't seen it in the game

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.770
yet but it's a little risky I suppose I

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.030
don't even know if oh yeah we get no

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.400
achievements for this so that was kind

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:27.440
of a waste but you know if you've got

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:30.620
your money making 0.5 percent per year

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.780
in a savings account but inflation is 2%

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.910
a year effectively you're losing 1.5

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:40.040
percent of your money annually anyway I

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:41.930
digress the point is I originally I was

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.370
like on Sony side a little bit I was

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.720
like yeah everything costs more money as

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:47.300
time goes on you know I don't want to be

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:49.820
one of those people who's like Oh $2 for

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:53.000
a coke back in my day it was a nickel

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:54.440
I mean minimum wage was 14 cents an hour

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.900
but you know I mean where you become a

00:10:54.440 --> 00:11:01.760
net confident you know raising the

00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:04.580
prices by like 10 pounds in one year is

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:08.420
like a prohibitive increase and I think

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:10.100
people were justifiably kind of upset

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.720
about if I'm of two minds about it

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.550
really is what I'm getting at but I

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:17.120
understand you know prices and things

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:20.930
rise wages have stagnated a little bit

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:23.290
it's all the side hustle now I like I'm

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:25.400
of two minds about something like uber I

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:28.520
feel like it's such a complicated issue

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:30.800
like everybody has an opinion on on uber

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:34.160
and lyft and etc etc and I'm talking

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:37.280
absent the you know the politics of the

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:40.460
brass rather just judging the service on

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.650
its merits it's so good and it's so much

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:44.660
cheaper than using a taxi but I feel

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:47.660
guilty using it because I'm like I'm

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:50.810
literally supporting the race to the

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:52.880
bottom you know I'm not saying when if

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:56.210
we took a taxi from our apartment to the

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.560
airport it's like 30 bucks we don't have

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:59.570
a liver in Vancouver because they fought

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:01.310
back against them before they

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:03.860
get it in here but it's been kind of

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:07.910
like on the agenda for years and years

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:10.340
either way well it let's just use like

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:12.950
Boston as an example you know a better

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:14.660
example would be like LA in LA when we

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:18.110
went there for e3 last year we took a

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:21.920
taxi from the airport to our hotel and

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:23.480
it it cost us like 40 or 50 bucks it was

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:28.430
expensive I understand the airport is

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:32.720
like outside of Los Angeles I mean it's

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:36.350
better sort of here damage served no we

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:38.660
have two floors left okay um don't care

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:40.430
about that uh yeah let's grab this maybe

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.140
we can make this work for us a little on

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:45.980
the compromising side but that's fine

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:47.600
anyway so yeah they and I was okay to

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.830
pay it because I've taken tags to my

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.140
whole life but I was like man as an

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:53.390
expensive taxi on the way back we took

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:55.970
an uber from where we were staying to

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:58.070
the airport and it was like 18 dollars

00:12:55.970 --> 00:13:01.310
is literally like one third of the price

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:05.480
and you're like how could I not take

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:07.160
this I know that especially and people

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.600
are always going to say oh you don't

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.470
understand was like me a taxi driver no

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:14.090
I do I do actually like my grandfather

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:17.840
usually use a journeyman you have many

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:19.910
careers you know drywaller various

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.640
different kinds of construction computer

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:25.070
repair and finally a taxi driver so I'm

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:27.670
very sympathetic to this you know you

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:31.220
buy your way into what is essentially a

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:32.750
racket and then you know these this

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.890
upstart comes in and is just like I

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:35.810
don't really care about your rules we're

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:38.240
just going to like undercut you by one

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:41.630
third and everybody's going to use us

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.649
but at the same time like it what it

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:45.230
will continue

00:13:42.649 --> 00:13:46.670
I fight every time I'm in the u.s. I'm

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:49.999
like I'm good at you Zuber it's just

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:51.759
cheaper and I do understand the concerns

00:13:49.999 --> 00:13:53.899
about the platform but it's still like

00:13:51.759 --> 00:13:55.930
we don't need to do anything else is for

00:13:53.899 --> 00:13:58.639
there's no shops it still makes sense

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:59.689
but then sometimes you know in Vancouver

00:13:58.639 --> 00:14:01.339
if we're going to the airport we got to

00:13:59.689 --> 00:14:04.339
get in the taxi and the taxi driver is

00:14:01.339 --> 00:14:07.040
like driving like a maniac I've it's

00:14:04.339 --> 00:14:08.929
it's weird that the cheaper service also

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.879
seems to have better service most of the

00:14:08.929 --> 00:14:13.600
time you know I feel like I'm in this

00:14:10.879 --> 00:14:16.309
weird self-policing

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:19.009
kind of quandary where I'm like I should

00:14:16.309 --> 00:14:21.379
put my life in greater danger by

00:14:19.009 --> 00:14:23.869
supporting the taxi because it's like a

00:14:21.379 --> 00:14:26.509
fair wage as opposed to like the uber

00:14:23.869 --> 00:14:31.519
driver you know you drive me half an

00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:33.559
hour and you're making like $4 on that

00:14:31.519 --> 00:14:34.339
ride like you're the over drivers are

00:14:33.559 --> 00:14:36.110
making peanuts

00:14:34.339 --> 00:14:39.949
it's a side hustle but nobody's getting

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:42.679
rich I think at least and I have

00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:44.660
sympathy for that you know if you as

00:14:42.679 --> 00:14:46.339
with many things the real answer or the

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:48.019
ideal answer is maybe somewhere in the

00:14:46.339 --> 00:14:49.370
middle but I also don't really know what

00:14:48.019 --> 00:14:55.459
I'm talking about I'm just saying it's

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:57.350
confusing okay that's what it's like to

00:14:55.459 --> 00:14:59.569
be a millennial in this day and age I

00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:01.429
mean I'll just level you I'm lucky I'm

00:14:59.569 --> 00:15:03.350
outside of the rat race right but I

00:15:01.429 --> 00:15:05.600
sympathize with the fact that you know

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:07.970
wages have stagnated so what do you do

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:10.009
you're getting you know bent over by all

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:12.050
these media properties you say ah you

00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:14.509
know Millennials are killing Applebee's

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:17.720
yeah why would why would people pay you

00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:19.970
know $17 to get a case of via Applebee's

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.949
when they can you can eat out of a jar

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:24.800
of peanut butter for two dollars a

00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:28.009
kilogram or something like that you know

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:29.839
we wages a stagnating people don't have

00:15:28.009 --> 00:15:32.509
disposable income to support the

00:15:29.839 --> 00:15:34.160
businesses that have previously you know

00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:35.720
perhaps flourished under a different

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.449
generation not to mention just taste

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:40.850
change I mean very few people are going

00:15:38.449 --> 00:15:42.559
to number one be like I'd a let's go to

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:44.240
an Applebee's everybody everybody get in

00:15:42.559 --> 00:15:46.279
your cars let's go mean at Applebee's

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.899
for my birthday party it's a rare

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:49.730
situation for like a twenty-something to

00:15:47.899 --> 00:15:52.339
watch that but you know you can't have

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:54.139
it both ways here of course you know the

00:15:52.339 --> 00:15:55.519
less you pay the generation that's up

00:15:54.139 --> 00:15:55.750
and coming the more businesses are going

00:15:55.519 --> 00:15:57.610
to

00:15:55.750 --> 00:16:00.940
for as a result widget where's the money

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:02.500
supposed to come from same thing you're

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:04.480
like you know but as a millennial you're

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:06.280
like I gotta take uber is as well as

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.570
anybody I guess as a consumer you're

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.320
just gonna sign I think uber is the

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:13.390
cheaper service but super drivers making

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:15.850
no money as a result the uber driver is

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:17.620
late he's ended up in the same boat as

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:20.020
you I just saved that or no I'm getting

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:23.470
too deep in my own that in my own world

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:25.930
here I suppose but it's just food for

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:28.330
thought and as with everything that I

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:31.090
bring up here I'm probably ignorant of

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:32.050
not the entire issue necessarily but of

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:34.300
some things that are major

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:37.630
considerations for the entire issue we

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:40.870
can make do with that and as a result I

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:43.930
never wanna and I'm like so not one of

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:46.150
those YouTube guys who is like hey I

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:48.550
know you came for the gameplay but like

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:51.220
here's how you know eat the rich etc

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:53.860
etcetera right here's what I feel about

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:56.230
you know the the rise of modern

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:59.440
socialism I'm not that YouTube guy and I

00:16:56.230 --> 00:17:01.570
will never be that YouTube guy just

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:04.930
because I have no interest in it

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:06.459
and also I don't I mean I don't have

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:07.480
that high of an opinion to myself to

00:17:06.459 --> 00:17:08.860
think that I should be pushing my

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:12.160
opinions on other people but I digress

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:14.589
anyway the point is it's just food for

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.839
thought you know it's just it's just

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:18.699
conversation

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:20.319
I'm trying to give you food for thought

00:17:18.699 --> 00:17:22.660
as well and maybe you know we can like

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:24.189
meet in the middle somewhere in long

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.959
live me and you know what I say it as

00:17:24.189 --> 00:17:30.970
much for me as well maybe you guys could

00:17:25.959 --> 00:17:32.740
teach me something that oh that was just

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:36.040
horrible maybe you guys could teach me

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:37.810
something that could you know elevate my

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:41.440
understanding of the issue as well do

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:41.980
you use uber do you not use uber why or

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:46.150
why not

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:47.860
I really need I mean I probably don't

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:49.390
need it but I want something to take me

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:52.810
over the top here that's definitely not

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:54.880
going to do it shears is real good but I

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:56.560
mean it does sort of work with

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.900
illuminated bulb but I think we can make

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:01.500
illuminated bulb yeah I think we can

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:05.830
make illuminated bulb work better for us

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:07.660
by holding isaacs or sorry Guppies head

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:09.330
here because it overshot to be just way

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:14.740
too high

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:16.860
this dry baby nice to see it card is

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:19.150
High Priestess they're both great I

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:23.800
think we want high priestess the first

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:25.180
damage is probably better right now it's

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.770
probably going to make it to Vancouver

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:28.720
eventually we're like it living in a

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:31.270
different part of the world at this

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:32.140
point you know I can't believe that we

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:34.360
still don't have any form of

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:35.980
ride-sharing but maybe it's a good thing

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.970
too the way I understand it I mean me

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.340
it's not such a great thing for the

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:44.410
consumer but the way I understand how /

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:46.030
is kind of risen to it the size it is

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:49.510
today is basically they just kind of

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:55.180
like set up in cities and then by the

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:57.910
time you know people the taxi industry

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:59.650
was like can we stop this consumers were

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:01.630
already like demanding which they should

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:06.010
be usually a better service and also

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:07.450
cheaper but anyway I died I digress you

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:09.520
know why I encountered something today

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:12.730
in our in our gig based side hustle

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:14.410
economy I had a rare fit of righteous

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:19.990
anger and I know you're saying rare fit

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:23.560
yeah okay you got me um but oh I

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:24.460
shouldn't have done that um Kate just

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.860
feeling a little bit under the weather

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:30.910
so she's like hey NL she doesn't call me

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:32.440
NL we're married she doesn't use any pet

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:33.430
name for me she just says hey do this

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.260
that's a joke

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:39.300
cuz that's a hacky joke from like a

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:42.420
1990s comedian anyway let's use this um

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:44.290
we can't make any benefit out of that um

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.460
she said I'm not feeling that well cause

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:46.630
you order lunch for me and I was like

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.800
hey what do you want she's like I wanted

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:49.000
a noodle place and I was like alright

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.620
I'll find the place online because

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.050
there's like eight food delivery

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:55.120
services right now in our area and we

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:56.860
nobody knows which ones coming out over

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:59.710
the top yet so like all the restaurants

00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:01.270
are signed to different places anyway I

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:03.520
figured out the place and I this

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:07.150
restaurant when I ordered it kind of

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:11.230
boggled my mind because they have a

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:13.060
minimum price for your order to deliver

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:15.100
it and this is very common you know a

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:16.690
lot of places if you if you go to like a

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:19.570
place in you're like hey can I get some

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:20.650
delivery I'll have a one coke

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:22.870
you know they're going to tell you to

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:24.700
screw off but they at a minimum delivery

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:26.830
price and I understand it's 20 bucks

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:29.470
fairly reasonable you know it's a dinner

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:31.870
for two being ordered in it's fair but

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:34.420
then they also had a delivery surcharge

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:37.930
at the same time and I was like if

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:39.640
you're already use it's got to be one or

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:41.170
the other either you say hey you've got

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:45.280
to order a lot of food to make it worth

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:46.720
our while to deliver or you say you can

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.340
order as much or as little food as you

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.620
want but you pay the delivery charge on

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:52.660
top of it her dude so you could be like

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:54.280
hey can you deliver one coke and they'd

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.510
be like yeah that'll be six dollars one

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.850
dollar for the coke and five dollars

00:20:55.510 --> 00:21:02.230
delivery right a little expensive on the

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:05.020
delivery charge but I digress so I was

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:08.200
like I was a little incense I was like 1

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:10.360
out of 10 incense aka mildly perturb how

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.980
does this business think you can get off

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.750
by doing this in the way that I noticed

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:15.640
by the way is I ordered what Kate wanted

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:18.880
and it came to like this minimum cost

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:20.680
was 20 bucks for the delivery and her

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.240
order came to like where there's no way

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:25.960
we're doing boss rush on this run don't

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:27.640
don't make me laugh the order came to

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:30.910
like 18 bucks and they're like you got

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:33.220
to add an extra $2 or pay $2 extra to do

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:35.200
this and I was like nah I'll order

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.760
something for $2 so I guess I in the end

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.840
I did support their business model we're

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.420
going to do another challenge here

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.979
because that was like super easy

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:44.690
highbrow

00:21:41.979 --> 00:21:47.379
what is highbrow give me a sec oh it's

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:49.460
all the poop items I remember

00:21:47.379 --> 00:21:51.739
so really the problem with this run

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:54.440
right now is our range am I in the wrong

00:21:51.739 --> 00:21:55.609
here I certainly don't want this to be

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.679
like you know I feel like I'm taking

00:21:55.609 --> 00:22:00.109
crazy kills like I don't want to be out

00:21:57.679 --> 00:22:02.389
of touch but I thought we agreed as a

00:22:00.109 --> 00:22:06.830
society we were we were in an either/or

00:22:02.389 --> 00:22:08.659
delivery situation either there's a

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:10.399
minimum delivery fee that forces you to

00:22:08.659 --> 00:22:11.989
buy enough foods that it's worth the

00:22:10.399 --> 00:22:14.149
restaurants while to deliver it for free

00:22:11.989 --> 00:22:16.009
or you pay the fee and they'll deliver

00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:18.739
whatever amount of food that you want I

00:22:16.009 --> 00:22:20.989
could be mistaken I'm just saying

00:22:18.739 --> 00:22:23.089
there's a double dip going on here I'm

00:22:20.989 --> 00:22:25.519
paying you for the food I'm paying the

00:22:23.089 --> 00:22:27.649
cyclist to risk his life driving in

00:22:25.519 --> 00:22:29.299
Vancouver traffic to deliver this lunch

00:22:27.649 --> 00:22:30.710
to me that I probably should have just

00:22:29.299 --> 00:22:36.080
made myself and saved a bunch of money

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:38.960
you know the avocado toast theory and

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.519
now I'm paying you to have made the

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.960
website and administer the the

00:22:40.519 --> 00:22:43.879
transaction to begin with and then we

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.979
got this extra little you know like meta

00:22:43.879 --> 00:22:48.349
economy going on at the same time here I

00:22:45.979 --> 00:22:50.089
that I don't understand there might not

00:22:48.349 --> 00:22:52.940
be treasure rooms on this one by the way

00:22:50.089 --> 00:22:55.129
so we should be there definitely are not

00:22:52.940 --> 00:23:00.799
treasure wings based on our situation

00:22:55.129 --> 00:23:03.649
right here by the way I recognize are

00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:05.450
you anytime I'm just asking the internet

00:23:03.649 --> 00:23:07.279
to be nicer which is always like it's

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:08.989
like rule number one of being on the

00:23:07.279 --> 00:23:10.339
Internet is like don't ask the Internet

00:23:08.989 --> 00:23:13.399
to be nicer you just has give her

00:23:10.339 --> 00:23:16.039
trouble but any time you bring up buying

00:23:13.399 --> 00:23:19.369
anything the whole internet turns into

00:23:16.039 --> 00:23:21.889
our slash frugal and I just I'm asking

00:23:19.369 --> 00:23:24.440
for some understanding Kayden I do weed

00:23:21.889 --> 00:23:26.419
out we don't need out that much well we

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:28.609
sort of do in the sense that we also

00:23:26.419 --> 00:23:30.710
have a ingredient delivery service that

00:23:28.609 --> 00:23:34.070
we cook from but we we've been eating

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:36.349
healthier lately so we you know we been

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:37.609
eating out less well depending on

00:23:36.349 --> 00:23:39.169
whether or not you count a service that

00:23:37.609 --> 00:23:40.729
delivers groceries to them because

00:23:39.169 --> 00:23:42.589
eating out but this is just a semantic

00:23:40.729 --> 00:23:47.139
issue which is a whole different subset

00:23:42.589 --> 00:23:47.139
of Internet arguments but regardless

00:23:47.299 --> 00:23:52.710
you know it happens anytime you talk

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:55.830
about eating out somebody's always like

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:57.840
why would you ever eat out I go to the

00:23:55.830 --> 00:24:01.260
grocery store I buy a sack of dry beans

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:02.820
and I buy a sack of dried rice and it's

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:04.470
you know eleven dollars and that gives

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:07.289
me enough matter and all twenty

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:10.049
essential amino amino acids for you know

00:24:07.289 --> 00:24:12.600
the next 20 days dude I'm not even

00:24:10.049 --> 00:24:14.100
messing with you that's sick that's like

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:16.500
the coolest thing ever and you know what

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:18.539
the great news is that you're already

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.980
getting an extrinsic benefit for that

00:24:18.539 --> 00:24:22.620
you're saving so much money

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:24.299
that's sick I'm not it sounds like I'm

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:26.460
using my sarcasm like oh good for you

00:24:24.299 --> 00:24:28.500
voice but I'm not that's awesome dude a

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:30.330
lot of people are very frivolous with

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:32.100
their finances especially at a young age

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:34.409
and it can come back to bite you in the

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:36.299
butt I worked with a lady she was in

00:24:34.409 --> 00:24:40.799
debt and being harassed by creditors you

00:24:36.299 --> 00:24:41.850
know why not pretty fly you know why she

00:24:40.799 --> 00:24:44.549
was being harassed by creditors

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:47.340
she bought too many songs on iTunes so

00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:50.159
like rest assured that when I say good

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:51.900
for you I mean good for you

00:24:50.159 --> 00:24:53.669
waited waited pay attention to your

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:56.850
finances you know why people eat out

00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:58.650
though because this can be convenient

00:24:56.850 --> 00:25:00.960
and you know if you go out to eat it's

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:03.510
fun so you got to balance it both ways

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:07.140
but I'm just it happened again this week

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:09.090
I got my oil change our car I know

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:11.070
nothing about cars and that's a bad

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:12.390
thing I'm not saying I should note I'm

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:14.150
not going to get self-righteous and say

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:16.770
like oh well I've specialized in the

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:18.720
Isaac labour and being entertaining so I

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:20.610
don't need to know about cars because

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:23.159
you know it might compromise how good I

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:27.450
am at making stupid bits you know not

00:25:23.159 --> 00:25:29.280
not relevant and it's a flaw but you do

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:31.850
it to choose your battles in life you

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:35.220
know consider myself relatively good

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:37.440
conversationalist I work hard at my job

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:38.909
and I also like learning computer

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:41.880
program and doing side projects with

00:25:38.909 --> 00:25:43.350
that in my downtime so I got like a lot

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:45.510
on the ghost you know what screw it I

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:47.820
pay to get my oil change you know we

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:51.150
should not pick that up but that's okay

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:52.530
you know who else pays a professional to

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:55.980
change their oil even though it's super

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:57.240
doable in your own home like millions

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.840
and millions of people worldwide based

00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:01.330
on the fact that when I googled

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:05.020
Vancouver oil change I got like tens of

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:07.660
pages of results anyway I digress as

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:09.970
soon as I said I took my car to a shop

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:11.020
to get the oil changed everybody comes

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:13.600
out of the woodwork

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:15.640
it's like all you you'll watch like a 45

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.740
minute YouTube tutorial jack up your car

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:22.060
in your parking garage get under it and

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:23.910
like you know what it's okay I'm alright

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:27.070
being a little bit millennium

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:29.890
I'll pay someone we paid someone to come

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:31.960
fix our sink I mean that's a little

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:34.480
different because our landlord

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:36.730
reimbursed us but for you we did we'd

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:38.410
paid someone to come fix our sink well

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:40.720
if our washing machine breaks I'll pay

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:42.670
someone to fix it anything to do with

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:45.010
like electrical I'll pay someone for

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:46.360
anything to do with my car I'm gonna pay

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:47.920
someone for it I should learn how to

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.560
change in spare though that's just one

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:52.450
of those things like you should know I

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:54.340
think there's like a you can run into

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:59.140
this dangerous cycle of self-improvement

00:26:54.340 --> 00:27:00.400
you know it this sounds like very like

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:01.750
I'm giving you an excuse for laziness

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:03.130
and I'm not trying to do that because

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:07.240
I'm actually a motivated and driven

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:08.830
person and if I make use of my time on a

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:10.240
daily basis there's no way to talk about

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:14.320
it without assuming like you're bragging

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:16.630
but I very little of my time spent these

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:21.580
days is purposeless you know I'm working

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:23.950
I'm learning I'm walking exercising you

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:26.260
know and then Sunday's a p.m. Pacific

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:27.730
time game of Thrones comes on and then

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.500
we're back to the grind again after that

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:31.480
point you know get a little bit of you

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:35.080
know you know nothing Jim Smith and then

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:37.000
I'm back on the horse but I think it's

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:39.850
possible to just be like you know you

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:45.310
should never pay anybody for anything

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:47.560
and that's I mean probably like really

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:51.880
good financially but also of it I don't

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:54.110
know if it's a reasonable request it's

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:56.850
all I'm saying

00:27:54.110 --> 00:28:00.090
like what do you do is what I asked

00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:01.560
after that point so you know oh you're a

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:04.170
business analyst or maybe I'll just

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:06.150
analyze my own business from now on and

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:07.860
identify the processes with a Gantt

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:12.320
chart that's right I know what you do I

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:12.320
took a six-week course on agile methods

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:19.260
mr. so-and-so this in commentary is

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:21.510
getting increasingly Miche but all I'm

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:22.680
saying is that we're all adults and as

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:24.720
soon as you become an adult you realize

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.700
that all other adults are just figuring

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.530
it out as it goes let us all figure it

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:30.690
out together while being free of

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:31.950
judgment thank God we had godet

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:34.140
otherwise we never would have made it

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:36.570
there by the way I'm like completely

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:42.650
ignoring the purpose of this challenge

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:46.710
like entirely I am basically never using

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:49.250
the flush I don't care dude I'm just

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:49.250
going to act

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:55.720
[Music]

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:56.770
lunch bitch we got enough bombs to get

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.480
over here I'm okay

00:28:56.770 --> 00:29:00.340
you know what take calluses well this

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.930
one goes to mom's foot as well you know

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:04.150
what knocking out two challenges like

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:06.250
this per episode Suze exactly

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:07.810
appropriately we got Huggle oz on the

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:09.430
last episode I haven't some people that

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:11.200
asked me they were like why don't you do

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:13.690
what cobalt does and you know when you

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:19.360
do a new save file only do the challenge

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:21.190
unlocks here I I'm in this for badness

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:24.100
just as much as goodness you know it's

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:26.410
like Jason Lee said in Vanilla Sky you

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:28.570
can't have the sweet without the sour so

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:33.730
we're getting a little sourness

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:36.600
available as well here I'll try it and I

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:42.280
think there's I think there's like

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:44.020
validity to that state you know it was

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:46.930
that that Lisa Simpson said this could

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:49.930
not be a more like born in the late 80s

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:51.760
Early 90s conversation now you know Lisa

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:53.770
Simpson said you know we no longer feel

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:55.660
highs and lows we just have an ironic

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:57.220
sense of detachment and then the Homer

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:59.860
goes like oh what's that like and she

00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:03.700
goes see it's like a self-aware sort of

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:06.280
joke that says I prefer things the other

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:07.840
way you know soaring highs and well-nigh

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:11.230
pretty much stay on the level to be on

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:13.690
you know I've watched that one miserably

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:16.180
where's in a pretty good spot here

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:19.900
though but no you know I think the sweet

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:21.340
isn't it sweet without the sour you know

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:23.380
you got to you got to know what it feels

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:25.150
like to be down in the dumps to to truly

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:28.860
appreciate what what you've got you know

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:34.150
I mean I wouldn't know my life have been

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:36.810
fairly easy I did

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:40.150
I cried in the sixth grade once because

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:43.390
my teacher made us in we had to do a

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:46.090
book report but instead of doing

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:48.550
we got goat head right um instead of

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:51.630
doing a book report on paper they made

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:55.780
us build like a mobile you know like the

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:57.550
is it a mobile mobile like the the

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.990
things that babies have in their cribs

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:02.319
and he was like you know make a mobile

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:04.789
with the imagery from the book

00:31:02.319 --> 00:31:06.289
like I made one and it was junk and I

00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:09.439
cried and I was like why can't I just

00:31:06.289 --> 00:31:15.019
write the paper god I hate that guy

00:31:09.439 --> 00:31:18.529
anyway that is look I like school I'm

00:31:15.019 --> 00:31:20.389
not afraid to admit it that project is

00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:22.599
stupid there's a couple there's a couple

00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:25.459
school project that show up now and then

00:31:22.599 --> 00:31:27.199
everybody hates I do paper mache in

00:31:25.459 --> 00:31:31.089
sixth grade as well and we did paper

00:31:27.199 --> 00:31:34.189
mache originally written puppet show God

00:31:31.089 --> 00:31:35.509
just give us a book report dude stop

00:31:34.189 --> 00:31:36.379
trying to be a cool teacher you're

00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:37.909
taking it too far

00:31:36.379 --> 00:31:40.819
dude owner oh this is this is how we

00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:43.699
ball okay so we take IV bag and we use

00:31:40.819 --> 00:31:46.399
this to give us invincibility that we

00:31:43.699 --> 00:31:47.599
can then use with ball advantages it's

00:31:46.399 --> 00:31:49.729
one of the ways that we can have fun on

00:31:47.599 --> 00:31:51.469
this run coincidentally or not so

00:31:49.729 --> 00:31:54.259
coincidentally it's also one of the few

00:31:51.469 --> 00:31:56.869
ways we could die on this run from being

00:31:54.259 --> 00:32:00.199
a little overly aggressive here uh I was

00:31:56.869 --> 00:32:03.049
also I was I was over complicating it

00:32:00.199 --> 00:32:04.489
there for a second we have no reason to

00:32:03.049 --> 00:32:06.669
really use our orbital you just walk

00:32:04.489 --> 00:32:13.999
into enemies and kill them instantly so

00:32:06.669 --> 00:32:16.009
read heart please now potato peeler we

00:32:13.999 --> 00:32:19.749
used it on our last green mode run I

00:32:16.009 --> 00:32:19.749
don't think it's really appropriate here

00:32:20.829 --> 00:32:25.609
dull razor would also function sack head

00:32:23.809 --> 00:32:29.139
is just like it's a killer item so

00:32:25.609 --> 00:32:29.139
obviously we're going to roll with that

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:35.360
let me out please

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:43.020
and that's all I got to say about that

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:44.820
should always like cap it off right on

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:49.260
of anything else to say about that I

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:50.850
don't know it's like the Internet is

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:54.780
like this weird the economy though where

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:56.160
I'm like you get your oil change by a

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:57.540
professional and people go what do you

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:59.880
do and just learn to change your own oil

00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:02.070
you're like leave you sound like you got

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.330
it all together but I learned Chad for

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:05.790
20 minutes before you got here you guys

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:07.350
are talking about who you're like anime

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:08.910
Weiss's I'm not saying there's anything

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:11.970
wrong with it I'm just saying how could

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:14.940
you be experts on both hot anime ladies

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:17.490
and also like getting your oil change

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:19.050
like it's only so much time in a day if

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:22.980
anything I'm just impressed by that

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:30.630
level of ambition I mean come on we're

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:34.170
gonna obviously go for broke here it's

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:37.170
like Austin Austin he's a young boy and

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:39.090
he's a sweet boy but he's been corrupted

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:41.850
by the Internet he's holding these

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:45.320
opinions like wine is an international

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:49.860
conspiracy any any acquired taste

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:52.140
in Austin's opinion is you tricking

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:53.820
yourself that must be hoggle eyes is you

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:57.180
tricking yourself into liking something

00:33:53.820 --> 00:34:00.810
that's actually bad for reasons that I

00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:02.190
can't really articulate but maybe I'm

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:04.800
just missing maybe I'm part of the

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:06.810
scheme you know maybe that's maybe

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:10.770
that's the deal oh we shouldn't have

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:13.940
blown that up clearly no we got

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:16.890
brimstone that's incorrect we're set

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:18.390
it's like he does drink coffee and I

00:34:16.890 --> 00:34:21.660
think he accepts that coffee is an

00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:24.060
acquired taste but he he thinks he

00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:24.440
actually thinks all alcohol is in the

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:26.629
class

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:29.119
or not and acquires a sari a fiction

00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:31.039
like that is none of it tastes good and

00:34:29.119 --> 00:34:33.889
everybody who thinks it tastes good is

00:34:31.039 --> 00:34:35.599
tricking themselves it sir I hold so

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:37.220
many ridiculous opinions you're entitled

00:34:35.599 --> 00:34:39.020
to hold whatever ridiculous opinions you

00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:39.919
want but at least accept that it's

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:43.099
ridiculous

00:34:39.919 --> 00:34:46.460
there are some delicious beers and wines

00:34:43.099 --> 00:34:47.690
and whiskey's and scotches and even

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:51.039
though I can't appreciate them I'm sure

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:55.760
some delicious gins vodkas out there

00:34:51.039 --> 00:35:00.049
just a matter of you know learning to

00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:02.089
stretch your palate out a little bit the

00:35:00.049 --> 00:35:03.770
idea that it's a conspiracy and I know

00:35:02.089 --> 00:35:06.049
some of you out there I like this as

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:07.309
long as I've seen like to be fair when

00:35:06.049 --> 00:35:09.799
he brings it up and he knows this

00:35:07.309 --> 00:35:14.480
happens like 90% of chat goes what are

00:35:09.799 --> 00:35:16.250
you talking about but like 10% of chat

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:20.569
is like he's right all beer is

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:23.420
disgusting and I can't it's very it's

00:35:20.569 --> 00:35:25.400
ridiculous for suggesting we don't need

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:29.000
to go to our shop we're so unbelievably

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:34.490
set here it just says it's a nonsense

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:39.140
opinion I not the go for broke a little

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:41.029
bit here just for fun I suppose I hold

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:43.279
ridiculous opinions too and I like to

00:35:41.029 --> 00:35:44.630
talk about them because I like for other

00:35:43.279 --> 00:35:45.770
people to hear them laugh and then

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:46.520
highlight what's wrong with them and it

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:47.980
helps me grow

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:50.510
oh this is not our final floor which

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:53.569
helped me grow as a person for example a

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:55.599
pet theory that I've had that I anybody

00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:59.329
else's be seriously you think are like

00:35:55.599 --> 00:36:01.490
you know they're probably false but in

00:35:59.329 --> 00:36:03.349
your head you're like I haven't seen

00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:04.430
compelling evidence yet so I just kind

00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:07.039
of like I'm going to choose to believe

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:09.200
this a little while longer one for me is

00:36:07.039 --> 00:36:14.450
the idea that everything tastes the same

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:16.430
to everybody what I mean by that is you

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:18.410
know when I taste broccoli I taste

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:19.849
exactly the same thing that you do the

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:21.200
only thing is different in what

00:36:19.849 --> 00:36:24.380
determines whether or not we actually

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:27.049
like it is our interpretation of that

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:28.460
taste which I think largely is influence

00:36:27.049 --> 00:36:30.619
of course it's going to be hot line is

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:32.180
largely influenced by like our mental

00:36:30.619 --> 00:36:35.000
approach to the game so I think if we're

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:37.819
like I mean let's be honest do I'm going

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.940
to open these get out of here you know

00:36:37.819 --> 00:36:42.150
if I

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:43.470
if I have like you and somebody else in

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:45.359
the room and both of you have never even

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:47.069
conceived of the idea of broccoli before

00:36:45.359 --> 00:36:49.619
you have no idea what broccoli is and

00:36:47.069 --> 00:36:51.240
for one of you I go hey I'm about to

00:36:49.619 --> 00:36:54.210
feed you this like a little baby tree

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:56.880
it's the most delicious food everybody

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:59.400
loves it it's like it's so healthy for

00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:01.380
you and it's amazing to eat and then I

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:04.170
feed it to them I think that they taste

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:06.720
broccoli and they are more likely to go

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:08.849
oh that's amazed that's really nice Oh

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.530
floral and then if I have the other

00:37:08.849 --> 00:37:12.059
person in the other room and I go hey

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:14.430
this is broccoli it's like it's

00:37:12.059 --> 00:37:16.020
technically edible but Earthlings use it

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:18.119
to live like packing peanuts because

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:19.020
it's like gross and it's horrible for

00:37:18.119 --> 00:37:20.670
you it's like it's worse for you than

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:23.190
like even a Snickers bar

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:26.039
and then I feed it to them they're gonna

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:28.410
be like oh there's gross you know I and

00:37:26.039 --> 00:37:31.799
I think that that's probably false but

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:33.750
I've never seen anybody refuted in such

00:37:31.799 --> 00:37:36.539
a way that I was like you got me

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:38.280
oh there's Yara right there anyway
