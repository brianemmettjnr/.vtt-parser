00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.830
hey everybody welcome back to northern

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.779
land please minding my schedule plus

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.910
we've been doing random runs that's

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.710
right I mean the last run I remember we

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.750
diplopia into the greatest run of all

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.509
time nothing could stop us over Judas

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.869
okay so this is like it's like a

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.750
hangover Judas I'm scared because it

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.310
wasn't necessarily recent but it wasn't

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.670
altogether that long ago that we had

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:31.050
like that triple loss with Judas kw9 3fh

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:34.230
m6 dude you just described my favorite

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.500
issue of FHM FHM six that's the one it's

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.140
got the Sofia Vergara on the cover six

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.120
easy exercises to get six-pack abs and

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.989
six weeks or less and if it's got that

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:51.000
many sixes you know it's got to be true

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:53.640
it's got numerical alliteration no

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.260
shouting no shouting allowed okay now

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.079
there's a great opportunity for

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.420
hugglemas ruin right here it's a good

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.719
Agha laws sometimes you have a Huggle

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.100
laws and you go and you know what

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.530
respectable you're trying to do haggle

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.030
laws but that one wasn't really on point

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.420
this hog allows you look at it and you

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.990
go that's a mighty fine hog laws that's

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.479
as mighty as the wine that Jeremiah who

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.299
was a bullfrog had is this sentence

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.150
sensible I don't think so okay we got

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:31.409
stimulus cells regen I don't think I've

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:33.210
ever used this intentionally if I've

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.070
ever had regen from it I think it's been

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.140
accidental I'm actually going to look it

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.790
up I've been looking up trinkets lately

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.670
to try to shore up my eyes acknowledge

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.460
that's a great pickup so stem cells I

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:49.799
know not stem cells ethics stem cells

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:54.570
Issac heals for half a heart upon

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.100
traveling to the next floor so I got a

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.920
close Skype there I got a message from

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.649
Daniel gisli here's the thing I really

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.140
do not need to record players on known

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.020
battlegrounds I have so much in backlog

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.989
but whenever Dan asked me if we want to

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.950
record I'm always like yes I can't I

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.810
can't stay away I asked if you wanted to

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.209
record later tonight and I said yes and

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.540
he said let's duck and go and you know

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.129
what that means in the Gea's parlance

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.480
that means too low thinking we local

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:29.819
come on homey we major we major

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.620
absolutely correct so this run is not

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.920
it's not set in stone that it's an easy

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.180
Judas win yet but we got the tools to go

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.700
to school and we got the knowledge to

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.700
get us into college here creep shots are

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:47.010
mostly not relevant I also as mentioned

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.560
you know heels for half a heart upon

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.970
going to the next floor not every

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.230
trinket has to be the best trinket in

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.760
the game or even in the running for the

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.069
best trinket in the game but I will say

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.390
this would be better if it at least like

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.069
if you were full-on red hearts it gave

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.299
me like half of spirit heart that would

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:05.519
make it more usable as is right now

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:11.160
rarely at least in my world do I end up

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:12.930
creating Isaac runs where where you have

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.810
a lot of red hearts and they're not all

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:20.489
full that doesn't happen too often so we

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.870
don't have a we don't have a spirit

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.700
heart for purchase in here so I'm going

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.620
to blow up the tinted rock back here I

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.510
do want an arcade but it's Judas we

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.340
don't need an arcade immediately if we

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.989
can get an arcade you know we're still

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.840
gonna have a chance at it actually if we

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.700
can get an arcade buy you know two

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.319
floors from now or two floors from the

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.850
next floor then that's good but we don't

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.920
need one immediately maybe we'll be able

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.410
to take advantage of one but we don't

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.950
necessarily need one this is a secret

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.359
room presumably and gave us two bombs so

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.010
it was worth it if we can find our

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:53.970
second secret room and pick up like an

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.160
eternal heart or for runes etc etc my

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.329
favorite Quentin Tarantino film then

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.889
that would be decent alright so we

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.230
basically just threw away the two bombs

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.880
that we got but whatever life goes on we

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.989
got everything going you know coming up

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.000
millhouse right now for us right now

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.480
we're Judas we got a great rate of fire

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.370
bonus from our first boss the HP

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.859
situation is temporarily sorted and you

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.930
know we have a decent consumable setup

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.160
as well come to mob was set up as course

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.540
what I meant to say

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.600
what is the weirdest soup you've ever

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.490
eaten I'm trying to think of this

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.440
because there's so many different soups

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.850
but I feel like we in I say we but I

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.460
don't know you know you may not relate

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.890
to this watching this episode in Canada

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.730
at least there's like 10 soups I don't

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.200
know what you're going to say there's

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.630
more than 10 soups but let's be honest

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.400
you got tomato chicken noodle French

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.140
onion and by the way if you start going

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.600
oh and chicken noodle what about chicken

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.740
and rice not it's the same soup I know

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.630
that they're you know one's different

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.220
than the other one in terms of the

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.050
carbohydrate that's embedded in but come

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.120
on that's the same soup

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.800
if you said can I get chicken noodle

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.630
soup except instead of noodles can I

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.190
have rice in it that's still a chicken

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.620
noodle soup with rice and no noodles in

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.500
my opinion anyway you know you got

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.900
garden vegetable what about beef stew

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.880
that's not a soup is it called beef soup

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.620
I don't think so you got Italian Wedding

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.010
soup with a little tiny meatballs in it

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.570
but in the end you know there's not that

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.210
many soups and not many of them are

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.490
weird I've talked about work potlucks

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.300
before and and out I always hate that at

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.740
least of the offices that I've worked at

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.080
anytime there's a work potluck it ends

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:39.350
up being a cornucopia of

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.330
mayonnaise-based salads macaroni salad

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.360
you know egg salad chicken salad not a

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.580
big fan I'm a mixed green salad man

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:51.680
personally you know no jell-o molds

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:54.110
please but I actually I worked at an

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.340
office at one point in which someone

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:00.950
brought in gazpacho dude that's pretty

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.169
swell great opportunity to pick up some

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.850
bombs somebody brought in gazpacho and

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:10.310
for those of you unfamiliar with what

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:12.950
gazpacho is it's a cold soup that's like

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.290
basically it's like a like a savory or

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.180
salsa basically but it's a soup and

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.919
nobody else in the office wanted to eat

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.960
it because you know I don't want to I

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:22.250
don't want to be ages here but the older

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.510
you get the more set in your ways I

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:28.610
think most people tend to get in that

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.750
day like if you're 14 that probably

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.370
doesn't apply because when you buddy

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.070
when you're 17 you're they try all sorts

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:37.710
of new stuff I promise you but you know

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.910
if you're 25 you at 25

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.460
you had 50 you're probably going to be a

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.810
little bit more risk-averse nobody so

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.460
everybody the ovens Laval you know I'll

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.500
just have the fried chicken and macaroni

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.360
salad you know I only have one lunch per

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.950
day I want to make sure I mean something

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.340
I like but I was like dude nobody's

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:57.660
touching this homemade gazpacho I went

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:59.310
nuts on that gazpacho I ate it and I was

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.200
like the only one who even tried it and

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.520
it was delicious and then the lady who

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.590
made it was like I'm so glad you like

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.570
the gazpacho you know I make it all the

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.430
time but like nobody likes it and then

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:10.230
she came in the next day and she gave me

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.050
like a big pot of gazpacho

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:14.730
look that's awesome now as gazpacho the

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:17.190
weirdest probably pronouncing it weirdly

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:19.890
as well is it the weirdest soup I've

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:21.360
ever eaten I don't know you know it

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:23.640
depends on your tolerance I guess for

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.590
Korean cuisine some even some weird some

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:30.180
weird Asian soups you know soups that

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:32.010
are like spam and ramen noodles and it's

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:35.640
slice of Kraft cheddar cheese budae

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:38.700
jjigae and you know there's ganja Tong

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:41.130
which is like it's potato stew but it's

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.230
got like pork spine it but it's like

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:45.780
fantastic but I don't know man I think

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:48.510
back to that gazpacho the cold soup and

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:50.160
I I remember it fondly and it just goes

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.690
to show you you know don't be afraid to

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.670
bring despacho to your potluck although

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:55.560
I will say it didn't win her any favors

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:58.190
in the office I was basically a

00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:00.870
temporary employee so it wasn't like you

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.800
know she was I was her boss and she's

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.450
gonna work her way up through the

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.010
company as a result of the gazpacho is

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:07.700
really just out of the goodness of her

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:10.410
heart she gave me the extra gazpacho but

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:12.810
you know you're probably does if I ever

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:14.370
if we work in an office a YouTube office

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:17.420
or something and there's a potluck I'm

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:19.560
gonna be the dude who brings like nachos

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.060
I'll be like little slurry guys look

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.380
forego the gazpacho I just went down the

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.630
street to that sports bar you like him

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:26.730
bought us all nachos everyone's going to

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:31.460
be like this guy is the best

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:31.460
I don't care about that shop

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.760
people like things that they they've had

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:40.840
before and they know that they like it

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:42.010
that's that's natural human nature dude

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.890
now that I think about it I'm actually

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:46.540
so off-base with like the with the

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:49.420
office potluck thing because we used to

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:51.790
not we but I used to work in Korea at a

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:53.080
school and in case you didn't you know I

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:56.080
didn't mention that for the last 45

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.610
seconds and sometimes like if there was

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.140
a field trip so they were like parents

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.760
there they were chaperoning they would

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:03.580
bring in a bunch of kimbap which is

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:05.680
basically like a for lack of a better

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:08.260
word you can look it up yourselves ki

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.790
MBA p but it's basically a sushi roll

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:13.030
that probably doesn't have fish although

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:14.860
sometimes it does have fish and they

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:16.450
bring in like a homemade kimbap and give

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:18.190
it to all the teachers I didn't even

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:19.930
teach their kids I just I showed up to

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:22.510
the office like at 3:00 p.m. for the for

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.830
the later classes and they're like hey

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:26.830
by the way there's like a bunch of free

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:29.380
kimbap here I'm like at dude it's like

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:31.300
I've got the surrogate Korean

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.620
mother-in-law or something like that now

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.930
I have like a literal Korean

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:37.600
mother-in-law so you know I still get

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:39.520
that I mean not homemade kimbap cuz you

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.050
go down the street and get some for like

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:44.650
you know two bucks but you get the idea

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:47.290
I don't really want shade on this run

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:49.720
like it's not very good is the thing so

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:51.820
I'll take gimpy which I love but shade

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:53.710
is irrelevant for us there's run by the

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:55.390
way like we've barely been talking about

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:56.890
it I've been talking about potlucks and

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.560
people are probably like what are you

00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:03.940
doing

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:05.710
feels like I'm walking on sunshine house

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:08.860
my house my ridiculous

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:10.450
decent probably not that's okay but

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:12.820
there's nothing to talk about on this

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:15.040
run it's just like really really good we

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.960
have seven damage we have seven rate of

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.820
fire both of those are positive we got

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.760
one of the most universally liked

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:23.200
respected space bar items in the game

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.370
went from it's a great redemption Ark

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:28.450
you know it's like the Most Improved

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:31.000
Player Award this used to be something

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:32.380
that I would conceive and not the item

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.930
the punching bag which is also a

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:36.910
punching bag in this sense but um you

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:40.540
know it was kind of I didn't like it at

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:42.760
all and then I'm now like the quality of

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:44.560
this item is is ridiculously improved

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.630
and we take it all the time and I'm

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:50.680
always happy to do so because of the

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:53.230
ass charge and damage output so there is

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:56.200
always potential for this to backslide

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:57.940
into terribleness but the odds of that

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.230
are very low you know as Judas we've

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.520
gotten everything gotten damaged

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.480
upgrades we've gotten enough HP to

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.860
survive

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.930
we got deal with the devil president

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:08.740
which means that it's very very unlikely

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:10.810
that we squander this run as long as we

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.700
have enough HP to keep ourselves moving

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:15.310
we have an engine that generates a lot

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:26.980
of momentum we do not have two keys

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:30.340
though hmm okay so Tammy said rarer and

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:31.780
in my opinion a little better then then

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:33.880
shoopdawhoop although they both

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:37.270
definitely have their uses like

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:40.060
shoopdawhoop is much better here but

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:42.340
Tammy said also better potential for

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:44.200
future improvements I think so I mean

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.790
you don't even go down the list of

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.530
things that are good with Tammy's head

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:49.210
now like half of you are going talk more

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:54.550
about the potluck I don't know I love

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:55.840
talking about food it's just I mean I

00:11:54.550 --> 00:12:01.030
don't want to be controversial but I

00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:03.670
think food is delicious most of it at

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.780
least and you're going to say NL but

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.510
what about the foods that aren't

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:09.490
delicious yo but what if the foods that

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:11.530
aren't delicious to you are delicious to

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:16.090
me you know that's the thing give me a

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:16.870
luck upgrade please I understand being a

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:20.280
picky eater

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:22.960
I have lived that for a long time

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.250
anecdotally as I've told you may if

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.050
you've watched these videos long enough

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:28.060
when I was when I was a kid even up

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:31.060
until the age of like 16 17 didn't need

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:32.350
rice it's too many of one food it wasn't

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:34.990
like a principal thing it was just like

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:36.640
why don't you like 15 grains of rice

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.290
when I could just be one stick of potato

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.940
and accomplish the same amount you know

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:44.670
it was ridiculous but it I was like I

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:48.930
don't really like it that was as madness

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:48.930
rice is delicious you know

00:12:49.889 --> 00:12:52.739
I don't I don't like the coupon I know

00:12:51.629 --> 00:12:54.959
it gives you free deals with the devil

00:12:52.739 --> 00:12:57.089
how often is it relevant to get a free

00:12:54.959 --> 00:13:01.069
deal with the devil occasionally how

00:12:57.089 --> 00:13:03.179
often is it relevant to you know smack

00:13:01.069 --> 00:13:03.779
every enemy on the room for a ton of

00:13:03.179 --> 00:13:07.829
damage

00:13:03.779 --> 00:13:10.709
always always that's that's my principle

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:12.629
the opinion on the matter here I didn't

00:13:10.709 --> 00:13:16.379
need soup is watery food

00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:19.019
who wants a watery food you know I'll

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:20.759
just just and I think oh is it Austin or

00:13:19.019 --> 00:13:23.850
now it's definitely Austin Rob's like a

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:26.399
he's an anti picky eater but Austin's

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:28.769
opinion is the same as it was when I was

00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:30.449
a child or mez mine was when I was a

00:13:28.769 --> 00:13:32.519
child it's like why would I want it

00:13:30.449 --> 00:13:34.499
just give me the chicken and the noodles

00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:36.059
don't give me the soup portion it's

00:13:34.499 --> 00:13:37.410
patently ridiculous you know there's

00:13:36.059 --> 00:13:38.669
different foods for different purposes

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:46.999
but you can choose to believe whatever

00:13:38.669 --> 00:13:49.679
he wants to please give me a key here

00:13:46.999 --> 00:13:53.279
and died I didn't need any desserts I'm

00:13:49.679 --> 00:13:55.529
still not really a dessert guy everyone

00:13:53.279 --> 00:13:57.360
whenever I tell that to people they

00:13:55.529 --> 00:13:59.850
always go oh no sweet tooth how you're

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:03.779
lucky and I'm like that really if you

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:05.100
put me in front of a a bag of like well

00:14:03.779 --> 00:14:07.079
let's say it's open you put me in front

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:09.239
of a bag of open potato chips all those

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:11.309
potato chips are gone the only chance I

00:14:09.239 --> 00:14:14.009
have did not eat the whole bag of potato

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:16.079
chips nearly regardless of its size is

00:14:14.009 --> 00:14:18.239
to exercise the self-control to keep it

00:14:16.079 --> 00:14:20.100
closed in the first place is if it ever

00:14:18.239 --> 00:14:23.220
gets open they're gone dude they're

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:25.470
dusted but straight up you could leave

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:27.660
me in a room with like you know the best

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:29.639
chocolate chip cookies ever made and I'd

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:31.709
be like yeah you know I'd like to try it

00:14:29.639 --> 00:14:33.959
but I don't need to eat that chocolate

00:14:31.709 --> 00:14:36.749
chip cookie if I eat one harvest cheddar

00:14:33.959 --> 00:14:38.519
sonship I'm like I need to eat every

00:14:36.749 --> 00:14:42.539
harvest cheddar sonship that is in this

00:14:38.519 --> 00:14:44.999
room right now that's actually like I

00:14:42.539 --> 00:14:47.160
think I might be turning 50 years old

00:14:44.999 --> 00:14:48.689
this here I just you can't leave me

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:53.519
alone with these SunChips somebody take

00:14:48.689 --> 00:14:55.649
these away from me something about that

00:14:53.519 --> 00:14:57.179
that multigrain goodness man I'm not

00:14:55.649 --> 00:14:59.489
suggesting SunChips are good for you

00:14:57.179 --> 00:15:00.440
good I mean in the end it is still you

00:14:59.489 --> 00:15:04.699
know

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:06.440
it's a like fried salted potato chip

00:15:04.699 --> 00:15:07.639
acceptance oh yeah they're better for

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:10.399
you cuz instead of potatoes they use

00:15:07.639 --> 00:15:13.670
sunflowers no I don't know if I buy that

00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:15.860
I don't know if I buy that for one

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:18.399
flippin second dude this floor is too

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.399
large

00:15:23.019 --> 00:15:28.100
give me the gup-e dream oh he's done it

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:31.699
he didn't get anything for it but he did

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:36.889
do it anyway what was I talking about

00:15:31.699 --> 00:15:39.470
I don't remember it doesn't matter what

00:15:36.889 --> 00:15:42.680
your name is we're gonna make boss rush

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:44.000
do we do we desire it I don't know but

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:46.610
anyway the oh that was on the picky

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.459
eater tangent the one thing I will say

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:51.110
is I get you you know I'm like the I'm

00:15:49.459 --> 00:15:53.089
the guidance counselor who was like a

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:54.649
cut-up in high school and then I'm like

00:15:53.089 --> 00:15:56.209
you should really think about applying

00:15:54.649 --> 00:15:58.220
to colleges to give you some structure

00:15:56.209 --> 00:16:00.740
in your life I was like you one day you

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:02.480
know me and my friends we didn't go to

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.279
class that I actually was diligent but

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.870
you know in this picky eater context I'm

00:16:04.279 --> 00:16:09.050
with you is what I'm trying to say thank

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:11.509
you for the damage bonus um everyone's

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:14.720
always hassling you especially you're

00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:18.980
like you know I don't really like fish

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:20.420
oh well you gotta try you know they did

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:23.959
a better example actually it's like I

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:26.720
don't like seafood Jeb what about crab I

00:16:23.959 --> 00:16:29.779
don't like seafood yeah but you have to

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:31.160
like Lobster though you know people if

00:16:29.779 --> 00:16:34.970
you're picky eater they take it it's

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:37.399
like a personal crusade to get you to

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:40.009
stop being a picky eater and you can't

00:16:37.399 --> 00:16:42.319
convince them and it's because you're

00:16:40.009 --> 00:16:43.670
lying and I don't want to put you on the

00:16:42.319 --> 00:16:45.110
spot here but if you're like no I don't

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:47.269
really like I don't really want to try

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:49.069
that food it's like you're lying to

00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:51.589
yourself it's probably pretty delicious

00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:53.329
you should give it a shot whenever I

00:16:51.589 --> 00:16:55.459
talk to people and some of you out there

00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:57.319
I like this and I just want to grab you

00:16:55.459 --> 00:16:58.850
by the shoulders and say what is wrong

00:16:57.319 --> 00:17:00.920
with you although this is a relatively

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:02.689
minor issue for this particular

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:05.449
situation people go oh yeah I like

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:09.049
lettuce but I don't like kale I eat so

00:17:05.449 --> 00:17:11.780
much of both to counteract the Sun ship

00:17:09.049 --> 00:17:13.860
poisoning they're the same food I know

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.600
they're not and like you know

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:17.370
today details a little firmer and it's

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:20.900
got like a slightly no I mean yeah like

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:20.900
a little bit they're the same food I

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:26.520
don't know where I'm going with this one

00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:27.210
anyway if you're picky eater you'll

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.300
figure it out

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:32.940
I will say try to try to sort it out

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:34.710
because there's a chance that you and

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:37.080
your life you know you may you may be

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:39.360
destined for amazing things you may it

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:45.030
sometimes have to go you know travel to

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:47.100
other countries and if you do that's not

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:50.670
what we want but it's interesting if you

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:52.020
do yeah let's go all but with Tammy's

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.250
head is so dangerous what are you doing

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:56.790
just putting money and then like to

00:17:53.250 --> 00:18:04.260
donate if you do it's going to help you

00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:07.320
out a lot too to be open-minded about

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:10.110
cuisine at least I know you know when I

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:12.000
when I moved to Korea apparently this is

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:15.000
the Korea episode when I moved to Korea

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.890
I was not a particularly picky eater and

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.510
I was like not as cool and narrowly

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:22.740
learned as I would consider myself to

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:26.670
this day basically I wasn't a snob

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:28.260
unlike today um but I was open to

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:30.180
everything you know I was like oh you

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.980
want to have like you know tofu soup for

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:33.270
lunch never had it doesn't seem like my

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:36.450
sort of thing but let's give it a shot

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:38.790
but I was there with people like one

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:40.740
dude was a vegetarian nothing wrong with

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:42.690
that but he also didn't like spicy food

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:45.480
something really wrong with that if

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:47.490
you're living in Korea like you you're

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.110
going to be in a hard place like I know

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:51.060
you can't help it you don't like spicy

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.590
food but you know you're limiting

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.690
yourself on one extent because

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:58.470
vegetarianism is not really that popular

00:18:54.690 --> 00:19:00.600
there and even what they think of as

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:02.400
vegetarian commonly also involves eating

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.540
fish so if you don't eat fish is going

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.160
to make it even on it you're limiting

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:07.050
yourself even more but then like to not

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.620
enjoy spicy food you're in a real tight

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:11.750
spot

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:14.370
you know you got a you got to open up

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:16.740
otherwise you might end up even like I

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:20.040
mean the first week that I lived there I

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:23.190
didn't know anybody or anything I bought

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:25.080
like a bunch of pepperoni from the

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:27.780
convenience store and basically just

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.950
like ate that so you know

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:31.850
trust me when I tell you you don't want

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:34.380
to go down that road if you can avoid it

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:35.610
but anyway you got time you probably got

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:39.030
time I don't know maybe you're like

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:40.770
thirty but you got time it's also really

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:44.070
nice you know you even group of like

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:46.050
five or six people when they go what do

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:48.690
you want to eat and you go anything's

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:50.610
good with me but to actually mean it cuz

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:52.410
you know I previously in my life had

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:54.420
been that guy you know and I was younger

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:56.220
what do you want to eat oh you know what

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:58.230
do you want to eat how about some sushi

00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:00.150
alright I really like raw fish actually

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:01.650
how about Mexican food oh you know I

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:03.120
don't really understand the concept of a

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:04.950
tortilla why don't they just put it on

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:07.320
bread you know and it just becomes

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:09.900
ridiculous you know you're like what do

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:11.730
you want to eat what what fits into your

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.020
arbitrary dietary concerns

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:19.080
I don't like faith reward in our

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:24.180
situation here Joker card against

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:27.870
humanity anyway this this episode has

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:29.340
been like literally 100% off topic and

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:30.810
that's cool sometimes those are the best

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:33.750
episodes at least it's not another

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:37.530
motivating talk about how oh you can do

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:41.360
it I don't know what the point of having

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:46.160
hoggle eyes is I don't do bozo is like

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:51.780
the actual ultimate who cares item yeah

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:53.640
okay like bozo does nothing for us here

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:57.710
I think although it might occasionally

00:20:53.640 --> 00:21:02.970
give us rainbow poop so who knows dude

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:08.580
we could come on with the speed downs we

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:11.540
could justify doing boss rush I mean if

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:14.310
you got the money honey I got the time

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:19.560
but beyond this we have the damage as

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:24.360
well and although it's dangerous we

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:26.310
could kill enemies pretty easily with

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:29.580
our ipecac setup case that's not

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:31.560
abundantly clear what I know I refused

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:34.730
to bet oh no wait that was the boss

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.730
fight yes silly

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:45.280
so we can basically stand in like 1% of

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:47.830
this boss fight it's enough to get the

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:51.340
job done apparently take this at least

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:52.870
look so I mean did the problem here that

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:55.870
none of these actually do anything for

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:57.670
us so in a way I'm actually you might be

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:59.170
surprised what I'm kind of concerned

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:06.010
about the way that this run is going

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:08.160
only because HP is not you know full we

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:15.070
don't have any other defensive items

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:17.710
perks okay and if a CAC for as much as I

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:19.330
love it and I sincerely do it's an item

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:21.610
that has the potential to backfire

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:24.760
especially on a curse of the blind floor

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:26.770
like trying to think what could what

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.780
could screw us considering we don't have

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:31.720
item rooms so I mean it's not like we're

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:34.510
going to get strange attractor we could

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:41.500
get cursed I which wouldn't actually be

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:42.790
that bad because the thing with ipecac

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.490
is you want to watch out for like you

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:49.780
know anything that that multiplies your

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:52.480
tears is particularly terrible like the

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:53.860
parasite for example but cursed I I mean

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.270
any enemy that got hit with cursed I

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:57.550
would probably die pretty quickly which

00:22:55.270 --> 00:23:01.140
is a it's good enough for me to be at

00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:04.030
least reasonably excited about it

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:05.350
this is extremely useful and we're kind

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:07.540
of I mean we have 100% deal with the

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:09.280
devil chance here so as far as I'm

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:11.530
concerned life's really good in that

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:13.540
department we can get nine lives like

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:14.680
I'm very confident we can beat pretty

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:19.120
much any boss

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:22.030
given enough attempts I wish I'd kept

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:28.240
shoopdawhoop though don't I wish I kept

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:30.850
shoopdawhoop though because so much

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:34.990
better damage dealer given our

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:37.390
circumstances but still anytime you got

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:39.130
50 damage as long as you're not actively

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:41.200
hurting yourself over and over it's hard

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:43.390
to complain I'll take them both let's go

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.520
for contract from below let's go little

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:46.630
delirium let's go these are both not

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:49.060
that good

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:55.180
but we're out and we maybe shouldn't

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:58.870
have done that but here we are here's a

00:23:55.180 --> 00:24:02.080
little song I wrote about if the CAC and

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:04.090
it's melts you if you're not paying

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:06.720
attention asperities going nowhere

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:10.570
you're gonna get hit by the pickaxe

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:15.000
thank God for no beams ultra light or

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:19.800
otherwise in every run there can be

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:25.840
explosions and play with logics on play

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:30.760
emotionally if the CAC is part of a

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:35.110
healthy run stack okay we're out of here

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:36.550
what makes you large or addicted are you

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:38.140
a wizard okay well I mean are you a

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:44.920
wizard gives us a great opportunity to

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:52.330
spend some time improving ourselves just

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:54.010
HP dog s it it's all we need take as

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.510
long as you have any strength gives us

00:24:54.010 --> 00:25:00.910
the opportunity to play that demon

00:24:55.510 --> 00:25:02.950
judgment we're probably not going to

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:06.400
fight hush regardless of what happens so

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:08.020
I'm not worried about our money even if

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:11.260
this is an inefficient way to improve

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:14.770
ourselves as long as what we get is half

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:15.820
decent I'm okay with it and at least I'm

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:21.700
not talking about being a picky eater

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:25.000
anymore okay I mean I have given you

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:27.460
like 40 cents so if you want to pay out

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:32.170
with you know your terminal reward I

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:35.170
would be very happy about it here's a

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:38.710
little song I am writing to pass the

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:46.300
time well I'm not fighting this judgment

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:51.520
is a jerk hold although I gave him so

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:56.510
much money he took too long to pay out

00:25:51.520 --> 00:26:00.750
it's funny don't worry these

00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:04.530
we should use walking on sunshine to get

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:09.990
some demon judge some demon judgement

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:16.559
demon love new DTD okay so here's what

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:23.429
you mean we obviously like you go to

00:26:16.559 --> 00:26:29.580
town here oh so now we can use the

00:26:23.429 --> 00:26:31.860
strength card in here we're still like

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:34.260
killing it come on dude you know you got

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:35.549
me here these are the plays that can I'm

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.410
not going to say win you the game but

00:26:35.549 --> 00:26:39.270
take us from a weird position into a

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:43.470
totally fine position honestly I'm okay

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:45.510
taking a range down I don't want to

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:47.309
leave well strength is still active

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:52.530
because like I mean we have to at some

00:26:47.309 --> 00:26:54.450
point but I figured it was worth going

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:55.830
for broke here and it takes us as long

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:58.970
as it takes us you know the demon

00:26:55.830 --> 00:27:01.049
judgement pick up can be so useful I

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:04.860
think that's the first time I've seen

00:27:01.049 --> 00:27:07.110
gimpy pay out fun on this whole run I

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:12.750
think it's the first time okay well I

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:14.100
mean we got some potato peeler I am I

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:18.740
should have been hit there that was a

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:18.740
moronic dodge but there's really no

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:31.950
there's no concern I think in our

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:33.360
present situation like I'm happy with

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:34.620
our permanent polaroid invincibility I

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:37.530
think permanent polaroid invincibility

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:40.110
is worth keeping what we should be

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:44.820
worried about is just making sure oh I

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:47.010
mean we got to look sorry we do want the

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:49.830
ability to fly that's gonna be worth it

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:53.960
and you know what Tami's good play Tammy

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:53.960
said is actually doing nothing for us

00:27:55.629 --> 00:28:07.669
we should mystery sack thanks for the

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:14.089
mammaries dude the other pill verb feels

00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:16.159
like I'm walking on sunshine he's done

00:28:14.089 --> 00:28:19.969
it so we should take this and just use

00:28:16.159 --> 00:28:24.799
it because Tammy's head is doing nothing

00:28:19.969 --> 00:28:27.169
so now we can fly oh well okay we got HP

00:28:24.799 --> 00:28:30.710
coming on the next floor the idea is of

00:28:27.169 --> 00:28:32.719
course great angel item the last few if

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:37.549
attack runs we've had have actually

00:28:32.719 --> 00:28:41.869
wow what a deflection that's just idiocy

00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:44.389
but have actually made me feel like epic

00:28:41.869 --> 00:28:48.950
hack is a bad item and that's wrong if a

00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:50.599
cake is a great item we're using it

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:54.399
badly but also having it in some

00:28:50.599 --> 00:28:58.129
situations where it's suboptimal what

00:28:54.399 --> 00:29:06.440
face reward like shot the ipecac back

00:28:58.129 --> 00:29:08.679
into my own face how it's got to go okay

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:14.619
now your dusted

00:29:08.679 --> 00:29:16.539
what my HP maybe if you didn't need so

00:29:14.619 --> 00:29:27.779
much gazpacho you'd be able to beat the

00:29:16.539 --> 00:29:33.669
binding of issac afterbirth plus NL he's

00:29:27.779 --> 00:29:44.350
potentially done it you got to go okay

00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:50.889
we live don't ever do that again

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:59.830
Oh be happy oh don't worry

00:29:50.889 --> 00:30:04.960
Sacred Heart now I can't resist though

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:07.450
what was such a deflection again if

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:14.740
someone getting deflect deflect deflect

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:16.210
deflect in you you know what that got

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:18.789
the heart rate pumping a little bit and

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:20.350
that's got me feeling good I honestly

00:30:18.789 --> 00:30:22.379
think that little burst of adrenaline is

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:24.490
going to help us out today

00:30:22.379 --> 00:30:27.789
obviously I'd love to keep our eternal

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:29.590
heart alive we have so much damage that

00:30:27.789 --> 00:30:33.669
to die would just be an embarrassment

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:36.039
but you know we should also 100% did it

00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:41.340
to ourselves so I'm not going to act

00:30:36.039 --> 00:30:41.340
like you know the run has screwed us

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:45.610
it's really it's the fact that we're not

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.139
shooting one AMPA CAC shot we were

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:49.450
shooting multiple attack jobs sometimes

00:30:47.139 --> 00:30:52.210
three because we have faith reward and

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:55.230
then the Incubus occasionally from the

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:55.230
like little delirium

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:11.340
compass yah I mean if when every run

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:12.960
there is some spicy if you do it you'll

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:17.400
do it nicely

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:20.430
secret room is not a secret room Bobby

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:25.140
McFerrin is gonna sue me to death but he

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:30.600
seems like such a nice guy he's always

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:35.010
saying don't worry be happy this is a

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:38.340
lawyer penned called Salmons bringing a

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:44.300
checkbook you pay in dozens I'm sue when

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:52.650
you are in lecture will property theft

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:55.320
okay Wow

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:57.570
I mean we don't need to keep this

00:31:55.320 --> 00:32:06.750
internal heart alive but it it would be

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:09.120
like a blessing just make it down to the

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:10.830
next floor I didn't even take breath of

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.570
life by the way because I I don't want

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:15.710
to saddle myself with the baggage of

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:19.080
trying to use that crap item properly

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:21.530
I'd rather have no item he's done it

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.530
good Dodge

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:28.860
ok 3 HP jeez 3 HP and 48 damaged what

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:32.220
could go wrong just give me a pyromaniac

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:41.600
from chief maximum safety cool blank

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:41.600
card I like it all to be honest with you

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:51.310
yeah I mean I don't like that one but

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:53.890
all we need is a rune a ruin of any

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:55.630
usefulness and we're like completely set

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:59.380
we're firing a lot more frequently now

00:32:55.630 --> 00:33:01.930
which is mostly good obviously like we

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:04.300
have greater outs now like a hero font

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:05.980
card wins us the game and an algae's

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:09.000
rune probably wins us a game and a de

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:11.770
gAHS ruin probably wins us the game um

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:15.520
trying to think of I mean a nampara card

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:17.920
wins us the game many different ways in

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:20.830
which we could achieve our objective on

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:25.030
this one so a couple of ways we could

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:27.640
obviously completely squander it don't

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:30.580
jump as long as you don't jump we're

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:34.150
good dude I prefer if you didn't do that

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:40.060
but that's an unrealistic ask we have

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:43.390
five luck five luck to me is is items

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:45.220
and this is where remember we paid we

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:47.580
kind of paid out the butthole for it too

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:50.790
we paid for a contract from below

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:54.660
contract from below is mostly an

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:59.260
investment in our future

00:33:54.660 --> 00:34:02.830
so I almost popped addicted there I feel

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:06.790
okay dude I'm telling you this is the

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:10.980
summer of brownie brownie has become the

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:10.980
most hated enemy in Isaac history I

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:17.070
popped addicted and then just like let's

00:34:14.890 --> 00:34:17.070
bounce

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:23.020
that's perfect thank you very much

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:32.179
brownie is just like such a hard counter

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:33.890
to so many different kinds of runs hey

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:35.270
you got to run that shoots explosions

00:34:33.890 --> 00:34:38.270
that's going to be a little bit of a

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:40.070
problem because every square of the room

00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:42.169
is now surrounded by enemies by the way

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:43.940
he's also chasing you down constantly so

00:34:42.169 --> 00:34:47.179
like enjoy never being able to do

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:50.000
anything okay I mean our flies are going

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:52.370
to do a ton of damage so now it's a two

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:57.700
brownies huh on the bright side it's on

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:57.700
a large room so actually have a way out

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:09.190
you still got me half heart I like it I

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:16.760
don't think this run at any business

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:20.830
being as difficult as it got do you know

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:20.830
of course blame myself for that

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:28.460
that's what happens sometimes where you

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:30.320
go for the same scatter bombs

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:33.790
huh she we're getting like the the

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:36.160
dictionary definition of decent items

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:40.240
this guy's got to go first then

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:40.240
everything stems from that guy

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:47.390
thank you little haunt that's actually

00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:50.240
little delirium now we get our tarot

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:51.860
card and as penance for struggling

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:53.060
through the back half of this run

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:53.630
they're going to give me the tarot card

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:57.970
of my dreams

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:57.970
Bob's rotten head my favorite tarot card

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:03.650
wonder what we're going to get from this

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:07.220
room it could be any kind of consumable

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:09.170
that explodes well that's not totally

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:11.180
true can also be an item that causes

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:14.630
explosions so like the world is our

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:18.050
oyster but you know I'm not a picky

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:21.590
eater I'm also not a rapper but I'm not

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:25.010
a picky item getter Wow give me whatever

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:27.440
you feel is right let's go Seraphim and

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:29.240
then actually a tarot card and it's the

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:32.900
ace of spades exactly what we needed

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:34.700
right now nothing could stop us it's

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:44.260
like Marie Antoinette said let them eat

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:46.490
keys I mean these are both pretty bad

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:48.830
you know what we should take thunder

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:50.330
thighs the extra HP may save us and we

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:52.400
didn't even get a speed downgrades I

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:54.290
figured we'd go down to like 1.7 but I

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:57.970
guess we were so far over the speed cap

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:57.970
that we we have some tolerance

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:09.540
all right so we are going to win here

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:11.310
and we made it look easy right right am

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.930
i right no probably not okay but that's

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:14.900
fine

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:18.660
no never in every life there is some

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:21.720
struggle so finish it then you'll get to

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:25.110
cuddle I don't know why I sing the song

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:28.380
with the none of unoffensive accents

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:30.860
it's Bobby McFerrin is an

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:33.600
english-speaking American I think so

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:37.170
first off oh hell yeah

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:39.180
secondly I think I do that to mask the

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:40.950
fact that I can't sing so if I put on a

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:43.230
funny voice it sort of makes me feel

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:44.940
like the caricature takes the precedence

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:45.420
over my lack of a singing ability no I'm

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:47.100
sorry

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:48.120
