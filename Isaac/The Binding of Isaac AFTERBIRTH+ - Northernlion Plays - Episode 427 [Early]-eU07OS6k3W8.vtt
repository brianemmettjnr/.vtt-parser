00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.650
everybody welcome xnor the lion please

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.990
fighting once again for the plus let's

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.030
do boss rush as someone we've never done

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.120
no okay that will not be done let's do

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.820
the dark room path as a character we've

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.770
never okay we've never done it so I mean

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.470
like okay okay we could do a little

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.720
samson dark room path we need the

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.519
negative on basically everybody but we

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.880
have done show on some people you know

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.160
what

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.170
Lazarus let's do some Lazarus light side

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.850
path apparently we have not done this

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.520
it's a good opportunity to beetle as

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.329
again here's your seat today KY 1 G TCA

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.489
8 the real metagame of a new save file

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.649
and Isaac is trying to remember all the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.140
great damage they're trying to remember

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.850
all the checkboxes you need to tick in

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.180
order to ensure that you can actually

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.219
complete the posted notes as is required

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.190
we don't really care about a lovers card

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.010
to be honest with you at least not yet

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:05.339
because we probably do want to invoke

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.610
the Lazarus principle here on our on our

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.979
starting floor at least that's my

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.229
perspective I got to be honest I've been

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.360
I've been slumping a little bit in Isaac

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.220
and I don't mean to even mean like slump

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.290
slump the jams slump it up while your

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.600
feet are stumping I mean like I've been

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.150
I've been playing like pretty much trash

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.650
lately I don't know if my brain is fully

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.720
switched over into like divinity

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.630
original sin 2 modes so whenever I see

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.180
top down even though the divinities

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.770
technically isometric which is a 3/4

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:41.100
camera or 2/3 camera in some situations

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.250
we're uh for whatever reason we're on

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.350
the wrong track back up back up cuz it's

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.950
on na te and me the war into the G

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.630
hopefully are I'm not Warren G and you

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.310
know what I don't want to be Warren G

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.840
not that I'm disrespecting his life but

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.290
I'm happy enough of my own life and you

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.670
know Warren G had his time in the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.670
nineteen nineties and I'm I'm sure he's

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.460
still doing ok to this day but I don't

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.829
want to like swap in new a hip-hop

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.679
artist past the prime of their career I

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.720
think if you were like NL you want to

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.170
trade spots with ice cubes circa you

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.000
know nine

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.670
in 89 I'd be like you know what can I

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.230
try it out for a week before I see for

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.090
myself like I'm pretty happy in my own

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.770
life and not you know there's a lot

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.480
about it that I would miss but I can't

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.190
deny that that would be cool but hey you

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.430
want to be ice cube now I'd be like I

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.489
had or no I'm trading like probably 20

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.760
years of my life for the opportunity to

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.430
star in 29 Jump Street maybe maybe not

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.920
right I knew there was gonna be a room

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.010
the secret here it's a decent amount of

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.550
capital nothing there then our second

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.970
secret room must be down here and that

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.560
is indeed correct and okay we got some

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:58.260
really really good stuff but I really

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:01.230
want some bombs careful what you wish

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:06.000
for buddy okay so we are a genius and we

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.620
got blood bag come on give me a little

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.100
money here you decide give me some keys

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.720
I mean um I just now want to go to the

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.340
shop because there's a couple of

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.799
opportunities for us to get something

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.450
valuable out of bombs one is the tinted

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.150
rock and and one is the other stone

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.010
chests in there so there is a bomb for

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.030
sale and the items in here are kind of

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.799
trash so my thinking is there's a really

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.630
obvious way to mess this up and that's

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:34.109
to pick up blood bag right away but I

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:37.890
think we should instead end our own

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:39.180
lives probably there we go we got

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.549
something out of it I'm gonna take dim

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.900
bulb from this point onwards but then

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.640
pick up blood bag after that and

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.530
whenever we get from our boss here and

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.150
then we're in a really really nice spot

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.130
it would be nice to blow that up as well

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.530
we could probably make it happen by

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.359
giving our reroll machine in our shop a

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.310
couple of cents and then it'll re-roll

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.510
we could buy a bomb for five cents

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.049
probably ruin our chance of getting in

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.400
our cave but get a spirit heart in all

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.630
likelihood that's figuring art will give

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.859
us a great chance of getting a deal with

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.030
the devil and all of a sudden we're like

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:10.889
extremely off to the races as as Lazarus

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.170
here this is an incredibly good start

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:15.720
basically getting a free blood bag and

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.609
also in the process justifying the

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.010
existence of x-ray goggles an item that

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:24.570
I probably underrate if I'm being honest

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:26.639
with you I always take like the you know

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.120
would you trade lives with blood

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:32.099
it's kind of a it's a young man's

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.949
question or a young lady's question for

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:37.080
that matter because once you you end up

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.789
you know you you have like a family for

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.219
example they're like would you trade

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:44.699
your life for ice cubes life you're like

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:46.080
well you're asking me to trade in my you

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.969
know this is a hypothetically I'm not

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.120
speaking as myself guess we just rated

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:54.210
like my wife my son and then get

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.800
somebody else's wife and son it's just

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.900
the little it's a strange question

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.840
wouldn't use I mean like it's kind of an

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.509
inherently selfish ask I found he'll so

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.599
I was hoping that'd be a little better

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:09.210
like would you trade your family for

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:11.909
somebody else's family but you also get

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.370
to be rich and not maybe a little bit

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:16.830
famous as well like it's it's a little

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.319
bit of a selfish ask the if your

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.810
significant other or spouse asks you

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:23.219
that question well if you trust each

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.810
other and it's a safe space give your

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:26.969
honest answer but otherwise there is a

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.270
correct answer and the answer is no baby

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:33.779
of course not we're going down the next

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.669
floor here we have really stat and our

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:37.620
selves up relative to the norm here for

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:40.919
a Lazarus run particularly with respect

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:44.339
to our speed which is a secondary stat

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:47.190
most of the DAW a secondary stat most of

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:48.900
the time damage is a little bit better

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.949
because we've resurrected ourselves as

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.509
Lazarus and I I chose to let's be honest

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:55.889
the reason I chose and some people may

00:05:54.509 --> 00:06:00.360
disagree with this the reason I chose to

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:01.710
go flat penny over just be careful on

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.360
this room this room is ruined many a

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.150
deal with the devil chance in its day

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.469
the reason I chose illuminated bulb over

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.750
flat penny is because we already have

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:11.669
six keys and that's like potentially

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.460
almost as much as we'll need for the

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:17.789
rest of the game it's a little bit of an

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:21.860
exaggeration potentially but not by much

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:24.240
to be honest with you no no we're good I

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.189
kind of just want to wait for the portal

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:31.529
to tap out this is a Oh that'll also

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:33.509
work it's a bad room there so dim but

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:38.279
are illuminated bulb which I sometimes

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:39.920
call dim bulb just for kicks is not good

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:43.430
at all for us right now but could

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:47.450
actually be good one day and this room

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:49.520
has a spirit heart it's the more boring

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:52.310
decision to do this but I'm gonna buy

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:57.380
the spirit heart and the reason for that

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:59.450
is because I really really want to get a

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.740
deal with the devil and that is like 12

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.870
out of 10 will get a small speed

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.750
downgrade but that's basically

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.550
irrelevant instead we're gonna be very

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.930
stoked to have the extra damage we're up

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.760
to six point two three damage and it's

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.750
actually more than six point to three

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:16.010
damage because of the fact that we have

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:19.910
chemical peels so I believe half of our

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:22.340
shots are gonna be doing either nine

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:24.800
point three damage or possibly twelve

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.210
point four damage you know plus 50% and

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.270
plus one hundred percent respectively on

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:30.800
those values I don't know if that's if

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:34.550
that's accurate but that's that's been

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:36.410
my back at the napkins sort of approach

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.740
we got pentagram for even more damage

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:42.290
and then I'm pretty happy to have super

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.850
bandage for some extra HP I'm gonna take

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.730
a little bit of a risk here and use two

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:51.640
of clubs it's not gonna be remarkably

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:53.690
productive it's allowed us to

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:56.840
potentially pick up us beer at heart

00:07:53.690 --> 00:08:00.140
there thank you HP's looking good and

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:02.270
really this is a run that I don't know

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:04.940
if it's conceivable to mess this one up

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:06.890
it's almost like the perfect run sure

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.000
it's no like brimstone mom's knife or

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:11.660
anything like that but we have seven

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.440
damage leaving the second floor really

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:18.290
good defensive choices as well

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:20.030
stats are nothing to be concerned about

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:22.580
at the present moment we're just like

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:27.650
really really well equipped to tackle

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:29.360
this run so quickly check this and in

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:31.910
fact we're in such a good situation I

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.170
will even well there's no reason to risk

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:35.210
a spear at alright let's just place this

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:37.490
down this is one way to break a slump

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.900
I'll tell you that much these are better

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.430
stats than we have at the end of the

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.900
game sometimes we also have deal with

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:45.070
the devil precedents go along with it

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:47.360
and to be honest with you a pretty nice

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:50.300
trinket here that that is not providing

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.510
us any value yet but could fairly easily

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:57.930
one day

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:59.640
I really want more options we're way

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:03.120
behind schedule for boss rush but it's

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:06.720
so irrelevant that I'm gonna like use

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:13.170
bombs even though I probably should

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:16.050
avoid doing so come on come on you

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:18.780
wouldn't just give me one penny dang

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:21.440
okay well more options we will abandon

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:24.540
there were still some pots left over but

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.880
shouldn't cheese it too much I mean the

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:29.520
game has been extremely kind to us now

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:33.110
it would be nice to make a little bit of

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:36.390
a play for going a little faster because

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:38.160
although boss rush is is not very

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:41.760
relevant to our interest right now it's

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.740
always nice to get another item maybe no

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.800
we have done hush already we haven't

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:48.360
done mega Satan I don't know it wasn't

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.530
really in the cards for us usually if

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.030
you want to do mega satan you're gonna

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:56.700
avoid that first deal with the devil

00:09:53.030 --> 00:10:02.900
which obviously like we did not in case

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:05.520
that's not abundantly clear it's okay i

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:07.890
think let's try out a little magic

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:11.550
musketeer i think five mushrooms is like

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:14.310
a very reasonable opportunity for you to

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:16.020
try to pick up magic mush in my opinion

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:19.170
now this is how you know that my brain

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:21.960
is broken like those are some dawn good

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:23.820
items dude blank card and diplopia we

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.730
have such good stats better stats than

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:29.040
you would ever expect to have oh my god

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.960
go ahead to better stats and you would

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:35.700
ever expect to have by this point in a

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:37.440
run not even sweating that and I'm still

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.300
like you know what would be sick is if

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:43.650
we just used our cube of meat to kill

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:45.480
everything so for 15 cents we could get

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.860
all of this and that actually might be

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.330
the approach I take instead of its

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:52.010
stealing a deal with the devil item but

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:55.200
I do kind of like the idea of stealing

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:57.630
for boss rush items even though blank

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.510
card is really good so I'm gonna try to

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:02.430
do this even though yeah this is the

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:03.640
Pope is one of those items that has

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:06.310
always had a little bit

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:09.640
of a contentious sort of use case I

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:12.190
think now my god more options would have

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:13.840
been real sweet they're like no matter

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:16.930
how you use diplopia it's always

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:19.000
divisive you know it's not like using

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:20.380
the d6 or people are looking at items

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.350
garbage you made a good decision instead

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:25.000
it's like you could have had slightly

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:27.010
more of a slightly less of an

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.990
opportunity cost on diplopia he used it

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:31.030
here and I like that might seem like I'm

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:33.010
being negative i respect that line of

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:36.910
reasoning quite quite a lot to be honest

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:38.620
with you but part of what makes isaac

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:40.840
such an engaging game is that not only

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:42.760
is the game like the gameplay in Isaac

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:47.800
the actual moment the moment dodging and

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:51.340
you know other others such riffraff is

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:54.220
like a seven the meta game though is

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:58.600
like a 19 so on average that makes it a

00:11:54.220 --> 00:12:00.850
13 out of 10 so it's really that kind of

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.800
like evaluation of the value

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:04.480
propositions in my opinion that makes

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.160
the game enduring like the first couple

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.580
of times you play it's kind of fun as a

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:11.560
little Legend of Zelda yeah I get it why

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:14.260
does he have 2300 hours in this and then

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.930
add your like a hundred videos later

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.850
you're like how do you take X drink it

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:22.180
over wide trinket you know it's like it

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:26.980
inspires tribalism in a way that I think

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:29.580
is astonishing okay stop just walking in

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:32.350
it means that is actually just stupid

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:35.410
every room is just full of 80 mushrooms

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:36.970
though so maybe it's not stupid maybe

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:40.450
it's actually genius now that I think

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:43.000
about it uh I really like I don't know

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:45.190
how many probably like 30 videos I've

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.180
gone on this exact same tangent but I

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:51.580
really think that rebirth specifically

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.800
is is one of the most best ones one of

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:56.950
the most well design games of all time

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:58.690
in terms of like structuring it in such

00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:02.680
a way that it encourages repeat play

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:04.690
without being super repetitive it's it's

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.600
like a landmark video game for that

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:10.870
there's no other roguelite has really

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:13.240
come close in my opinion sure there's a

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:16.190
few other rogue lights I got you know a

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.630
hundred hours in two hundred hours

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:19.190
and that's a lot that's a lot of

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:21.500
playtime for many people watching this

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:23.360
that would probably qualify for like the

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.130
most they've ever played a game ever for

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:28.579
anyone that's ever played a MOBA they're

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:31.130
going you're like a little baby you're

00:13:28.579 --> 00:13:35.899
your limited amount of play time makes

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:38.089
me laugh you're like a small child sorry

00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:40.329
it's a little frame II on the preview as

00:13:38.089 --> 00:13:42.860
well I don't know what's going on there

00:13:40.329 --> 00:13:45.019
maybe it's fine I don't know it is weird

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:47.029
like sometimes the preview looks frame

00:13:45.019 --> 00:13:49.220
II and then the video is fine sometimes

00:13:47.029 --> 00:13:50.209
the game looks frame II and the preview

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:53.810
looks smooth as butter

00:13:50.209 --> 00:13:57.519
it's like myriad pseudo technical issues

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:57.519
here but I think it's relatively smooth

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:03.110
but but nothing's come close to Isaac's

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.420
like as far as I'm concerned this game

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:07.820
is like potentially eternal I could play

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:09.769
a once-a-day forever and have a good

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:11.690
time sometimes either you're enjoying it

00:14:09.769 --> 00:14:17.029
more than others oh I won't deny that

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:19.149
acquiescence but it's a testament to the

00:14:17.029 --> 00:14:21.320
design

00:14:19.149 --> 00:14:23.540
Gunjan was close and you know the

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:25.670
updates could could change it but just a

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:29.870
little too long whenever a roguelite is

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:32.360
like the average run is an hour comes a

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:35.300
little tougher for me but your mileage

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.920
may vary sister Maggie so we're really

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:39.790
feeling the burn for not taking more

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.790
options earlier

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:47.630
this dude has not paid out with spiders

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:50.810
I think which is awesome we're almost on

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:53.120
pacer boss rush my dream case for boss

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:58.100
rush is we get one of those rare like

00:14:53.120 --> 00:15:00.860
eight item boss rushes getting four

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:02.990
items for free is great getting eight

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:06.410
items for free is like having another

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:09.560
hole like one runs worth of item room

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:12.530
stacked on top of your existing run now

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:15.230
if all eight of them are active items

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:16.430
might be a little cheesed but so of

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:18.050
course we can seem to get deals with the

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:19.130
devil because of Goathead is you're

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:23.440
wondering where that's coming from

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:26.300
Noah's goblin is like potentially worth

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.890
losing illuminated bulb if we're gonna

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.180
take both of these and I oh we could use

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:31.940
diplopia to get them for free but I

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.800
don't think it's that valuable I could

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:39.080
consider taking knows goblin and

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:42.740
actually no I think we're better off at

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:46.400
the bulb the bulb is really good so his

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:48.620
nose Goblin but we're better off with

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.530
the with the bulb because the idea is

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:54.140
that eventually you know we're gonna

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:56.690
lose diplopia and the odds are like if I

00:15:54.140 --> 00:16:00.560
had to put smart money on it if we get a

00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:02.120
boss rush with four items which by the

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.370
way sometimes you get one with two items

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:06.740
so there is a possibility you get one

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:08.750
with with less than four items but if

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.700
you get four items or more one of them

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:14.290
is probably gonna be active so when you

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:14.290
diplopia you're gonna be able to grab

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:18.620
something to replace this with it and

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:21.260
even if it's a garbage spacebar item

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:24.470
garbage space bar items are made into

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:26.720
pretty good passives just by virtue of

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:30.770
having the illuminated bulb and if it's

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:32.420
useful then the even better but diplopia

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:35.090
is actually a great case for us because

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:36.710
it counts as being fully charged I think

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:38.450
despite the fact that we're not using it

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:41.660
for anything at all right now I am an

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:43.490
idiot moron man the sooner you realize

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.570
this about yourself because it's not

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:46.760
just me I'm talking about the human

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:51.560
condition the better off you're gonna be

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:54.490
my meat brain is so much you know like

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:57.589
so far behind where it should be

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:59.750
and I can't wait for the robots to iron

00:16:57.589 --> 00:17:00.680
out the inefficient process he's first

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:04.669
step robots

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:06.620
stop making me crave Doritos it's it's a

00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:08.689
vestigial trait to want that much you

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:11.530
know salt fat and powdered cheese in my

00:17:08.689 --> 00:17:14.419
body we don't need it anymore

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:17.030
get rid of my Dorito cravings or or

00:17:14.419 --> 00:17:20.240
alternatively robots make the Doritos

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:21.949
like zero calories secondarily make it

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:25.010
so I'm not tempted to use Cuba meat

00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:26.510
anymore you might say onl why don't you

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:29.360
take some personal responsibility and

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:31.190
build you know better habits and this

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.870
applies to the Doritos thing you know as

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:34.250
well as the queue of meat and I say

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:36.740
that's for the birds

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:40.400
that's for less evolved species than

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:43.039
human beings I'm not gonna take any

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:46.760
personal responsibility if I could just

00:17:43.039 --> 00:17:48.950
you know gene mod all of my inefficient

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:53.929
and undesirable traits out of myself

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:59.990
okay I don't need to go through build

00:17:53.929 --> 00:18:03.730
good habits nah son unnecessary on the

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:07.370
shoulders of giants we will let these

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:08.929
big pharma companies develop a way to

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:14.179
create the perfect human being and then

00:18:08.929 --> 00:18:16.220
I'll just opt in we do not actually you

00:18:14.179 --> 00:18:20.299
know what we do want a was cuz the

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:24.380
teleport out of boss Rush is preferable

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:26.240
I suppose but I'm not joking out look I

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:27.770
am of course obviously joking is our

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.600
differences and perhaps even our flaws

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:33.530
as humans that make us unique and

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:37.490
beautiful however I would like to lose

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:39.260
whatever evolutionary trait is going you

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:40.640
know what would be fun crashing into

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.740
enemies with Cuba meat despite having

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.780
like 8.4 damage and a good rate of fire

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:49.730
we can we can dump that get that out of

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:53.289
here we also have to make boss rush

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:56.750
which actually is pretty easy I think

00:18:53.289 --> 00:18:59.140
once no secret room there once you

00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:01.220
realize that we have the compass

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:03.260
shouldn't be too hard even though we're

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:04.909
gonna be maybe a minute behind schedule

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.860
which is significant as you approach the

00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:09.560
end of the game

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:11.090
so you realize that we're rocking that

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.930
compass we should be pretty much good to

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:16.370
go get some bombs in there because

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:18.320
cluster bombs can help take this guy out

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:22.240
I still maintain this is like the

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:24.470
hardest debts boss in the game almost

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:26.000
impossibly the amount of real estate you

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:28.520
have to dodge these shots is like zero

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.190
but this is a fun difficult boss it's

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:32.570
not like when you fight oh I mean you

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:34.010
got it I'm not gonna take that just

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:37.130
because I don't expect to die we also

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:40.400
just got Leviathan and polydactyly

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:42.740
allows me to get an iPhone pose it's not

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.450
like when you have like no damage and

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:46.370
you fight champion Ragman right off the

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:50.090
bat that's just like just just take me

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:51.950
out like a Franz Ferdinand song sorry

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:53.780
like the Franz Ferdinand so I know they

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:56.240
have more songs okay I own self-titled

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:58.550
2004 frame the Franz Ferdinand darker

00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:00.410
than Madden a you know lots of lots of

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:02.240
classics I know the second one as well

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:05.510
which I can't remember what it's called

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:07.010
but it have it had maybe maybe it was

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:09.020
called you can have it so much better I

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:10.940
can't remember there's definitely a song

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.890
on it that was the lead single I think

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:14.930
no the lead single was do you wanna okay

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:16.730
yeah look this is another thing we can

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.560
mod out of my brain although I'm worried

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:20.900
that I would Stepford Wives it a little

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:25.070
bit and lose what makes me unique or at

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:27.950
least eccentric uh what do we got down

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:30.740
here Cannes other eye that's not

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:33.320
particularly strong I'm going to

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:35.960
basically mainline my way to try to make

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:38.740
this diplopia a technique work here and

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:45.740
main line my way to the mom fight

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:46.670
specifically not good although a you

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.680
know we're gonna take a lot of damage

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:50.660
sure but it's not a daily will have to

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.460
do dailies at some point you might as

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:57.310
well get used to the idea that that

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:57.310
those days are approaching again however

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:05.179
we're not that incentivized to not take

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:06.140
damage here in fact like gonna cheese

00:21:05.179 --> 00:21:09.049
through some of these rooms because

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:12.500
really like the whole the thrust of this

00:21:09.049 --> 00:21:14.780
run being interesting is dependent to a

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:16.160
mild extent on making sure that we make

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:20.059
it the boss Russian it looks like we're

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:22.880
going to but on rooms with a a lot of

00:21:20.059 --> 00:21:27.020
annoying enemies it's for the birds to

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:29.840
skip by it can we beat mom in under like

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:31.340
50 seconds I think the answer should be

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:34.990
absolutely unless you fight like a

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:37.400
really cheesy red mom then okay that

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:40.490
puts a foot up and then never puts it

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:42.830
back down happens from time to time but

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:45.440
we're looking good here yeah we're

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:48.850
looking extremely good here God is

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.850
behind looking darn good though

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:54.380
easy money we do want the Polaroid on

00:21:52.309 --> 00:21:56.419
this one the deal with the devil's gonna

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:58.790
stay open but why don't we look you know

00:21:56.419 --> 00:22:01.570
we we already fought Krampus we already

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:04.400
paid the toll there

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:06.740
forget those pills dude we got four

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:12.460
items I think we got a space bar item we

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:14.900
got two space bar items we got proptosis

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:19.610
Jacob's Ladder is like a great one-time

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:22.460
use item mega beam and then the D AIDS

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:25.700
the d8 is your Zane here we'll take

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:27.500
proptosis to proptosis doesn't do jack

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:29.929
apparently but that's fine let's head

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:32.690
down to the next floor we are stat it up

00:22:29.929 --> 00:22:34.370
dude I almost don't want to roll because

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:38.480
our stats are so good but the purpose of

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:40.070
the d8 is having it is rolling even

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:42.230
though this run is like 20 out of 10

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:44.000
right now I am gonna roll now keep in

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:46.490
mind you're gonna go all the stats went

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:51.520
down that was garbage we won't know

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:54.470
until we get the bulb illuminated

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:56.559
whether or not this was a good choice or

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:59.720
a bad choice

00:22:56.559 --> 00:23:02.690
cuz we lose a lot of stats right off the

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:05.330
bat from not having a full charge on our

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:06.740
space bar items so it's gonna take us

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:08.480
four rooms to figure out whether or not

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:10.580
it was a good call and once we're once

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.920
we're set once we got like 20 damage or

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:14.970
something

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:16.890
we'll just that just get our illuminated

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:21.000
bulb to persistently give us an all

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:22.590
stats up even this like if we traded in

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.940
damage for speed we're still killing it

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:29.370
here let's be honest so I think our rate

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:32.850
of fire did get worse and our damage

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:34.200
might have gotten mildly better this one

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:36.450
looks like okay our rate of fire

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.980
improved drastically our speed is

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:39.510
horrible and our damage is gonna be a

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:44.850
little bit less but with Jacob's Ladder

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:47.520
I think it's actually possible although

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:49.800
I don't want to say guaranteed or

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:52.770
probable but I think it's possible that

00:23:49.800 --> 00:24:00.390
this could be kind of the chosen reroll

00:23:52.770 --> 00:24:02.670
here basically like maybe more than

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:05.700
doubled our rate of fire oh why not do

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:09.480
more than doubled our rate of fire

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:12.500
crushed our speed in a bad way but left

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:14.700
us in a in a glorious position from a

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:17.730
DPS standpoint because it only took a

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:22.200
little bit of damage and it gave us an

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:25.680
absolute ton of stats so we're fire and

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:28.920
super quickly our speed is okay not

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:30.030
great but okay I don't want to lose this

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.650
rate of fire I think I'm gonna roll with

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:33.150
this for a little while I think we could

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:35.190
eventually stat up in like all

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:37.920
categories by using d8 I'm not sure

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:39.510
though I think it's every stat as a

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.790
champ an equal chance to go up or down

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:43.650
so if you roll enough you know you might

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:46.110
expect to beat the odds one set of you

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:48.150
know X number of plays everybody by the

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:50.520
way when they're gonna hear that and go

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:52.200
NL that's not how probability works stop

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:54.060
echoing what your stats prof told you

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:58.230
when you slightly misunderstood okay

00:24:54.060 --> 00:25:01.050
that is house that's work sure every

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:03.150
role is an equal chance to you the odds

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:04.650
are the same rolled a roll but the more

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:05.940
you increase the sample size the more

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:08.100
you introduced variance into this

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:10.170
situation you know that's why in a lot

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:12.660
of scientific studies they call outliers

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:16.050
is because Playa is one of the reasons I

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:18.690
suppose is because you know that the

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:20.520
outliers are not actually representative

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:22.660
of what you would expect the mean

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:27.370
response to look like in a sane

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:29.080
so like if you bought a billion lottery

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:34.810
tickets your odds of winning the lottery

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:37.030
go up it's the same people go like you

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:38.590
know they're I don't know why this is

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:40.210
like this is the thing I'm most

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:41.740
passionate about hey ya know how do you

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:44.770
feel about politics the income

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:46.390
inequality and blah blah I don't like to

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:48.240
get into controversial subjects how do

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:51.580
you feel about a misinterpretation of

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:53.860
statistics it's extremely bad but people

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:55.390
will go like you know I I might say

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:57.160
something like well you know if you flip

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:58.950
a coin six times you're probably gonna

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:02.020
get a head's at some point people go

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:04.510
excuse me the number every time you flip

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:07.180
it you have the same odds as the first

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:09.640
time you flipped it yeah yeah you ain't

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:12.100
wrong but just why don't you go test it

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:16.270
for yourself go to random.org flip a

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:19.000
coin do it six times tell me how many

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:21.010
times you don't get ahead or like do it

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.610
six times times like a thousand tell me

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:26.590
how many times you don't get ahead you

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:29.020
know you lose 50 percent likelihood

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:30.570
every single time of the sample working

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:34.720
assuming it's an equally weighted coin

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:36.220
they people just commonly not everybody

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:40.960
and you might be saying who thinks this

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:42.820
NL I know people who think this we

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:45.910
almost should fight hush except our

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:48.490
resources like are not necessary to like

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:50.560
we don't have the requirements like

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:52.330
people I think they just misinterpret

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:55.120
probability a little bit is what I'm

00:26:52.330 --> 00:27:00.220
trying to say if you flip a coin once

00:26:55.120 --> 00:27:02.020
yes fifty-fifty no question if you flip

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:05.320
a coin six times what are the odds of

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:08.500
not getting any heads it's like 1 over 2

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:10.660
to the power of 6 you've got a 1 in 64

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:12.340
chance of never getting the heads you

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:14.980
don't have a 50-50 chance of never

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:16.480
getting a head when you put it in plain

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:17.950
text like that I think is obvious but

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.450
sometimes people they've ever

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:20.890
misinterpreted a little bit so we should

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:23.110
we have to speaking of which we are

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:25.090
we're misinterpreting our means of using

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:27.070
Duffy's head here we should use guppies

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:30.580
head at the end of a room instead of at

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:32.920
the start of a room so that we get the

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:34.840
maximum value from having illuminated

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:36.830
bulb here

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:38.419
by the way if you're saying nobody

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:43.370
thinks that congratulations you have

00:27:38.419 --> 00:27:47.899
like very intelligent friends and also

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:48.529
you don't read YouTube comments it's

00:27:47.899 --> 00:27:51.320
good stuff

00:27:48.529 --> 00:27:52.850
we should stick with the illuminated

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:55.820
bulb I think quite obviously here it's

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:57.590
given us good stats we maybe should have

00:27:55.820 --> 00:28:01.220
rolled the d8 a little bit more but you

00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:04.750
know that train is sailed we also became

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:08.179
Guffey way so it's like using Guppies

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:11.330
head is not really particularly relevant

00:28:08.179 --> 00:28:14.029
potentially but this has been a an 11

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:14.990
out of 10 run like a very very very good

00:28:14.029 --> 00:28:18.049
run

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:20.840
then we've pretty much have no reason

00:28:18.049 --> 00:28:22.909
whatsoever to complain about everything

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:24.740
went very well here oh you know leave

00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:27.830
one spear a tarp I know this is another

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:29.929
statistical let me explain it to you and

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:32.980
then so many no ok see I'm just joking

00:28:29.929 --> 00:28:36.529
that was that's just laziness on my part

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:39.860
alright so dream crush this dude you're

00:28:36.529 --> 00:28:42.799
done we out this would actually be a 10

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:47.389
out of 4 run that's right it would be

00:28:42.799 --> 00:28:50.950
250 percent if we could get a void

00:28:47.389 --> 00:29:01.779
portal so dump on that thank you

00:28:50.950 --> 00:29:04.279
good very good decent very good good

00:29:01.779 --> 00:29:07.070
sorry Stuart it's a good item but

00:29:04.279 --> 00:29:09.799
guppies head has a beat the Halos good

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:14.380
item rubber cement is - did you want to

00:29:09.799 --> 00:29:14.380
get a weird mama let's get weird

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:23.759
this is a I'll call it like maybe the

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:26.250
most powerful and yet also fun run that

00:29:23.759 --> 00:29:29.340
I have had since starting up the new

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:31.799
save file this is like we got so many of

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:33.450
the cool items that are also semi new at

00:29:31.799 --> 00:29:37.470
least from you know my standpoint that

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:43.350
I'm I'm stoked we would steamroll void

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:50.970
and delirium specifically but make me

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:53.549
prove it Oh shucks we don't get to fight

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:55.919
the Delirium on this one we do get store

00:29:53.549 --> 00:29:56.909
