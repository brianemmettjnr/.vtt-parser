##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.899
everybody welcome ectonurite Lampley is

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.370
the binding of issac after birth plus uh

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.670
I still sound sick but not as sick as I

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.750
used to sound I feel ten times better as

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.219
a result of that I feel like we're gonna

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.570
start rolling through these challenges

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.119
again I'm gonna I'm gonna try to talk a

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.160
little at a more conversational tone

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.800
today I know I said I'd do like a

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.359
refresh like standard runs but kind of

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.769
want to knock out some of these

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.560
challenges at least get some extra

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.900
momentum under my belt I've faced with

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.690
the way I've faced that's probably not

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.300
how that expression actually works okay

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.770
that looks weird but can't conceivably

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.160
be that much worse than what we already

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.430
have going on he said without realizing

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.980
he was becoming part of a modern meme a

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.309
narrator it could become much worse than

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.440
it actually starts as but um yeah so

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.719
yesterday I felt bad and my voice

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.719
sounded bad and that sucked today I

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:05.909
sound okay and I feel actually like 95%

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:08.159
like I'm in a good spot however once

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.770
every like 15 minutes you'll probably

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.710
deal with a little dead air as I mute my

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.200
microphone and cough like something from

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.780
a Ridley Scott movie has embedded itself

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.780
in my lungs I actually consider myself

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.130
pretty lucky I prefer it this way and as

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.229
opposed to yesterday and I feel like

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.720
getting over this illness faster than

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.090
usual just every once in a while I feel

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.380
like a little telltale scratchy scratch

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.119
on the back of the throat and then like

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.810
blossoms into full-blown like eye

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.850
watering like I need the cough and then

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.960
my confidence all good so just if I mute

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.700
my microphone and you don't hear

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.939
anything try not to think about what's

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.060
happening in the background I promise

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.920
it's for your own well-being

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.320
dude this is honestly like as far as PAX

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.619
pox goes I don't think I got sick at PAX

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.659
last year I did this year obviously but

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.799
I've had some worse ones one year I got

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.570
strep throat head pax that was like

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.280
pretty much the worst I'm not blaming

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.489
anybody here's the thing people always

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.830
blame like everybody else when they get

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.930
sick at PAX the gamers don't watch

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.370
their hands you probably washed your

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.890
hands as much as I did it's just if the

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.810
disease is already there what do you

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.770
what are you supposed to do right like

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.900
there were people I saw people like in

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.000
the hotel bar one of these hotels have

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.670
standing like shoulder to shoulder with

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.370
five hundred two thousand other people

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.930
that are also at the convention staying

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.430
up until 4:00 a.m. they're gonna get on

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.010
Twitter and be like all the people at

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.000
the convention made me sick come on

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.160
let's take some ownership for it

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.230
ourselves we still can't defeat the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.850
bacteria and viruses of mother nature

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.280
like that easily you know we gotta at

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.770
least at least eat some oranges and then

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.310
start to complain I don't know what I'm

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.440
talking about

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.440
either way that this is nothing dude the

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:03.630
year I had strep was actually terrible

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:05.910
because it lasted like two weeks I can't

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.940
touch that without dying but yeah this

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.900
is honestly just a couple of days of

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.490
getting like 12 hours of sleep a night

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.950
suffering mildly through the NL SS and

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.200
then repeating the same thing the next

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.820
day one you're like a dream come true to

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.320
just want to be with you three girl it's

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.620
plain to see that you're the only one

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.380
for me now so yeah I wanted to get these

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.670
challenges done mostly because I feel we

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:37.380
still got a lot of them left to do I'm

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:41.760
not against the idea of doing refresh

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:44.209
runs cuz it really is pardon me a good

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.190
opportunity for me to refresh my

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.500
enjoyment and also like especially we're

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.910
gonna do not just challenges but this is

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.239
like a supercut of the hardest

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:57.269
challenges we've ever done so you should

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.700
be aware of the fact that we might get a

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.900
little disillusioned this one even is

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.489
not that bad

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.820
this is one of the challenges we should

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.860
have one but failed pretty much because

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.110
I'm an idiot didn't I take like if a can

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.299
some weird garbage to like make this

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.299
nearly impossible to win I think I did

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.359
so we might need those refresh runs at

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.250
some point but for now I'm feeling

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.530
relatively strong and I feel good about

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.750
this run as is right now we haven't

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:29.850
really markedly improved the run too

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.949
much however we do have a tinted rock

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.490
which allows us to get a spirit heart

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:38.250
and a ton of money and actually we might

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:43.350
be able to pick up an item from our shop

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:50.100
ooh and then all will be well

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:51.570
hopefully sickness as like someone who

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.470
uses their voice for a living is very

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:58.740
strange dude we'd probably want diplopia

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.979
I feel so much better today then I felt

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:05.060
yesterday and two days ago but like when

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:08.580
the voice wants to go it just goes I

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:12.330
need to like respect my real life skill

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.039
points into like throat health not a

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.860
high value skill it's like leveling

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:19.289
attunement in Dark Souls 2 but dude for

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:25.289
my specific unique character build I

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:26.699
think it would be valuable I've already

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.280
lost all the points that I put in to

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:32.280
hair you can just move some of those

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.349
like charity wise into in the throat

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:38.430
health I'd be a happy camper what do you

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:39.990
think tell mo he's asleep and his ear

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.330
twitch says please don't talk to me

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:46.470
that's what I garnered from that at

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:49.610
least okay we're gonna get a deal with

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.610
that one this could change everything

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:58.699
Joker card also great shops gonna be

00:05:53.910 --> 00:06:00.780
amazing it's sort of changes everything

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:04.979
especially if we can get something good

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:06.419
from this demon judgement here world

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.889
card is good enough we can use that

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:12.020
right now we want to save the Joker card

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:18.020
obviously come on

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:20.090
we definitely want both I think even if

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.400
it does put us in slightly scary of a

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:27.800
situation that would have been a great

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:31.610
HP upgrade apart from that okay grab

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:36.259
these we could now offer up a little bit

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:37.930
more to the demon judgment it might not

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:39.800
be everybody's favorite approach

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.210
actually now that I think about it there

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:47.990
was a much better play here do you see

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:53.449
it the idea would be to use that's so

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:55.690
good and into the guns

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:58.039
I clearly should not have done that um

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.720
would have been to buy diplopia from the

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:02.060
shop and then use the Joker card to grab

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.110
everything but I think we'll take the

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.810
plebeian nonetheless we don't really

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.400
want this garbage rate here let's see if

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.960
our deal with the devil has anything

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.840
left in it we can still use diplopia to

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:16.880
double whatever we get from demon

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:19.729
judgement if anything at all health up

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.490
perks I'll still go for it a little bit

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:26.120
here come on you know he's gonna give me

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:28.280
something there we go no need to double

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.900
that but I feel pretty good about our

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.960
situations let's head down to the next

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.310
floor this is not a long run so I'm

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.509
gonna start to like the swing for the

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:38.150
fences pretty quickly like I'm gonna use

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:39.919
the Joker card right away and this might

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:44.150
do it right here we diplopia get a free

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:46.130
brimstone and a free little delirium we

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:50.199
can pay extra for another little

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:52.699
delirium which I think I might do and

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:55.009
honestly we just broke the game are we

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:57.620
broke the challenge I should say we

00:07:55.009 --> 00:08:00.110
should have pretty much no ability to

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.370
fail except for the fact that I'll admit

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:01.669
that I didn't realize this until just

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.259
now

00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:04.789
except for the fact that we have one

00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:07.310
point three six damage so soymilk

00:08:04.789 --> 00:08:09.020
brimstone is is no amazing combination

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.639
necessarily but it's still very good

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.039
because we can actually hit enemies with

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:14.710
it reliably so we've probably just come

00:08:13.039 --> 00:08:19.789
out ahead in the in the head trauma

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:23.330
challenge the head trauma challenge head

00:08:19.789 --> 00:08:24.800
trauma I want to scream so loud for you

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:27.229
y'all that's not cool dude

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:30.349
that was my inner day and easily did you

00:08:27.229 --> 00:08:33.469
guys see the photo of Dan at CBS

00:08:30.349 --> 00:08:36.800
headquarters dressed like the hero from

00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:39.440
mystery men it got me good dude he was

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:41.000
telling us in Seattle he's like yeah I

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.580
was in LA this week Phil at filming

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.680
something for CBS and we're like oh

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:48.260
that's cool it's it's weird sometimes to

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:52.149
remember that you know we have a friend

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.149
who is like a genuine celebrity

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:58.190
not to be like self-deprecating but

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.899
still you're like oh

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:05.810
CBS that's a three-letter Network I've

00:08:59.899 --> 00:09:09.440
heard of it let's head downwards I think

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:11.329
uh and then to see that photo I was like

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.010
well he was not kidding he was not just

00:09:11.329 --> 00:09:15.260
down there going like hey Julie here so

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:17.839
I think's gonna win he was like he was

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:23.270
deep in the production he didn't mention

00:09:17.839 --> 00:09:24.980
the superhero outfit the first time now

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:26.270
we also got super lucky we didn't get a

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.920
deal with the devil on the last floor

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:32.480
which sounds like the opposite of how we

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:34.880
should be pleased but it's actually very

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.430
very good double little delirium by the

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:40.070
way is not that good but I figured it's

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:43.160
okay and for one red heart it's not that

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:45.410
bad what we really need is like a damage

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.329
multiplier or alternatively just a lot

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.980
of damage upgrades we don't even need

00:09:47.329 --> 00:09:51.110
that because the run only goes to mom

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.579
but it would be the single biggest thing

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:55.630
that could benefit us the most for sure

00:09:52.579 --> 00:09:59.329
so head traumas gonna be taken out here

00:09:55.630 --> 00:10:01.399
almost certainly and I gotta see what we

00:09:59.329 --> 00:10:02.990
unlock for this and by goddess II I mean

00:10:01.399 --> 00:10:09.290
I gotta wait and see we'll be online for

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:11.810
this the great thing about brimstone is

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:16.010
that it kind of nullifies our ability to

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:18.190
screw ourselves over like I can't

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:20.209
conceivably pick up epic hack him and

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:22.730
find ourselves in times of trouble

00:10:20.209 --> 00:10:29.950
mother Mary comes for me singing words

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:29.950
of wisdom IPEC se

00:10:31.709 --> 00:10:36.580
gotta not do that voice like the the

00:10:34.779 --> 00:10:39.910
prepubescent voice cracks are coming

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:44.410
fast and furious man this is why I like

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:46.209
I don't want to get into it necessarily

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:48.490
but so I can never get behind the idea

00:10:46.209 --> 00:10:50.980
of intelligent design instead of

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:54.850
evolution you know we got this one pipe

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:58.330
here controls air controls speech you

00:10:54.850 --> 00:11:00.100
drink through it you eat through it you

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:03.220
vomit through it if something goes wrong

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:04.779
in your stomach it's like the opposite

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:07.270
of writing good code you know you want

00:11:04.779 --> 00:11:11.080
your code to be loosely coupled and

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:14.470
highly cohesive the human body is like

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:16.540
tightly coupled and and not cohesive

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:18.700
it's like one one unit of body

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:20.290
accomplishes like 40 different functions

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.600
see this is probably not that good of a

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:26.350
bit right now but it's at the

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:28.570
intersection of a degree that I worked

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:30.070
for and have since like lost the

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:32.560
requisite knowledge of information to

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:34.750
hold and Mike my current intellectual

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:39.670
pursuit so for me it's it's a pet joke

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:41.079
but for you it was Tuesday that was Sean

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:43.720
Connery as m.bison

00:11:41.079 --> 00:11:46.329
for some reason you don't need Sean

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:49.240
Connery as m.bison raúl juliá already

00:11:46.329 --> 00:11:51.130
knocked it out of the park most famous

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:54.790
maybe for being gomez addams but come on

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:57.000
am vice the movies garbage but Raul

00:11:54.790 --> 00:12:03.160
Julia's portrayal of m.bison is like

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:05.560
seen chewing wonderfulness as is

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:08.079
jean-claude van Damme as guile but for

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:10.510
different reasons and you've lost your

00:12:08.079 --> 00:12:16.240
balls that's not a very good I can't do

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:18.440
it a Belgian accent so I can't speak to

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:22.050
that but

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:25.110
you could just get busted here

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:28.560
I think we're highly highly safe to be

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:29.670
honest with you didn't get a deal with

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.700
the devil here but we only have two

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:34.830
floors remaining so I'm pretty confident

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:36.390
that basically we maybe just got a bad

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:39.990
roll first time and this time we're

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:41.280
completely set so let's try this one of

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.680
the nice things about challenges with no

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.450
item rooms and it I'm grasping at straws

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.310
here and it's like well one of the nice

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:49.140
things about tuberculosis get a lot of

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:54.180
downtime and now one of the nice things

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:55.620
about challenges is there's no item

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:59.400
rooms you got a good excuse to use your

00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:02.270
keys for golden chests not really a

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:04.380
major concern but could be worse you

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:09.600
know a lot of the times we walk into

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:10.830
this room and be like no way which in in

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.390
hindsight perhaps you should have done

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:15.510
given the caliber the items that we got

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:18.540
but that's fine and it's kind of the

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:21.150
classic and Allies ik irony you know as

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:23.100
I find myself like coming to the end of

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.990
the challenges I realized that in

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:28.770
actuality I might miss him a little bit

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:30.810
so that's why I logged in today and I

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.580
was like am I gonna do regular runs

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:35.040
regular runs sound pretty fun but at the

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:36.870
same time I got a task sitting on my

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.220
plate here beat all the challenges and I

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:42.450
want to get it done cuz I know in

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:45.090
particular ultra hard speed maybe own

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:47.070
and streak are gonna be garbage so we

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:49.740
might as well unless we get super lucky

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:51.420
we might as well knock out the ones we

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:55.860
probably should have beaten on the first

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:58.680
try and really like failing a challenge

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:01.230
that's hard once is no big deal I can

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:03.360
live with that I'll start to get sad if

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:04.680
we fail these challenges that even if

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.660
they are hard if we failed them over

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:09.300
three videos or four videos that's where

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:12.630
like my self-esteem is gonna take a

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:14.190
little bit of a hit my dream is like no

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:15.690
challenge takes more than two and I

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:19.010
think for most that's very realistic

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:21.240
ultra hard and speed are really like

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:23.450
it's a crapshoot but maybe we'll get

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.450
lucky

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:29.980
and who knows dude maybe the dayquil is

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.690
a performance-enhancing drug although I

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:35.140
have to be honest I'd love to continue

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:37.810
with the dayquil joke but it's dayquil

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:39.520
joke also my favorite Canadian alt

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:45.430
rocker who's very popular in Sweden

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:49.090
that's a Danko Jones joke um I don't

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:52.210
know there's a case to be made for the

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:53.560
ventricular razor I don't really want to

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:54.640
choose my way out of basta rush if

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.080
anything I might want to fight on

00:14:54.640 --> 00:15:00.160
Bosphorus just for fun so let's just

00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:02.410
take charge baby and some HP not for any

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:08.260
particular reason except try to amplify

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:11.140
the enjoyment factor here we got death

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:14.440
and we've got temperance neither of

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:16.270
which are that relevant um but actually

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.260
they I can't continue the dayquil joke

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:19.000
first off because it might be

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.320
irresponsible I don't know hey if

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
there's anybody out there that abuses

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:25.450
dayquil but it wouldn't surprise me I

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.910
mean there are stimulants in it like I

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:29.710
didn't even realize it until this bit

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:31.480
that I recycle over and over but I

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:34.210
didn't realize dayquil was actually a

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:36.220
stimulant until I had it and drank a cup

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.300
of coffee in the same hour and ended up

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:41.080
feeling like my heart was gonna explode

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:42.640
not personally recommended and I'll take

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.710
the L on that one I'm happy to let

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:48.010
everybody know that I'm in the idiot is

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:49.540
what I told Kate she was like let's grab

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:51.250
the fire rate up even though I doubt it

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:54.760
does would did do something and the

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:58.600
damage F is very nice here and we can

00:15:54.760 --> 00:16:03.400
fly now but she was like how do you not

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:05.620
know that you can't uh you can't take

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.880
coffee in cold medicine in the same you

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.410
know general area I was I don't know

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.850
that's how I took cold medicine I was

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:12.970
like twelve that's before my coffee

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:14.410
drinking days so I'll happily I'll

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:16.630
happily make myself look like an idiot

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:17.830
so that you guys know not to mix those

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:19.330
two I don't know if it's

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:20.530
life-threatening but either way but the

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.330
other reason is cuz we went to the

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:25.450
grocery store last night and I was like

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:28.690
okay I gotta get some like I got a cold

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:30.610
routine I like one container of

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:32.709
medicated cough drops you take like once

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:34.420
every two hours and then like some that

00:16:32.709 --> 00:16:36.490
you can just freebase whenever you

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:38.889
the support I'd like to get Buckley's

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:42.220
it's a Canadian cough syrup brand their

00:16:38.889 --> 00:16:44.410
slogan is uh it tastes awful and it

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:47.079
works and it sort of does although it

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:48.970
burns my throat going down on a I mean

00:16:47.079 --> 00:16:50.860
it's not really the taste so much is the

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:55.269
fact that it's like swallowing rancid

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:59.790
mint burns the throat it's like paint

00:16:55.269 --> 00:17:01.839
thinner mixed with the bad paint thinner

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:04.990
and I get some think when I get some

00:17:01.839 --> 00:17:06.970
nyquil nyquil for the symptomatic

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:09.730
suppression as well as the the fact that

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:13.030
it helps you sleep they had five

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:15.490
different kinds of nyquil no dayquil I

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:17.679
was wondering if maybe like it was after

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:21.970
hours at the pharmacy which is my

00:17:17.679 --> 00:17:23.709
favorite Tom Waits album but maybe day

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.699
quills like locked in one of the

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:26.589
cabinets that you have to have a

00:17:24.699 --> 00:17:29.830
pharmacist open for you or something

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:33.340
it's got some kind of ingredient you can

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:34.750
synthesize into drugs I don't know and I

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:37.270
was also like who needs five different

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:38.860
kinds of nyquil there's like regular

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:41.380
nyquil and then there's cherry nightmare

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:42.880
that's all you don't need nyquil but

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:46.419
this one specifically for it's not a

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:49.510
medicine come on I'm not trying to blow

00:17:46.419 --> 00:17:51.549
up you know Vicks game here but

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:55.360
Michael's not a medicine is it's a sleep

00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:59.260
aid that suppresses you symptoms it's

00:17:55.360 --> 00:18:03.250
not actually like treating the cold so

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:05.559
when I see the you know nyquil flu

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:08.500
nyquil cold I'm like come on

00:18:05.559 --> 00:18:10.059
those are like 99.9% the same I got

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:12.160
maybe I'm being ignorant here if you

00:18:10.059 --> 00:18:13.770
work in Clack so SmithKline or Procter &amp;

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:16.630
Gamble please feel free to let me know

also send me a free supply dude I will

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:20.040
endorse those products no doubt

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:25.779
they work wonders in my opinion I'm

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.610
gonna says salty that apparently

00:18:25.779 --> 00:18:29.799
somebody's ruined a quill so I have to

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:32.380
like you know speak to an actual person

00:18:29.799 --> 00:18:36.159
in order to get it for myself so I don't

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:39.159
really like any of these items enough I

00:18:36.159 --> 00:18:40.929
mean mom's contact is good but hello

00:18:39.159 --> 00:18:42.730
Tomo I don't like any of these items

00:18:40.929 --> 00:18:44.169
enough to actually do boss rush but I

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:46.929
gonna do boss rush anyway cuz otherwise

00:18:44.169 --> 00:18:51.309
the videos like 18 minutes long and it's

00:18:46.929 --> 00:18:53.169
not quite right ya know dayquil so I'm

00:18:51.309 --> 00:18:55.630
I'm just on coffee and buckley's right

00:18:53.169 --> 00:18:57.340
now which is like if you see a Canadian

00:18:55.630 --> 00:19:01.240
singer do an album called coffee and

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:02.289
Buckley's ask them if they're okay it's

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:04.389
a bad sign

00:19:02.289 --> 00:19:07.299
let me let my Tomo friend in here which

00:19:04.389 --> 00:19:08.980
is a bit of a redundancy I suppose

00:19:07.299 --> 00:19:16.059
hello Tomo I'm also gonna mute my mic

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:27.389
for a second let's go but you can tell

00:19:16.059 --> 00:19:33.039
I'm excited let's go Tomo hey buddy

00:19:27.389 --> 00:19:34.320
but what is it did you just poop I think

00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:38.889
that's a yes

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:41.049
we got poopy side Thom oh hey Netflix if

00:19:38.889 --> 00:19:44.049
you're watching this renew the return of

00:19:41.049 --> 00:19:45.789
Mystery Science Theater 3000 I know you

00:19:44.049 --> 00:19:48.340
might have done it already and you can't

00:19:45.789 --> 00:19:51.090
speak to that yet because of business

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:53.679
things that I wouldn't understand

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:55.179
got to get licensed for wizards in the

00:19:53.679 --> 00:19:59.320
Lost Kingdom 3 or something like that

00:19:55.179 --> 00:20:01.419
they did a super job and I would like

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.620
you to renew the television show because

00:20:01.419 --> 00:20:04.330
it was excellent

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.830
maybe it's cost prohibitive maybe he

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:09.899
doesn't get as many viewers as orange is

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:14.080
the new black but they did a great job

00:20:09.899 --> 00:20:16.389
and I would hate to see it return just

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:20.590
to get a one-off sees it's an enduring

00:20:16.389 --> 00:20:22.179
style of content dude anyway you don't

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:24.340
have to tweet Netflix to tell them to

00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:26.649
bring back Mystery Science Theater 3000

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:28.299
the return but I tweeted them I just

00:20:26.649 --> 00:20:31.899
want my support to be known in whatever

00:20:28.299 --> 00:20:34.789
capacity that offers yo this cat is

00:20:31.899 --> 00:20:39.829
looking at me like he is high as

00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:43.609
right now Telmo what did you get into

00:20:39.829 --> 00:20:46.309
buddy one of the mailbox catnip petroi

00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:49.909
toys trophies that's right we don't have

00:20:46.309 --> 00:20:57.320
cat toys we have cat toys of the helen

00:20:49.909 --> 00:21:01.059
of variety Telmo you ever wonder what

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:04.129
goes on in like a cat's minds cuz like I

00:21:01.059 --> 00:21:07.190
think about that sometimes and I also

00:21:04.129 --> 00:21:08.449
think about the carriage but I think

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:10.129
about that sometimes cuz like we know

00:21:08.449 --> 00:21:12.919
what it's like to be sentience we have

00:21:10.129 --> 00:21:14.299
at least a I think this is how it is for

00:21:12.919 --> 00:21:16.849
me I guess I shouldn't speak to anybody

00:21:14.299 --> 00:21:18.829
else's opinions but I kind of have like

00:21:16.849 --> 00:21:21.409
an internal monologue running all the

00:21:18.829 --> 00:21:23.239
time in in English or at least in in a

00:21:21.409 --> 00:21:25.039
language that my brain interprets is

00:21:23.239 --> 00:21:26.869
English without getting you know

00:21:25.039 --> 00:21:31.249
difference between like machine code and

00:21:26.869 --> 00:21:32.869
plain text but anyway the point is so I

00:21:31.249 --> 00:21:35.209
kind of like a have thoughts in my head

00:21:32.869 --> 00:21:38.389
like if I get cut off in traffic I go

00:21:35.209 --> 00:21:40.219
like this guy's being a real jerk what

00:21:38.389 --> 00:21:43.969
are they do you think cats possess that

00:21:40.219 --> 00:21:45.919
level of cognitive ability you think

00:21:43.969 --> 00:21:47.629
this can is sitting here thinking like I

00:21:45.919 --> 00:21:50.749
am going to go to sleep now

00:21:47.629 --> 00:21:53.059
or do you like with language attached to

00:21:50.749 --> 00:21:56.899
it or you think it happens on like a

00:21:53.059 --> 00:21:59.469
lower level I'm sleepy now I am sleeping

00:21:56.899 --> 00:21:59.469
you know

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:03.770
I wonder sometimes I'm not trying to

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:06.440
suggest that cats are stupid I think

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:09.500
that oh he looked at me like you better

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:11.090
not be like they're actually they have

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:13.309
their own unique personalities which i

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:15.710
think is indicative of being clever to

00:22:13.309 --> 00:22:17.090
some degree plus I'm not like an animal

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:20.059
neurologist so I don't know to begin

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:22.190
with right like I'll be the first to

00:22:20.059 --> 00:22:23.299
tell you that you know you should listen

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:24.950
to someone who actually knows what

00:22:23.299 --> 00:22:27.140
they're talking about but be kind of

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:29.929
interesting you know as a sentient

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:31.760
creature to think about what did what

00:22:29.929 --> 00:22:32.990
existence is like for a creature that's

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:35.600
yeah I mean I guess

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:39.039
cats are sentient but do they know that

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:39.039
they're sentient you know what I mean

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:46.490
it's a little weird it's kind of like

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:48.440
it's like an ich ich an LSS topic and

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:50.570
I'm playing the role of Nick here so I

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:52.429
need an I need a northern lion character

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:54.020
to step in and be like my dude what are

00:22:52.429 --> 00:22:55.520
you talking about there's people dying

00:22:54.020 --> 00:23:02.210
out there you're worried about what cats

00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:03.620
are thinking about Tomo I'll tell you

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:06.020
straight up I don't know if there's a

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:09.460
whole lot going on upstairs but he's

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:13.130
quite handsome I can't deny that and

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:16.450
moreover you should enjoy tomo the fact

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:18.260
that you know you can be a little bit

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:20.270
ignorant without there being

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:22.909
consequences for it like you're always

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:27.320
gonna have us to put the food in the

00:23:22.909 --> 00:23:30.350
dish and change the litter box you got

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:33.669
nothing to worry about buddy just go to

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:33.669
sleep in your tangerine box

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:40.260
I should never have chosen to do boss

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:42.510
rush but here I am and it's actually

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:44.940
like going okay I forgot what the next

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:49.890
challenge was we're definitely going to

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:54.210
survive the 1.56 damage is slowly

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:55.470
killing me like inside or out we're

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:57.090
gonna knock one out and I think that's

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:58.350
like hey I don't mean knock one out like

00:23:57.090 --> 00:24:00.360
that you sickos but I think it's like

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:09.750
pretty positive for our morale to be

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:11.850
honest with you headed to our next

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:15.080
challenge being positive like we can if

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:17.970
we can beat 50% of the challenges that

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:20.730
we failed on the first try or a I should

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:22.830
say on the second try I guess am I gonna

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:24.420
be happy no but it's a start

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:27.980
you know we're we're on one right now

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.980
one for what is as good as it gets

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:34.679
unfortunately boss rush is never gonna

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:36.030
end cuz I being me astute Isaac player

00:24:34.679 --> 00:24:38.820
that I am I thought to myself you know

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:42.059
it would be smart let's go to boss rush

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:44.010
with 1.56 damage excuse me streamer

00:24:42.059 --> 00:24:45.330
that's willfully misrepresenting things

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:47.220
you have a one-foot you have a three

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:51.990
rate of fire that's true you're not

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:54.540
wrong it's fairly good don't die

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:58.890
this is like almost an exact repeat of

00:24:54.540 --> 00:25:02.130
what we did earlier on the on the head

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:03.750
trauma challenge I think just finding a

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:06.620
unique way to accidentally screw

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:06.620
ourselves over

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:14.070
dude you know what the real test is

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:15.570
gonna be for my voice is if I can get

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:18.480
through like a West of loathing video

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:22.470
those were like so much fun to recorded

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:25.230
my voice was well good maybe it is good

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:27.120
in that situation because you barely

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:29.610
have to maintain any kind of monologue

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:30.990
all you do is read things that smarter

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:34.260
people than yourself have wrote and it's

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:36.179
funny but with a broken voice I don't

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:41.309
know that it sounds like a unique form

00:25:36.179 --> 00:25:43.460
of misery but luckily healthy Ryan

00:25:41.309 --> 00:25:45.360
recorded like 10,000 of those

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:47.480
unfortunately they all have horrible

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:54.200
audio desync but apart from the head

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:56.640
ended up being a huge positive please

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:59.490
Bob's brain I'm begging you

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:02.779
land some shots kill some enemies get

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:02.779
messy make mistakes

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:12.460
keep backing it up coz my daddy taught

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:14.990
me good

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:17.360
are we done been here for like eight

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:19.070
minutes we're not done okay

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:22.580
that's alright we still got five and a

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:28.220
half HP moms contact definitely was not

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:32.810
worth doing this for I could be sippin

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:35.590
on neo Citroen right now having a nice

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:35.590
herbal tea

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:46.490
instead I got a deal with you know wave

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:47.000
99 of 100 of this so my own I can't help

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:51.800
myself

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.840
I need like a an Isaac manager who just

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:55.940
goes like hey don't do that you got the

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.890
win just take it you know you're in

00:26:55.940 --> 00:27:00.160
danger of like Terrell Owens in yourself

00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:00.160
here

00:27:07.659 --> 00:27:12.020
at least this is the easier one to kill

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:15.080
cuz like he's doing chain reaction

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:15.649
damage to himself we've done it okay you

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.149
