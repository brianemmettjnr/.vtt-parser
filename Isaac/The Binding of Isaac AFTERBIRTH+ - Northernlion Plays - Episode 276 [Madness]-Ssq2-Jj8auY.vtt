00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.680
everybody welcome back to northern lion

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.919
is trapped in a game that he cannot win

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.840
for some reason we're eating let's go I

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.880
do I sound demoralized I don't know

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.900
maybe being demoralized is exactly what

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.960
I need right now

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:21.539
70s 2d 4b 4d be a D board default epochs

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.420
divorce divorce evil or Devo did he do

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.480
you start with them again actually just

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.580
like last run really really good stats -

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.630
the HP and our spirit heart has all

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.750
sorts of potential last run I mean every

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.540
single loss has like an obvious thing

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:45.090
associated with it like a proximate

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:50.430
cause that makes perfect sense I think

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:53.340
we can afford to the the last one was

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.800
bomber boy bomber boy was amazing but

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.270
then bomber boy plus mr. boom might have

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.520
gotten us crushed so I'm actually like

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.960
mad at myself for allowing myself to get

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.330
hit when in that powerful situation

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.710
especially after I said it's my dream

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.869
come true but I've been humbled I don't

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.830
wanna I want to pull back I feel like

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.750
I've put myself into this narrative the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.820
narrative has been like whatever damage

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.900
you get is a pretty good room whatever

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.100
damage you get on the start in the spawn

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.780
that's the damage you're going to have

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.329
when you fight mom damage that's bond

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.759
damage and mom for whatever reason the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.799
damage hasn't been flowing as quickly as

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.600
I needed to most of the time we are

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.280
going to get the 15 cents since we don't

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.420
have a pill we could buy one but I'm

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.939
going to buy there's options instead

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.579
this should help us out honestly if

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.869
Isaac got harder even if it's indirectly

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.420
just by virtue of the fact that there's

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.890
more non tears related and non damage

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.020
related items thanks to the booster

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.939
packs being added that's good it's a

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.610
good thing but we do have to change our

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.110
playing style a little bit and if this

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.320
is the rude awakening that it takes to

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.390
make that happen then so be it

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.390
we're almost at - there you go

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.810
close we probably yeah pacifiers no

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.160
question right here we want that tears

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.870
upgrade we want that spirit our we're

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.480
going to go down to the next floor and

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:24.430
I'm thinking we got on in the above all

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.890
else we've got to play better we could

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.110
have won the last run we were very glass

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.330
cannon E and it was also the last room

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.340
we walked into was our immediate cause

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.590
of death you know if you don't recall I

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.970
believe I said I looked God in the face

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.770
and said really you're going to do me

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.620
like that it was a room where there were

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.900
champion vaginal bomb flies that just

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.459
rushed me down like in a narrow room

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.430
that I had basically no chance to escape

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:51.940
it I don't say I take full ownership of

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:55.180
my idiocy almost all the time but in

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.970
this case I really did have no chance to

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.860
escape I'm in my opinion at least maybe

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.240
if I made the greatest Dodgers of all

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.860
time and you know what maybe previously

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.450
I would have made the greatest Dodgers

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.940
of all time and it's the self defeating

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.030
belief that's got me thinking I can't do

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.540
it now but I really think what we need

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:17.860
is whoa okay one good run get your

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:22.090
confidence back and then yes Queen slay

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:24.760
and if we do that all is right in the

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.800
world of Isaac again I will accept so

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.680
many upgrades from this boss I'll accept

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.370
HP I'll accept DPS I would love to get a

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.350
huge speed upgrade man sockitumi look at

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.570
that once every four rooms have got bad

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.570
gas who's going to stop me

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.799
like our stats are actually awesome

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.109
right now thank God we got that extra

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.299
spirit are from the tinted rock it's up

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:51.549
to me to reverse the salt I got a sodium

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:54.250
overdose I got arteriosclerosis right

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.019
now it's a great name for an EDM artist

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:01.620
who's a little bit portly maybe I should

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:04.420
sign up let's go you are going to take

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.709
all of your damage and get destroyed

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.470
that doesn't even make any sense we

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:11.769
certainly don't want range come in here

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.299
you know what angel rooms it's going to

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.419
be an angel rooms run and there ain't

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:19.870
anything wrong with that

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:23.949
it takes stem cells for a not essential

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:26.949
but still fairly nice HP upgrade you

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:28.419
know maybe I need the respect HP more I

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:31.419
certainly am NOT going to dig range in

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:34.570
that situation so Allah I'll take the HP

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:36.039
when I can grab it you can just fart

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.410
right off mister that'd be excellent so

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:40.389
the easy way to the path forward a

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.860
success for us is we get to like 1.9

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:47.949
speed and then as soon as we walk into

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:52.560
every room we crap on enemies with

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:58.990
Taurus the other way is to get a sweet

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:03.669
pill out of our shop no you got a nozzle

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:06.760
steel peel from a chef oh the Swedish

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:12.599
Chef are you gonna use it to make a

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:18.190
losing streak stop oh the Swedish Chef

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:20.110
baby's got sackboy in the shop trinkets

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.210
melter I'm in need of your strongest

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.030
trinkets we also I know as a bomber boy

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.909
but like I'll take bomber boy as long as

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.620
the day is freakin long here dude so

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:32.080
what's this again is gold so we got

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:37.710
trinkets melter effectively The Fool the

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.710
son The Fool on Zeus use on Zeus

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.849
do we well I guess for now we're fine

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:47.179
with trinkets melter oh whoa whoa

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:51.110
the sweetest shop I told you not the

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:52.789
Swedish I can fly you know what not the

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.209
sweetest shop but that would be cool as

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:59.360
well do we know this bad gas we do know

00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:59.779
it I'm you but stronger let's get out of

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.199
here

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:06.139
let's go this was a good situation now

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:09.919
placebo basically does Jackie S for us

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:11.809
right now but that's alright we're a

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:17.119
beautiful-looking little demon sperm

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:19.669
here let's head downwards stats speeds

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:21.559
bad but it gets better every room got a

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.879
lot of bombs they do hurt us but they

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:26.479
also we're going to you know crap on

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:29.599
enemies HP is looking fine sac boy this

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:31.159
is and I know that I'm setting myself up

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:33.259
for disappointment let's go for angel

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:35.029
rooms anyway because bomber boy is going

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:37.459
to crap on angel statues if you place a

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:39.499
bomb and then blow the angel statue up

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:43.039
they will take like 40% of their HP

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:45.860
along with it this is a very close to

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:48.079
unloose herbal run already would love

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:53.169
some extra killem power no question

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:56.180
about it I'm going to be using bombs

00:06:53.169 --> 00:07:00.680
rigorously here because they're

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:03.769
excellent maybe you've heard of them Tom

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.289
Zaki that's actually fine but we're

00:07:03.769 --> 00:07:08.599
going to stick with smelter but

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:10.789
effectively smelter you know in the most

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:13.009
recent patch they made it so if you bomb

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:16.999
the mirror in the chest you don't

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:19.399
actually get an extra item which sucks

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:22.129
but is also like completely

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:26.749
understandable that they added in like a

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:28.309
thing for you know just a superficial

00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:34.039
change and then it was like oh by the

00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:35.089
way the chest is easier now I understand

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:36.829
where they're coming from we need that

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:38.240
speed upgrade I understand where they're

00:07:36.829 --> 00:07:40.039
coming from on that but it is always

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.749
like it always feels like a slap in the

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:44.629
face when they take an item away from

00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:47.659
you you go dang it you start doing the

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:50.840
audit well why don't you make this hard

00:07:47.659 --> 00:07:52.280
thing easier then but I think the

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:56.139
that's that's a change that I can

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:58.610
understand hey don't even try it buddy

00:07:56.139 --> 00:08:01.970
why are we not speeding we didn't get

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:08.360
Taurus on this room already what's going

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:12.229
on with that perfect enemy to face yeah

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:13.970
this this run and I know I said it's not

00:08:12.229 --> 00:08:16.580
a couple of runs very recently and

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:18.860
previously but we should not be able to

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:21.400
muck this one up it should be unlockable

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:26.240
branded on mockable on smokable

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:28.700
Uncrustables unmistakable lady that's

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.979
making you a living legend to send me an

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.630
angel and I thank you hey mama I want to

00:08:30.979 --> 00:08:34.400
scream so loud for you because I'm so

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:38.479
proud of you and let me tell you what

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:40.990
I'm about to do I know act the fool but

00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:44.540
I promise you I will go to Sheol and

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:49.940
sort of sort of work justice was just

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:53.660
lovers not even close to justice keep

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:58.130
dropping these bombs and dance till you

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:59.839
feel better we're hoping deal with the

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:01.760
angel comes to fruition here the earlier

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:03.680
we can manifest that the better you get

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.930
the extra like 10% chance or whatever it

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.270
ends up amounting to and I'm not even

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:09.740
worried about you know the quality of

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:14.990
item that we get from a deal with the

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:19.820
angel right now I just want free sweet

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:23.060
stuff also wouldn't mind getting a small

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:25.070
rock although the speed downgrade is not

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:28.700
necessarily incredible didn't know

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:32.000
Sagittarius I guess is just a 10% speed

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:34.580
upgrade or maybe it's a 1.1 multiplier

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.080
to speed which actually would probably

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.080
be more useful at this point

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:43.240
rarely are we getting to use tourists

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.560
but I have faith it'll come through in

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.600
the clutch I don't think we want

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.140
anything there I mean mama mega it is

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.730
what it is

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:54.070
magic mush I'd accept mini mush as well

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:55.810
until the end might have been better off

00:09:54.070 --> 00:10:00.399
actually like taking friends to the end

00:09:55.810 --> 00:10:02.800
and then using gulp or sorry using that

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:03.040
placebo oh okay magic mush yeah let's do

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.810
it

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:13.300
our speed now 1.29 we're closing in on

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:16.060
like endless tourists before that

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:20.079
happens I would not mind getting an

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:22.360
orbital to help us along here see this

00:10:20.079 --> 00:10:23.980
is why I love bomber boy because you see

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:28.990
in like the potency that is bringing to

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:30.370
the table right now it found the secret

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:32.680
room even though we placed it at the

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:34.420
bottom of existence there we're getting

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.940
enough bombs back from sackboy to pretty

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:38.980
much justify that is our if not primary

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:43.029
like a very viable secondary means of

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:45.490
damage now we just need a burnt penny

00:10:43.029 --> 00:10:46.149
along with it and basically nothing can

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:48.070
stop us

00:10:46.149 --> 00:10:50.260
magic much by the way nice little damage

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:52.570
upgrade combined with the fact that our

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:57.220
speed is now higher I walk to that enemy

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:59.620
at 1.98 speed and then I have the nerve

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:01.990
to say Isaac's gotten harder see that's

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:03.699
that's the kind of damage that you know

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:06.750
you take that you lose a run that damage

00:11:03.699 --> 00:11:06.750
haunts you forever man

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:13.749
this is great mini mush is fine here we

00:11:11.889 --> 00:11:17.169
ready to speed already but I think it's

00:11:13.749 --> 00:11:19.509
you know because of the whole speed

00:11:17.169 --> 00:11:22.959
upgrade mid room sort of thing are you a

00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:26.229
wizard not super good ie terrible I'm

00:11:22.959 --> 00:11:29.850
not giving you any bombs bomb beggar you

00:11:26.229 --> 00:11:29.850
haven't earned them I've earned them

00:11:31.139 --> 00:11:36.239
speed down that hurts that hurts

00:11:37.439 --> 00:11:44.379
speed up what makes you larger that's

00:11:41.019 --> 00:11:45.669
still not that good in fact it's a net

00:11:44.379 --> 00:11:47.229
negative probably we're like the

00:11:45.669 --> 00:11:48.579
slightly smaller than normal size though

00:11:47.229 --> 00:11:50.829
so I'm not complaining we got a gulp

00:11:48.579 --> 00:11:56.649
pill I know I'm giving them a valuable

00:11:50.829 --> 00:11:58.839
HP right now I got high hopes though the

00:11:56.649 --> 00:12:01.269
devil okay well oh it's going to blow

00:11:58.839 --> 00:12:04.389
them all up bomber boy these are getting

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:10.359
our HP back lots of speed down so that's

00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:16.779
pretty sweet gulp gulp that's the sound

00:12:10.359 --> 00:12:19.929
of the ponies these are strictly you

00:12:16.779 --> 00:12:22.179
know a defensive maneuver there too by

00:12:19.929 --> 00:12:23.410
the spirit heart in the red heart if

00:12:22.179 --> 00:12:24.669
you'd have the track record I had

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:27.100
recently I don't think you could blame

00:12:24.669 --> 00:12:28.869
me for my decision-making process here

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.069
so we got one point three for luck let's

00:12:28.869 --> 00:12:35.199
see if we can get something out of this

00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:37.959
I wouldn't mind picking up a little yeah

00:12:35.199 --> 00:12:40.589
like cracked crown it's pretty amazing

00:12:37.959 --> 00:12:43.239
and then if we could I mean I would

00:12:40.589 --> 00:12:44.619
guess we'll gulp it up I use the gold

00:12:43.239 --> 00:12:47.289
pill but we got another one back there

00:12:44.619 --> 00:12:53.739
ok good job good job still alive

00:12:47.289 --> 00:12:55.659
I want crystal ball doh we don't want

00:12:53.739 --> 00:13:00.489
that it's it's too frequent of a

00:12:55.659 --> 00:13:02.439
teleporter can be good but more trinkets

00:13:00.489 --> 00:13:04.119
dude more trinkets look or crystal ball

00:13:02.439 --> 00:13:07.600
two-spirit odds are secondary at this

00:13:04.119 --> 00:13:10.049
point emperor k blind rage is worth

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.049
holding

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:22.320
as is Isaac's fork so forget the emperor

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:26.880
card for now go grab gulp we're going to

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:29.490
gulp this and then we're going to hold

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:33.180
gulp is a real battery charge down here

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:35.010
and we're going to go get blind rage or

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.510
whatever one was left it's Isaac's fork

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:38.040
and we're going to gulp that and then

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:39.420
we're going to go fight the boss who is

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:43.110
probably going to eat one bomb and then

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:48.240
die Wow actually way tankier than

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:51.420
expected save a bomb because we might

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:57.390
have a an angel stats you've got like a

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:59.279
40% chance devil room belly button you

00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:02.610
can go to trinkets at once better than

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:03.959
shot speed we shouldn't we really

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:06.630
shouldn't you know what this is great

00:14:03.959 --> 00:14:10.620
because it doesn't compromise our angel

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:11.760
chance of course it's you know pretty

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.110
bad because it didn't give us an item we

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.320
wanted but it's great because it doesn't

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:23.910
compromise our angel chance

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:25.410
we need more bombs oh you got it okay

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.130
that's not what I meant to do because I

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:28.260
can fly

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:30.600
here's what I think you do put out all

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:32.520
the fires and then blow all these guys

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:40.310
up with one bomb surely you're getting

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:40.310
more bombs back what have I done

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:53.529
I think that was sweet but the jury's

00:14:49.779 --> 00:14:57.339
out um yeah so keep exploring is we do

00:14:53.529 --> 00:14:59.050
want to get our item room of course we

00:14:57.339 --> 00:15:03.760
have golden bombs now so like I mean

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:07.029
every opportunity to use a bomb is going

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.830
to be taken at this point this is makes

00:15:07.029 --> 00:15:14.440
you larger that's not a relevant pill

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:19.660
for our endeavors with 1.63 speed got

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:21.820
like an absolutely decent chance of

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:23.589
making it to boss rush and we kind of

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:25.480
got the tools to make boss rush work for

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:28.029
us as well we don't need that you don't

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.710
have trinkets yet because we're going to

00:15:28.029 --> 00:15:31.990
be like a minute and a bit behind

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:36.279
schedule it is actually completely

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:41.020
irrelevant okay so we just go straight

00:15:36.279 --> 00:15:42.850
up to to speed that gives us instant

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:45.310
Taurus which is incredibly potent you

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:48.100
could not construct too many runs that

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:50.650
are like stronger than this basically so

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:52.600
if we lose this one we actually have

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:56.140
some sort of problems with our like

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:57.520
neurological makeup it's not like

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.020
there's anything wrong with that but it

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.959
would come as a little bit of a shock to

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:03.550
me I mean I know I got some weird brain

00:16:01.959 --> 00:16:06.160
structures that are able to remember you

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:08.709
know every lyric - so fresh and so clean

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:10.810
by Outkast 14 years after I last heard

00:16:08.709 --> 00:16:13.300
it but at the same time kind of thought

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:15.459
I was relatively competent from the Isak

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:18.100
standpoint of things so we're not going

00:16:15.459 --> 00:16:19.779
to gulp that because I mean yeah we

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:24.520
could have because we have instant

00:16:19.779 --> 00:16:26.380
tourists every room but why invite that

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:29.370
evil into our lives is basically what

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.370
I'm getting to right now

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:34.590
so

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:40.650
the big upgrades for us right now are

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:42.210
really anything that cranks up our

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:45.690
damage output well we're in this

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:46.230
invincible state so sac dagger Midas

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:48.990
touch

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:53.130
dirty touch any combination of those any

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:54.420
orbital really will do it how can you

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:58.200
look at this run at this point and be

00:16:54.420 --> 00:17:00.900
like don't give me crooked penny you

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:02.790
know we have a gulp pill for whatever

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:06.210
train gets killed you know choose to

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:08.340
show up but then we've got a crooked

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:09.690
penny for a little bit of the same

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.490
factor which honestly we could

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:14.390
desperately use considering the strength

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:14.390
of this run right now

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:24.670
even our damage itself is pretty solid

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:31.120
so still hoping for angel rooms the

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:32.740
dream could exist for us it does not we

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.510
can't afford to get a speed down so

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:38.130
there you go for this and this actually

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:38.130
gave us the fungi transformation as well

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:42.190
yeah we should go to our shop I mean we

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:43.360
could try to double everything in the

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:52.390
shop it's one of the big reasons to have

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:54.040
this item so should go for it I don't

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:59.470
know if that's worth smelting but it is

00:17:54.040 --> 00:18:07.180
at least worth holding and then we can

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:09.640
smelt later if we want probably a secret

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:11.020
room but not super relevant okay to be

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:13.180
honest with you this is the run that I

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:16.330
wanted to have last time you know it's

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:18.580
taken my confidence and it's through the

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:21.730
roof because I basically like cannot

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:23.500
mess it up at this point and I basically

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:27.660
feel like we should hold an emperor card

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:31.630
as well and and use that as a gloss rash

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:34.780
enabler either to get to or to get out

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:36.850
of box rush I don't know it allows none

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:38.620
of these are that amazing now if we can

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:40.780
get deal outs from the coma tour iam I

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:42.640
might consider it you know landmark

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:47.230
album of the post hardcore scene I

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:49.180
suppose but Steam sale it's in time to

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:50.470
potentially be useful we could we should

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:53.760
have tried to double it actually you

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:57.630
can't double old pedestals anymore so

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.630
yeah so I'm going to keep Emperor

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:06.370
is speed upgrade in HP no we don't I

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:07.720
mean what do we read to speed and we

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:11.320
have more than enough HP we just picked

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:14.740
up blue cap on this very floor so of

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:21.760
course it's the NL curse he's a lucky

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:23.710
man but he also complains about the game

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.179
being too hard and then he gets a run in

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:27.039
which is basically impossible to take

00:19:25.179 --> 00:19:29.799
damage and then finds a way to take

00:19:27.039 --> 00:19:32.230
damage but hopefully in a way that's

00:19:29.799 --> 00:19:33.520
still sort of a score you know what do

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:38.650
you got for me in here at the space bar

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:40.240
that's placebo of course all right we

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:43.120
got two minutes to make it to the boss

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.409
rush it's better for us to go in there

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.510
and try to grab that item to get

00:19:44.409 --> 00:19:48.700
something from the item room if possible

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:50.620
because of the fact that we have our

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:52.360
choice of two to four items actually two

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:56.350
to eight items now if anything boss rush

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:57.960
has gotten stronger I think a little

00:19:56.350 --> 00:20:03.250
dangerous

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:06.580
Joker ace of spades extremely irrelevant

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:08.590
at this point now you might wonder why I

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:11.350
chose to go in a different direction and

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:16.870
the answer is because I don't understand

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:19.600
the Monty Hall problem but we were told

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:21.130
that there is more space over in this

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.870
direction by virtue of the fact that

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:24.039
there was a secret room there and I

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:25.570
chose to take him up on that offer

00:20:24.039 --> 00:20:29.669
instead of being on the one that I was

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:29.669
on which could have led to a dead end I

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:33.210
don't actually

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:37.730
care about this guy again doubling that

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.590
is actually a super who cares a moment

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:41.779
when he got on Sue's let's go this was

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:48.289
the wrong direction no it was the right

00:20:41.779 --> 00:20:50.509
direction and he is a god I was walking

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:52.039
in Vancouver today and there was a piece

00:20:50.509 --> 00:20:55.309
of graffiti this is not a joke even

00:20:52.039 --> 00:20:57.460
though it sounds like a send-up but said

00:20:55.309 --> 00:21:00.110
God doesn't wear glasses and I was like

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:02.450
spoken like somebody who has watched me

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:04.850
play player unknowns battlegrounds I

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:06.740
also don't know what graffiti that means

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:08.480
God doesn't wear glasses is supposed to

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:11.330
mean honestly if someone who wears

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:13.279
glasses I was a tribe not to be offended

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:15.230
by it but it's hard you know because

00:21:13.279 --> 00:21:20.360
it's like they're firing a shot directly

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:21.500
at your bow what do you mean I'm not God

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:27.049
I'm just out here trying to get a

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:29.480
sandwich didn't expect to be insulted by

00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:32.419
a wall of all things we'll take a

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:36.679
Polaroid yeah these are high-quality all

00:21:32.419 --> 00:21:41.960
right I mean we doubled them tell you

00:21:36.679 --> 00:21:51.529
why use my new game plan we're going to

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:54.350
go until the doubling fails why ever do

00:21:51.529 --> 00:21:56.269
this is I am a moron man I'm getting out

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:58.039
of here don't be a stupid idiot okay

00:21:56.269 --> 00:21:59.649
that's how you lose runs right there

00:21:58.039 --> 00:22:02.720
should I have taken Isaac's heart

00:21:59.649 --> 00:22:03.799
shooters do judo expert no that's my

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:07.490
impression of myself

00:22:03.799 --> 00:22:12.169
no Isaac's heart it introduces too much

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:13.730
uncertainty into a must-win run this

00:22:12.169 --> 00:22:15.649
isn't a must-win for any reason other

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:17.720
than my confidence but still that's

00:22:15.649 --> 00:22:22.129
enough dude that's enough you don't

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:27.350
understand I get roasted for my Isaac

00:22:22.129 --> 00:22:30.440
play when I play well when I play badly

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:34.269
it's like I begin to question my own my

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:34.269
self-worth in a way that's unhealthy

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:53.540
we got to get the W here I guess I'll

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:57.049
take Judas's time he's invisible not not

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:59.929
interested sorry let's go double the

00:22:57.049 --> 00:23:01.490
chest that had bombs in it instead of

00:22:59.929 --> 00:23:03.049
the one from a room earlier that had

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:12.820
items in it that's okay

00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:14.840
honestly this might be a decent bloom

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:19.340
situation but let's see how things work

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:21.530
here we got a 50% chance of a devil deal

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:23.270
and a 50% chance of an angel deal

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:25.880
assuming we don't take red hard damage

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:35.440
which is I mean we shouldn't take red

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:35.440
hard damage kind of getting low on bombs

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:41.240
this is like the most

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:44.330
Oh P familiar to have for a boss in a

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:45.890
boss fight it was just a bullet sponge

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:48.940
we didn't have piercing shots I'd be

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:48.940
losing my mind right now

00:23:53.050 --> 00:24:10.010
remember when scolex is like the joke

00:23:55.340 --> 00:24:11.870
boss so why not definitely we oh we

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:21.920
would like to take Abaddon and then take

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:23.390
Abaddon again let's go he's a god we

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.920
don't care about the razor blade why do

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:26.360
that well because Abaddon is going to

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.440
take away all our spirit arts anyway so

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:35.690
he might as well try to double down on

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:37.310
the damage upgrade right so we did

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:39.650
finally take deals of the devil if

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:41.480
there's I mean I'm actually not going to

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:43.100
look a gift horse in the mouth they

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:45.740
improve deals of the angel in the most

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:48.710
recent booster pack very very positive

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:50.840
change people are excited about it if

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:52.610
there's one problem with angel rooms

00:24:50.840 --> 00:25:00.170
it's still that it's tough to make them

00:24:52.610 --> 00:25:02.240
exist you know they even if you if you

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:03.860
play all your cards right the closest

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:07.220
you can get to a guarantee on an angel

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:11.720
room is like well without getting like

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:14.690
duality Goathead which happens but not

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:20.450
that often and well who cares about that

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:22.610
key oh let's go is like 50% so we did

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:24.470
roughly as best as we could have done

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:26.360
there lads okay I'm gonna stop saying

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:28.940
let's go I know it annoys people for

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:30.320
every person that annoys there's one

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.970
point quid

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.470
there's probably zero point one people

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:35.330
that really like it so you can

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:36.980
understand that I was never very good at

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:39.070
math but it becomes a difficult

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:41.800
situation for me to suss out you know

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:46.130
what should I do

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:51.910
sure for God we we basically have a

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:51.910
really really small duration holy mantle

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:59.510
so we can actually go to curse rooms for

00:25:55.850 --> 00:26:04.250
free please come here what I'm liking

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:07.670
invisible to you that's sad

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:11.200
joke or card let's get down to business

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:17.960
to defeat the Huns will you come for me

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:19.940
grab all this joker out double-up told

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:22.870
you we didn't need any of those so I'm

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:25.100
not you know not sweating it too much

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:26.810
would it like to have had both of them

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:29.500
but you know if ifs and buts were candy

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:37.370
and nuts we'd all have a Merry holiday

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:39.890
that's what they say you're all doubt

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:42.920
he's not dead he had actually like

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:49.090
negative 15 HP left and he was invisible

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:49.090
he was a ghost of the space variety I

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:55.850
think don't hate me because I'm correct

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:58.730
in this situation I don't know I haven't

00:26:55.850 --> 00:27:03.350
fired tears in 10 minutes but let's see

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:06.020
how we do against mom mom's heart if we

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:08.900
do well maybe it is the right call to go

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:14.210
to hospitai I gotta think about it

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:16.850
because I really don't want to put this

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:19.210
one into question but we are extremely

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:19.210
strong

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:30.890
not of not a smart play not a smart play

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:31.659
we got 80 cents - we got good damage

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:39.140
output

00:27:31.659 --> 00:27:40.850
we got 31 Keys let's go for broke you've

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:43.100
already seen that let's go for broke

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:46.460
this is the right run on which to do

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:47.720
this we're so strong our invincibility

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:51.919
is meaningless but it really good to

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:53.630
fight again you know oh please

00:27:51.919 --> 00:27:55.429
humbling bundles we can try to double

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:58.909
champion belt but I want to damage and

00:27:55.429 --> 00:28:03.649
then here or is good but there's no

00:27:58.909 --> 00:28:06.049
purpose to doubling it there is a

00:28:03.649 --> 00:28:08.840
purpose to doubling both of these so you

00:28:06.049 --> 00:28:10.429
go for it maybe this takes us closer to

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.830
Beelzebub oh it took the other how to

00:28:10.429 --> 00:28:14.179
jump away that was stupid but I wanted

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:17.570
to take - how to jump for the chance to

00:28:14.179 --> 00:28:19.190
get closer to bookworm because there's a

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:25.580
battery charge for sale let's look at

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:30.100
this for a sec okay that's fine where's

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:30.100
the grape bangies link let's go

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:41.510
those shouts are still landing so I

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:44.270
would say that we did improve pretty

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:46.490
nicely here the aura honestly we really

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:48.890
only care about tears and damage like

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:54.170
we're on a range or or something we do

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:55.520
not care and I've almost mine flooded

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:58.430
myself into believing that this run is

00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:00.530
not that good so that's a false

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:02.150
situation to be in and if we're thinking

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:03.410
that we're already dead we got to start

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:05.240
playing better if we're thinking that a

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:08.060
run like this is not high quality we got

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:11.150
19 damage and a 4 rate of fire maybe

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:12.590
we're not one hitting hush but this is

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:16.010
our run to get our confidence back and

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:18.710
honestly so far we're 10 minutes in and

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:20.690
we haven't climax yet so the world's our

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:26.230
oyster you know we can only build on

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:31.220
that from here let's stand back good

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:33.920
work team lusty blood would be an

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:37.070
awesome get right now not compulsory by

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:39.140
any stretch of the imagination lusty

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:41.390
blood would be nice though trying to use

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:45.230
halo of flies to do a little extra

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:46.730
damage in here this is where you say

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:49.670
thank you to the game for giving you an

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:51.920
unbelievably good seed because it's not

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:56.000
just the start the star was good we

00:29:51.920 --> 00:30:03.140
could fly but the the seed really like

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:04.650
crushed it on this one somehow he's done

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:10.230
it

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:12.840
I think I should save some bombs you

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:15.150
will not get in here you will be slain

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:17.900
your ashes will scatter to the earth you

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:17.900
will be no more

00:30:23.499 --> 00:30:33.700
is slow going but it is going every once

00:30:29.989 --> 00:30:33.700
in a while is ticking down there

00:30:34.089 --> 00:30:42.379
we're like 20% of his HP left and we

00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:43.940
haven't been hit yet we've come close

00:30:42.379 --> 00:30:46.580
but mostly that's out of you know

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:49.399
bravado and idiocy more than anything

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:55.580
else oh that one look like a direct hit

00:30:49.399 --> 00:30:58.599
basically that's alright take as long as

00:30:55.580 --> 00:31:01.789
you want when you find in super hush

00:30:58.599 --> 00:31:04.489
just remember there ain't a rush and

00:31:01.789 --> 00:31:06.469
take the smart way home wraparound form

00:31:04.489 --> 00:31:07.879
that's a good harmonica right you

00:31:06.469 --> 00:31:11.739
remember in the Blues Traveler songs

00:31:07.879 --> 00:31:11.739
where they're always going flat my wife

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:26.640
he's dusted all right we'd like at this

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:28.290
point nothing okay no no no if they

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.760
force us to do it maybe we'll consider

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:31.950
it this is we're killing all our demons

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:33.420
on this run but I don't know if that's

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:37.950
the right thing to do right now so let's

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:47.790
get out of here why do all these enemies

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:50.070
have four hundred and one HP it seems we

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:56.340
have five bombs moon cards nothing wrong

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:58.950
with it easy money keep going for these

00:31:56.340 --> 00:32:00.600
we don't want a self-sacrifice room we

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:04.700
do want to teleport card even more than

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:04.700
we want like a moon card specifically

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:10.350
want teleport cards like this room I

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:12.840
don't care get me out of here I'm a

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:15.360
celebrity it's a British reality show

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:17.160
where I think they send celebrities into

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:19.860
the wilderness so basically like me

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:21.390
going on a grocery trip I don't want to

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:23.750
be in that room you can't make me beyond

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:23.750
that room

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:30.820
you see how strong we were like we

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:33.700
pushed this guy out of the way as if he

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:39.009
was made merely out of code and pixels

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:40.600
that's how strong we are I'm just

00:32:39.009 --> 00:32:43.029
begging for what like I know it's

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:46.889
different so good not mad if we don't

00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:49.960
get this I'm just looking for one

00:32:46.889 --> 00:32:52.330
offensive orbital don't get me wrong I

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:57.419
like the flies you've been very generous

00:32:52.330 --> 00:33:02.009
to me so far just hook me up with one

00:32:57.419 --> 00:33:06.639
little offensive orbitals all I need

00:33:02.009 --> 00:33:09.610
just a just a single offensive orbital

00:33:06.639 --> 00:33:11.830
put me in heaven right now it's all it

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:13.200
takes to make a boy's day that much

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:16.000
better

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:17.980
nah stinky diapers not what I asked for

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.450
perhaps you misheard me I'll give you

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:23.230
one more chance to provide me with an

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:24.850
offensive orbital before I show you my

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:29.590
katana skills that I've been training

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:35.320
for for weeks dude though you're a rune

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:38.500
you don't have to withhold a yellow room

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:41.409
down into it hold it yeah yeah let's go

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:45.879
I'll stack them up stack them in let me

00:33:41.409 --> 00:33:49.389
begin we're ready to go we got five

00:33:45.879 --> 00:33:55.779
bombs our damage is so good we should

00:33:49.389 --> 00:33:57.100
not worry about using all of our bombs

00:33:55.779 --> 00:33:58.570
because we don't need those bombs to

00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:00.759
make it through the hush fight I'm kind

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:03.879
of surprised 19 damage doesn't seem to

00:34:00.759 --> 00:34:07.120
go as far as they used to man like Isaac

00:34:03.879 --> 00:34:08.399
is living a little longer than I

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:13.679
expected

00:34:08.399 --> 00:34:19.000
how should be handled I swallowed penny

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:22.119
you got to go for broke that was

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.560
terrible I absolutely 100% have to go

00:34:22.119 --> 00:34:25.060
for broke for you're a little

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:27.550
so what you do is you pop the year at

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:29.590
first ah no no you pop swallowed penny

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:34.060
first because it's questionable and then

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:38.290
you yera he's done it we could have gone

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:40.810
deeper but like why why mess with

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:42.790
perfection right dude this is great we

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:45.100
have an offensive Korbel I don't think

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:46.869
we care about taking technology unless

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:50.379
it messes up Jacob's Ladder which it

00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:52.810
actually completely might have this is

00:34:50.379 --> 00:34:54.490
eight passive items though so as far as

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:56.590
I'm concerned like that's amazing

00:34:54.490 --> 00:34:59.380
we have 20/20 along with it we don't

00:34:56.590 --> 00:35:01.960
really want the body we do want crickets

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:03.790
head it didn't give us as much as I

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:05.859
thought sure let's ludo it how does this

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:08.020
look so it's kind of what I figured so

00:35:05.859 --> 00:35:17.320
we should we probably have no Jacob's

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:18.520
Ladder now that's weird but our ball of

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.830
death is doing so much damage

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:26.560
unfortunately it also does not move when

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:29.380
we enter a room but if an enemy like

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:31.260
ever touches it they're dusted in record

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:34.000
time

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:35.980
golden bombs that seems like a wonderful

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.580
addition to our collection

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:43.060
chariot card it's kind of ironic I

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:47.950
suppose if there's a win it's a good win

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:50.520
it was a fun way to be a part of let's

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:50.520
bring this one home

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:59.999
see that

00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:01.200
did that just give us spun I had to go

00:35:59.999 --> 00:36:05.400
back and look at the footage for that

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:07.140
because I am actually confused we got

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:14.670
some kind of transformation for taking

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:17.009
that pill that doesn't seem correct it's

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:19.289
like one of the best invincibility is

00:36:17.009 --> 00:36:20.640
you can have of course you know deep

00:36:19.289 --> 00:36:26.160
down inside I'm hoping for a little

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:29.579
dirty touch but can't always get what

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:31.529
you want right you always wanted she

00:36:29.579 --> 00:36:34.759
ain't got don't it always seem to go you

00:36:31.529 --> 00:36:34.759
don't know what you've got clothes on

00:36:37.099 --> 00:36:44.970
not a particularly fast run either which

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:47.180
is kind of surprising but we've got like

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:49.470
five different ways to kill every enemy

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:51.029
even still like we've managed to

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:53.160
hemorrhage HP which is kind of a

00:36:51.029 --> 00:36:56.130
surprise to me what are you shooting it

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:58.200
I have camo on these on dude you

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:59.609
shouldn't be able to see me or at least

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:02.160
the most important part so I guess maybe

00:36:59.609 --> 00:37:03.269
if you got camo undies but no shirt it's

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:08.999
kind of easy to tell where you're

00:37:03.269 --> 00:37:10.920
standing at this point like my Taurus

00:37:08.999 --> 00:37:13.799
invincibility means nothing to me

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:15.660
I am being chased these guys are not

00:37:13.799 --> 00:37:22.979
randomly selecting a target I am being

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:28.710
chased I don't appreciate it we want

00:37:22.979 --> 00:37:30.630
that oh we're so in this was a fun run I

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:33.839
feel like I actually know what I'm doing

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:35.400
and Isaac again despite the fact that we

00:37:33.839 --> 00:37:39.749
had basically nothing to do with this

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:43.640
run let's finish this bad boy off I

00:37:39.749 --> 00:37:43.640
don't want your charity okay

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:52.410
and they're not even going to make me do

00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:53.910
void we're back in the saddle thanks for
