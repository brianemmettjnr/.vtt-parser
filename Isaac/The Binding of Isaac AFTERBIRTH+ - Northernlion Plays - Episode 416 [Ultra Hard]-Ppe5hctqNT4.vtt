00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.899
hey everybody welcome back to on the

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.379
line please the binding of issac I am a

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:11.780
little bit sick however I'm gonna

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:15.120
persevere I'm not that under the weather

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.430
just my voice sounds bad and I feel

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.779
terrible but apart from those two things

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.890
to all God and it's ultra hard Oh apart

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.390
from those two things right there it's

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.619
not that bad though so what is ultra

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.599
hard let's go give ourselves a little

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.529
reasoning here ultra hard

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.059
it's like consumables never drop you got

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.190
a fight magazine you got a beat mega

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.590
saving through the dark room all enemies

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.530
are champion forms champions will not

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.660
drop any collectibles you get all of the

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.690
curses every floor and they can't be

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.600
purged there are no hearts to be found

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.949
on the run except for items that

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:56.940
normally give you hearts anyway oh good

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:58.649
well remember this people say oh you'll

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.149
it's not that hard of a job playing

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.100
video games in the Internet yeah but

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.170
what if the video games are like mildly

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.869
more difficult in the standard form is

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.530
it still so easy then Susan I don't

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.390
think so

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.549
we're gonna try it regardless though in

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.760
the hopes that like perhaps my altered

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.020
state is like maybe perhaps even

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.030
appropriate I think I'm gonna be holding

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.250
our here as I want to get to the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.750
starting room I want the starting room

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.740
to have an item room adjacent to it is

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.340
what I mean

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.470
because here's the way I see this going

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.420
first off I've already done the ultra

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.799
hard challenge it's mad annoying if

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.150
you're gonna go well you just gave up

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.970
your ability to say that you beated

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.630
first try there then by all means but

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:43.649
I'll accept an acquiesce however I think

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.229
like the only realistic way I'm coming

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.090
out of this video with a w not this run

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.490
necessarily but this video alright Tom

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.990
well you may leave is if we get a good

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.689
item room right off the bed that good

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.740
item room allows us to get a deal with

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.540
the devil

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.280
that deal with the devil is good enough

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.630
that I can realistically not take very

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.369
much damage and kill champions

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.470
relatively quickly I think that's our

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.080
game plan totally fine with the puberty

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.930
pill um we're gonna use big fan to deal

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.459
damage because we've already kind of

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.750
ruined our deal with the devil chance

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:21.760
here if you can't I don't even think we

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.830
can get well I'll wait until we find the

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.140
tinted rock because I'm not sure if you

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.519
can get tinted rocks to payout with

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.750
spirit hearts but if you can't get them

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.599
to pay out of spirit hearts what the

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.400
what are they good for well small rock

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.640
perhaps even a higher incidence of small

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.769
rock for all I know thinking of like

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.930
some of the combinations we could have

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.530
here obviously something with like life

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.260
gain would be good so we can get even

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.880
like placenta but charm of the vampire

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.380
might be slightly more appropriate um

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.900
that might be good or just like

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:59.440
pyromaniac and a lot of bombs would also

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:02.349
be good oh my god I know they scurry but

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.549
I thought they scurry away they're

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.630
scurrying towards me and I don't

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:12.760
appreciate their magnetics Karina's

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:15.280
please gimpy um it could be useless but

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.120
if not useless then I guess potentially

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.709
pretty good we'll see anyway I think

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.810
this is it's almost like playing the

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.030
lost way way way back in the day we got

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.739
to boss fights coming up here what was

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.569
it like playing as the lost way way back

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:33.489
in the day it was harder but simpler you

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.989
just usually held or until you got a

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.180
good item right off the bat that gave

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:42.609
you like even a modest chance of coming

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.989
away with the victory okay I basically

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.850
let him walk into me there that was not

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.230
a smart decision let's try this again

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.180
we're gonna we're gonna go for some high

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.299
percentage plays here mom's bottle of

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.400
pills not good enough not necessarily

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.410
terrible but not good enough this by the

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.269
way if you're saying NL you're breaking

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.940
the spirit of the challenge I would say

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.440
like absolutely not true I think the

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.480
spirit of this challenge is frustration

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.190
and I will be frustrated by the end of

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.359
this I could be napping right now my

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.979
dudes I slept for 11 hours last night I

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.299
know and I'm not complaining a lot of

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:16.180
people don't have that luxury I'm just

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:18.010
saying like my mind is telling me yes

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.690
but my body is telling me no it's like

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.210
the opposite of the r.kelly song and yet

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.889
here I am doing everything I can 8 Inch

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.169
Nails is worth giving this a shot I

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:29.080
think and I do see a tinted rock we need

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.630
one more bomb that's not it but I'm kind

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.449
of thinking we might have a chance here

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.300
I'm what dude curse of the maze actually

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:40.419
saved us it gave us an item room and a

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.150
boss room right off the bat I would like

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.770
to use that tinted rock but I would also

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:49.150
like to not have to if you know what I

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.710
mean so see what the item room is kinda

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.750
don't love that I guess we're gonna

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.210
exclusively run into champion bosses if

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.690
they're available to box of spiders it's

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.600
not great necessarily but it's also

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:04.150
decidedly not horrible mild synergy had

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.820
worst with 8-inch nails here we got the

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:11.250
damage upgrades and what does the dark

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:14.800
haunt do it's just ah I thought I had a

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.600
perfect spot there okay well clearly I

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.190
not only do not have a perfect spot I

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.990
don't know what I'm doing I thought he

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:26.530
was just spiders but he's spiders and

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:28.889
and shots as the shots that are killing

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.889
me right now

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.770
we still have a 30-ish percent chance of

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:37.210
a deal with the devil that's nothing to

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:38.830
sneeze at you're dead 36 I think mom's

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.900
underwear for a range upgrade is

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.349
effectively actually completely

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.180
worthless I would say range ends up only

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:48.219
rarely being a problem but pin goes down

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.449
we beat the odds we get a surprisingly

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:52.000
good deal with the devil maybe it even

00:05:49.449 --> 00:06:01.169
takes us on the path to guppy them aka

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:03.729
enlightenment we did it now Oh mr. dolly

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:09.310
tears upgrade is solid we don't know

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:12.520
what these deals are go ahead I can't I

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.719
I want to because there's a lot of items

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.120
that it could be that would be really

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:17.259
good but I actually just cannot but now

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.280
we don't have to worry about ruining our

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:20.919
deal with the devil chance I'm actually

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:24.190
like really pleased with where we're at

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:27.310
now I'm wicked sad by the way I went to

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.770
Seattle and picked up Boston language

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.719
apparently I got my paksas mixed up

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.879
which is why I'm sick by the way I'm

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:36.819
pretty confident I told this story on

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:39.729
the N LSS but like that's playing a game

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:41.620
now mind you not the healthiest weekend

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:45.909
to begin with you know the average meal

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:49.930
is like a cheeseburger you're shaking a

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:51.279
lot of hands but I did tell the story on

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.050
the LSS I was playing a game and a

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:55.060
dude's knees so close to my ear it

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.639
actually vibrated my earlobe I'm not

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.319
saying that's how I got sick it's not

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:04.180
like I necessarily took great care of

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:05.740
myself this weekend however if I could

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.289
shirk responsibility slightly that's

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.779
that's what I'm gonna choose to do here

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:13.750
yeah what I was getting at is that we

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:16.150
actually cannot get any spirit hearts

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:21.509
apparently mr. dolly gave us nothing to

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:21.509
begin with and then

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:26.330
obviously we got none out of that tinted

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.610
rock and in fact we actually got nothing

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:31.580
out of that tinted rock which is far

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:34.009
worse than getting no spirit hearts that

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:36.889
mist I don't know what you want here

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:39.560
actually like box of spiders is probably

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:41.360
better bob's rotten head is not

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.729
particularly strong but it is kind of

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.900
nice I guess

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:47.870
for killing enemies that might get too

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:50.889
close to you we have a key we should go

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:53.720
back for it oh you almost blew that one

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:56.780
go back for that key we need it it's a

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:59.780
special key to is that what special K's

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:05.210
been all this time just special keys so

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:06.650
this should be a long run hopefully this

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.360
one ends up being a long run I just mean

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:12.199
like video wise this should end up being

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:15.080
a long video we got to go as far as the

00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:17.780
game will ever go and it really does fit

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.909
that kind of like the irony of Isaac

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.879
challenges that the more difficult

00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:24.409
challenges also go further they're not

00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:28.509
more difficult necessarily because they

00:08:24.409 --> 00:08:30.830
go further but for whatever reason

00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:32.390
Tyrone's got his troll engine working in

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:33.250
full effect yeah I saw that one coming a

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.570
mile away

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.849
we really just can't afford to get hit

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:41.539
like I maybe that's as simple as it

00:08:37.849 --> 00:08:43.339
comes down to here we just need to not

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:48.649
get hit and if we can do that the

00:08:43.339 --> 00:08:50.390
world's our burrito this could be the

00:08:48.649 --> 00:08:53.000
one I don't remember what it took to win

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:54.680
ultra harder to beat ultra hard the the

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.270
first time we did it I do remember it

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:59.180
being a slog though I remember doing

00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:01.490
maybe three videos maybe four videos

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:07.450
even on ultra hard but it has been a

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:07.450
while no I don't want to go to the shop

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:15.770
we're on the road to nowhere there we go

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:19.730
Capricorn all stats up really important

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:22.610
for many reasons that I will dictate now

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:24.740
the merriam-webster English dictionary

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:26.870
defines success as blah blah nom to see

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:30.470
the bit here as I take off my hoodie is

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:32.209
that I'm trying to write an essay from

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.230
the perspective of someone applying for

00:09:32.209 --> 00:09:35.720
college

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:37.280
you stupid idiots why didn't you just do

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.440
what I did and go to college ten years

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:42.650
ago then you could be as successful as

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:44.620
me they're all the kids these days don't

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:47.600
know how good they got it

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:49.460
this is not an ill-advised Bill Cosby

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.960
impressions just in the natural state of

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:53.660
my voice when I'm a little under the

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.480
weather there's nothing nothing more

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:59.240
bhaiyya than that

00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:02.090
Capricorn stats upgrade yes but also it

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.530
gave us HP which is extremely valuable

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:08.300
you know what would actually be really

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:11.210
good for us is young heart and I'll

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:13.190
never hear me say that so I must be sick

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:15.770
if I'm starting to value young heart as

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:19.580
an item but I think it actually is like

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:21.200
a 10 out of 10 here the ability to

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:24.440
actually regenerate some red hearts oh

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.030
my god we got pyromaniac are we actually

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:31.490
gonna beat ultra heart on our first

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:33.370
attempt we need bombs or like what's let

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:41.300
me run you through the the paces here

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:44.530
also where the heck do we go my nose is

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:49.600
like so stuffed up Axl knows more like

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:55.040
Axl knows more like hey give me some HP

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:56.840
hey give me some HP thank you uh as long

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.580
as we can maintain bombs even the speed

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.630
upgrade there is pretty good as long as

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.420
we can maintain bombs we're in an

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:05.570
amazing position we essentially have 12

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:08.030
red hearts right now just stored up

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:10.130
which is unbelievably useful that sucked

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:11.240
pretty bad is unbelievably useful

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:16.190
because normally at this point in the

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:19.160
game you have zero I haven't taken a

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:21.050
math class too recently but I believe

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.030
that twelve is better than zero most of

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.740
the time plus with Goathead even if we

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:25.850
lose HP we don't compromise our deal

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.880
with the devil chance I'm beginning to

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:33.260
think this could be the one and it would

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:35.270
be super early let's not get too cocky

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.620
we still got to be mega Satan the stats

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:40.420
are good they might even be like

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.420
borderline very very good but

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:46.600
we still to play pretty well I think to

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:48.069
come away with the W on this run

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.329
regardless and we still want to

00:11:48.069 --> 00:11:53.620
endeavour to get hit as little as

00:11:49.329 --> 00:11:54.940
possible because of course we do you

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.980
know it's still they take no pleasure

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:59.019
and getting hit by a spider or something

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.720
like that I'm assuming Bible tract will

00:11:59.019 --> 00:12:05.259
do absolutely nothing for us say it

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:10.779
again say it louder for the people in

00:12:05.259 --> 00:12:13.089
the back something people say on Twitter

00:12:10.779 --> 00:12:17.110
these days I'm aware I spent some time

00:12:13.089 --> 00:12:18.490
in the Twitterverse uh I don't think

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:21.310
it's worth two bombs for a golden chest

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:23.620
let's just beat these bosses uh you're

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:25.360
not pin by the way I know you said pin

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:27.879
you don't appear to be pin you appear to

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:30.610
be mega fatty and then pin is like the

00:12:27.879 --> 00:12:35.850
appetizer at best mega fatty is the

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:37.959
annoying one I guess we should go for a

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:40.980
matchstick even though I think the speed

00:12:37.959 --> 00:12:40.980
upgrade is pretty solid

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:47.019
matchstick giving us more bombs would be

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:52.600
really useful matchstick imprisoning me

00:12:47.019 --> 00:12:55.000
all that I see you know it's won by

00:12:52.600 --> 00:13:01.870
Metallica let's one by Metallica

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:06.069
actually hello PIM hello pin the third

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:07.630
what are you doing here do you have to

00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:09.579
be on every boss fight is that all

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:15.189
champion cave bosses have pin attached

00:13:09.579 --> 00:13:21.459
to them for some reason give me back my

00:13:15.189 --> 00:13:22.810
baritone rhinovirus Kiska say sniff

00:13:21.459 --> 00:13:27.480
sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:31.240
sniff sniff sniff where we got

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:33.160
polydactyly not great I'm assuming by

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:39.430
the way that the lovers card does

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:40.930
nothing still can't take it I should may

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:42.700
there's a case to be made you probably

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:43.960
take one of the two hard deals on one of

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.510
the first two floors instead of just

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:49.180
always going for the one hard deal we

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:51.570
would possibly slash probably be dead if

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:56.380
we did that but I can't say for certain

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:58.390
we might not be I have to imagine the

00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:00.070
curse room is probably the wrong choice

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:02.260
I know you're thinking you know nine

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:04.270
lives could be very very good any

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:10.180
progress towards guppy very very good

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:11.650
but the removal of any items or any any

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:15.280
payouts that give us spirit or black

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:16.930
hearts is enough to put me in a another

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.090
mind about how to make a decision there

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:22.270
I don't think that it's necessarily a a

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:26.770
good choice much less a great choice of

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:29.470
the Theon variety and now was that jokes

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:32.470
about Theon Greyjoy's yes it yes it was

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:35.500
look okay I'm not messing with you I

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:37.780
kind of like being sick mildly sick and

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:40.000
I've told this story before but first

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:42.460
off you want to talk about like first

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.990
world not even problems but like first

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:46.420
world blindness oh yeah

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:47.980
being a little ill is really it's kind

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.960
of fun you know but really you get a

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:52.390
good excuse to like lay in bed and like

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.740
you know watch some movies eat some

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:54.450
chicken noodle soup or something like

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.890
that

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:58.420
you can eat chicken noodle soup like it

00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:59.530
normally but everyone's gonna ask you if

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:02.350
you're sick so you might as well take

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:04.780
advantage of it sprinkler sure let's

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:06.580
let's try it I think for the specific

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:08.340
fights like mega Satan for example

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:11.290
that's pretty good do we have to beat

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:13.330
like the hush no cuz the hush is all

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:13.570
based on timing yeah that wouldn't be

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.420
right

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:18.010
I'd be surprised unicorn stomp also

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:20.340
tempting but once every six rooms I

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:23.380
think means we're not gonna do it

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:24.760
so yeah I'm not like some people are

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:27.040
babies when they get sick and that's

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:29.410
fine I'm not gonna call him out but

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:31.840
they're like little sniffles mom can you

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:33.730
bring me a kale salad see I deliberately

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:36.850
made that person a caricature of myself

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:39.069
but dude I love kale salad

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:40.720
I'm not getting jacked anytime soon but

00:15:39.069 --> 00:15:43.660
like I just slided love the taste of

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:46.540
that dark leafy green if you know what I

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:51.149
mean um we might as well check the shop

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:51.149
out you got something

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:55.420
nothing

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:59.350
I didn't mean to buy that the card could

00:15:55.420 --> 00:16:02.170
be good though yeah especially now that

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:09.850
it's temperance um terrible terrible

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:11.110
damage be very careful here and like I'm

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:14.610
not even comfortable being at this level

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:18.160
of HP because there's no reason to be

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:20.319
okay okay Hoss card is so good okay

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:24.399
throw down temperance card blow yourself

00:16:20.319 --> 00:16:25.720
up take care of that lock up pretty good

00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:30.550
even though gimpy will never give us

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:31.810
anything I don't want to go too much

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:36.610
deeper in this I'll tell you what we'll

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:38.319
do one more just wanted enough money to

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:43.600
like conceivably buy something next

00:16:38.319 --> 00:16:46.410
floor not too pleased with that but I am

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:48.610
very very pleased with the chaos card um

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:50.709
anyway the point is I'm not a baby when

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:53.170
I'm sick I I think I'm very lucky

00:16:50.709 --> 00:16:54.160
honestly like I do work in a job where I

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:57.279
have to use my voice and that's

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:59.800
frustrating because you know I don't

00:16:57.279 --> 00:17:01.750
sound like myself but the brain is still

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:04.059
there plus I kind of appreciate that

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.589
it's a fever is like a little bit of an

00:17:04.059 --> 00:17:09.549
altered state you know if it's not gonna

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:12.039
be if it's not gonna kill you

00:17:09.549 --> 00:17:14.949
or cause you undue duress it's kind of a

00:17:12.039 --> 00:17:17.289
weird mental vacation if you will

00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:19.510
plus for some reason well being sick

00:17:17.289 --> 00:17:21.010
I've gotten really like a lot better and

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:22.539
player unknowns battlegrounds which is

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:24.970
something that makes no sense to me

00:17:22.539 --> 00:17:27.100
whatsoever but I'm still in many ways I

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:28.390
find myself quite happy with it so I did

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:31.480
decide to go to the cursed room after

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:33.520
all that and we got a guppy item which

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.750
I'm quite happy with because we have

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.640
non-stop deals with the devil

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:39.340
now I have no idea where I'm going and

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:42.280
I'm starting to realize realize the

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:43.510
wrong word I'm starting to remember what

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.919
happened to us on the ultra hard

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:46.540
challenge in the past which is that you

00:17:44.919 --> 00:17:49.299
get to later floors and you just want to

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.840
die because you have no knowledge of

00:17:49.299 --> 00:17:51.730
where's

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:54.309
to be going and it's like the stupidest

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:56.350
design choice well it might be a little

00:17:54.309 --> 00:17:59.650
too far but it's an extremely annoying

00:17:56.350 --> 00:18:01.539
design choice to derive pleasure from

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:02.980
just having your players walk back and

00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:05.980
forth between the same rooms over and

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:07.840
over but I'm not gonna give them the

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:10.630
satisfaction of being mad about it

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:13.710
because I think that that just plays

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:17.400
into their into their hand basically

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:21.610
yeah yeah I remember being back here and

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:22.779
there and the sad thing is there's

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:25.840
nothing you can do about this if we get

00:18:22.779 --> 00:18:28.840
blank card Emperor we could do something

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.559
about it but okay and then this was a

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:33.279
dead end

00:18:29.559 --> 00:18:37.630
yeah so how you doing guys good yeah me

00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:38.919
too um this is a very smart decision to

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:41.679
add to this game I think it's just

00:18:38.919 --> 00:18:43.450
really just elevated the whole system

00:18:41.679 --> 00:18:46.690
right okay so this is the curse room

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:48.520
this is the steeple definitely been down

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:50.169
here oh we have not been down here

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.909
though if we see red chests I think we

00:18:50.169 --> 00:18:54.730
have to go for it you know we're rolling

00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:57.010
the dice to try to get a guppy situation

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:59.409
even golden chests could give us items

00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:02.169
so you got to check it obviously didn't

00:18:59.409 --> 00:19:05.110
work out but now after waiting so long I

00:19:02.169 --> 00:19:07.480
will use the sprinkler and probably end

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:10.570
up not getting a charge for our boss

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:12.580
fight you know we could really use as

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:14.169
well as piercing shots I'm not

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.640
complaining about our current situation

00:19:14.169 --> 00:19:17.950
but keep in mind that you know we're

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:19.419
we're not in a normal run either so just

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:21.880
because our stats look great for a

00:19:19.419 --> 00:19:24.399
normal run not necessarily indicative of

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:26.590
how it's gonna be long term we are

00:19:24.399 --> 00:19:27.970
necropolis so we got like the mom fight

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:29.649
coming up so we're gonna miss an item

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:31.809
now that think about it from the mom

00:19:29.649 --> 00:19:35.679
fight it's gonna be forcing us to pick

00:19:31.809 --> 00:19:37.330
up the negative but if we live we'll get

00:19:35.679 --> 00:19:39.220
a deal with the devil after that mom is

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:43.390
actually a fairly tough enemy to fight

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:47.830
with pyromaniac she'll kick your bombs

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:49.840
away cause some problems potentially but

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:51.820
I don't think there's any reason to be

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.980
needlessly like pessimistic about this

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:57.460
run right now beyond the obvious like

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:58.899
difficulty of it every bomb could be the

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:02.230
difference between life and death chaos

00:19:58.899 --> 00:20:03.860
karna mega satan is a big play we could

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:08.510
even use the chaos car to

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:10.790
Isak instead but I think probably using

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:15.890
a one phase of manga stating this is a

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:19.610
smarter get juicy sac sticky babies it's

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:21.470
like an item nicknamed feels like not

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:24.260
that it has a nickname I mean literally

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:25.880
Nick nicknamed it but he didn't but it

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:31.520
sounds like an item name that he would

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:34.970
create you know what I mean so every

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:36.710
bomb is very valuable at this point just

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:39.140
realized since we're on necropolis we're

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:40.880
not going to really have anything else

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:42.440
to do with our money unfortunately I

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:45.230
think we still made the right call to

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:50.000
save bombs like having one extra HP from

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:53.660
an endo speed upgrade from the blood

00:20:50.000 --> 00:21:00.140
bank play would be fine we did get an

00:20:53.660 --> 00:21:01.580
emperor card however not super

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:03.770
displeased about now you know we got to

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:05.600
be getting I think it was smart to save

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:07.429
like a few bombs to roll with I mean I

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:10.400
gotta admit I do have a bit of a good

00:21:07.429 --> 00:21:12.559
day quill Isak track record like my

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.970
Isaac track record is okay off dayquil

00:21:12.559 --> 00:21:18.429
but on dayquil like I've had some

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:18.429
lights-out videos this could be the one

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:26.570
so we beat this floor cuz we're close to

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:28.550
the end we use the chaos card I know we

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:32.080
say we use the emperor card to get

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:36.920
through the womb and then the Sheol

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:38.450
can't even have duplicate

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.809
I'm sorry double the floors cuz it's

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:42.950
just Sheol you know just is what it is

00:21:40.809 --> 00:21:44.450
and we definitely do not want to use

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:45.320
chaos card originally I said Isaac but

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:48.290
we definitely don't want to use it

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:50.090
against Satan because there's multiple

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:52.400
phases of the Satan fight so we're not

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:57.080
getting much money for value instead

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:58.820
we'd probably pop it against the first

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.780
phase of the mega satan fights so we

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:02.290
don't have to fight all the garbage

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:02.290
enemies

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:11.630
okay let's do it

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:13.730
Wow okey-dokey we got healed immediately

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:16.310
so these are not the worst enemies to

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:19.460
fight and I really want to use bombs but

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:21.920
I'm not gonna it just doesn't seem like

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:23.480
there's a great reason to I would love

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.910
for these guys to drop all stats

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:29.240
particulars particularly something along

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:31.310
the lines of like you know magic mush

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:33.200
it's unlikely that it'll happen but if

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:35.360
it does great dps is up there

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.730
HP is up there like having three HP

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:41.570
would be quite nice if we can't get any

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:45.350
of that to manifest then I'll take what

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:46.640
I can get but HP with like an added

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:48.650
benefit would be high up there

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:55.160
so all stats is really just HP plus like

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:57.700
every added benefit this fight is gonna

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.700
be fine

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:06.330
even if he jumps on us he usually heals

00:23:01.559 --> 00:23:10.049
us afterwards I think not on the quick

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:12.390
jumps but like that one for example wow

00:23:10.049 --> 00:23:13.850
whatever we'll figure it out I'm just

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:19.620
gonna heal myself up a mega fatty

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:23.760
whatever actually think caffeine pill is

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:29.640
totally fine here I'm going to kind of

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:30.029
waste a bomb to help myself out - pardon

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.750
me

00:23:30.029 --> 00:23:40.980
real sneeze but real sneezes real cases

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:42.600
Judge Judy real sneeze okay read mom my

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:46.529
favorite series of young adult fantasy

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:48.390
novels about a mouse and also probably

00:23:46.529 --> 00:23:53.909
the easiest opportunity to beat this

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:55.860
fight what I would love to see is nine

00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:57.570
lives I mean we actually are gonna have

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:59.520
to make a pretty important decision

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:02.130
about whether or not we take these deals

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.480
with the devil which means in the end it

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:05.130
would probably be best if we actually

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:09.149
fought Krampus and got like a lump of

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:11.640
coal but in my head I'm gonna be like

00:24:09.149 --> 00:24:13.049
what if they're guppy though we already

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:15.419
have Guppies collar which can bring us

00:24:13.049 --> 00:24:17.130
back if we get hit but the less HP we

00:24:15.419 --> 00:24:19.409
have the worst pyromaniac becomes

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:21.870
especially if we have one HP versus two

00:24:19.409 --> 00:24:24.210
- makes it useful one makes it useless

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:26.390
so at least once we get down to the the

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:26.390
womb

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.990
the other thing you do is steal one item

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:32.400
with the emperor card but I don't think

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:33.600
stealing one item with the emperor card

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.070
is worth it

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.380
but I'm stoked because we are fighting

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:42.180
Krampus and even Krampus his head would

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:44.460
be a better pickup I don't like that I

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:46.350
didn't get the heel off of that but it's

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:48.240
lump of coal which is the the ideal

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:53.910
outcome we'll head down to the next

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:55.260
floor and pretty much immediately we're

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:56.190
gonna emperor card just see what the

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.980
room has to offer

00:24:56.190 --> 00:25:01.080
yeah let's Emperor we still got chaos

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:03.210
and of course we should be fighting a

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:04.800
boss before this and we're gonna walk

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:06.300
back and fight that boss because it's

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.790
one of the last opportunities for us to

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:13.980
get items that we can reasonably see

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:16.610
here um I gotta get over like my mental

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:21.510
issue here of there's really no reason

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:22.740
to to bomb ourselves right now cuz if we

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:24.540
get hit once we're gonna be one hit away

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:26.100
from death if we get hit once after

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.480
healing ourselves once we're gonna be

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:29.970
one hit away from death so we might as

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:35.370
well save our bomb even if it doesn't

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:40.170
feel quite right right now nice that was

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:41.580
actually pretty well handled given the

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:43.010
circumstances we could have panicked

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:45.330
pretty hard there was some enemies that

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:48.410
rush you down pretty fast when we

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:50.580
managed to survive

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:57.440
caffeine pill will keep us from getting

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:57.440
hit here hopefully and we in this

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:03.490
we still have goat head so yeah I mean

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:05.260
you might as well check it that

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:12.670
something about that room just screams

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:16.720
like ghost baby to me no good move good

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:19.299
move to get out I could have stood there

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:21.990
and try to make that bomb work would

00:26:19.299 --> 00:26:24.670
have been a bad decision I think

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:26.650
something's got to give Diane Keaton

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:29.830
Jack Nicholson Amanda Peet Keanu Reeves

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:31.630
2005 underrated romantic comedy you

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:33.400
might think it's only for septage

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:42.160
anarion 'he's not true nonagenarian

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:44.669
'he's love it as well dude just give it

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.669
up okay

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:53.390
okay okay get dust we've survived

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:56.470
we got three bombs not a lot tiers

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:56.470
upgrade quite nice

00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:03.500
we have to go downwards cuz we have the

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:05.900
negative or doesn't matter it matters it

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:08.600
matters I can't take the deal you're

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:11.530
offering me I have to oh you're right

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:14.630
with 19 cents we could fight the hush

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:18.170
but that's not the right play as much as

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:20.000
I wish it were it's not I know you're

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:21.710
thinking go down fight the hush you get

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.830
the double item rooms and you take one

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:26.570
item out of the shop it could be a path

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:31.970
to victory and I'm not disputing that

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:33.410
but I'm skeptical and I think I think if

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:35.330
you search your heart and you put

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:37.220
yourself in my shoes on this run you

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:41.600
would you would say the same thing like

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:43.310
ultra-hard is not a run I want to I want

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:46.550
to you know make light of right now it's

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:48.710
a challenging run we are finding

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:55.550
ourselves probably like slightly behind

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:57.560
the curve stat-wise now - really really

00:27:55.550 --> 00:28:00.770
good rate of fire would never dispute

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:03.110
that everything else little iffy at this

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:04.700
point even our damage you know we had

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:08.480
six point four five damage from like the

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:11.540
third floor onwards so I'm not convinced

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:13.640
that we're really benefitting in a huge

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:18.200
way from being in this position right

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:21.140
now but I do think we've held it

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:23.840
together on this running even more than

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:27.410
just having a great run starting the run

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:29.060
off with a great item is a huge help you

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:31.580
want the run to get easier as time goes

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:34.490
on that's that's the one of the central

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:36.770
tenets of like winning Isaac is your

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:40.060
runs get easier as time goes on it's the

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:40.060
idea anyway it's the dream

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:47.110
we don't need the penny we also don't

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:53.529
need your thought control if I have to

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:56.139
heal myself maybe we should do it to a

00:28:53.529 --> 00:29:00.909
spades if you have to heal myself maybe

00:28:56.139 --> 00:29:03.399
we should do it on the mirror at which

00:29:00.909 --> 00:29:10.509
point we might get some pills and/or

00:29:03.399 --> 00:29:12.070
cards I'm really just trying to hold

00:29:10.509 --> 00:29:13.570
things together here we can only get hit

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:15.090
twice we didn't really get a lot of HP

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:18.940
on this run

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:20.889
now hilarious I'm not really complaining

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:24.149
about a lack of HP I think we've

00:29:20.889 --> 00:29:26.440
actually managed to get pretty lucky

00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:31.529
we're actually at full health after

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:31.529
getting hit which is quite rare but um

00:29:32.309 --> 00:29:37.059
we've gotten really good items

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:40.210
especially pyromaniac like situationally

00:29:37.059 --> 00:29:43.899
always pretty good but on this run that

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:45.129
an actual like 20 out of 10 I know

00:29:43.899 --> 00:29:51.129
you're gonna ask yourself how did you

00:29:45.129 --> 00:29:55.600
not get hit here wow that was scary um

00:29:51.129 --> 00:29:57.759
okay let's try this had to still have 5

00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:01.690
bombs not an insignificant amount and

00:29:57.759 --> 00:30:04.659
all we need to do if we beat Satan we're

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:09.399
free I will use one bomb in two keys if

00:30:04.659 --> 00:30:13.389
we beat Satan we make it down you got 1

00:30:09.399 --> 00:30:17.429
cent out of that if we beat safe you

00:30:13.389 --> 00:30:17.429
hear me out here we make it down

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:26.630
please pop up bad timing

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:30.500
extremely bad timing how did we not get

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:32.990
hit there if we beat Satan we only have

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:34.940
to kill the second phase of magazine

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:36.230
much rather kill the second phase of

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:37.909
mega Satan than the first one you have

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:45.470
to be out of your gourd to do those in

00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:47.360
Reverse come on dude who knows how much

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:55.340
impact like the matchstick has had on

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:57.409
this run as well presumably it's one of

00:30:55.340 --> 00:31:04.370
the only it's the only reason we have

00:30:57.409 --> 00:31:06.380
bombs left at this point we've gotten

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:08.179
way more than five bombs I'm assuming as

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:09.620
a direct result of the matchstick but I

00:31:08.179 --> 00:31:12.110
mean I guess there's no way for me to

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:14.649
say that with authority necessarily four

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:14.649
bombs left

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:23.170
now the Satan fight is I mean many

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:26.559
things it's here it tends to be fairly

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:28.630
difficult and it also abuses bombs or a

00:31:26.559 --> 00:31:31.120
bomb for the first stage so we got to be

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:32.559
careful about that you know we want to

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:34.299
save bombs as well but I think we'll

00:31:32.559 --> 00:31:35.679
probably try to use a bomb to choose the

00:31:34.299 --> 00:31:39.220
fall and fight a little faster than

00:31:35.679 --> 00:31:45.160
usual and we'll also put the sprinkler

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:47.620
like right there the idea quite simply

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:50.309
being that the first phase of Satan is

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:56.950
just gonna hang out like right there so

00:31:50.309 --> 00:31:59.770
second phase sorry now if there is a

00:31:56.950 --> 00:32:02.830
benevolent force in this universe it

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:10.440
will give me to guppy items in the red

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:10.440
chest that we get on the chest excuse me

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:25.390
since when does Satan fly around that he

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:28.030
has never done this before it's like

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:32.049
they patched in something new just for

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:34.660
ultra-hard kind of a jerk move and we

00:32:32.049 --> 00:32:37.480
only have two bombs left they also only

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:41.169
have one luck so you know I am NOT going

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:43.510
to waste a lot of time on the chest

00:32:41.169 --> 00:32:47.980
doing rooms that seems very foolish to

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:50.380
me and by the chest I mean that the you

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:52.750
know dark room but like are you

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:59.610
impressed we might have a chance here to

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:59.610
be doing Li this ok oh ok that's nothing

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:04.990
take away tears up tears explosive

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:06.070
diarrhea would have been a great one to

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:08.710
bring in but that's fine we got more

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:12.190
pills out of it regardless infested we

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:14.410
definitely I was just gonna say we

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:18.600
definitely should not be doing this but

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:21.040
here we are and we are doing

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:23.920
probably the safer play now is to not

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:25.180
use chaos card right off the bed but I'm

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.590
gonna use chaos card right off the bat

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:31.060
please tell me he doesn't even spawn a

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:32.980
phase to still spawn to Phase two we

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:43.240
just got to keep him on the screen so we

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:47.770
know what he's doing it was the it was

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:49.300
the health down I've never been more

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:50.860
upset about anything in my whole life

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:54.220
can't you tell from the tone of my voice

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:55.600
we had ultra hard cinched up I ruined it

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:57.610
and that's what hurts me I took the

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:59.640
pills I should not have taken the pills

00:33:57.610 --> 00:34:02.800
and we died so instantly it's just like

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:04.090
what a catastrophe I'm gonna go take the

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.990
