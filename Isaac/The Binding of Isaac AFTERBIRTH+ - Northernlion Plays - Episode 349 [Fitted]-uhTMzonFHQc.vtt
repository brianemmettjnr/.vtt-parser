00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.830
we lost on our last run Tomo I can't pay

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.450
you right now but after this episode is

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.880
done

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.100
non-stop pets I promise I don't know

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:44.610
what this voice is where the loss

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:54.440
against me 240 X you want one one meow -

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:57.870
one pet ready Tomo come oh come oh no

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.289
meow - no pets I petted him a little

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.270
anyway I like being a loss I'm happy to

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.640
be the loss the last run was extremely

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.540
strange very aberrant as far as lost

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.500
runs go my boy comes in here he meows at

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.970
the door I let him in I pet him I start

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.320
recording Isaac he's like I don't want

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.930
to be here anymore he's looking at the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.540
door he's ready to leave I gave you the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.340
best pets of your life and you've

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.829
decided to rebuke my my respect

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.820
okay don't die on the second room that

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.860
would be a little embarrassing

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.799
parasitoid tears is excellent as well so

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.689
I'm excited Friday night and I've been

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.259
recording a lot today is my last video

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.360
of the day it's like what I used to feel

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.009
like it's not that I don't enjoy doing

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.750
videos by the way it's just been such a

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.000
busy day it's been like a time and a

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.799
half day for sure that this is what I

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.070
used to feel like on like Friday night

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.070
when I had my teaching job except for

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.549
those weekends where they were like hey

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.600
can you come in on Saturday because you

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.159
know there's going to be some of the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.570
kids here for like a field trip sort of

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.759
thing and you're like well can I legally

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.369
say no and they're like no and you're

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.369
like okay well I'll see you on Saturday

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.500
the downside to working you know in a

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.000
foreign country with no knowledge of

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.520
your of your rights and freedoms but

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.930
anyway I digress it's not the that

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.120
wasn't the right time to plead the fifth

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.959
because it brought me here we have no

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.780
bombs

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:33.290
so I unfortunately have zero means with

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.060
which to access this Isaac's room which

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.870
is a real shame because a black market

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.120
would be incredible

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.430
however wait a minute let's think about

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.560
this if things go exactly right

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.340
like unbelievably right we could get

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.130
enough money to buy a bomb potentially

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.560
turn it into two bombs via a mechanism

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.120
no Cade I was going to say biomechanism

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.440
I haven't considered I guess probably

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.870
like bombing right here would have a

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.450
chance to do it but oh you know what we

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.780
only need one bomb because the secret

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.599
room is adjacent to Isaac's room but we

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.160
need another bomb to break the bed in

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.970
the middle so we'd actually be hoping

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.290
for like the matchbook here I got to

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.049
remember because the last run was so

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.470
strange I have to remember that on this

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:21.350
run we should not under any

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.090
circumstances you use the d4 do you

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.769
remember how things went wrong in the

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.170
last run probably like people are like

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.690
NL you should go see a neurologist I

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.670
walked into a self sacrifice room walked

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.140
on the spike took damage sought for some

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.680
reason I was in a curse room so I would

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.870
die if I left so I rerolls the whole run

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.269
thus losing me holy mantle in a Hail

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.609
Mary attempt to live despite the fact

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:46.389
that I need to do it send me on a spiral

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:50.950
of despair that led to my eventual

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:50.950
victory surprise surprise

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.639
well this is not going to do it for us

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.630
that was effectively worthless but it's

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:00.829
all other deals with the devil

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:03.470
regardless but yeah that was not a not a

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.329
stellar performance on my behalf that

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.609
led to a run that I hope was a little

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.709
bit entertaining but yeah my brain is

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:13.489
fried you'd have recorded so much today

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:16.250
the deleterious amount I hope not but

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.930
conceivably from from a commentary

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.989
standpoint you know you sometimes the

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.849
comps the commentary Peaks like three

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.950
videos four videos into a day usually

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:28.490
it's hopefully relatively

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:31.460
Sisseton around there as well but you

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.850
know you got bits stored up you go up on

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.730
tangents your high energy right now I'm

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:41.260
more like when this is over I'm gonna

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:44.510
eat the sandwich and sit on the couch

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:47.060
like I never understood sitting on the

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.350
couch when I was a kid you know parents

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.720
get home from work they take a seat on

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.690
the couch and you go wow being an adult

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.760
sucks nah dawg and so that's what a hard

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.670
day's work earns you is I just want to

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.820
get home and sit down you're gonna turn

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.920
on the TV I don't know 50 50 little

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.520
feelin a little lazy my just sort of sit

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:11.780
there my phone is like a TV in my pocket

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.600
maybe I'll look at my phone god help me

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:19.250
if it's got to be charged though I you

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:22.490
know it's as I get older my phone almost

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.170
never ends up being uncharged or low on

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.570
battery when I was younger and

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.760
admittedly I've only you know I lived in

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:32.450
the pre cellphone era so I've had my own

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.680
phone only since I was like maybe 2021

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.990
it's like seven years

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.680
I mean battery life has gotten better

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:42.110
for one but you know always sorry my

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.480
phones out of battery you know 20%

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.000
battery life 40% battery life I'm on

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.120
like a hundo percent battery life most

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.230
of the time now not hundred but like

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.020
rarely do I get home and have it be

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.100
under 50% admittedly it smells like I

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:02.420
have a long commute

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:03.860
oh I crack myself up but it's it's

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.510
almost always charged then we make up

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.430
for this in Canada by having no data

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.700
allowances so you're like oh did I

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:14.330
accidentally just open a video on LTE I

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:17.120
guess I owe them my firstborn child my

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.160
firstborn child was a very strange

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:23.270
opportunity for an Ed McMahon impression

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:27.260
for some reason money please thanks

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:29.810
thanks a lot um you know what we want

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:33.140
bombs ooh

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:35.330
we don't want keys but not super

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.890
disappointed this is a good shop this

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.660
Rhonda is I mean I didn't really

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.370
lampshade

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:42.220
but of course on a run like this I'm

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.380
going to take mom's knife I'm the

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.660
freaking loss the rule is it's in the

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.000
Geneva Convention if you random the lost

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.350
you can take whatever items show up you

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.090
don't have to apologize for it because

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:57.100
you already are paying the piper by

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:58.510
being the lost in the first place we can

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.030
buy a BFF as well

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:06.400
BFF tonight am I quite like so I may

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:08.080
indeed consider it here and buy consider

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.670
I mean like I was walking over there to

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.600
do it at the present moment so yeah

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.610
we'll do that it's not like we have an

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:16.210
arcade that we ever want to make but

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:17.800
especially on the next floor but I think

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:23.320
it's you know if you were to draw a

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:25.450
graph of phone average phone charge

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.340
versus age it would rise as you get

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:30.010
older because plugging in your phone is

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:33.040
a good metaphor for how to live a

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:35.110
successful adult life at night you know

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.150
you might think all I'm too lazy to plug

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.760
in my phone but you know it's going to

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:41.050
hurt you tomorrow obviously it doesn't

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.360
take a whole lot of work but you know

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:45.490
that's that skill of plugging in your

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.410
phone nightly despite the fact that you

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.870
don't necessarily want to do it in every

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:52.630
situation but it'll benefit you tomorrow

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:55.120
it's applicable to all areas of adult

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:58.240
life you know all you know it's Sunday I

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.860
don't want to buy groceries you go out

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.570
you buy groceries anyway then you got

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.550
food for Monday Tuesday Wednesday maybe

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:05.500
even longer I don't know how long how

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:09.360
often do you guys buy groceries on a

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:14.110
regular basis when I when I was a single

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:18.430
bachelor a young a young pup so to speak

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:19.900
I was like a twice a week sort of guy I

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:24.490
think we're still pretty much in that

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:28.419
range Kate and I are right now you know

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:30.490
you because I don't meet usually only

00:08:28.419 --> 00:08:32.050
stays good for like a few days and I'm

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:34.410
on this I eat a lot of sandwiches

00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:36.460
because I'm white like like so white

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:38.740
unbelievably white I'm not saying that

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:41.110
as a self insult it's just the way it is

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:43.570
right and I love sandwiches it's in my

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:45.220
blood I could be happy eating nothing

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:46.570
but sandwiches for the rest of my life I

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.310
could probably be happy eating nothing

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.550
but the same sandwich every day for the

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:50.860
rest

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:52.600
to my life so the thing is I love eating

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.399
these sandwiches but it's a suboptimal

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.779
lunch food to buy for yourself at the

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:57.370
grocery store and you might say NL

00:08:55.779 --> 00:08:59.970
that's stupid people been doing it for

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:03.760
years yeah I know but the thing is

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:06.250
unless you buy a stager and maybe nobody

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.050
else has this problem maybe I'm unique

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:10.209
in this I'm just going to blow you up

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:17.529
because I don't care about your

00:09:10.209 --> 00:09:19.120
existence maybe I'm maybe I eat and I

00:09:17.529 --> 00:09:22.300
don't know I'm trying to phrase this in

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:25.000
a way that doesn't damn me my typical

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:27.880
sandwich is two slices of bread three

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.240
slices of a lunch meat so like a sliced

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:32.920
usually processed meat sometimes they

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.079
get the artisan stuff if you down at the

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:39.160
Whole Foods or as I call it a whole

00:09:35.079 --> 00:09:42.490
paycheck don't sue me jeff bezos anyway

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:44.220
nah I'm not dying here I'm not dying

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:46.570
here thank you

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.670
two hearts maybe we should use two of

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:52.029
diamonds first but I'm actually okay

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:54.339
with this I got to go hard on this I do

00:09:52.029 --> 00:09:55.899
not care about moving bucks it's so much

00:09:54.339 --> 00:09:59.110
more trouble than it's worth in like

00:09:55.899 --> 00:10:00.310
almost every situation but anyway what

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.980
if we can get something on a dull razor

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:06.520
so it's like two slices of bread

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:08.200
standard three slices of meat I'll slice

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.940
up some cheese put some mustard on it

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:14.829
sometimes some lettuce you know it's

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:16.990
pretty simple it's a very I would

00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:19.329
hesitate I would not hesitate to call

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:21.730
that a standard sandwich by the average

00:10:19.329 --> 00:10:23.020
person's definition sure maybe some

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:24.700
people are like where's the red onion

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.600
dude you got some red onion throw it on

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.730
there as that's the beauty about

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.230
sandwiches they can take on a variety of

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.110
different ingredients and still be

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:34.630
glorious right but anyway

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:38.170
the turnover in sandwich ingredients is

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:39.910
too high we buy bread the bread

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:43.029
typically goes bad between four and five

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:44.350
days that means no matter what unless

00:10:43.029 --> 00:10:46.000
you're buying like eight loaves of bread

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:48.579
freezing them and then you got a defrost

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.440
them I suppose Plus defrosted bread it's

00:10:48.579 --> 00:10:52.720
never the same I know a lot of people do

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:55.120
it my parents do it as well you can tell

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.500
if they did a blind test I could tell a

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.850
hundred percent and I'm not being

00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:01.240
facetious I'd be like this is a fresh

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:01.990
loaf is the front defrosted loaf it's

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:06.100
not the

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:08.470
that's either one is bad I'm just saying

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:10.029
you can tell we don't do the bread

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.230
freezing thing here because we don't

00:11:10.029 --> 00:11:12.310
have a chest freezer we don't have a

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.260
chest freezer because we live in an

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:15.730
apartment that's you know 600 square

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.920
feet or something like that I would take

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:19.690
up like all of our living rooms so

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.279
anyway the point is that means I have to

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:26.920
go grocery shopping twice a week there's

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:28.810
no conceivable way we could freeze

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.490
loaves of bread but then we could buy

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:32.170
three loaves of bread at a time we'd

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.970
have to go grocery shopping three times

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:37.510
in two weeks this is the other way it

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:38.680
could work out I guess but the point is

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:41.260
you always need more sandwich

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:43.330
ingredients I need to I'm not trying to

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.250
like min/max my entire pardon me my

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.959
entire life to make it so efficient but

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:48.279
that's why I'm grocery shopping two

00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:50.529
times a week it's like 90 percent

00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:55.899
sandwich math I have to run out of bread

00:11:50.529 --> 00:11:58.000
or the bread goes bad or I run out of

00:11:55.899 --> 00:11:59.440
meat because you know I order a standard

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.450
amount of me I see people they go to the

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.430
they go to the deli counter they order

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:05.200
like a hundred grams of a meat that you

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:08.020
probably do like slices or ounces in the

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.480
u.s. I guess but I'm gonna be honest you

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:14.850
a hundred grams of meat is like maybe

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:18.220
two sandwiches that's okay

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:19.630
I'm not going to rag on you if you're

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.550
only having two sandwiches that week

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.959
that makes sense but the math doesn't

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.339
make sense to me you took all this time

00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:25.660
to go to the grocery store and you're

00:12:24.339 --> 00:12:29.860
just going to buy enough meat for two

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:31.570
sandwiches I get like 300 400 grams

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:35.410
that's enough meat for four to five

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:37.779
sandwiches I think that math roughly

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:39.990
checks out I'm not doing strict error

00:12:37.779 --> 00:12:43.870
check and you get the idea

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:45.610
but even then so there are some days

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:48.430
where I'll have two sandwiches and then

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:49.959
as a result I'm basically I'm never more

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:51.850
than two days away from needing more

00:12:49.959 --> 00:12:52.959
sandwich ingredients you know the first

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:54.220
sandwich you make with brand-new

00:12:52.959 --> 00:12:55.930
ingredients you're like these are going

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:57.010
to last forever the second sandwich you

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:59.860
make with new ingredients you're like

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:01.750
we're gonna need more stuff soon cheese

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.880
is the like the ultimate Savior the

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.860
cheese you buy a block of cheese if you

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:08.079
don't use it for other purposes it will

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:11.320
seriously stay good for a hundred years

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:14.800
what if it gets moldy dude I'm so like

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:16.420
Pro food safety but I don't know other

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.880
there hopefully like this I seem like a

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:22.180
weirdo if a hard cheese gets moldy you

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:23.800
just cut the moldy part off give it like

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.570
a lick of it's not just dude like

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.279
there's unseen mold under the surface

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:29.910
right so you cut the moldy part off and

00:13:27.279 --> 00:13:32.320
with a little bit extra to hopefully

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:33.910
stop the spread it's like you're doing

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.440
surgery in the Middle Ages you know

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:37.510
you've got a gangrenous leg and you're

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.730
going to go to chop it off and get to

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:41.470
the you know get to the good stuff save

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:44.730
the rest of the world or save their

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:48.490
heads to the leg I should say anyway

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:50.230
this the cheese is a non non-issue the

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:53.110
cheese is always there's always cheese

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:55.209
and it's always in a good condition but

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:56.769
bread and meat are in a different spot I

00:13:55.209 --> 00:13:59.290
need to start doing what I did in

00:13:56.769 --> 00:14:01.570
college which was actually like really

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:04.959
good for my health and wellness which

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:07.360
was make like one sweet pot of chili a

00:14:04.959 --> 00:14:09.370
week and then just have chili for lunch

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.649
and you're like I knew the macronutrient

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:14.680
breakdown like the back of my freaking

00:14:11.649 --> 00:14:16.839
hand you know literally is a 540

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.910
calories per serving the most of it is

00:14:16.839 --> 00:14:20.980
from protein but there is also a little

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:23.560
bit of fat from the beef and the

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:25.720
carbohydrates are exclusively in fibrous

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.040
form viola the legumes the three cans of

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:29.529
beans that go in there you know it was

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:33.880
it was perfect it was like a genetically

00:14:29.529 --> 00:14:36.310
created superfood that also kept well in

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.720
the fridge always tasted well tasted

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:39.579
good that was an overcorrection

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:42.640
grammatically speaking and you know what

00:14:39.579 --> 00:14:47.170
you know all you need just boom that's

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:49.420
it all you need to have a good time with

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:51.010
chili once it's made as a spoon when

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:54.520
sure when you buy the groceries you got

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:56.140
to buy a lot more the preparation time

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.910
is much larger than making a single

00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:00.790
sandwich probably much larger than

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:03.040
making five sandwiches but I think it's

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:06.850
it's worth it from a simplification

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:10.769
standpoint so how's this run going I'm

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:13.240
straight up I actually do not know I

00:15:10.769 --> 00:15:16.360
couldn't tell you dude we got mom's

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:20.980
knife which is lovely but we're on base

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:24.720
damage a great rate of fire slightly

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:26.950
irrelevant with mom's knife but not bad

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:29.200
certainly a chance to

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:33.310
is there a secret room somewhere near I

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:39.160
heard it go cash oh yeah it is right

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:40.570
there we're on schedule which is bad for

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.640
having moms night because it indicates

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:48.460
that we're probably beyond schedule

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:50.950
layer behind schedule it should say Kate

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:53.610
is playing a horror game from the other

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:56.200
room on stream so if you hear shouting

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:58.180
or screaming that's where that's coming

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.980
from which I understand sounds like the

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.570
sort of thing that happens in like media

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:03.430
all the time where they're like oh

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:05.880
there's been a disappearance with this

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:07.870
person and then you know you go to the

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.520
suspected killers house and you've got

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:11.080
like blood all over his hands like oh

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.970
yeah officer I was just butchering

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:15.690
butchering a deer that I caught but no

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:18.190
this is you know time will bear out

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:23.440
she's playing hide and shriek on steam

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:27.280
right now are on stream right now some

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:28.780
people you know they horror games on

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:31.120
YouTube and twitch have been given a bad

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:33.280
name all this is getting ridiculous by

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:35.940
people who like fake their reactions and

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:39.040
I understand the pressure to fake a

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.720
reaction as well because I mean it's

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.130
conceived I don't rely on that stuff for

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.710
entertainment value I actually have no

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:47.320
idea why I'm entertaining I'm just I do

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:49.780
to some people anyway at least I'm just

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:51.670
happy that it's there and I'm anxious

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.930
every day that one day it won't be there

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:56.200
and it'll just be gone and there'll be

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:57.880
no way to get it back however we might

00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:01.570
as well take curse of a tower dude who

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:04.750
cares right however I understand that

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:09.790
pressure to perform you know Kate is

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:10.990
like 100% the like Platonic ideal of who

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:14.320
you want to watch play a horror game

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:17.290
because she gets genuinely scared all

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:20.920
the time and she gets like animated when

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:22.540
she gets afraid I don't mean she turns

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:25.300
into a car too and that be weird as heck

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:28.270
dude alright so I did use tell appeals

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:32.230
there I was hoping to say that for boss

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:34.960
rush but it's alright I'm sorry fine

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:36.700
regardless just remember that song it

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.050
might be a Canadian song and I say that

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.940
because

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:41.780
if it's a Canadian song it might have

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:44.420
been one of those things where I was

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.560
only played on radio here because we

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.880
have laws that say you have to play a

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:51.500
certain amount of Canadian content but

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:55.490
it went that's all right that's okay and

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:59.060
it I really love you anyway and I think

00:17:55.490 --> 00:18:01.010
it's pan food me too something yeah and

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:03.170
the song's called another dumb blonde I

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:05.900
can't remember it was like a big in the

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:09.080
pop punk era so like you know Oh Wanda

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:10.940
oh four or something like that I'm not

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:12.980
saying it's a good song as the song is

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:14.660
definitely more about like you know your

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:16.190
first boyfriend broke up with you in

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:18.140
middle school and now you want to get

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:20.780
back at them so you make those lyrics

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:22.460
like your aim away message or something

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:24.820
like that but anyway okay we got to be

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.820
careful now

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:29.420
it just popped into my head the other

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:31.070
day no joke when I was making a sandwich

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.730
no I haven't heard this song in a long

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:33.980
time

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:35.210
Thank You universe for presenting me

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:37.910
with something to talk about on this

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:41.620
episode by giving me that bit from

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:41.620
earlier this week I appreciate it

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:47.540
there's a couple of songs like that that

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:48.590
nobody talks about them anymore but

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:50.390
every once in a while they pop in my

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:53.420
head like there's another one it's I'm

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:58.670
afraid of Britney Spears and Christina

00:18:53.420 --> 00:19:01.430
Aguilera Backstreet Boys and NSYNC I

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:07.040
don't know what to think

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:09.260
so this is like you know a long

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:11.660
generation personified but at the time

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.740
we were like well thank god what's the

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:15.320
difference between the Backstreet Boys

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:17.690
NSYNC in that band basically they had

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:22.790
guitars so you but that's real music

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:24.890
dude better damage worse rate of fire

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:26.540
we're going to snow we should go to the

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:30.500
shop we should go to the shop we got so

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:32.960
much money we should go to the shop or

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:36.179
maybe that band is the new version of

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:39.090
the wheels I had no idea let's be real

00:19:36.179 --> 00:19:42.119
all I'm saying is we all bought into a

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:45.809
fact that dude please a black market I

00:19:42.119 --> 00:19:56.399
would give anything to experience the

00:19:45.809 --> 00:19:58.440
market noir unlikely well we're still

00:19:56.399 --> 00:20:01.590
moving on I mean the run is fine is

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:03.269
beyond fine it's good it's just the main

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:05.039
principle problem is that we still can't

00:20:03.269 --> 00:20:06.929
take any hits I wish that our speed was

00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:10.769
like 1.2 and then I'd be a lot happier

00:20:06.929 --> 00:20:13.139
but short of getting like a respawn or

00:20:10.769 --> 00:20:19.080
something this is pretty much where we

00:20:13.139 --> 00:20:22.440
want to be looking for more copy items

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:25.309
but very cautious of the fact that some

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:27.720
troll bombs could cause us some issues

00:20:25.309 --> 00:20:29.220
when I said that might as well take her

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:31.019
to the tower by the way I hope you

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:33.360
called me on that because there's no

00:20:31.019 --> 00:20:35.190
reason well that's not true there is

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:37.080
actually one reason to take curse of the

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:40.169
tower that I can think of maybe you can

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:42.869
think of more there's also one reason

00:20:40.169 --> 00:20:44.970
not to so here's the here's the easy

00:20:42.869 --> 00:20:48.749
ones the reason to take it is that if we

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:50.220
rewrote our whole run it gets rear old

00:20:48.749 --> 00:20:52.049
into something else that could be useful

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:54.119
or it could be terrible but you know

00:20:52.049 --> 00:20:55.619
you're banking on it being useful we're

00:20:54.119 --> 00:20:57.360
going to try to make boss rush despite

00:20:55.619 --> 00:20:59.700
it seeming like a bit of a pipe dream

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.049
right now hopefully we'll get a teleport

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.879
on the way so we can go back to the shop

00:21:01.049 --> 00:21:05.340
not that we can buy spirit arts or

00:21:02.879 --> 00:21:06.720
anything but still either way so that's

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.549
the benefit is that it adds one more

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.929
item in your item drawer and then you

00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:11.580
know if you were to ever to find a six

00:21:09.929 --> 00:21:13.110
room and for some reason you wanted to

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.850
re-roll it or you had addy 100 or

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:17.429
something like that you could take

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:22.799
advantage of that and it would probably

00:21:17.429 --> 00:21:25.649
help you out although I'm skeptical of

00:21:22.799 --> 00:21:27.659
the relative value of that the negative

00:21:25.649 --> 00:21:28.980
though is that if we ever respawn as

00:21:27.659 --> 00:21:33.809
another character like if we get dark

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:35.940
Judas or Lazarus rags all of a sudden we

00:21:33.809 --> 00:21:37.440
we still have curse with the tower which

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:41.909
can be very dangerous when you come back

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:43.830
with one HP so in the end I think it

00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:45.240
probably was still a bad idea to take it

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:47.159
and that's how you know an item is

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.480
really bad when even when it has no

00:21:47.159 --> 00:21:49.280
effect it could still have a

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:54.830
catastrophic

00:21:49.280 --> 00:22:01.280
of that so okay I tried so many

00:21:54.830 --> 00:22:02.840
different ways to not get hit there be

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.130
careful this this is like the calm

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.730
before the storm where we look at this

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:08.660
and we go

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:10.760
hey remember back on that depth room

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:12.470
where I took six here the depths floor

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:14.120
where I took six hits on six rooms in a

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:17.750
row yeah that explains why we're dead

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:19.430
now we are going to have a chance to

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:22.100
make boss rush but it's going to have to

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:24.050
be like a ten out of ten item in order

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:25.580
to justify its existence but I still

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:27.530
think it's worth trying just going to

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:28.220
quickly bomb these two and hope that we

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:29.930
get a card

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:41.960
hopefully that card is worth it not

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:45.050
nothing just focusing for now it's kind

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:50.000
of an important fight no deal Polaroid

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:55.490
is fine able Aquarius halitosis in the

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:57.380
bean halitosis and the bean Helen no

00:22:55.490 --> 00:23:08.150
this is this is very bad this is not

00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:10.730
good so what's the what's the scenario

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:12.560
here but you know in a way I like it

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:14.630
because it's a classic lost running

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:18.860
we've never deviated from the don't get

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:21.170
hit twice model right now got an outside

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:23.870
chance of gum P nine lives wins us the

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:27.050
run to guppy items probably wins us the

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:29.540
run substantial damage increase probably

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:30.890
wins us the run and even if we get none

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:32.500
of that I think we got a good chance of

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:34.580
winning the run I don't think we're in a

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:36.320
nothing we're in an unfair position I

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:39.020
don't think the run has been bad to us I

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:40.610
mean we got mom's knife early and then

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:42.140
we got deaths touch maybe those are the

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:44.150
only big damage improvements we've had

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:47.000
but you know what more it is it does a

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:50.060
boy need what a girl wants what a girl

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.180
needs whatever makes you happy sets me

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:54.380
free and I'm thinking you over show

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:56.539
anything

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:59.480
and I remember that we're getting into

00:23:56.539 --> 00:24:03.320
the leg everybody remembers and talks

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:04.370
about all constantly toxic hit me baby

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:07.490
one more time

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:11.110
oops I did it again you know nobody ever

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:13.970
talks about sometimes sometimes I men

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:17.720
sometimes I had who's sometimes I'm

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:22.789
scared of you but I really want is to

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:24.169
what a strange song Brittany it sounds

00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:25.490
like you're creeping us do the hack out

00:24:24.169 --> 00:24:27.799
he's like hey Brittany you want to go

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:30.679
out and then she runs away it hides from

00:24:27.799 --> 00:24:32.809
you sometimes I'm scared of you all I

00:24:30.679 --> 00:24:34.640
really want is to hold you tight treat

00:24:32.809 --> 00:24:37.700
you right be with you day and night this

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:45.950
is a very strange message for that song

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:47.600
I mean I could if the subtext is that

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:49.669
she gets like intimidated because the

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.760
man's showing her affection I guess I

00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:57.400
understand that you know she's like

00:24:51.760 --> 00:25:03.950
teehee Oh Sydney what's Rob's voice

00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:06.320
senpai oh but I pull from there senpai

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:11.570
I'm trying to do Rob's version of the

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:13.039
anime voice it's oh man somebody linked

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:15.559
that clip in the comments can even post

00:25:13.039 --> 00:25:20.809
links in YouTube comments I got no idea

00:25:15.559 --> 00:25:23.570
either way when she says you know that

00:25:20.809 --> 00:25:26.480
the text of the song seems to make it

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:29.539
apparent that sometimes she actually

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:31.100
runs away from this from her suitor and

00:25:29.539 --> 00:25:33.830
there's nothing wrong with that if

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:36.409
you're actually like in danger but like

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:38.710
if you like this poor guy and he's like

00:25:36.409 --> 00:25:43.309
hey Brittany I needed hey Brittany I

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:47.210
need to tell you something I love you

00:25:43.309 --> 00:25:49.340
and but then she's literally running

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:51.070
away and hiding in fear

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:53.780
that's not sending a mixed message

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:56.840
that's sent a message that light is do

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:59.240
as a creep and you're sending in that

00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:00.650
message without without desiring to send

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:03.490
it to them it's a very strange situation

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:03.490
Brittany

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:13.600
on Seuss algae's bag as hey bro check

apologize because some of you were

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:27.670
probably trying to sleep that's also not

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:29.620
what these videos are made for these

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:32.230
videos are videos for you to jerk it to

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:33.930
not to sleep - okay two very different

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:38.220
things

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:38.220
sometimes done in the same location

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:47.460
algae's picado see that was supposed to

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:52.240
be a play on the what's up the was up

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:58.300
joke was a that gasps it's like I said

00:26:52.240 --> 00:27:05.680
at the stars been a long day okay no

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:08.710
response yet you don't need a respawn to

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:10.510
win is the loss certainly even old loss

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:13.180
you didn't need a respawn although it

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:15.370
was like it's like you know you don't

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:17.920
need a high school diploma to get this

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:21.970
job but you know it's kind of like a

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:23.650
soft credential be very valuable at the

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:33.310
very least is what I'm trying to suggest

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:36.250
here it's indicative the quality of this

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:37.930
run somehow we were unable to kill a guy

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:42.610
by actually poking him with the knife

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:47.200
for that long just because our knife is

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:49.390
on like no damage very little damage the

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:55.930
principal problem right now though is

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:58.590
really speed yeah we lived let's not get

00:27:55.930 --> 00:28:03.040
cocky but we lived on Susan's very good

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:03.790
Avedon's very nice let's get the heck

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:06.880
out of here

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:08.500
oh is this what I see one though the

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.840
Abaddonn pick up is very helpful don't

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:12.280
get me wrong but I would love some like

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.990
a speed upgrade probably wins us the

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:16.510
game at this point we know guppies not

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:20.130
likely to happen so

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:24.190
it's been a while since I had a lost run

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:26.980
yep it all it all went up in smoke in

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:28.270
like two seconds I was just about to say

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:30.880
it's been a while since I've had a lost

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:33.760
run that gives us a run for our money so

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:36.370
this one absolutely did that was my own

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:38.680
poor play they're squirming to 4dx

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:39.910
