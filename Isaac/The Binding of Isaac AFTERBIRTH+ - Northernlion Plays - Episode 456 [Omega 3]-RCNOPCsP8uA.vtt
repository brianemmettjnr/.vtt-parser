00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.529
hey everybody welcome back to northern

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.760
line place abiding by scattereth plus

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:17.580
where we've been doing a we've been doin

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:20.609
a let's do a negative negative Cain that

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.850
could also do mega satan negative Cain

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.760
mega Satan apparently I was mistaken

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.529
offensively mistaken you can do mega

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.150
satan and the lamb in the same run

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.050
whether or not we can strike you know

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:39.290
gold there will see nine a seven 4 ec

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:43.260
eight or as I say x8 haha the AE lek

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.510
okay that works we avoided a troll bomb

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.950
all to give ourselves another troll bomb

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.780
but actually if I'm on today the half

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.110
spirit hard garnered from that room

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.010
might actually be enough to protect us

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:04.049
from some ensuing deal with the devil

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:05.309
danger when that debit comes due I was

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.799
just trying to alliterate it didn't

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.400
really fit okay question marks dangerous

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.380
except when they're not infestation two

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.159
in arguably one of the best items in the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.390
game I think and gets better as we get

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.710
better that's the thing you want your

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.650
items to get better with you you don't

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.270
want your items you know when you're

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.530
doing bad they're doing better than all

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.509
of a sudden you're doing well and the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.030
item goes you gotta do worse so you can

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.680
you know make better use of Cain's

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.810
near-sighted friends the answer to that

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:40.740
question is no I refuse excuse me got a

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.909
lot of flies out of that one amnesia new

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.909
rooms new rooms okay

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:54.060
I don't like this fire I see the danger

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.860
inherent in that fire I'm just gonna

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.390
keep moving on here having some extra

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.190
spiders is gonna help out even without

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.340
any extra damage but the extra damage is

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:06.890
gonna take this into like 12 out of 10

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.890
range for us if we can make it happen

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.340
but first we need to create that

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.650
situation out from under us damage PJ's

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.690
just like seven spirit arts and here I

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.120
was thinking that we were being a smart

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.650
guy we got that half spirit heart I was

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.600
gonna rely on that we just got like four

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.580
extra spirit ours are picking up PJ's

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.980
low key though I actually think that

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.410
PJ's is probably one of those boss items

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.580
I'm always internally in my head and I

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.709
don't know whether it's based on you

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.959
know new information or you know my

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.640
present play style or you know how the

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.790
mood strikes me but I'm always really

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.040
ating items items I love sometimes end

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.810
up becoming items that I think are not

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.150
so good rarely do they go from like

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.560
beloved to garbage kidney stone is like

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.100
the closest thing I've ever seen to do

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.540
that maybe triple shot as well but the

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.269
only kind of triple shot I want is

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.430
flavor in my makiato I've never consumed

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.799
the macchiato do I get drinks in

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.690
Starbucks occasionally if it's the if

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.310
it's the closest coffee shop I'm a black

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.519
coffee sort of guy though I gotta admit

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.450
there's no not meant to be you know Mike

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.030
machismo

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.360
it's mostly I just enjoy bitter flavors

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.519
I also like a lot of beers that people

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.989
you know and I'd say hey you should try

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.329
this they try it and they go oh it

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.190
tastes like you know gin filtered

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:27.329
through gasoline and I'm like yeah isn't

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.900
it great Abaddon is fine here that means

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:33.239
better than fine the question becomes we

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.579
rather have shop key or free golden

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:39.540
chests shop key has probably got a a

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:42.870
lower floor or sorry a higher floor and

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:46.350
yet a lower ceiling for usefulness this

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.940
which I'm gonna keep much higher ceiling

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.440
but oftentimes there might be several

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.070
floors where we never get to use it at

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.599
all so for now though I think it's good

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.650
we're gonna stick with it if we got B's

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.569
tail or something like that we're

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.730
rolling I like strong flavors you know

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.430
people

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.110
they they have created the idea and this

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.330
might have scientific backing to it at

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.230
least for now did I say that is if I

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.129
have some kind of privileged information

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.110
I do not but you know at least not

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.760
related at tastebuds but they people

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.500
consider themselves super tasters I'm

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.790
not a super taster I'd like everybody

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.650
you know whatever you learn about the

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.660
idea that there's tasters super tasters

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.330
and like sub tasters I wanted to be a

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.340
super taster why wouldn't you this room

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.880
could be huge you know it means you

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:32.600
taste things more strongly it's like the

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.100
circumcision argument but for your for

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.910
your taste buds instead of you know your

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:41.600
glands either way though let's not go

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.400
down that road that bombs but we spend

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.410
bombs as well so it's kind of a wash a

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.500
little bit of money in the process I

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.539
don't think I'm a super taster I think

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.539
I'm like a sub taster I think I have I

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:55.130
think I have bad taste buds or there's

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.780
like you know something's clogged up the

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.639
connection maybe I ate too many Cheetos

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.639
a clogged up the connection nerves

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.630
between my taste buds in my brain but

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.950
that's probably how that works right

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:08.570
yeah yeah why not

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.760
I think I taste less than the average

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.050
person

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:16.099
what can live with iron bar that's not

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.510
bad I love hot sauce I love like you

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:19.700
know sour beers

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.070
I love bitter beers I'd love vinegar is

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.960
it kind of a Canadian and also British

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.300
probably originally British you know

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.610
give credit where it's due

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.970
thing but I love vinegar as a condiment

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:35.330
gimme you know vinegar radish give me

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.070
vinegar on french fries 100% into it one

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.710
of the things I always forget when we

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.479
have Americans I mean I could save one

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.360
key and go to the shop it's kind of like

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.620
who cares we have people over in their

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.520
American and they haven't been to Canada

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.360
before they always go

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.830
it's so weird at the like the food court

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.139
where you get your drinks and also the

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.729
condiments for your fries or whatever

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:57.500
there's always vinegar you go you like

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:00.169
for cleaning supplies it's not dog to

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:03.770
eat we eat it and I think it's delicious

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:05.630
a little sour vinegar on a on a crispy

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.820
french fry maybe with some fish and

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.490
chips sign me up

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.840
I'm invested I'd rather have that than

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.240
mayonnaise but I understand that's a

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.990
content

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.120
his topic anyway I like strong flavors I

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.009
think if liking strong flavors makes me

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.630
a sub taster then so be it

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:26.849
I am a sub taster I can live with that

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:29.610
there have been times can I tell you

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:31.229
about some of the most you know

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.770
embarrassing snacks I've ever eaten in

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:34.349
my life

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.280
how about a piece of cheese with some

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:40.729
Cholula on it

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:46.530
that's one gone through days like that

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:48.630
how about Bologna and a cheese string

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.009
ripped up and then put on top of it you

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:53.099
can see there's kind of like a common

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:53.880
recurring element here let's get in

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:55.889
through here sorry

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.360
I got distracted remembering the most

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:59.930
shameful snacks I've ever consumed in my

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.930
entire life

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.990
Big Horn it's gonna be a test for our

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:08.639
damage I think it's positive if we can

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.919
take out Big Horn quickly I'll be happy

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:12.840
we're only six minutes in so we're

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:14.130
already ahead of schedule and then if we

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.840
can beat this guy in under four minutes

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:18.750
it's gonna be even better we do still

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.219
have item room shop mob trap room etc

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.690
etc to go to here and what am I gonna

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:23.789
use the Emperor for well it's kind of

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.280
hope and I guess we don't have to do the

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:27.360
hush fight now that I think about it I

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.099
also just realized we didn't even give

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:34.199
ourselves a shot at fighting mega Satan

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:36.270
dude so be it though Bob's rotten head

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:38.280
in need of replacement hopefully yeah it

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:40.169
is a shop for us so we'll use a key

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:43.860
because keys are actually probably less

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:45.530
valuable than bombs pay-to-play will

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.849
probably pay for itself

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:50.880
the lovers won't because it's kind of

00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:52.139
garbage let's go put in as much money as

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.639
we can here while leaving ourselves with

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:57.479
enough money to also have a chance at an

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:59.069
arcade on the next floor we'll probably

00:07:57.479 --> 00:08:01.680
get more as time goes on but it broke

00:07:59.069 --> 00:08:05.310
anyway so like this is good for us just

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.870
keep it up here we will look for our

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.460
item room first you know because if we

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:10.530
can get damage upgrades we want to stack

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:12.719
those up ASAP just remember we're not

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:15.569
spending keys on anything anymore keys

00:08:12.719 --> 00:08:18.090
are actually like are they a completely

00:08:15.569 --> 00:08:20.279
useless item for us now to get a key

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:22.199
what do you use keys for no not

00:08:20.279 --> 00:08:23.510
completely useless we could use them on

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:25.130
a key beggar

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:28.990
we don't need them for golden chests for

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:31.250
now we don't need them for doors for now

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:32.919
yeah I think the only thing we can

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:36.530
really use them for is key beggars

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:38.300
that's a rare situation I don't know if

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:41.510
I've ever found myself in that situation

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:43.190
before we will pick up a key that's

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.910
actually for once like a really bad

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:46.850
trade

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:49.310
I do not care about I'm drowsy although

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:53.570
to be fair if we get access to delirium

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:58.340
I'm drowsy is 10 out of 10 but am I

00:08:53.570 --> 00:09:02.390
really gonna dedicate one full slot of

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:06.680
our entire loadout to just making the

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:08.660
delirium fight a little easier whenever

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.850
we've already done delirium not

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.380
necessary okay that's I'm glad I checked

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:14.240
because I was thinking about it to be

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.500
honest with you I was like maybe this

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.820
would be a good opportunity for us to

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:19.040
knock this out but since we've already

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:21.890
done it that'll be irrelevant guppy

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:25.100
guppy guppy no gub stirs I do want to

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:26.570
take the pills if we're gonna take the

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.220
pills we should probably save the

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:33.500
Emperor card cuz we're already done a

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:36.500
pod so is the point of the X lakhs pill

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.940
just that it's a joke just that it makes

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:41.090
you poop yourself and then you slip on

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:42.650
the poop cuz like I was watching to see

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.880
if it did any damage to enemies usually

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:45.440
I use pills at the end of a room and

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.840
there's no enemies around but that time

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:51.140
you know we had a chance and I was

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:53.780
reviewed so I won't be too excited about

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:56.240
using that pill in the future five bombs

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:58.730
do I care about a second secret room

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:02.420
yeah could make a deal with the devil a

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:04.100
little easier five pills could be good X

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.510
lakhs sucks I'm drowsy is great but

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:08.660
useless right now

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:10.430
puberty's fine I'm excited substantially

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:12.020
worse than I'm drowsy and we can't just

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:14.180
get rid of the effects by using an I'm

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:17.960
drowsy pill I think so we'll move on and

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:20.810
be upset by this we could always use the

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:22.550
emperor card right away but I'd rather

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:25.010
we could use it here we can get value

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:27.140
out of it here this is good and then we

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:31.400
emperor card and all of a sudden we got

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:34.490
spiders and flies oh me oh my yeah I

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:36.170
take no pleasure I know but just in

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.860
general I take no pleasure it's a bad

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.480
habit I

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:40.160
to take pleasure cuz it just said leads

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:43.460
to complacency now this is an

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:45.260
exaggeration of my character I take no

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.970
pleasure I think a lot of people tend to

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.020
overestimate themselves I'm not saying

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:50.180
it's a bad thing if it's good for

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:52.430
self-confidence and so be it

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:56.020
I think I take a very realistic view of

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:59.150
myself you know I I've got a lot of

00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:01.880
flaws I don't know it's it sounds like

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:04.190
when you say that it's like an admission

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.920
that you're a bad person no I actually

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:08.240
think I'm just stupid in a couple of

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.700
different ways that I'm not really

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:13.370
offended by calling myself I'm like a

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:15.470
computer and not even in a Dae you know

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:18.620
programming sort of way I noticed this

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:21.740
when when other people get instructions

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:22.970
from people if they're like hey can you

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:26.090
pick me up you know

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:29.810
juice from the store they run it through

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:32.390
like an internal interpreter you know

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:34.790
they go like okay well they said they

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:36.320
wanted juice to be picked up I know them

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.480
so I want you know I'll just pick them

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.860
up some apple juice and then this is the

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.970
kind of apple juice they like so I'll

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.760
get that I'm not like that

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:46.070
I make an effort to be like that but I'm

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:48.410
not like that instead my brain just

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:49.850
starts inundating them with aggravating

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:51.710
questions well what kind of juice do you

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:53.000
want you know what what brand is juice

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:54.640
do you want what size of juice do you

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.260
want other people just let it go

00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:02.270
me myself I take it almost like a

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:04.160
computerized set of instructions and

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:05.900
you're gonna say that that's you know on

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.880
the spectrum I wouldn't go that far

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.320
you know nothing of course meant to be

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.580
insulting to that degree but no I don't

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:14.810
think it's like that I think I'm just

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:16.610
I'm hyper literal or they more in my as

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:18.680
I've grown older I've become more hyper

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:20.750
literal an endless source of frustrate

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:24.020
of frustration for my wife like when

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:26.120
she's like can you get me that brain

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.860
does not understand what is that

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.820
sometimes I've got a wooden spoon I go

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.200
give it to her she's like what am I

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:32.450
gonna do with this like I don't know it

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.130
was the first object I saw so when you

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:36.800
said that I just figured we were on the

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:40.790
same page not always true Rick rarely

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:42.890
true I require specific instructions you

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:44.780
can probably notice that in the way that

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:48.050
I speak to other people as well like

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:49.520
when I I try to give people specific

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:49.910
instructions because that's what I want

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.180
you

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:54.740
I don't want people to say like I don't

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:57.110
want it to approach ridiculousness on it

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:58.550
use your legs to walk over to me and

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:00.350
like that just it comes across as

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:01.730
offensive but I'm you know if we're

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:03.380
talking about how to join a lobby I'm

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:05.030
like press shift tab open the steam

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:08.300
community friends list and then join on

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:10.220
me you know I don't just say hey join my

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:13.370
game I try to I try to give some useful

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:15.590
feedback but I think it leads to meet

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:17.900
caricature izing myself sometimes which

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:22.520
can also be funny dude sissy longlegs

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:26.230
I'm excited moreover terrible eyesight I

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:28.820
don't think I'm a good taster I don't I

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:30.320
don't think I hear that well I'm

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.940
wondering you know they say when one

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.950
sends dims and all the other senses grow

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:36.170
stronger I don't know what since I'm

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:39.380
missing here or what since I'm gaining

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:41.510
here I should say smell my sense of

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:43.900
smell is actually terrible I must be

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:46.220
like the greatest touch sure of all time

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:49.580
because I'm missing like a quarter of

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:52.040
every other scent since I should say but

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:54.950
it's kind of like I'm missing a quarter

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:58.340
of four cents it says it sort of makes

00:13:54.950 --> 00:14:00.530
sense this is there's like a monetary

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:04.360
related pun in there you see there we go

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:06.770
again within this ambiguity regardless I

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:09.860
think I take a realistic approach to

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:11.090
myself I think most people you contend

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.230
this is not to look down on anybody I

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.910
used to be like this as well you know

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:16.430
you get introduced to a new phenomenon

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:18.020
you know one in ten people has a gene

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:20.420
that gives them blah blah blah

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:22.010
resistance oh I have that I get look I

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:23.720
know it's a one in ten chance but I'm

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:26.660
pretty sure I've got it cuz there's a

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:28.820
kid one time I scratched myself on a you

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:30.460
know Rusty's fence post and I didn't get

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:33.710
sick so I'm pretty sure I got that gene

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:37.190
that's my impression at least but I

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:40.910
really do have that gene I've cut myself

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:42.560
on some rusty fence posts and I never

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:45.830
get a tetanus shot except that one time

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:47.990
I got bitten by a dog while I was riding

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:49.670
my bike and then the hospital was like

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:51.470
you gotta get a tetanus shot and I was

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:53.360
like alright whatever gives me out of

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:55.910
here so I can play all-star baseball 98

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.410
Larry Walker's hit 98 home runs this

00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:00.700
year I'm gunning for a hundred we're not

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:00.700
even at the all-star break yet

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:05.330
that was an accidental great segue I'm

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:07.279
gonna applaud myself for that cuz

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:10.459
there's another there's another topic to

00:15:07.279 --> 00:15:12.620
be had you guys at play sports video

00:15:10.459 --> 00:15:14.600
games I know a lot of people I know my

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.820
audience a lot of people gonna say yes

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.649
and I like that a lot of people are

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.839
gonna say no and that's fine too you

00:15:18.649 --> 00:15:22.519
know you like what you like but sports

00:15:20.839 --> 00:15:25.040
video games ever since they've started

00:15:22.519 --> 00:15:26.990
adding these like career modes the

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.089
biggest revolution the industry at least

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:34.519
that the smallest sector of the industry

00:15:29.089 --> 00:15:36.740
is gotten in like 10 years things have

00:15:34.519 --> 00:15:39.079
been real weird cuz like I played a ton

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:41.480
of NHL oh 9 this is almost 10 year old

00:15:39.079 --> 00:15:43.579
game at this point but you know you

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.740
sports games have a problem in that they

00:15:43.579 --> 00:15:47.420
try to like replicate a simulation esque

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.860
view of the sport most of the time yet

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:51.019
at the same time if you're better than

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.940
the computer you can end up you know in

00:15:51.019 --> 00:15:54.800
hockey for example you could end up a

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:56.420
scorer in like four goals a game as the

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.680
player you're controlling I don't know

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.060
how much hockey watching your life

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:02.690
that's not a very real it that's like

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:04.550
300 goals a season shatter the record by

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:06.649
like a factor of three or something like

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:09.680
that so you get this weird situation

00:16:06.649 --> 00:16:11.750
where like you play an NHL oh nine you'd

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:13.220
score like four goals but you wouldn't

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:14.570
back check that hard and your coach

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:17.600
would send you down to the minor leagues

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:19.370
it's like you know sending David Beckham

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.620
down to you know be with the under-16

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:24.470
crowd or something like that you know on

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.670
the in development camp maybe like we

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:28.940
really didn't like your hustle out there

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:31.610
my dude I've scored more points by

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:34.209
February than anybody else in the NHL

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:37.940
has ever scored in their career

00:16:34.209 --> 00:16:39.110
we're 44 and oh my dude maybe they've

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:42.170
gotten better about that it's been a

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:45.620
while admittedly I won't buy the the

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:49.160
modern sports games until they put more

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:52.420
of them on PC it's not even like a it's

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:54.170
not even making a stand it's not like a

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.730
philosophical issue where I'm like I

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:57.079
can't support those business practices

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:59.209
it's more just like I want to play him

00:16:57.079 --> 00:17:03.769
on PC and I think your reasons are

00:16:59.209 --> 00:17:06.130
stupid I don't want to go you know

00:17:03.769 --> 00:17:08.870
because the thing is about if I get NHL

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:10.459
17 or I guess it's 18 this year and I

00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:12.199
play it on the couch in the living room

00:17:10.459 --> 00:17:14.680
then my wife is gonna know how much NHL

00:17:12.199 --> 00:17:16.750
I play what I want to do is pretend

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:18.850
working and have plausible deniability

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:20.590
from playing NHL behind closed doors I

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:22.930
think that's the secret right there well

00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:27.070
we got a little baggie what a piece of

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:31.330
garbage that's that's actually 99% a

00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:32.890
joke I think sports games are in a good

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:34.840
place man apparently the NHL ones

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:36.070
recently not been that good always a

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.200
little bit of a falter when they hit a

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:39.490
new generation although generations like

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.640
four years old at this point

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:44.680
but MLB the show is like until divinity

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.900
probably my favorite RPG of this

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.580
generation including west of loathing I

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.290
think they they knocked it out of the

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:52.380
park I haven't played this years but I

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:54.790
mean the last time I played was 2014 but

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:56.620
that is just an RPG but I've already

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:59.410
gone off many many times on the tangent

00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:02.650
of like stop hating sports sports are

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:05.110
just you know Dungeons &amp; Dragons games

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:07.180
for jocks instead of nerds like there's

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:08.980
a the intersection between Johnson nerds

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:11.140
is way closer than I think most people

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:14.140
that would identify as either would tend

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:17.560
to believe tons of gamers love sports

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:19.210
dude it's it it's like footballs like

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.950
real-life Warhammer I don't really watch

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:22.960
much I want to I don't watch any

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:28.690
football really but it's like real life

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:31.750
Warhammer except occasionally you know

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:33.400
brain injuries but somebody's probably

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:35.020
been hit in the head over Warhammer

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:39.550
I wouldn't suppose it's an expensive

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:42.190
hobby well the devs - we might make boss

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:43.540
rush this is tough because if we get a

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:45.340
hive mind we'd probably rather have

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:47.400
Guppies head if we don't get hive mind

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:50.500
shoopdawhoop is gonna be like incredible

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:52.210
ship duel also is it almost has a

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:55.090
problem of being too good not too good

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:56.680
to use just just too good because it's

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:57.880
going to kill enemies and if we kill the

00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:00.730
enemies with ship - Lube

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:03.460
I don't think we get spiders out of them

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:07.720
never mind I am incorrect we totally get

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:10.150
spiders out of them so I think you know

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:12.580
a tears upgrade is on the docket for us

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:16.510
if we can get that I be over the moon if

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:17.770
we can't I would like to get HP that we

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:20.920
could trade to a deal with the devil I

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:22.990
think we might want to just do all that

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.010
was bad oh and another use for keys at

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.960
least although we have golden keys

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:26.980
regardless we might just want to do boss

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.080
rush

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:30.970
I'll do it look all we're trying to do

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:32.529
on this run is get the negative that's

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:34.389
like if we get the negative and make it

00:19:32.529 --> 00:19:35.859
to the land fight I'm a happy camper so

00:19:34.389 --> 00:19:39.279
I'm gonna re-roll this whole run because

00:19:35.859 --> 00:19:42.909
I think it'll be it's more fun to test

00:19:39.279 --> 00:19:44.200
that hey excuse me my cat no you know

00:19:42.909 --> 00:19:46.359
you get attention when you go under the

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:50.889
computer don't go under the computer

00:19:46.359 --> 00:19:52.600
get up here go on your box this box you

00:19:50.889 --> 00:19:54.929
can sleep in the box don't get out of

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:58.269
the box the box is for cats

00:19:54.929 --> 00:20:00.369
no transformations what are these shots

00:19:58.269 --> 00:20:03.159
these are shots I've never seen before

00:20:00.369 --> 00:20:05.980
weird eggs shots we're flying we got a

00:20:03.159 --> 00:20:07.299
hive mind we do not have taro cloth

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:09.519
which is what I was looking for there

00:20:07.299 --> 00:20:11.950
we're about to get some more HP bombs

00:20:09.519 --> 00:20:13.330
are normal so for good cards oh dude we

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:18.159
have cards again because we've lost a

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:20.559
little baggie okay that's that's well we

00:20:18.159 --> 00:20:22.359
also have an enormous Bob's brain

00:20:20.559 --> 00:20:28.090
I don't know these like the tears look

00:20:22.359 --> 00:20:37.989
pretty good they're like parasite shots

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:40.450
but eliptical like a NordicTrack Joker

00:20:37.989 --> 00:20:43.570
I'm gonna hold to so why not um they're

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:49.600
live this another new room I think they

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:51.489
are like ipecac shots that oh that's

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:53.769
that's really good there are a pickaxe

00:20:51.489 --> 00:20:59.590
shots but they don't explode at least

00:20:53.769 --> 00:21:01.029
they don't explode by Nature should

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:02.320
check the shop I would love to donate

00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:05.980
more but I don't think it's gonna be in

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:09.789
the cards there is a card though double

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:14.230
Joker sir other card the stars yeah why

00:21:09.789 --> 00:21:16.059
not right red candle useless because our

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:18.359
damage is so good but otherwise probably

00:21:16.059 --> 00:21:18.359
pretty good

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:25.230
technically it's probably shrewder to go

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:27.430
with the oh right behind mine um

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:31.240
technically it's probably shrewder to go

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:32.950
with the Stars card because we can use

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.990
that to teleport out then grab both of

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:39.790
our Joker cards we have a holy mantle as

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:41.470
well if leprosy an item that I don't

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:43.330
think is that good necessarily but it's

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:46.090
a lot of fun and we'll keep taking these

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:49.090
just in case one day there's a value to

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:54.670
it so watch out it's like hi mine is the

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:56.770
only thing we can screw you here- please

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:59.200
thank you you've already fought Krampus

00:21:56.770 --> 00:22:01.540
we could fight him again I think a theme

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:05.130
is okay Judas a shadow we don't want to

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:07.240
use but it's not necessarily terrible

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:08.880
and we got curse of the blind so we

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:12.460
don't know what we're gonna get here

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:16.060
ecoli it's okay so we're gonna bounce

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:17.500
out remember mega satan negative so we

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:19.950
want to go to Sheol thats the important

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:22.330
part to want to go to Sheol

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:28.710
I'm gonna Joker it up right here right

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:32.470
off the bed why take brother Bobby

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:33.610
essentially inertia the idea that it

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:36.700
would have been the right thing to do if

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:38.770
we had taken the polaroid also factors

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.150
in you know why break habit basically

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:42.750
I'm gonna be a little lazy about

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:45.190
consumables as I take pleasure in

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:49.420
productive laziness from time to time as

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:51.210
I'm gonna call it you know I think

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:55.380
there's a certain rest and relaxation

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:58.600
element I'm not saying you should ever

00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:01.930
half-ass anything you know I'm a firm

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:04.030
believer when I do something it's it's

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:05.970
been a long time since I've handed in at

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:09.250
least let's say a piece of school work

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:11.730
that I was not proud as kind of a strong

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:14.290
word but that was not like content with

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:15.550
when I was younger occasionally you know

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:16.840
you're like I worked on this for like an

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:18.850
hour couldn't figure it out it's only

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.650
worth 5% of my grade who cares now I'm

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:23.770
like I don't care if it's worth 1

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:25.180
percent of my grade I I take pride in a

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:28.170
job done right it's an attitude I'm

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:33.100
trying to cultivate as I get older here

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:34.420
that being said I can't I guess I in the

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.590
end I kind of screwed myself cuz I don't

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:37.810
really have much of a defense to offer

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:41.170
for my occasionally willfully lazy Isaac

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:43.270
play except for the fact that you know

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:44.740
maybe you can be lazy about the things

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:46.480
that have no effect on your grade

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:49.090
whatsoever like getting your fortieth

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:52.710
key on a run where there's not gonna be

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:52.710
40 lakhs let's put it that way

00:23:53.160 --> 00:24:00.570
ruin bag well worth it another reason I

00:23:56.650 --> 00:24:04.920
am quite happy we managed to get rid of

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:07.270
little baggie which is basically trash

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:10.960
so is that unfortunately that's the

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:12.580
fourth or the third and fourth golden

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:16.390
key we've gotten over the course of this

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:19.810
run your boy is over the golden key

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:23.380
situation algae's though he's quite

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:26.260
happy with only things I'd love to see

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:27.910
now like it on a I need to have this

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:31.330
sort of level and I don't even need to

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:32.680
have it but I would love to see immunity

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:35.140
two explosions and honestly I think

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:42.010
infamy does give you that option so I

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:45.750
think host had obviously and pyromaniac

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:45.750
of core pyromaniacs the big one but

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:52.990
we'll just keep moving for now we're

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:54.850
looking for guppy items and when we're

00:24:52.990 --> 00:25:00.520
not getting them we're moving on

00:24:54.850 --> 00:25:02.230
I always forget what that is because it

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:04.240
looks like the goz but I don't think

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:09.760
that was the gaas I don't I can't tell

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:12.070
if I gained HP off of it so the other

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:17.670
play for us is mega Satan I don't think

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:20.350
we're getting it you got to get a a

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:22.450
dad's key payout at this point or are

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:26.200
you like technically you could find an

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:27.610
angel room you could play the self

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.930
sacrifice room and make it happen

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:32.320
obviously we don't have the HP for that

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:37.750
just yet but in theory the potentiality

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:41.100
exists and then beyond that the other

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:41.100
option would be

00:25:41.659 --> 00:25:46.230
if we can I'm trying to think about how

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:48.809
we get an angel step we if we get like

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:51.840
purity or duality is the one yeah we get

00:25:48.809 --> 00:25:53.190
duality go into the angel room there's

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.330
two angel statues in there cuz

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:56.100
apparently one of the things the new

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:58.230
booster pack does is actually make it so

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:59.909
that every angel statue gives you a key

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:01.409
piece if you don't have one already so

00:25:59.909 --> 00:26:04.710
you can actually get two key pieces from

00:26:01.409 --> 00:26:07.649
the same room I'd rather keep algae's

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:08.909
just to keep ourselves going here uh so

00:26:07.649 --> 00:26:11.340
you can probably guess from my tone of

00:26:08.909 --> 00:26:14.429
voice that not necessarily thinking it's

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:16.950
too likely that we're gonna get the

00:26:14.429 --> 00:26:22.200
angel statue here and that's fine Nega

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:24.299
satan is always it's finicky but I'm

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:27.090
learning to relish you know the time

00:26:24.299 --> 00:26:28.590
that we have without having absolutely

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:31.230
everything unlocked and it's a pleasure

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:33.269
to have some sort of extrinsic goal cuz

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:35.519
you know eventually sooner than you

00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:38.700
might think we're probably gonna hit a

00:26:35.519 --> 00:26:41.970
point in which we've got everything done

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:43.139
and Isaac again probably not you know

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:44.519
within the next three months or

00:26:43.139 --> 00:26:45.830
something but you know with before the

00:26:44.519 --> 00:26:51.840
next year is out

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:53.580
without a doubt and a year honestly it's

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:55.769
one of the few YouTube series I think

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:59.129
with one of the lower percentage at

00:26:55.769 --> 00:27:01.350
least YouTube series where like you know

00:26:59.129 --> 00:27:04.619
it's not really that much of a time

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:06.899
investment a year of one Isaac a day is

00:27:04.619 --> 00:27:11.909
like 5% of the Isaac that we've ever

00:27:06.899 --> 00:27:14.419
done so I think we'll take Joker and

00:27:11.909 --> 00:27:14.419
Yara

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:21.019
we have algae's Yara Joker Yara okay

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:27.730
so I'm taking a very you know copacetic

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.770
view to it might be a good way to

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:31.540
describe it I'm like it takes as long as

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:34.030
it takes maybe we don't get mega satan

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:35.710
done than this one but you know at some

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:37.810
point in the future it's unavoidable it

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:50.740
will happen and as a result i remain

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:52.090
unconcerned please I am very surprised

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:53.860
you can get hit dude we get to keep our

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:57.550
Joker card so I'm happy about that the

00:27:53.860 --> 00:28:10.380
items suck so we'll go Scholl very

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:12.460
important then Joker razor blade I'm so

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:14.560
shell-shocked by the existence of this

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:16.270
item that does nothing for us right now

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:18.790
that I'm not even gonna make the Jay

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:21.010
Leno joke that people think I invented

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:23.800
but was actually completely co-opted

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:24.220
from a Frank Caliendo bit like 11 years

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.440
ago

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:31.180
what are these enemies they when they

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:35.980
die they do anti birth stuff algae's and

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:37.780
Yara we don't need a triple-a battery it

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:40.900
does nothing for us cuz our shots are

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:46.000
better than red candle well still use

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:50.110
red candle on occasion but there's some

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.890
irrelevance II uh I mean I why not get

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:54.760
HP that's a good way to describe it

00:28:52.890 --> 00:29:00.490
whatever we get from this we can also

00:28:54.760 --> 00:29:02.260
reroll do we want to maybe dude let's

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:06.370
see what we can get yeah like that's way

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:09.130
better not really eager to play a demon

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:12.810
judgement with 0 HP also stop shooting

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:12.810
cuz fire mind is gonna make you pay

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:19.480
start looking for tinted rocks my man

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:20.830
you are you're getting low on HP for

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:25.060
somebody who wants to do like another

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:26.770
floors worth of goodness we haven't

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:27.910
taken very much damage since the reroll

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:29.950
and dude I haven't even talked about

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:32.440
like the reroll prospects I thought it

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:33.730
was pretty good obviously our run is

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.280
worse now than it was

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:40.600
we had you know good damage not so great

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:42.840
rate of fire but good damage and EE era

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:46.830
why not

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:49.330
triple era that's ridiculous

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:54.510
it's not quite as good as our previous

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:57.600
run but its new and newness is super

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:59.680
goodness you know what I mean

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:03.250
probably not it's an inherently

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:05.140
meaningless expression I don't know if I

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:11.820
believe in the guppy dream anymore

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:13.120
and moreover if we get one guppy item on

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:15.460
pardon me

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:21.760
if we get one guppy item on the lamb

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:23.200
floor we'll get like four guppy items on

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:29.860
the lamb floor because of our double

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:33.510
Yara I think that math checks out one

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:33.510
becomes two two becomes four yeah

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:43.810
see you can tell this guy's still in

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:47.110
school to ^ 0 2 to the palate and zero

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:49.600
doublings gives us 1 1 doubling gives us

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:51.460
2 to doublings gives us 4 of course you

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.050
could just you know you don't know you

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:54.490
know to get those that exponent key

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:55.930
involved in there I was just trying to

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:57.820
think of the method the pattern that

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:59.890
made it more plausible why are we

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:03.700
creating troll bombs is that bomb bag

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:13.650
making me an upset boy every time I look

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:13.650
around every time I look around okay so

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:22.630
what what am i hitting myself with all

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:30.520
so I'm almost certainly going to become

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:31.630
dark Judas let's try not to but I have

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.860
I've created a strange situation

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:36.610
actually don't get down on yourself

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:39.430
because if we're able to beat Magus or

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:42.130
regular Satan we will probably get at

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:44.260
least some spirit hearts due to our

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:46.600
aggressive doubling on the next floor so

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:50.100
I would try not to lay yourself you know

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:52.690
feel the burn too much just yet at least

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:58.020
so you know what first things first blow

00:31:52.690 --> 00:32:02.520
this up then the era then the era okay

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:05.260
look at the cards temperance the moon

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:07.990
Wheel of Fortune Wheel of Fortune is

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:10.680
very good see those are all gonna be

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:10.680
bombs so

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:23.950
we don't need moon cards no that's too

00:32:19.419 --> 00:32:32.140
many bombs dude spirit arts we in this

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:33.190
please do not blow me up one spirit are

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:34.720
in every single one of those little

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:35.290
annoying but hey magic mush that's

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:39.490
really good

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:40.840
also give us the fungi transformation we

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:43.150
should probably blow all these up at the

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:45.570
same time but we also have infinity

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:48.850
bombs we should probably also play them

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:51.750
that one a got less of a you know catchy

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:54.549
come back for all right

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:57.280
we found our secret room and we got

00:32:54.549 --> 00:33:02.320
Polyphemus inside of it so who's

00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:07.540
laughing now I'm laughing now okay I'm

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:13.330
no longer laughing at all that being

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:19.809
said this is 35 damage I would describe

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:24.580
that as a lot so a was can't remember

00:33:19.809 --> 00:33:29.770
what the M is rate of fire is just like

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:31.419
destroyed please don't explode still you

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:34.630
got to think of this as a pretty huge

00:33:31.419 --> 00:33:37.270
positive we should have no chance to

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:39.100
like ruin this run I can't believe the

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:42.360
secret room only touched one room by the

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:42.360
way you almost never see that

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:53.090
excuse me I'm a little scared

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:54.950
I mean I shouldn't be because there's a

00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:56.240
decent chance I mean if we have to come

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:58.220
back as dark Judas we have to come back

00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:01.670
and start to decide like it it is what

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:03.140
it is I'd prefer not to because we got a

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:13.909
chance to knock something out with Kane

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:17.600
here but we should have a pretty easy go

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:19.629
of it regardless we embark on oh these

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:22.550
guys are gonna be outrageous

00:34:19.629 --> 00:34:23.960
Aquarius not really that good not as

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:26.330
tempted as you might think to pop open

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.860
that other item by the way I guess we've

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:29.690
you know consider yourself lucky we got

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:31.820
those red hearts not only are they

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:38.149
what's keeping us alive right now but we

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:41.710
can actually replenish them it's the

00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:45.200
strangest looking floor I've ever seen

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:46.790
well no we've seen some weird ones like

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.860
late-game floors where the boss room is

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:53.720
adjacent to your spawn room not adjacent

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:58.730
but like one room away still it's a

00:34:53.720 --> 00:35:02.210
strange room kind of like a Bob and Doug

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:11.930
McKenzie film uh black hole actually

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:15.920
good for Cano roon actually good what

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:18.020
are we gonna do with this well we're

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:19.940
gonna throw it down on the ground and it

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:21.260
will probably kill every enemy it comes

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.580
in contact with actually it seems to

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:23.450
synergize pretty well with our weird egg

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:27.910
tears as well

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:27.910
scatter bombs in the beam not worth much

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:35.630
please I really like this is like a

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:39.320
super do as I say not as I do moment

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:42.110
should have gone back but I didn't pair

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:45.050
throws not worth too much I need it to

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:48.040
not be blanket I should go back you

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:51.910
can't deny though as a certain little

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:51.910
tensions you know say quoi

00:35:52.569 --> 00:35:58.220
almost like it's like punishment for me

00:35:55.809 --> 00:35:59.660
to force myself to do things the

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:06.319
difficult way here and look at that it

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:09.109
turns out it's not that difficult well

00:36:06.319 --> 00:36:11.990
that's an incredibly useful defense to

00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:13.280
that attack I just don't want to get

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:18.050
close because I worry the homing shots

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:20.480
will still kind of go in on me seems

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:25.880
like we've probably got a win more or

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:26.089
less sewn up here or like a win more or

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:34.250
less

00:36:26.089 --> 00:36:38.450
sho'nuff no not today at a later date

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:40.880
perhaps good we unlocked Abel that's a

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:42.319
lot of nothing for a decently difficult
