00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.179
hey everybody welcome Exeter in the lamp

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.400
is mine anybody and robots are doing a

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.319
daily today and honestly we were just

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:13.139
lucky to live on yesterday daily so I'm

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:16.460
not really gonna sweat the scoring you

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.350
know what I will score I will score a

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.150
volleyball game if you know volunteers

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.859
are required to work those little flippy

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.600
scoreboards I've done that before my

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.039
life I understand the scoring system I

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.369
will score the skin of a salmon before I

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.930
pan fry it I allowed the very famous

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.250
Gordon Ramsay recipe on YouTube but I'm

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.290
not going to worry about yesterday's

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.180
score what we do have here is a

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.620
ridiculously strong run and I figured

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.879
that because just before doing the daily

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.969
I went to check out greed but just to

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.680
see where it ended up today wonderful

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.719
Gophers second secret room there may be

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.300
but um and I saw it was like okay it's

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.500
Azazel and it goes to I guess it goes to

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.120
show I just

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.719
whenever I see a cross I'm like okay

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.020
that goes to delirium effectively as

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.490
long as we play our cards right I think

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.229
I'll save our bomb for the next floor

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.150
and the top score today is something

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.450
like 63,000 you can get top 10 with

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.869
50,000 you can get a 50,000 point score

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:23.100
on a daily that you know is as asel

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:26.820
infestation to just by basically never

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.600
taking damage so technology burned me

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.450
last time however I think that it

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.030
doesn't necessarily have to burn me this

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.509
time I thought the technology combined

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:43.229
with any form of brimstone is actually a

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.820
good combination I don't believe it

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.170
screws you I think it just gives you a

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.579
damage upgrade right big damage upgrade

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.770
and of course the sweet laser beam

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.189
around your uh your brimstone tears okay

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.740
so that was in contrast to yesterday's

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.210
daily wear some weird combination of

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.130
technology and chocolate milk kind of

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.740
left us in the lurch this one is feeling

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:10.830
a lot better I think that this is going

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.970
to be it is probably better to do the SU

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.630
we get with our deal with the devil

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.830
first but it is probably been

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:21.670
in my estimation to do the boss trap

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:24.250
room instead so this Rodney is just like

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.890
absurd its popping off ridiculously

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.110
right off the cut we could get that

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:35.200
obviously we're hoping to get a bunch of

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:36.520
keys out of our out of our boss trap

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.990
room but I don't know let's see how that

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.360
goes I do still think it's the right

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.920
call and we got basically nothing but

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.180
you know maybe if you pick another chest

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.270
there things go differently

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.100
that being said I'm not at all oh I mean

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.080
that was bad but I'm not at all

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.090
concerned with today's daily it's

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.600
already exceptionally strong like

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.190
unbelievably strong number two and a

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.240
half minutes in we got seven damaged

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.590
well they actually we got like nine

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.620
damaged now right thanks to growth or

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.600
twelve damaged effectively a little

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.810
light on consumables but you know

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:15.730
ignoring this we're in an amazing spot I

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:17.920
am going to fool card and my reasoning

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.680
for that is quite simple we know we're

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.360
not going to want a fool card out of

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.000
boss rush you got to take blank card you

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.620
know we're already generating enough

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.210
spiders we probably don't need flies now

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.900
if I that blank card fool I would have

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:34.720
been a happier camper okay NL this is me

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.450
talking to myself in character range

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.790
upgrade is always nice slow your roll

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.870
it's not that you're going too fast you

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.000
know some of the damage that you've

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.520
taken when you take damage from an enemy

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.320
that shoots bullets upon death as azazel

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:53.310
I sort of get it you know you've got

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:55.570
this beam that's blocking the obvious

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:00.010
ability to track where shops are coming

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:01.630
from quickly however we shouldn't be

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.000
taking this damage getting hit a couple

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.560
of times certainly far from the kiss of

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.200
death when it comes to ranking well

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.610
getting hit you know a couple of times

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.540
per floor now we started to put

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.670
ourselves in a bad spot everybody it's

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.200
essentially unavoidable that everybody

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.520
is going to have a pretty good chance to

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.890
rank well today I mean look at the

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.790
timing and the the stats that we got

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.229
going on on today's run already

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.360
it's a bit of a weird call there I'll do

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:31.750
the luck upgrade is so good because IV

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:36.010
bag is actually also potentially pretty

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.690
useful for example we can get into the

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.490
curse room without taking red heart

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.960
damage but I don't think it's the right

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:47.800
call for us I think we'll try the card

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.960
blank card tower that's really bad we'd

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.160
really like to get one extra penny but I

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.500
don't think it's going to happen

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.750
although the secret room is in a very

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.060
obvious location probably out with

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.860
disregard okay the secret room is in a

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.030
very obvious location probably right

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.570
here so I'm gonna do something really

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.580
quick and just get rid of these fires in

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.720
the hopes that I can keep myself alive

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:13.000
and we're going to hope to find the

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:18.160
secret room here I still think it was

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.479
worth a try anyway let's get going we

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.220
didn't play the demon judgment but

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.479
that's it today we've got nothing to

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:27.190
worry about when it comes to making sure

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:29.740
that the run goes where it needs to go

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.440
you know it is going to make it to

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.910
delirium the one exception that or the

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:39.340
thing that's worth worrying about is

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:42.100
that Basara shouldn't be too bad but the

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.440
hush fight can be really annoying with

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.630
no range and the Delirium fight

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.830
obviously can be super annoying with no

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.360
range but I'm not going to worry about

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.550
that it's like 10 floors away which at

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.110
the present pace means it could be 45

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.940
seconds before we get to the Delirium

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:59.260
fight so we got plenty of time with

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:01.870
which to with which to increase our

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:06.460
defensive capabilities of this battle

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:07.750
station dae and may the fourth it's not

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.979
made of four that I'm recording this I

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.310
don't want you to think our backlog is

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:18.039
like ridiculous here so a Waze is great

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:22.030
and temperance is also great it was a

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:24.310
very nice amount of HP there or sorry

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:27.850
amount of money there I should say okay

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.650
and that as well I guess if we're going

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:32.500
to use temperance we should really throw

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:35.240
down both temperance cards

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:50.660
because we do have we know what this one

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:54.230
is tower right yeah hear me out here it

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:58.130
worked I don't want to spend too much

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:59.750
time on this but only got to that's okay

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.710
we know we got at least one more play

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.410
before we either we're I think we have

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.260
two more plays oh okay

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.360
watch that a little bit you see my

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:11.120
master plan quote-unquote though anyway

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.190
and my goal there is to not take damage

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.150
going out of the curse room obviously on

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:20.600
the way and we're not going to take

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:22.760
damage but be a really nice floor to not

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.680
have curse of the unknown we got so much

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.450
money like I'm not going to worry about

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.180
Beelzebub I'm really going for broke

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:31.900
here dog tooth is I'll tell you what on

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:38.540
a daily I think dog tooth is just fine

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:39.650
liberty cap as well but we're way ahead

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.320
of schedule I'm just trying to think

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.930
what do I want to do here why want to if

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:47.570
possible getting more HP would be nice

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:54.200
if only to help us play blood bags more

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:56.270
effectively PhD does give us full HP and

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.060
a range upgrade is very useful as a say

00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:07.940
zl-- blank card a waz is not necessary

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:09.170
but it's certainly not bad if we can

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:14.480
only get to plays we can only get to

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:16.130
plays that's fine and we're cares if

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.480
we're a little slow as long as we're

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.160
still ahead of the schedule for boss

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:23.860
rush I don't know why we're getting so

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.860
much money out of those but I am in

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:28.170
two spirit hearts valuable okay so we

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.160
are going to take damage on the way out

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:33.720
actually absolutely fine do we want to

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.190
buy the card in here what kind of card

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.690
would we be looking for to make this I

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.940
like that you're a font would be swell

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:40.590
the Hermit is not what we're looking for

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:45.360
I'd rather have a was you know what

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:47.280
we've got so much money I think it's is

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.230
sensible consumables are worth a lot

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.420
that's a secret room as well the secret

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:54.750
room access there but we bought one read

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:57.630
hearts of there we go

00:08:54.750 --> 00:09:03.600
now we've got at least three plays here

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:06.000
and we're going to say at most three

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:10.890
plays even though I'm probably under

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.270
rating our security no we got to have at

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.950
least one more plus we just got a bunch

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:17.280
of spirit arts it's not plausible for

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:18.600
this to go terribly wrong at the present

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.510
moment at least okay so now we're going

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.830
to go if we lost a half a spirit heart

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:27.090
or even a full spirit out there who

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:28.380
cares so we're as well from the shop

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:30.600
there's one pill in here something's

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:34.980
wrong not a great one all right now I'm

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:37.410
going to go we really did our part on

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:39.360
that floor to make sure that things were

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:42.870
working out well for us that might give

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:45.390
us a leg up on the competition here keep

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:47.730
in mind this is caves - so there still

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.440
could be a real arcade as well unlikely

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:56.070
I'd say of this this time on the floor

00:09:49.440 --> 00:10:01.920
but no secret room come on dog tooth I

00:09:56.070 --> 00:10:07.320
know you got me here no dog - I'm going

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:11.020
to try to get something nothing

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:14.220
secret room here Wow

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:17.110
dog tooth he almost tricked me there

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:21.520
never do that again you had me so

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:22.660
worried totally forgot we had placenta

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.430
as well either way we're getting

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:27.310
probably a deal with the devil working

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:30.910
towards Duffy hopefully damage plus

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:33.700
rains we're up to 14 damage we don't

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:37.920
actually want Judas a shadow we

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:40.360
definitely want contract from below so

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.610
straight up we should just be using a

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:45.070
waz more often we didn't use it much

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:47.320
there I don't know I guess my reasoning

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:48.790
largely came down to we wanted to use as

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:53.280
many temperance cards as possible and

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:56.050
then we had other things to focus on but

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:58.270
dude I don't know maybe instead of blank

00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:01.510
card a wazoo on blank card temperance as

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:05.470
long as we have red hearts it's a lot of

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:08.940
coin no I said it as if I was in Game of

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:12.730
Thrones or something but a lot of coin

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:15.660
but then beyond that I guess we don't

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:17.760
really care about getting blood bags

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.690
past a certain point

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:24.550
not that it would be the worst thing in

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:28.780
the world but but even if we don't care

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:36.100
about getting blood bags this allows us

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:37.510
to be very spending I think we should

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.740
still go I mean we're so far ahead of

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:41.800
schedule we got to be out of this floor

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:43.300
by 16 minutes in my opinion like run

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.340
begged epsilon C F we're out of here by

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:47.080
16 minutes I think we're good we should

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.700
really like if we can get restock or

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.800
something like that is that where we pop

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:54.040
off on today's run is that where we

00:11:50.800 --> 00:12:00.390
finally you know take our our place in

00:11:54.040 --> 00:12:04.120
the afterbirth Plus daily Pantheon I

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:06.970
don't want to get your hopes up but

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:10.920
despite a little bit of bad damage I

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:15.870
would not be surprised if we could

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.870
qualify for like a top 15 finish today

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:22.030
I'm not suggesting that's 100%

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.870
temperance and I'm certainly not

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:29.290
suggesting it 100 percent personal skill

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:31.420
I'm just saying that as of right now I'm

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:33.850
looking at our score and I'm liking

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:35.500
where we're at there's no way we're too

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:39.460
slow for boss rush and our damage on

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:43.540
boss rush should be very good because

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:46.510
there is a secret room somewhere here if

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:48.730
our damage on boss rush is good that

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:53.440
means we will not which one you think

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:54.910
has a secret room it is this one okay if

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.410
our damage on boss rush is good that

00:12:54.910 --> 00:13:01.000
should mean there's no way for us to not

00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:02.830
go to the hush fight I am then this is

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.100
the luxury position we find ourselves in

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:08.140
I am a hoping to get IV bag so that I

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.730
can easily get out of the curse room

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:12.190
without taking one hit on a damage

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:17.800
penalty so might be getting to the point

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:25.560
where that's pretty irrelevant that's

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:25.560
okay got to use money here no no no

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:32.470
decent but we already sort of got okay

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:37.390
the relic it was probably the best item

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:40.030
out of all the items they're trying not

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:46.300
to waste money by you know needlessly

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:48.580
picking it up but don't think it's super

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:53.110
relevant when effectively we probably

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:56.520
have nearly unlimited of it right now it

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:58.420
really feels like the culmination of a

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.350
while we're going to go to our cursor

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.390
I'm just give me a second here this

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:03.520
field is a culmination of like the last

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:05.110
few dailies where things have sort of

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.000
been botched I'm not on all of them but

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:09.550
certainly on yesterday's daily today's

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.110
daily is like you know you get blown out

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.880
in week 14 and then you come out in the

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:15.310
final week of the NFL season and you say

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.550
Peyton Manning I'm going to put you in a

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:19.290
four-finger headlock I don't

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:21.660
mixed metaphors but you get the idea

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:23.720
sure we'll take latchkey for some extra

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.620
luck and some extra keys

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:30.000
you shouldn't have twelve thousand

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:31.110
points on the depths one that's too many

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.060
points you're not supposed to have

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:35.060
twelve thousand points at this point I

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:45.510
guess with placenta how would you like

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:52.190
your burrito bowl sir with placenta

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:56.370
please I guess with placenta we are

00:14:52.190 --> 00:15:00.860
trying to get as many HP upgrades as we

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:03.060
can like as many blood bags as we can as

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:04.380
long as we're guaranteeing ourselves

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:07.380
deals with the devil basically

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:10.200
regardless of the fact okay I mean like

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:12.900
I just want one IV bag I shouldn't

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:17.220
really complain but I just want one IV

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:20.160
bag I don't know we might be starting to

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:23.070
lose points as a result of this and I

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:34.830
don't necessarily believe that that's

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:36.330
the case well we tried okay I could use

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:37.740
like a hero font card maybe temperance

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.450
is overstated welcome at this point we

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:42.270
got like 5 HP upgrades out of a blank

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:43.680
card death blank card of Herman no out

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:47.580
of all these I think we'll stick with

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:50.760
temperance and we'll head down to the

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:53.160
next floor this is often how many points

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:59.370
I have by the time I make it into boss

00:15:53.160 --> 00:16:01.800
rush so I think that this is a pretty

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:08.520
good situation to be in like we're ahead

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:12.390
by far of where I normally am we also

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:16.560
have not taken oh don't make me reroll

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:18.390
again you wouldn't oh this is goofy it's

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:23.520
destined I've seen it written in the tea

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:25.470
leaves we're almost there still very

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:28.050
good something's wrong lockup is great

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:30.510
range up is also amazing as Azazel and

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:31.300
another lockup take off his tail we're

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.830
killing it

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.180
you so I'm not sweating that we got lots

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:41.230
of spirit outs back there if we ever

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:43.420
need you ever need them I mean again

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:46.480
it's kind of like really should use

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:48.730
blank cards temperance not really a good

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:51.940
reason not to just everything's coming

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:55.450
together here there's probably a good

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:59.740
reason not to take chaos yet but I don't

00:16:55.450 --> 00:17:03.339
care is the thing so blank okay

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:05.170
I mean blank cards son is also really

00:17:03.339 --> 00:17:07.120
good so if we're going to do is pop down

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:11.020
temperance and then we're going to stick

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:14.620
with blank cards son because as useful

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:17.110
as temperance can be and it might this

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:18.790
might cost me like the extra a few

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:22.900
thousand points you could eke out on

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:25.300
like a really really tight daily but the

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:28.990
ability to get full health as desired

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:33.880
and also mapping as desired seems really

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:36.040
useful so there is a secret room here do

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:39.630
dogtooth has really helped us the

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:42.580
occasional holy mantle it's not bad

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:45.880
dogtooth has really helped us make the

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:49.120
most of our meager bombs like I'm very

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:52.480
thankful that I wised up this run is all

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:59.590
about like Redemption and we don't need

00:17:52.480 --> 00:18:04.510
it is the thing oh ok so we'll take

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:06.340
guppy and that makes us copy and don't

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:08.460
think we need ah we do have that

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:11.650
contributes to spun so let's take it I

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:13.690
think we've made and I you know I always

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:15.760
I tend to be modest and this is going to

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:18.460
strike you as hilarious but I tend to be

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:19.929
a modest person and so I'm always saying

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:21.190
I'm probably the most modest person I

00:18:19.929 --> 00:18:23.169
know I'm always saying I don't want it

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:25.929
to my own horn it's true you know I'm

00:18:23.169 --> 00:18:27.669
uncomfortable with praise unless I feel

00:18:25.929 --> 00:18:30.700
like that praise is highly deserved and

00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:33.040
in a way not that it was hard but I feel

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:35.500
like today's daily is worthy of praise

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:37.960
if only because the perfect storm of me

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:40.120
apparently being right unlike almost

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:43.630
then we don't need that sadly it's a fun

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:44.600
trinket of me being right on almost all

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:47.630
of these decision

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:51.290
and like re-roll machines and etc etc

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:52.640
has completely worked out again I'm not

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:55.640
saying I don't think I'm the only one I

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:59.480
didn't you know figure out cold fusion

00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:02.480
here or something like that but I think

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:05.150
that it's we're remarkably well-equipped

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:06.860
shall we say we need to I mean with

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:10.670
contract from below we really need to

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:14.360
keep keys coming our luck stat is 4

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:16.630
that's very high so I would be expecting

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:18.890
that be able to take advantage of that

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:20.540
so what's the game plan what's the road

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:23.720
map for this run look like right now

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:27.830
it's very very simple we kill mom

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:31.850
probably in a single shot we take the

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:34.610
polaroid because it's better we don't

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:39.470
take more options because it's

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:40.970
irrelevant then man I would like to take

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:44.510
none of these but I'll tell you what

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:46.970
here's the thing Plan C might have been

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:49.250
the right choice because it has no

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:53.950
negative effect unless we choose to use

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:57.400
it which we never would have whereas oh

00:19:53.950 --> 00:20:00.080
we add holy mantle thank God whereas

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.940
obviously curse of the tower could have

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:04.040
a negative effect my brain is hardwired

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:06.170
to look for things in Isaac like it it

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:10.100
prioritizes passives over actives we're

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:11.240
never going to use so for better or for

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.250
worse we're stuck with curse of the

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:14.540
tower now probably you'd expect that to

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:17.720
contribute to a little bit of damage

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:20.480
over the course of this run and you know

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:23.270
fair fair play basically but anyway

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:28.030
after this we're going to the womb where

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:28.030
we will explore every single room and

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:33.700
should be able to do so easily thanks to

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:33.700
the Sun card

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.480
at which point we'll be going to the

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:41.880
hush fight which is going to be tough

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:43.470
our damage toughie Sh our damage is

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:50.730
going to be fine and we have no chance

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:52.710
to die but our range is pretty bad then

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:54.420
it's all the way to the Delirium floor

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:55.950
which is really like the Delirium floor

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:59.100
is where things get sort of exhausting

00:20:55.950 --> 00:21:01.170
but just an enormous floor and I'm still

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:04.560
I'm always bummed that like the Delirium

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:06.930
floor doesn't give you any items outside

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:09.390
of boss rooms it just makes that floor

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:12.390
feel like on daily as you're doing it

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:15.210
just for the points could be worse of

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:18.840
course but we're going to be out of boss

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:21.390
rush probably before 20 minutes it's a

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:24.420
very good sign we have taken a couple of

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:27.330
hits that I'm not thrilled with but we

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:30.000
were still a living being oh wow okay we

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:34.310
don't want it but it's a nice gesture I

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:37.680
suppose we'll get the heck out of here

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:39.480
so this is maybe in arguably like the

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:42.870
strongest daily that I've ever had on a

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:44.580
daily we absolutely have to do every

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:48.540
room we have to go back to that room and

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:50.940
do it I'm not going to worry about any

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:53.280
sort of min maxing and but I'm excited

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:54.840
as a good pill now I'm going to worry

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.430
about any sort of min maxing involving

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:59.640
like trying to maximize deals with the

00:21:56.430 --> 00:22:03.600
devil at this point we have more than

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:05.550
everything you know the I don't see many

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.990
conceivable ways to improve the quality

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:12.680
of this run outside of getting like

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:15.510
literal brimstone uh it's tough actually

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:18.420
having blind rage could protect us from

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:20.690
curses and power damage but as we saw

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.710
the wooden cross can protect us from

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:25.460
curse of the tower damage as well

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:27.300
withholding mantle so I guess I'd rather

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:29.550
it's really a question of like

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:33.630
guaranteed damage versus stopping damage

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:36.470
of the source so I think it's irrelevant

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:39.960
but it's nice or relatively irrelevant

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:41.730
it's nice to have the luxury to worry

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.510
about stuff that like could not matter

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:46.570
less

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:50.289
gotta start using that curse rooms full

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:52.510
secret room of course curse rooms we

00:22:50.289 --> 00:22:54.130
don't need to become Guffey there's

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:55.720
definitely a case to be made that curse

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:57.429
rooms are not the right play right now

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.710
but I'm probably going to do in

00:22:57.429 --> 00:23:03.389
regardless we have chaos you never know

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:06.250
what we're going to get in the form of a

00:23:03.389 --> 00:23:09.880
red chest or a golden chest in there or

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:12.429
I still don't understand that pill is

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:18.279
that pill really just uh nipa cock shot

00:23:12.429 --> 00:23:20.200
oh dude I'm so glad I came in here the

00:23:18.279 --> 00:23:22.750
range upgrade is still we're not

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.889
oh and we got holy mantle from it which

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:25.510
is excellent but we're still not

00:23:23.889 --> 00:23:27.269
crushing him from a range perspective we

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:29.830
still got to get right next to like

00:23:27.269 --> 00:23:38.889
every enemy on planet earth to kill them

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:40.570
but all range upgrades are helpful at

00:23:38.889 --> 00:23:43.080
least so with the Sun you know we got to

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:43.080
play this guy

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:56.220
he lived he is he lived again he did not

00:23:54.029 --> 00:24:01.440
live for a third time all right I'm

00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:03.480
excited probably unnecessary but I'm

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:06.179
looking at our score and I'm the like in

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:08.490
our score you know twenty four thousand

00:24:06.179 --> 00:24:10.650
at this point usually I mean oftentimes

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:14.520
I'm actually at like nineteen thousand

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:18.409
when I come down here so to conceivably

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:21.899
be a 25 or 26 by the end of this floor

00:24:18.409 --> 00:24:25.250
is very very nice okay blank card ruins

00:24:21.899 --> 00:24:28.500
blank card black rim blank card for Cano

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:31.980
blank card on Seuss blinkered the guns

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:33.870
blinker dog laws I think you can make a

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:36.809
pretty sweet case for this now

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:39.720
admittedly the loss of the Sun card is

00:24:36.809 --> 00:24:42.600
not trivial it would be nice to have

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:48.090
both but I really like being able to

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:50.520
have blank rune so I black rune to suck

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:52.169
up some of these statistical like

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.820
increases or decreases that we don't

00:24:52.169 --> 00:24:55.740
care about some of these items is really

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:58.830
what and what an earth human being would

00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:00.840
use to describe those game objects but

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:03.419
anyway so we got uh cat of nine tails

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:08.640
it's a lovely upgrade for us obviously

00:25:03.419 --> 00:25:10.789
we're at sixteen damage now yes

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:17.190
[Music]

00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:19.529
kind of a weird call super bandage does

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:21.870
nothing for us and as a result if you

00:25:19.529 --> 00:25:23.690
like taking it could only cost us points

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:29.070
what I mean by it does nothing

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:31.679
well it takes HP oh there is a secret

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:34.559
room here that could be amazing it's on

00:25:31.679 --> 00:25:40.590
the right side it takes our HP and then

00:25:34.559 --> 00:25:42.330
gives us more HP than we can hold so it

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:46.140
seems like that's highly highly

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:47.340
irrelevant so why why risk the points

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.870
basically is what it comes down to I

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:50.970
think a also makes deals with the devil

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:52.110
worse most of the time on average you

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:53.159
would expect it to make deals with the

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:54.539
devil words because the deal with the

00:25:53.159 --> 00:25:56.930
devil pool is the best so it's being

00:25:54.539 --> 00:26:02.810
diluted by the

00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:06.650
that are not as good so I'm not going to

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:10.460
lose too much sleep over that that dog

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:11.810
is barking dude is it a different bark

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:17.000
if there's like a crawlspace or

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:19.760
something it was barking yes okay so it

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.700
is a different bark and it's not even a

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:25.310
crawlspace it's a black market and it's

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:33.680
a black market that can hold anything so

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:35.150
you'd take fun we have so much time

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:43.040
don't sweat this one at all

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:48.260
you take spawn you take infamy you take

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:52.820
Book of Belial but you don't keep it you

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:57.440
take Tami's head and you do keep it and

00:26:52.820 --> 00:27:00.380
then you black rune everything else give

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:04.190
us a luck increase so why would we ever

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:07.730
do this well we do lose blank card black

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:08.480
rune we gain an unbelievable ability to

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:10.820
kill things

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:12.560
thanks to Tammy's head not that we were

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:19.640
struggling to begin with we should keep

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:22.070
some of these keys but like now we're

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:24.560
crushing it so keys are my biggest

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:26.720
concern which might strike oh dude we

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:28.820
got such a huge range upgrade Keys might

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:31.460
strike you as being something we

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:34.040
shouldn't be that concerned about but I

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:35.750
disagree you know we are going down to

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:39.050
the blue wound the whole point of being

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:41.500
on the Blue Room beyond just increasing

00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:41.500
our points

00:27:43.299 --> 00:27:54.010
to hook us up with as many items as

00:27:46.659 --> 00:27:58.419
possible should go go through this think

00:27:54.010 --> 00:28:02.529
oh secret room I think there's no reason

00:27:58.419 --> 00:28:04.409
we can't be in the top 25 today I've

00:28:02.529 --> 00:28:11.049
remained relatively focused with the

00:28:04.409 --> 00:28:13.090
with my usual good-natured charm made

00:28:11.049 --> 00:28:19.539
some decisions some of which were bolder

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:22.539
than others but the Tammy's head pickup

00:28:19.539 --> 00:28:25.630
is really going to start the show what's

00:28:22.539 --> 00:28:27.700
great about it I don't think we want it

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:30.520
it's really going to start to show

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:32.440
what's great why it was the right

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:37.779
decision I guess I should say when we

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:40.179
get to the Delirium floor which is still

00:28:37.779 --> 00:28:41.980
kind of a surprising distance away we

00:28:40.179 --> 00:28:43.360
want I mean we probably don't need six

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.740
keys you probably need five because we

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.230
can buy one from the shop most of the

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:53.320
time but let's let's stick with it as is

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:56.620
right now double range of why not at

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:58.179
this point do bird got decent range and

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:59.710
we got a holy man that again does wooden

00:28:58.179 --> 00:29:06.159
cross give you a holy mantle every room

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:08.070
or am I just the world's luckiest man we

00:29:06.159 --> 00:29:11.049
found both our secret rooms Loki

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:15.880
dogtooth has absolutely crushed it on

00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:18.760
this rug right we don't care about those

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:20.320
and we definitely want to go to the hush

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:22.450
bye okay so after the hushed I would go

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:24.549
to delirium and then what we go to void

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:28.020
and then the rest of it is uh pretty

00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:31.720
much automatic there is no key for sale

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:34.659
so we definitely want item rooms and I

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:43.320
mean this is so we could ruin our run

00:29:34.659 --> 00:29:43.320
right here you take Libra as Azazel

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:50.340
I think I am going to be unsane e today

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:53.029
at least with respect to that one

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:56.340
specific thing and I'm not going to take

00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:57.750
Libra Libra may indeed be by far the

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.529
right choice and I'm just not thinking

00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:02.700
clearly

00:29:58.529 --> 00:30:04.830
however Pandora's box does nothing for

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:08.730
us sadly I think this is an old bandage

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:17.370
is worth it I think is there anything we

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:18.600
care about in here I mean we could knock

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:20.820
a the death card was not whether we

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:29.549
could justify moldy bread I don't think

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:31.740
it's going to be relevant yet basically

00:30:29.549 --> 00:30:34.429
here's my methodology for this decision

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:38.070
by the way um we're crushing it

00:30:34.429 --> 00:30:39.600
so I don't really want to call this run

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:42.090
into question you may remember there was

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:43.820
a daily run not too long ago and by not

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:47.100
too long ago I mean literally yesterday

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:48.659
where I had really good setup maybe

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:51.000
taking a little bit too much dumb damage

00:30:48.659 --> 00:30:58.020
out of overconfidence sound familiar

00:30:51.000 --> 00:31:00.720
and saw a d6 room tried to make my run

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:02.760
better ended up making it a lot worse we

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:08.279
still survived the daily but we ranked

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:10.260
really really poorly however today's

00:31:08.279 --> 00:31:12.630
daily is a chance for redemption I

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:16.409
really I mean I'm looking at the scores

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:18.510
here I don't know if we're going to be

00:31:16.409 --> 00:31:19.890
in that like there's a big jump from 50

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:20.850
to 55 I don't know if we're going to be

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:23.970
able to get there I don't even know if

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:29.850
we're going to be able to get to 50 but

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:31.919
I do think that there is a chance if we

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:33.210
do absolutely everything on the Delirium

00:31:31.919 --> 00:31:35.720
floor and I do mean absolutely

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:38.700
everything I'm going to fight delirium

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:42.029
this is my like you know I've been

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:44.250
elected to Congress as like an

00:31:42.029 --> 00:31:46.529
anti-establishment candidate I'm on the

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:48.149
young side of things and I'm like we're

00:31:46.529 --> 00:31:50.330
going to change politics and then you

00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:50.330
know

00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:56.249
seventy year old man in a nice suit

00:31:54.299 --> 00:31:57.719
smoking a cigar came up to me and said

00:31:56.249 --> 00:31:59.609
here's how things are done here and he

00:31:57.719 --> 00:32:00.839
hands me a big old canvas sack with a

00:31:59.609 --> 00:32:04.229
dollar sign on it

00:32:00.839 --> 00:32:11.849
this is my moment because the right call

00:32:04.229 --> 00:32:14.159
is almost definitely - alt f4 or at

00:32:11.849 --> 00:32:16.200
least x2 the daily before we fight

00:32:14.159 --> 00:32:18.029
delirium the smart money's on taking

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:24.749
damage during the delirium fight because

00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:27.419
it's a hard fight something something

00:32:24.749 --> 00:32:29.549
never tell me the odds anyway alright

00:32:27.419 --> 00:32:33.509
we're gonna grab this taking one hit

00:32:29.549 --> 00:32:35.669
there who cares it's not that bad the

00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:41.309
good news is I expect to basically crush

00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:49.379
the delirium floor at 43,000 points with

00:32:41.309 --> 00:32:52.229
curse of the blind I think I'm not going

00:32:49.379 --> 00:32:54.029
to pick up any item you're going to hate

00:32:52.229 --> 00:32:56.789
that but at least I'm going to fight

00:32:54.029 --> 00:32:59.249
delirium I'm choosing my battles here

00:32:56.789 --> 00:33:01.469
and I pull it to a pace of something is

00:32:59.249 --> 00:33:05.669
not that good a to love something is

00:33:01.469 --> 00:33:09.599
excellent here but I don't think it

00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:11.969
makes sense to take most items here

00:33:09.599 --> 00:33:13.469
especially not knowing what they are not

00:33:11.969 --> 00:33:15.239
worried about ruining the run I'm

00:33:13.469 --> 00:33:16.709
worried about needlessly compromising

00:33:15.239 --> 00:33:21.739
the amount of points we have and that's

00:33:16.709 --> 00:33:21.739
lame but it is also the way she goes bud

00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:29.070
alright so now we know where we're going

00:33:25.039 --> 00:33:35.359
it's probably still sensible to fight

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:35.359
delirium last bit of a waste

00:33:36.919 --> 00:33:42.690
but it might not matter at all

00:33:41.039 --> 00:33:44.789
why wife item last well I was thinking

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:46.229
what we could get stronger but not if

00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:48.269
we're not picking up any items although

00:33:46.229 --> 00:33:52.679
we you know cards can make a difference

00:33:48.269 --> 00:33:54.479
admittedly just ask Blizzard

00:33:52.679 --> 00:33:56.459
shareholders after the hearthstone

00:33:54.479 --> 00:34:00.179
release so yeah we're going to ignore

00:33:56.459 --> 00:34:02.699
these and you know we're getting a few

00:34:00.179 --> 00:34:04.919
thousand point bonus once we finish this

00:34:02.699 --> 00:34:07.469
run overwhelm once we finish this floor

00:34:04.919 --> 00:34:10.700
I should say you know forget it the Gaza

00:34:07.469 --> 00:34:10.700
room that's all I need

00:34:11.779 --> 00:34:16.139
holy mantle saved us I actually think

00:34:14.819 --> 00:34:20.359
we've made the right decision we've

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:24.419
never been hit by curses at our I think

00:34:20.359 --> 00:34:27.659
and a holy mantle has saved us from

00:34:24.419 --> 00:34:33.000
taking a lot of damage so I am very very

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:36.109
for it right now we still run a small

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:39.149
rock I think another spirit art

00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:40.500
point-wise could pay for itself assuming

00:34:39.149 --> 00:34:44.309
we take damage at some point so there's

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:48.710
the small rock do does a huge range up

00:34:44.309 --> 00:34:52.679
but I think that probably does beat our

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:54.779
wooden cross specifically is Azazel but

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:57.450
this is not to insult wooden cross which

00:34:54.779 --> 00:35:01.049
has been excellent for us now I would

00:34:57.450 --> 00:35:02.880
not be surprised if if one of these

00:35:01.049 --> 00:35:05.279
rooms is Delirium this one in particular

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:12.690
kind of looks like it's got that feel to

00:35:05.279 --> 00:35:17.519
it it was not and that's okay listen for

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:19.980
dog tooth as well well we know where the

00:35:17.519 --> 00:35:26.609
regular secret room is so it's done all

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:29.789
these rooms um oh let's go I'll go for a

00:35:26.609 --> 00:35:33.590
walk outside now the Summer Sun calling

00:35:29.789 --> 00:35:36.690
my name I hear it now just can't stand

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:41.540
okay we know we're going to go this way

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:47.550
Oh two of spades really actually good

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:56.220
what did I step on really good if we can

00:35:47.550 --> 00:36:00.900
get more Keys the luck is also fine yeah

00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:02.250
two of spades that was really bad two

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:04.109
buys us some time

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:07.080
we shouldn't be opening these golden

00:36:04.109 --> 00:36:14.310
chests yet and damage kind of sucks

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:19.650
I still think like 50k is well within

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:20.400
the realm of possibility taking a couple

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:25.920
of hits

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:30.810
basically doesn't matter at all we need

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:33.690
that spirit hard okay let's start the on

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:36.390
through this our range is good but it's

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:39.420
not that good you got tricked myself

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:41.960
into thinking that it was infinite like

00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:44.640
the most recent Bioshock game am i right

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:45.900
it sounded like it was a dig at Nick but

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:49.080
really I just put on my nerd voice

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:54.510
because video games right I only like

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:56.910
cool things like trading stocks like I'm

00:36:54.510 --> 00:37:01.890
going to suck first edition Charizard

00:36:56.910 --> 00:37:04.490
can I have your rare candies okay what's

00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:04.490
going on there

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:13.980
all righty somehow did not get hit did a

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:16.200
lot of damage and every time we land a

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:17.400
shot and this is really the fight that I

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:19.440
was thinking of when it came to like

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:23.520
using our range upgrade but cord

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:29.490
prioritizing a range upgrade curse of

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:33.260
the tower did hit me there this is why

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:37.650
by the way in case you watch me play

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:39.800
Isaac runs that are not dailies and then

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:44.160
you go what is you never fight delirium

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:50.250
delirium is unfit able if you're not

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:51.690
like absurdly defensively strong because

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:54.480
there's just there's damage that's

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:56.010
nearly unavoidable now not all of it

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:57.540
some of the damage I took here is

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:59.820
definitely avoidable and you know what I

00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:01.619
hate that we took damage there

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:04.290
to that extent because we proved that

00:38:01.619 --> 00:38:06.150
it's the right idea to just alt have

00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:11.369
four out of the Delirium fight and it

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:11.820
pains me that that's the case I don't

00:38:11.369 --> 00:38:15.359
know

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:17.430
imagining at this point these videos

00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:21.420
aren't necessarily must-watch

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:25.350
entertainment and Nicolas but it would

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:28.080
be really nice if and this is admittedly

00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:29.609
salt talking after knowing that I

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:31.680
probably just wandered like 15

00:38:29.609 --> 00:38:34.290
leaderboard positions by being bad on

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:38.010
the Delirium fight but why not just make

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:44.180
it so that delirium gives you a point

00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:44.180
bonus okay sure

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:49.750
maybe not a big one because I'd still

00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:52.660
rather go to I'd rather he'd make

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:54.550
mathematical sense to go to the chest on

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:56.860
runs that go that part or go to the lam

00:38:54.550 --> 00:39:00.490
on runs that go that far then going to

00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:02.950
the Delirium fight but you should at

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:07.270
least make the Delirium fight worth

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:11.220
fighting kind of a cheesy technique and

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:13.570
again I'm not at all mad at anybody and

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:15.900
I certainly am not disparaging the

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:18.790
players for taking the optimal strats

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:23.950
but on the development side I think like

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:27.580
you know it's kind of a weird position

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:29.710
to take either way you kill delirium

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:34.800
everything else is going down easily

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:34.800
here I don't think we are going to hit

00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:40.270
50 I think we're going to be in the high

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:43.270
40s that's still probably good enough

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:48.580
for uh I think it's good enough for

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:52.000
front page which is top 30 and straight

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:58.540
up it makes me kind of a scrublord but I

00:39:52.000 --> 00:40:00.910
love as asel the Hilly's man big Bible

00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:03.820
I love azazel dailies for whatever

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:07.720
reason the is a Latvia dailies the

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:11.650
Azazel dailies speak to me I do not know

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:16.050
why which was delirium over here but I

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:23.700
have a tendency to do alright on him

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:23.700
let's go wait it was down trophy room

00:40:26.359 --> 00:40:31.910
I should have known it can't be done it

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:33.499
must be this one costing ourselves a

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:35.420
little bit of extra time but who cares

00:40:33.499 --> 00:40:37.339
this was a fun daily through and through

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:38.599
we didn't take very much damage very

00:40:37.339 --> 00:40:41.719
thankful for that we're going to rank

00:40:38.599 --> 00:40:43.729
okay at the very least 70 it's a little

00:40:41.719 --> 00:40:44.359
bit lower than I expected and hurts but

00:40:43.729 --> 00:40:45.529
that's okay

00:40:44.359 --> 00:40:46.519
for now thanks for watching hope you
