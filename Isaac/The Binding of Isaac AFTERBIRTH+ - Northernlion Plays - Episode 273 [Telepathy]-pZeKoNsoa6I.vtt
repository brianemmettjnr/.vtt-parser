00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.659
hey everybody welcome back nor the land

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.750
please the binding of issac afterbirth

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.179
plus I can't buy a win here but that

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.769
doesn't mean that this is going to be

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.490
the same where Isaac that's what I

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:18.960
wanted I really I mean again first off

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:22.980
ng 1/2 y9l I apologize we've had some

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.320
spotty performances lately this run is

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.470
all about the fundamentals good

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.009
commentary better ingredients Papa

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.860
John's good commentary acceptable

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.750
gameplay the wins will come I know that

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.540
we can win an Isaac I mean it's like

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.590
we've got it infinity times friendly fly

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.399
is just fine

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.920
all we got to do is play our game and do

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.070
a low-rent Christopher Walken impression

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.719
apparently but we really we know the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.370
keys to the kingdom we know how to win

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.530
an Isaac stop taking so much stupid

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.440
damage you'll probably you know be a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.789
happy camper but yeah I've been I've

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.260
been on a little bit of a slump lately

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.640
but you know what keeps me going I used

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.070
to sincerely be like bummed out if I

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.930
would have like a series of bad Isaac

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.350
recordings or at least like bad gameplay

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.630
I'd be like man what am i doing this is

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.750
rough and it still is to some extent my

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.180
natural that's my ground state to use a

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:27.720
10th grade chemistry chemistry chemistry

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:29.100
term but now I get so many tweets from

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.439
people that are very supportive they say

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.299
we love watching you suffer your worst

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.680
videos are your best videos and I say I

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.270
don't know in a way that sounds like a

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.100
little bit of a backhanded compliment

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.380
but at the same time I appreciate it so

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.920
that's why those videos exists instead

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.930
of me just coming up and being like hey

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.899
-6 streak what happened don't ask you

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.520
know and then recording a win hopefully

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.070
hopefully you've enjoyed some of my my

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.170
suffering lately in a way it was a

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.479
little different like in the vanilla

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.450
Isaac days and I had like a probably

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.049
around a 50% win rate then like a loss

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.670
wasn't special we've gotten a lot better

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.789
at the game losses have become at least

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.800
mildly rarer so having a string of like

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.519
incredibly bad luck like this is at

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.989
least kind of hilarious I hope

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.910
I'm gonna reroll book of sin becomes

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.980
Anarchist Cookbook obviously it's not

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.910
particularly strong but we are one

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.750
battery charge away from having a

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.930
bookworm which is a decent upgrade

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.670
you've gotta try to use Haga laws there

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.910
you know the day I stopped using hog

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.489
allows to try to find a black-market on

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.840
a room like that as the day that I was

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.849
going to say the day that I died but

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:49.500
that's a copy written song so that'll be

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:52.829
the day when you make me cry our virtue

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:56.989
has been rewarded it's not a black

00:02:52.829 --> 00:03:03.510
market it's also not a tumor but it is

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:06.120
undefined which is actually swell I'll

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.519
tell you what because undefined wave

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.280
undefined and teleport 2.0 are actually

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:15.959
different I'm trying to what is teleport

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.579
2.0 it takes you to a room a teleport

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.100
2.0 takes you to the closest room you

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:26.220
haven't been to which by default leads

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:29.010
to the error room sometimes undefined

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.380
takes you to a random special room which

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.359
can be the error room early okay so I

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.670
think I've got it sussed out here so my

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.650
game plan believe it or not is actually

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.959
to dump the d6 and take undefined

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.160
because I find it more fun we really

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.130
haven't had a chance to use this item

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.150
too much because it oftentimes shows up

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.380
you know when you're late enough in the

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.690
game that you're like ah we can't loop

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.079
on the chest so we cares but being able

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.569
to get error rooms is fun I'd use this

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.099
just so we could get bookworm we could

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.840
pick up another battery charge reroll it

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.040
again but honestly I don't care about

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:06.840
getting more books we're not going to

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:09.000
mill out a library by just getting you

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.859
know one book pedestal rear old over and

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.760
over and over is extremely unlikely so

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:17.789
take on defined and then the general

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:21.719
theory with undefined in mind and I used

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:23.460
to use this item rigorously take

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:26.190
triple-a battery and you know why we're

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.670
taking triple-a battery the more charges

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.380
the better

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.510
you know you use it at your own risk

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.980
early because it could cost you an item

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.980
room it could cost you a bathroom which

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.560
could cost you a devil room but if you

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.600
use it with a lot of charges stacked up

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.630
after you go to the rooms that you don't

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.160
mind are you that you want to go to we

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.370
will take devil precedent because I

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.690
would like to still like you know kill

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.130
things on this run and the deal with the

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.860
devil is very conducive to making it

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:57.020
happen then we start teleporting so we

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.020
got a second secret room it's not bad

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.790
this card could be valuable you never

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.800
know you never know it's the fool does

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.260
it beat the devil card yeah for boss

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.120
rush purposes and we got a second secret

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.010
room again we still can't get into our

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.390
item room so I'm going to you know do my

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:17.490
due diligence go back and take a little

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:20.900
time to explore that we get a penny we

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.900
should pick up Oh

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.390
freaky it's gonna say we get a penny we

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.740
should pick up the flat penny and I mean

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.540
flat penny is a great trinket I don't

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.150
like leaving it behind but triple-a

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:33.120
battery is a little bit more useful for

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:36.720
us in terms of maximizing our space bar

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.210
item glitter bombs are just fine so

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.500
we're going to get out of here all right

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.780
so I mean I'm already flying in the face

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.730
of my own advice first off I chose not

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.470
to go back and pick up the trinket

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.420
before I got the penny that's okay

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.640
secondly instead of just playing with

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.860
the fundamentals um throw in a little

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.680
dashes aim you know like Emeril Lagasse

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.440
here but I'm not sweating it too much

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.680
because the runs all right it's got an

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.840
orbital I'm just going to fool card out

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.960
of that it's got an orbital it's got

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.450
bookworm 9lives is a nice little

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.390
failsafe here and I actually think

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:14.820
undefined' is good as well as being fun

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:17.240
it's not just you know occasional error

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.620
rooms it's also a teleporter

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.630
you know it's also access to secret

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.520
rooms that we otherwise possibly would

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.370
not have been able to get to so it has a

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.830
lot of utility sometimes they can screw

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.210
you especially if you use it on like one

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.610
of the floors that causes you to not be

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.840
able to make progress like you know use

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.990
it on the womb - it gives you a narrow

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.710
room that only gives you access to Sheol

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.020
constant doing business

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.260
AIE you should not use it on that floor

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.260
but

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:48.960
it's all it's all part of the game so I

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:51.240
think we definitely look for a secret

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.580
room here pick this up son card son

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:56.730
cards a good card grab this secret room

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.170
get three battery charges don't want to

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.790
hit a narrow room yet so we go check

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.100
this rotten baby's lovely now we

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:04.340
teleport we teleport into the secret

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.480
room I'm okay with that

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:10.020
infested not a bad pill

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:12.320
good to know it exists at least although

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:16.320
it rarely makes much of a difference

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:18.600
overall and really with one HP the Sun

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:22.730
card is that was such a bad dodge the

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.730
Sun card pretty much exists to be like

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:28.500
you know mapping more or less dude the

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.840
dodges are so bad right now okay pull

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:34.140
yourself to pull yourself together and

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:37.440
Aldous is not this damage is unbecoming

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:40.200
of you what I am going to do is be a

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.669
little reckless and to go to our room

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:46.430
here I was hoping when you get something

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:50.810
out of our donation machine grab this

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:53.850
teleport it's a narrow room he's done it

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:56.160
so car battery strikes me as being

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:58.110
largely irrelevant the money's nice but

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:03.540
I don't think car battery does anything

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:05.220
for us right now in theory it like it

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.990
could cause you to accidentally roll

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.690
over the room that you wanted to go to

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:13.080
but I don't know if that actually means

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:14.669
anything you know like if basically when

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:17.190
we press the button we're going to go to

00:08:14.669 --> 00:08:19.830
a destination that is a special room so

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:22.140
I don't know if it's if rolling over the

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:23.970
special room has any actual consequences

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.410
to our actions so I'm going to I'm going

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.669
to choose not to be too rattled by it

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.990
and if we ever want to replace car

00:08:26.669 --> 00:08:33.810
battery we're going to you know love

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:35.580
life son card I mean you could use it

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:37.710
kind of want to use it just because I

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.770
hate this room type there's an enemy

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:42.480
remaining somewhere oh it's a little

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:48.870
spider over there

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:51.660
various now item room shop teleport

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:53.640
seems appropriate to me if we wanted to

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:57.870
you know what we actually want not car

00:08:53.640 --> 00:09:00.330
battery but if we can get the battery

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:02.040
that's such a good get for this

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.810
it's a fringe case you'll probably be

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.400
able to use it like once every two runs

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.600
like this but sometimes you're going to

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.500
teleport to the air room you're not

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.210
going to want to be there you're gonna

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.310
want to get out so you can use your

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:13.620
second charge to possibly get out of

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:15.750
your error room I say possibly because I

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.580
think you can teleport from a special

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:21.540
room into the exact same special room

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:25.020
but it's a-you know you have a good

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:28.920
chance to get out at least we should go

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:30.690
to our item room first never go into our

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:34.410
item room our shop is only like two

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:36.420
rooms away so although it does fly in

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.950
the face of my earlier advice to use as

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:43.440
many charges as possible that's really

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:52.770
like womb one advice and having a lot of

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:54.690
battery charges advice item room is dead

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:57.570
shot dude we've been stacked on items so

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:59.430
far I gotta be honest with you vibrant

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.860
bulb makes a great case to be better

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:03.650
than I mean first off better than golf

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.090
with a gator for certain but better than

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:07.650
triple-a battery we are holding a lot of

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.120
charges we're generating charges more

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:11.610
quickly than we need to and we're

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:18.840
holding them for a while so I support

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:21.240
this decision Steam sale is well and

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.770
truly ok 67 percent deal with the devil

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:28.020
chances teleport we did get an error

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:29.340
room not a huge fan of this error room

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:33.740
and it did cost us unless we get a

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:33.740
battery charge it did cost us our

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.110
phosphite and possibly a deal with the

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.820
devil

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:41.190
losing the deal with the devil hurts a

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:42.870
great deal but it does also guarantee us

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:47.870
a deal with the devil on the next floor

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:49.920
so is it worth it no probably not but

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.420
you know you got to hedge your bets

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.100
what were we hoping to teleport to I

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:56.540
guess if not the error room it's a good

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:59.670
point self I'm glad I brought it up

00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:01.620
all right so that deficiencies in this

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:04.110
run are probably pretty obvious our base

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:07.260
damage is bad the lucky thing about it

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:11.580
is that we can pretty easily fix it with

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:13.940
dead shot we have enough keys to justify

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:16.980
using two of them to the dodge a second

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.990
subpar in fact just like from an

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.850
attribute standpoint in general we're

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.350
killing it with respect to our tears

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:26.430
bookworms nice but really this is like

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:37.290
the dead shot show right now did not

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:43.590
hear a key drop 42 cents you know what I

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:45.330
got a good feeling it's not a terrible

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:48.330
trade but it's not a good trade for us

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:50.400
we've already got 44 cents we might want

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:54.930
to just play it cool on this floor and

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:57.600
say you know it would be a good floor to

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:58.710
go item room shop bathroom deal with the

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.070
devil because the deal with the devil's

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:03.480
guaranteed I know what like on the

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:05.490
surface this looks like a run that's

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:09.020
tough to lose and that's why losing it

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:13.380
would kill me you know deep inside that

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:14.010
was just not a good dodge we have nine

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.590
lives

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:18.150
it's physically painful to lose a run

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:20.850
with nine lives like on a conceptual

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:22.800
level but then also dying over and over

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:24.930
to like the same rooms so this would be

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:28.650
a good time to really get it all put

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:33.510
together here certainly head of the

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:34.770
keeper is absolutely fine we're not

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:37.740
really I mean I would still say we're

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:40.320
not greatly at risk of death but should

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:44.790
handle it before it becomes too much of

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:48.930
a genuine concern because to go on a

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:51.030
seven loss streak it's pretty terrible

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:55.860
without a fail I am actually like

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:58.560
dodging into every single shot that

00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:01.230
shows up here give me a teleport card I

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:03.850
want three boss rush stuff

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:05.560
but it's important to remember first off

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:08.740
don't let the self-defeating narrative

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:11.170
take hold secondly a lot of easily one

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:12.879
runs have gotten to this position before

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:14.319
where they looked pretty bad and we

00:13:12.879 --> 00:13:17.069
played like trash I think that could

00:13:14.319 --> 00:13:19.689
still be a secret room wishful thinking

00:13:17.069 --> 00:13:22.089
this is a fairly common situation to

00:13:19.689 --> 00:13:26.079
find yourself in not that much HP not

00:13:22.089 --> 00:13:27.670
super powerful and just waiting on you

00:13:26.079 --> 00:13:29.649
know that 100% deal with the devil

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:33.339
chance and hopefully if not carry us I'm

00:13:29.649 --> 00:13:38.160
not asking for a brimstone at least give

00:13:33.339 --> 00:13:41.649
us a you know leg up here what is this

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:50.500
telekinesis the power of mind this is a

00:13:41.649 --> 00:13:52.740
booster pack item I don't know what this

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:58.120
does

00:13:52.740 --> 00:14:04.389
does it deflect an enemy now doesn't

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:11.639
seem like it it recharges when you kill

00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:14.639
an enemy I'm going to look it up

00:14:11.639 --> 00:14:14.639
telekinesis

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:21.759
Isaac active item upon use for the next

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:24.970
two seconds any shots that come near

00:14:21.759 --> 00:14:27.100
Isaac are held in place after the charge

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:28.569
is depleted they are fired back as tears

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:33.910
so it's not killing an enemies two

00:14:28.569 --> 00:14:38.529
seconds seems like a terrible synergy to

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:41.500
have with vibrant bulb which is kind of

00:14:38.529 --> 00:14:44.290
driving my stats but at the same time I

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:47.230
really do want to experience a new item

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:50.730
and it seems pretty good especially when

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:53.829
I've been getting hit by so many bullets

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:55.269
probably like neutral synergy with

00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:57.069
Deadshot maybe some of the tears

00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:59.290
reflected back could miss and cause you

00:14:57.069 --> 00:15:01.750
to lose your charge there but fairly

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:07.559
minor I don't know let's let's let the

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:07.559
game decide didn't give me an error room

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.829
strength card is good we got plenty of

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:18.720
time on this floor so I think you just

00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:20.940
hold up we definitely want to go to the

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.470
arrow room the shop was greed so

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.459
brightly not every room but I mean we

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:24.990
would like to but we want to go to the

00:15:23.459 --> 00:15:26.490
item room first but the shop was green

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:28.829
so there's no battery charge for sale

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:30.630
might be lucky enough to get one more

00:15:28.829 --> 00:15:31.950
charge we got sin robes from our deal

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:34.019
with the devil which is also excellent

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:36.149
also gives us a little bit of a

00:15:34.019 --> 00:15:37.589
fail-safe for all the dumb damage we've

00:15:36.149 --> 00:15:39.600
been taking and of course keepin meat is

00:15:37.589 --> 00:15:41.399
a lovely item even if it is ball

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:44.100
advantages and not keeping me three

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:47.070
dollar bill is also great except for the

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:48.180
times that it's terrible I doubt we're

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:51.329
going to get three more rooms to be

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:54.510
honest with you but we should give it a

00:15:51.329 --> 00:15:57.720
shot that couch is a big room I think so

00:15:54.510 --> 00:16:00.060
we will get one more charge and I'll

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:05.790
tell you what I'll play it the way

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:08.730
Zane would have intended if we get a

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:10.440
narrow room we stick with undefined if

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:12.690
we don't get a narrow room we go with

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:17.120
telepathy and try to figure out how that

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:21.149
item works from a functional standpoint

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:23.670
let's go no error room alright so we'll

00:16:21.149 --> 00:16:28.769
take we'll take telepathy I'm a man of

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:31.380
my word we did improve statistically on

00:16:28.769 --> 00:16:33.930
this floor so it's not a huge problem

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:35.910
that we are going to lose most of the

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:38.220
effective vibrant bulb we could also

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:41.040
just hold it as like an easy stats

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:43.890
upgrade because we will always have

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:45.360
vibrant bulb if we never use this plus

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:47.730
we'll be able to get vibrant bulb like

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.910
multiple times per room I guess if we

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:53.130
wanted I don't know it's a bit of a

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:55.860
strange item but let's let's try to give

00:16:53.130 --> 00:17:01.110
it the credit it deserves we are looking

00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:06.240
for Gumby so like knowing when enemies

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:08.959
do like tear attacks seems really

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.959
helpful for this

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:14.250
like you never shoots here so telepathy

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:19.050
I guess we just hold on to this here

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:19.050
okay I'm starting to become a believer

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:24.190
it would be nice but maybe like

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:25.570
overpowered if it also sort of beheld

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:27.580
enemies in place because then we would

00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:30.940
be largely immune to those guys who

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:35.140
chase us down which admittedly interests

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:37.300
me a great deal dude like okay I see the

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:43.270
power I'm glad I didn't underestimate

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:44.860
this item too it's basically two seconds

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.600
of bullet invulnerability I don't know

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:49.990
how valuable it is that the shots get

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:51.340
sent back most of the time I tend to

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:52.120
think that like deflected shots are not

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:54.400
worth it

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:57.790
we're not worth caring about because

00:17:54.400 --> 00:18:06.370
they they tend to not really reliably

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:08.020
hit enemies but could be mistaken not

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:09.670
using it in some situations just cause

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:13.720
like on these enemies doesn't seem like

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:16.150
the right call to use right if an enemy

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:19.420
is going to shoot bullets then or eat

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:19.780
pant for that matter I'm 100% in sign me

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:26.830
up

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:28.900
I definitely caught shots and those guys

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:31.080
don't shoot so it must catch bones as

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.080
well

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:39.000
I'm trying to think of like what bosses

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:41.610
we crap on like it seems like this is

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.610
absurdly good against like the hush so

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:46.380
we're looking for stats fingers okay I

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:47.850
mean it's borderline capable here right

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:50.400
we just I would like to have something a

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:52.080
little more statistically amazing and I

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.150
got to be honest with you super bandage

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:58.920
is a little lame but it's also very

00:18:54.150 --> 00:19:08.390
helpful I didn't get the bomb I'm aware

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:11.250
but Kiki excellent not greed let's go

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:13.440
we'll take there's options we'll take

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.790
the Joker card I like it a lot and then

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.960
we'll donate as much money as we can

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.760
we'll buy the spear at artists we can

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.950
get something out of this after okay

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:21.530
yeah I mean at first I was like I don't

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:25.140
think telepathy is very good at all I

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:26.400
don't understand now that I've used it

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.930
I've realized that if you can kill

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.960
enemies that are rushing to you if you

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:33.330
can avoid beams the enemy shoot out

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:35.910
you're invincible might be a strong word

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:39.630
but you're you're much more invulnerable

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:43.560
than you used to be what a cool idea for

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:46.800
an item fact that it recharges

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:48.840
consistently is absurdly strong full

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:51.660
health again that's really just like a

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:54.930
nice to know that it's in the rotation

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:56.490
sort of situation but we don't have

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:58.020
enough keys to go back to the double key

00:19:56.490 --> 00:20:04.440
room and what would I be looking for

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:07.530
like I care not for a secret room I

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:09.660
think I don't really care about a 5 room

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:11.880
at this point we don't need money for

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:17.910
anything we've already donated like 70

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:20.340
cents or something ridiculous I guess it

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:22.050
is nice to recapture some value out of

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:25.710
bullets that you dodged around as well

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:27.960
but ok that was that's that's hi mind or

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:31.500
sorry fire mind that's a sensible

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:35.280
mistake to make at least who mom's

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:37.710
contact is a very nice get here then I

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:41.490
just stood still most of these enemies

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:42.570
do not fire bullets so I think majority

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.040
of this fight I'm just going to try to

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:46.350
roll with a stat increase from

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.549
illuminated gold no deal with the devil

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.499
but we have a free get out

00:20:47.549 --> 00:20:53.549
jail free cards so take the polaroid

00:20:49.499 --> 00:20:55.950
grab this wow these are both excellent I

00:20:53.549 --> 00:21:07.470
think I'll go crickets head for raw

00:20:55.950 --> 00:21:09.330
damage because I can sometimes get death

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:10.710
touch from three dollar bill anyway so

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.999
I'll just take the raw damage I don't

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:14.610
know it's it's not an easy decision

00:21:11.999 --> 00:21:16.320
necessarily but they're both great

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:19.559
that's the thing plus crickets head

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:21.179
doesn't mess with our tier stat so

00:21:19.559 --> 00:21:28.499
although it's what I always forget is

00:21:21.179 --> 00:21:33.059
deaths touch a speed upgrade thank you

00:21:28.499 --> 00:21:35.789
for the tinted rock illumination this is

00:21:33.059 --> 00:21:37.379
the one I feel it all coming back to me

00:21:35.789 --> 00:21:40.080
now dude you can be so much more

00:21:37.379 --> 00:21:45.720
aggressive with those doppelgangers when

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:48.090
you have effectively immunity to

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:49.859
whatever they shoot out like did you I

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:53.249
probably would have been hit there where

00:21:49.859 --> 00:21:55.980
it not for a we're not for telepathy

00:21:53.249 --> 00:21:57.989
functioning same right there dude this

00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:00.029
is actually I'm not I don't want to go

00:21:57.989 --> 00:22:02.759
too over-the-top like best item in the

00:22:00.029 --> 00:22:06.450
game no let's not get crazy but an item

00:22:02.759 --> 00:22:10.649
with some extreme usefulness this is a

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:13.129
bad idea by the way but I'm feeling

00:22:10.649 --> 00:22:17.690
confident and as a result I wanted to

00:22:13.129 --> 00:22:17.690
express that confidence by going to that

00:22:17.929 --> 00:22:21.899
curse room right there

00:22:19.529 --> 00:22:24.840
unfortunately didn't quite pan out as

00:22:21.899 --> 00:22:27.830
predicted left my broken heart open and

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.830
you ripped it down

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:42.480
nothing it's kind of like a great

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:44.940
synergy vibrant bulb when there's

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:47.100
enemies that don't shoot bullets nice

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:48.900
stat increase and then when there's

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:50.640
enemy the do shoot bullets were immune

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:53.760
to them and we can still build up a

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:56.460
pretty impressive like statistical

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:58.530
resume just with Deadeye which I

00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:00.240
continue to call Deadeye and Deadshot at

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:07.430
different intervals depending on you

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:09.630
know how I'm feeling okay that's fair

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:14.900
we're going to take some damage

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:17.640
I wouldn't wouldn't suggest it we're not

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:22.920
if we had the wafer or something I would

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:25.560
be invested in playing those demon

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:29.550
judgments at present it's just a little

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:31.320
too risky and let's be honest wouldn't

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:35.970
necessarily suggest that we're in a

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:37.800
position to be playing risky right now

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:41.720
dude we could really use speed but tears

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:45.090
is also almost always great so some

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:47.130
situation in which we take brother Bobby

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:50.550
didn't even realize conjoining was going

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:52.110
to exist and then not really thrilled

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:54.440
with that are we both just conjoined

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:57.060
breaked it to your cap we got a no it

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:59.940
looks like it did it was it happened

00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:02.520
pretty fast there but we like lost rate

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:05.480
of fire because three dollar bill change

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:07.650
to something else and then we gained it

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:11.550
when we picked up the the coat hanger

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:13.590
plus we got a speed upgrade for lord of

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:18.030
the pit anyway I think but sure can join

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:21.450
how do I feel about it it's okay it's

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:25.220
it's a net increase always but it

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:25.220
doesn't always feel like it

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:30.110
seems like it's working pretty well a

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.880
Deadeye to be honest view so what are we

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:34.370
looking for now honestly anything that

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:36.110
keeps us from dying is is amazing like

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:38.929
this should be a win and it feels like

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:41.300
oh it feels like a me win which I like a

00:24:38.929 --> 00:24:42.710
lot you know there's a little rough

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:45.530
around the edges in terms of damage

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:47.090
taken but we ended up taking a little

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:48.920
bit of a lark on an item that didn't

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:50.510
necessarily at first glance although

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:54.980
probably people were screaming at the

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:56.360
screen like it's good take it but didn't

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:58.780
necessarily seem like a great item at

00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:01.010
first glance we took a chance on it and

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:05.870
turns out that it might be like

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:10.820
exceptional and now we've got a run

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:12.830
that's like crushing it Gary Vaynerchuk

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:14.920
style should just pop this have some

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:17.090
immunity like they are shooting at us

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:22.190
it's kind of naive to think that we're

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:24.410
going to be able to properly press the

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:26.360
button at all times might seem a little

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:29.210
mild the two seconds of invincibility is

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:33.440
actually incredible Pandora's box here's

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:35.030
the thing it's a lovely item if you get

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.559
it on the cathedral and you got nothing

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:39.440
better to do with your spacebar item

00:25:36.559 --> 00:25:46.610
slot but I really really do not wish to

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:49.090
get rid of telepathy at this point it's

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:52.010
too much fun

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:54.110
broken honk thankfully irrelevant I walk

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:58.220
into an enemy which is sacrilegious at

00:25:54.110 --> 00:26:02.110
this point now I am you might dispute

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:04.100
this I've chosen to take the HP upgrade

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:06.010
because I believe in the one-third

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:11.570
chance of our deal with the devil here

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:13.760
is it going to manifest the odds are not

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:15.290
in our favor we lost permanent polaroid

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.880
invincibility the dream is that

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:21.950
permanent polaroid invincibility like

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:24.710
basically won't matter we do only have

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:31.020
one orbital

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:33.870
okay so I really like telepathy versus

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:35.100
mom's heart that was amazing we didn't

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:36.390
get a deal with the devil so I feel a

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:38.550
little bit like an idiot but we're

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:43.800
moving on here nonetheless we are going

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:51.870
to absolutely slay blue baby we're

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:52.410
immune to bullets money is out of

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:54.570
control

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:57.810
for all this money having to luck as a

00:26:54.570 --> 00:27:00.540
little stinky but I just become butters

00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:02.160
there there's a little stinky

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.660
that's not a good butters impression

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.550
thank you to all the people who tweeted

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:06.720
words of support for my impression of

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:10.440
the lead singer of the crash test

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:12.450
dummies and that's one person who

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.770
tweeted who told you your impression of

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:16.470
the crash test that means is bad they

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:18.900
were wrong you know not exactly the

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:21.710
strongest words of praise ever but at

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:28.020
least on my side so I appreciate it

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:31.620
once there was a tweet that made me feel

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:36.330
more confident about my impression and

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:40.050
when there we go it finally came up I

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:43.620
screwed my notifications to the top had

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:47.460
a smile okay it's not I think I lost it

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:49.710
a little bit something to do with you

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:51.630
know you got to soak the vocal cords the

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:56.250
night before in you know quick dry

00:27:51.630 --> 00:28:00.660
cement and then you're like mm-hmm

00:27:56.250 --> 00:28:01.740
that sort of works okay don't even try

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:04.500
to shoot me like it's just embarrassing

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:06.180
at this point I believe so firmly in

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:09.300
this copy dream and I continue to just

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:11.730
be villainized forward by the game like

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:13.590
no guppy improvements you know what dude

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:19.670
you know what you know what dude you

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:23.940
know what give me a compass me a compass

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:26.460
mr. judge means bring me mapping bring

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:30.060
me rapping bring me a compass so that I

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:33.500
can see see sing would rhyme there but I

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:33.500
can already sing obviously

00:28:34.399 --> 00:28:41.490
restock there's no reason not to take it

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:43.529
there is one reason to take it I think

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:45.450
it drops like some consumables on the

00:28:43.529 --> 00:28:47.789
ground let's just think it like maybe we

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.720
could get a per throw rune but we should

00:28:47.789 --> 00:28:53.759
pick it up and maybe we'll get a

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:56.340
judgment card or something the bombs are

00:28:53.759 --> 00:29:01.740
key which is actually fine the Hermit

00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:06.240
card turned out to be useless but that

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:14.190
was not necessarily who stated in the

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:18.960
contract when just keep believing and

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:21.659
dreaming here finally found our boss

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:27.720
would like to dust you a little earlier

00:29:21.659 --> 00:29:33.690
than you allowed me to but alright so

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:37.740
blue baby maximize our telepathy usage

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:39.269
your dude it's so good then you use the

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:42.269
ticket that was bad obviously then you

00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:45.840
use the tears that he shoots as orbitals

00:29:42.269 --> 00:29:49.740
to crush him did you see that telepathy

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:52.169
I'm calling it eight out of ten nine out

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:55.070
of ten spacebar item there's some

00:29:52.169 --> 00:29:58.490
amazing stuff going on here

00:29:55.070 --> 00:30:02.990
well lots of zodiac items

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:07.009
Capricorn's lovely of course and I took

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:13.369
Scorpio but might as well take that

00:30:07.009 --> 00:30:18.119
there's no reason to take anything else

00:30:13.369 --> 00:30:20.389
from that room so we should crap on this

00:30:18.119 --> 00:30:22.919
run now it's a pretty fast one and

00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:26.539
honestly was a lot of fun it's like my

00:30:22.919 --> 00:30:26.539
favorite archetype for a run we've

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:32.159
learned a lot about the game got to use

00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:33.779
a new item use it properly I think on

00:30:32.159 --> 00:30:36.179
the first try which is rare if not

00:30:33.779 --> 00:30:38.730
properly then honestly decided out of

00:30:36.179 --> 00:30:43.049
control stigmata is worth approximately

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:45.230
nothing at this point I'd say but still

00:30:43.049 --> 00:30:47.030
nice to have there's still like a

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:49.180
theoretical chance we

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:51.830
could die if things go horribly wrong

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:54.200
but with nine lives and a decent amount

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:58.610
of HP you know we should be relatively

00:30:54.200 --> 00:31:00.710
set more of this room please

00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:02.090
I mean to be real with you like half the

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:04.550
damage we've taken since picking up

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:06.800
telepathy is from fire mined from three

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:08.180
dollar bills so I don't necessarily feel

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:10.160
like the Dodgers have been bad

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:24.260
maybe positioning has been terrible but

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:27.860
I'll look at this easy rares there's

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:32.900
really like no recharge time least it

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:34.190
feels like there's no recharge time so

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:36.230
don't don't hate me because I'm

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:38.540
beautiful I've had a couple of runs

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:41.090
lately where I've gone to delirium in a

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:43.220
row and they've been on day leaves and

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:44.630
I'm like everyone's gone oh it killed

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:46.520
these guys easily and then delirium just

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:50.030
roast me I'm going down I'm taking my

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:51.530
win I'm banking it the weakest link

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:53.720
style because I want this

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:55.160
