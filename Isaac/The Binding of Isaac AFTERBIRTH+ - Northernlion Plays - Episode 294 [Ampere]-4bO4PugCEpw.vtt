##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.130
everybody welcome back to Norton land

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.049
please abiding by Sanford plus some runs

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.980
you just ball out of control from the

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.170
get-go and this was one such run last

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.150
last run he had this run looks great as

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.760
well although I will admit I looked at

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.100
our items first it was like dope incubus

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.800
crystal balls decent HP then you look at

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.910
our stats three damage and 15 rate of

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.060
fire is pretty terrible JB DMS 4 a.m.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:33.450
but I think it's too simplistic to just

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.040
be like well you have an incubus so your

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.960
damage and your rate of fire are

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.300
basically doubled because it's it's

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.040
harder to hit with Incubus than it is to

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.920
hit with your own tears and it's even

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.809
harder day with both of them so I

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.670
wouldn't say I mean the speed up is

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.059
actually quite nice I wouldn't say that

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.969
it compensates for it but it does

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.379
compensate forward to a degree one thing

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.699
for sure it gives us lots of future

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.170
potential because as far as I'm

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.329
concerned every tiers upgrade every

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.550
damage upgrade and every tier effect is

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.199
worth slightly more maybe even a lot

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.309
more as a result of having Incubus it's

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.090
one of my favorite items in the game

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.740
without a doubt however man we did not

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.950
need to come to this room

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.930
however we are just a little bit I

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.180
wouldn't say underpowered but not as

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.350
overpowered as you would think given

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.820
what we're starting with here for

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.229
starting with one of the better space

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.150
bar items in the game and one of the

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.189
better passive items in the game we're

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.509
not quite looking at this run like it's

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.470
a foregone conclusion that we're going

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.570
to win to be fair we started our last

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.220
run without that knowledge as well and

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.280
it you know starting to ball out of

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.049
control within like seconds you know

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.430
what we got monstros lung and I think

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.899
our first item room and then after that

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.430
we got mom's knife in our first deal

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.329
with the devil and it was just like it

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.009
was over but it can still go both ways

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.220
as all I'm trying to say and you've got

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.700
to admit dude man that is one angry fly

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.229
he's flying around here going like AE

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.030
you jerk ol want to use your signal

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.399
lights stop ordering so many things in

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.340
the deli line you know yes that's right

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.560
angry fly is me

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.020
all I ask the deli line is one thing

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.790
that's that's quality of life if you're

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.060
watching this you don't use your turn

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.040
signals you

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.380
you turn signals it doesn't mean that I

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.480
am a bigger man than you that you took

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.770
advice from another man just and you

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.959
might not even be a man in the first

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.420
place there's plenty of women who don't

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.450
use their turn signals either just use

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.440
you it's no reason not to use your turn

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.140
signals I

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.290
I don't think Vancouver is one of the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.819
worst driving cities in the world but

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.099
it's definitely the worst I've ever

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.140
lived in traffic gets pretty bad

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.780
although not nearly as bad as Seattle

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.090
and people are jerks on the road

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.380
I still signal even though I talked to

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.280
people here and they go out on signal

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.870
because if I signal

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.069
someone's going to take the spot that I

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.720
was going to take when I was changing

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:57.760
lanes well then the onus is on them you

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.069
have made them into the jerk in this

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.080
situation and hopefully you can take at

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.330
least a great personal satisfaction in

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.680
that plus a much lower chance that

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.720
you'll actually die behind the wheel of

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.190
your automobile from getting you know

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.959
t-boned by somebody who doesn't know

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.819
you're coming anyway I digress

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:20.730
spider babby that's no good well it's

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:23.980
not very good at least and we're not

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.049
really well we haven't really gotten

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.690
stacked yet but this is what this floor

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.700
is for I mean we're killing it on spirit

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.810
hearts right now

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.690
why is it why I opened a video by

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.910
talking about driving dude oh you didn't

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.700
realize the whole point of my isaac

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.660
videos at this point is merely to slowly

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.790
but surely seed the weeding out of

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.709
things that I find annoying today it's

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.980
not using your signal lights trying to

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.120
think of what is going to be tomorrow

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.889
listening to music on public

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.459
transportation without using headphones

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:59.109
I mean what's wrong with you we live in

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.500
a civilized society or just use

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:04.209
headphones never in history has anyone

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.010
ever thought oh this song is so good I

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.900
bet everybody on the bus wants to hear

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.970
it and then right everybody just thinks

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.579
you're a jerk I'm trying to listen to

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.130
Paul Simon's magnum opus 1986 classic

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:19.769
Graceland you're over here you know

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:22.030
bumpin I don't know some trash music I

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.620
don't need to hear the next Kenny

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.720
Chesney song I have nothing against

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.680
Kenny Chesney it's just an assault on

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.090
the ears that I'm try

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.199
to listen to you know the boy in the

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:36.460
bubble I don't even know I'm almost out

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:38.110
of like mild I'm out of mild

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:43.690
inconveniences in my life at this point

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:45.850
I'm trying to think people who order at

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.160
a fast-food restaurant and then don't

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.889
move to the side after they order they

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.830
just stand at the machine waiting for

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.090
the server to tell them to move because

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.330
they don't understand how things work

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.820
okay I mean we're getting a little petty

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.910
once's we do know where our second

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.050
secret room is

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:09.370
since when does the wait that's our

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.960
regular secret room weird no it's not

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.449
that's our second secret room since when

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.650
does crystal ball or on shoes tell you

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.479
where the second secret room is I

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.650
thought neither of those gave you second

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:21.070
secret room I thought they only give you

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.110
the first secret room might be mistaken

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.699
tears office huge here and we're

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.280
actually like better than average tears

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:30.220
already a better than average starting

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.199
tears already and we'll just go down to

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.659
the next floor here so it's looking good

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:37.510
and multi-dimensional baby again it

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:39.070
stacks with Incubus in the sense that

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.599
you know we're firing more tears I'm

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.729
assuming when Incubus tears go through

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:49.599
multi-dimensional baby they become you

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:51.610
know augmented deus ex style whether

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:53.110
they do or not I think it's a it's a

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.630
positive get plus it gives us deal with

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:59.919
the devil president I'm still the jury I

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:01.300
mean the jury is not out on this I think

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.009
the most recent booster pack was

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.590
probably the best booster pack added a

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:06.520
lot of interesting items like the coupon

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:12.099
which I still have not used properly

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:12.820
telepathy which is amazing and edit

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:16.120
cetera et cetera

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:20.080
however okay so that doesn't give you

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:23.500
the man it must have been on suits they

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.930
gave us than that but the big thing for

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.220
like a super Isaac nerd level was the

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.349
fact that they changed the parameters

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.240
for deals with the angel so that you can

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:33.070
get different angel rooms and also

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.110
there's odd there's more variants that

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.430
have a tendency to be higher value as

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.450
well I didn't even see that dude there

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:46.270
the invisibility work

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:50.110
however Oh what have I done I don't know

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:55.500
if if we've really experienced the the

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:59.830
value of that yet golden bombs means we

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:01.210
go to town here um it's not that we have

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.700
not had good deals of the Angels just so

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.260
we've not seen them enough to really

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.730
draw conclusions about whether it's been

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.420
a meaningful change you know something

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:12.220
that more or less subtly impacts

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.960
something that only shows up like once

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:17.050
every 10 runs or something like that to

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:19.330
begin with it's hard to it's hard to

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.830
draw conclusions this early about how

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.120
it's actually changed you know it's only

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.800
been like two weeks since the booster

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:27.760
pack came out it'll take a little longer

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:30.220
to really understand the I just just

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.480
turn to purse runner to a penny so good

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.980
if you're wondering how I'm feeling

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.960
right now I just heard a poor throw run

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.690
into a penny but I got a smile on my

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:40.900
face because I'm feeling good it was a

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:44.890
very silly move though it did you know

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:46.150
nonetheless either way uh yeah so I mean

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:47.970
we're not going to see deals with the

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:50.830
angel on this run unless we get duality

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:55.000
we have given it our all if there's what

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:58.380
I wish there was a way to guarantee

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.580
deals of the angel that was more common

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.990
here's my problem with deals with the

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.400
angel if we're going to talk Isaac and

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.740
put everybody to sleep for a minute

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.330
deals in the angel are it's like the

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.940
crawlspace conundrum you know they're

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:12.100
not high-value enough to justify their

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:13.630
rarity right now you know crawlspace the

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.000
first twenty times you get a crawlspace

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:17.500
you go oh my god it's a free bit of

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.960
value and then you realize pretty soon

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:22.090
you know what's the highest chance

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.860
payout probably a trinket you don't care

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.690
about or like three cents or a chest

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.950
that has a troll bomb in it right you

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.720
just eventually you're like if it's not

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.520
a black market then a crawlspace

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:35.380
tends to not be worth much of a you

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:38.890
still always check deals with the angel

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:41.320
are still kind of like that but more

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:43.030
because they're just rare and even if

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.800
you do everything right to try to get

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:47.589
them to exist they don't always come to

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:50.800
fruition and that will be fine if you

00:08:47.589 --> 00:08:52.400
know they so often paid out with such

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.740
amazing stuff that it made sense

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.590
to dilute the certainty of them showing

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:59.300
up but I almost wish like if you skipped

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:01.820
one deal with the devil you were

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:05.300
guaranteed deals with the angel because

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:08.210
it is or at least historically has been

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:13.820
suboptimal to skip deals with the devil

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:15.560
I don't think you'd get let me put it

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.970
this way if I was guaranteed deals with

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:21.020
the angel by skipping a deal with the

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:23.300
devil most of the time I would still if

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:24.950
I have the HP I would still take a bad

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:27.620
deal with the devil to get precedent

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:31.400
because the pool is more consistently

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:33.050
good however I might be I'm basing that

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:36.800
off anecdotal evidence of my own

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:40.160
personal you know pet cause here so that

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:42.080
might not actually hold true with it

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.180
with data but I still think they should

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.890
be more likely if you if you make the

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.640
effort to skip a deal with the devil I

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.350
think there should be a higher

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.870
percentage chance of you going for angel

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:54.740
rooms of you getting angel rooms I

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:56.270
should say either way and it has to be

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:59.270
one you deliberately skip it can't just

00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:00.440
be one like oh I took damage and now

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.030
I've got deals with the angel because I

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:07.240
think that does maybe make it a little

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:10.190
too easy but regardless okay the runs

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:12.560
still completely fine still waiting on

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:15.200
you know the the run Buster did to tear

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.000
it wide open but it's fine we're getting

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.740
spirit arts fairly frequently we're

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.480
getting cards of some usefulness I'm

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.580
hoping we get some HP and we can make

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.110
this temperance card work on our arcade

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:26.000
and maybe get you know start to get a

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.620
chain get a little extra money we can

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.230
buy stuff in the shop get two blood bags

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.940
something like that but it's not an

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:35.120
immediate concern for us to make that

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:36.950
happen but and there are advantages even

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:41.780
early that was pretty bad but there are

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:43.070
advantages even early to having a only

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.720
spirit arts we can give in to this boss

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:48.520
Trap room without having to you know

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:50.710
pull anything anything funny here and

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:53.600
that was well worth it as you can tell

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:55.550
you can have no spirit or sorry have

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.920
only spirit arts so that you can get

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:59.510
into the boss trap room and pay for the

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.390
privilege to get a red heart that you

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:05.730
cannot use that is

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:05.730
the s the American dream right there

00:11:06.029 --> 00:11:15.279
Cuba meet is just a godsend man just a

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:17.230
wonderful item the other change that

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:20.380
while there are many changes I guess but

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:23.200
the other very noticeable and welcomed

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:27.269
change in the most recent booster pack

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:30.100
was making it so that the waves here

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:32.170
actually give you one charge for every

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:38.440
single one that you complete very very

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:43.269
nice you know what very very nice for

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:46.089
making it a little easier to get value

00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:47.470
out of your spirit hearts there sure we

00:11:46.089 --> 00:11:50.290
didn't get maybe as much value out of

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:52.000
temperance as we would have liked but we

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:54.370
got value out of temperance and charity

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.410
or a chariot I should say which was not

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:58.839
guaranteed in advance it's an item

00:11:56.410 --> 00:12:00.279
it's belong curse head we already know

00:11:58.839 --> 00:12:01.570
where our secret rooms are but I'm not

00:12:00.279 --> 00:12:04.660
going to turn out my nose at what is

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:08.589
essentially a free item spelunkers head

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:11.170
is not the best secret room enabler

00:12:08.589 --> 00:12:12.430
because we still have to use bombs you

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:14.170
know what it does allow us to see the

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:15.100
second secret rooms at least which I'm

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.930
telling you dude

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.730
start giving me some eternal hearts and

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:20.230
I mean I'll probably trade them away -

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:22.240
the deal with the devil immediately but

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:26.410
still like it would be a nice gesture

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:29.890
you got to admit drove on down here

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:31.329
secret room gives us a bomb okay let me

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:34.240
use a bomb to get into our shop instead

00:12:31.329 --> 00:12:37.420
of one key overall use another bomb here

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:41.170
we'll probably buy the item ok go

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:42.670
actually completely acceptable an item I

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:45.310
can't believe we didn't get hit there

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:48.880
but an item I quite enjoy and depending

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:50.440
on what kind of familiars we get as a

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:53.279
result of that it can be extremely

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.279
powerful as well

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:03.050
well unfortunately there's essentially

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:04.130
no way for us to allow come on what's it

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:08.510
what's the boy to do in that situation

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:09.800
there's no way for us to not give

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:10.910
ourselves a good chance of to deal with

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.380
the devil so we just have to hope that

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:14.930
we don't get a deal with the devil

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:17.690
and I guess I hope that that's lump of

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:19.490
coal and it's not crystal balls better

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:23.060
defensively and from a utility

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:24.890
standpoint you know this run is good by

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:27.050
the way based on the fact that we still

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:29.690
have two point nine six damage and I'm

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:32.360
not complaining that much I will start

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:34.880
to complain pretty quickly because this

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:39.710
you know these stats cannot stand

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:41.810
forever two point nine six damage does

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:47.900
not leave us with a lot of room for

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:49.910
error long term but short term we can

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:53.510
make it work especially with an orbital

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:56.960
and with Incubus like we're not totally

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:58.850
screwed but we really really need to amp

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:01.550
up our damage more so than our rate of

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:02.570
fire more so than our speed more so than

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:08.510
getting a new tier effects we need

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:12.940
damage ups mr. Dahle is good and dude we

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:15.200
lucked out for real on the on the

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:17.330
distribution of hearts that we got from

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:20.300
it and amazingly we're still on pace for

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:24.410
boss rush if we should like to go to it

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:26.240
but dude two point nine six damage this

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:29.990
many floors and is going to start to be

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:32.480
grading pretty soon to a club's all

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:34.100
right luckily like mr. Dahle essentially

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:37.280
nullified all the damage that we took

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.750
earlier on that floor so I'm feeling

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.370
good about that and we're still hoping

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:41.930
against hope that maybe you know the

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:44.420
gup-e dream could get started at some

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:49.310
point here we got to be able to devil

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:52.040
precedent perthro versus uh to a club so

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:54.140
it was pop to a clubs justice card okay

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:58.850
I mean slightly suboptimal to a clubs

00:14:54.140 --> 00:15:00.380
usage but I digress secret room doesn't

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:02.900
really border a room were that

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:05.110
interested in it's just a mob trap room

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.110
this time

00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:11.069
why I don't understand

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:12.899
we got a tears upgrade but our rate of

00:15:11.069 --> 00:15:14.880
fire was honor no our rate of fire was

00:15:12.899 --> 00:15:17.850
nine before it only became seven when we

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:21.899
got hit and a cup of milk spilled she

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:25.500
gives you a nice little tear delay bonus

00:15:21.899 --> 00:15:31.290
but sadly of course not meaningful most

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:33.690
of the time hangman range up we do need

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:35.310
range ups we probably are good now but

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:37.199
we started with like nineteen range and

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:39.240
nineteen range is a little on the low

00:15:37.199 --> 00:15:40.649
side for making sure that you can hit

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.730
things from across the map which is

00:15:40.649 --> 00:15:44.339
pretty important for us right now

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:46.350
because of the fact that our that was

00:15:44.339 --> 00:15:52.380
pretty bad the fact that our damage is

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:54.959
essentially non-existent oh I just punch

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:57.930
my microphone my apologies

00:15:54.959 --> 00:16:02.190
five bombs remote detonator / throw 99

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:04.889
bombs okay this is actually sweet but I

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:08.279
feel like you know we keep asking mom

00:16:04.889 --> 00:16:11.310
for a Playstation and you know she works

00:16:08.279 --> 00:16:14.040
hard but she's coming home with like you

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:15.689
know one of those 99 and one consoles

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.850
from Canadian Tire or something like

00:16:15.689 --> 00:16:19.230
that and like mom you don't understand I

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:21.839
know it's you

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:25.110
why would I pay $60 for one game when I

00:16:21.839 --> 00:16:27.209
could pay ten dollars $4.99 but this is

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:30.269
actually worse than like all of them put

00:16:27.209 --> 00:16:33.199
together so are that like good it's a

00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:36.480
waste of my time you don't understand

00:16:33.199 --> 00:16:40.860
it's like buying a hundred big wheels

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:42.029
instead of one Honda Civic it's not

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:44.040
going to give you what you need we're

00:16:42.029 --> 00:16:48.060
asking for damage we're not getting

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:50.040
damage that's it that's why you we got

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:54.779
them you got the bombs you take a chance

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:57.649
on that and we probably don't need the

00:16:54.779 --> 00:17:03.389
burnt penny anymore now we peep these

00:16:57.649 --> 00:17:05.400
magic must up to five damage five and

00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:09.569
five and change but to be honest with

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:12.089
you is not really exceptional but it

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:14.130
still it's a lot better and now we can

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:17.580
start to be happy again because like

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:19.170
five damage with Incubus with

00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:21.090
multi-dimensional baby you know there's

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:25.410
good stuff to be said about that and

00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:28.140
we're getting spirit hearts from crystal

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:30.150
balls so like life is good again I'm not

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.620
worried about boss rush it's always most

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:33.570
of the time at least on a daily I do

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:37.590
worry about boss rush but on runs like

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:39.930
this it's about pace kind of a tough

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:44.130
call because I like I like both of these

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:46.740
items jumper cable is newer so I'm going

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:48.900
to go for that but it is not too late

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:51.210
for there's options to be worth

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:53.700
something because we have bosses that

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:54.810
give us items up until like oh maybe we

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:58.800
can just run the math pretty quickly

00:17:54.810 --> 00:18:00.120
right we have this floor it won't affect

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.620
the next floor and it will affect the

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:04.380
room 1 but it won't affect the room - so

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.880
15 cents to get a choice of items on to

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.260
boss rooms I still think that's if

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.700
you're not doing anything else with the

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:11.250
money I think it's fairly worth it but

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:14.880
jumper cables probably stands to give us

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:18.570
more benefit here crack Jax's is fine

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:20.460
and sure let's take a some spades with

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:22.920
the crystal ball and expect to have a

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:24.600
chance to teleport out of our boss rush

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.340
but curse of the blind boss rush is like

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:29.550
one of these days I got to learn my

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:31.230
lesson that it's not worth trying to

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:34.200
make curse of the blind boss rush work

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:36.480
so many times we try to you know finesse

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:40.980
that combo into existence and it's just

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:45.630
it tends to be terrible so if we can

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:47.510
teleport I will I'll consider it but

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:51.750
without being able to teleport

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:52.680
guaranteed probably say no to it but

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:56.430
again there's a good chance we can

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:57.720
teleport and we can so everything that

00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:01.650
I've just said is completely for naught

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:05.340
as usual - more spirit hearts well worth

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:09.150
it probably not grossly interested in

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:10.440
our shop their current finances I don't

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:13.590
understand the concept of the bomb

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:16.350
judgment he almost always pays out with

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:18.720
bombs it's the weirdest value

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:20.430
proposition so I'm going to I need to

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.260
have a decent number of bombs to

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:24.360
consider playing it and then there's a

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:27.960
chance that he pays out with as many or

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:31.290
perhaps even slightly more bombs than I

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:35.490
gave him I don't this guy should pay out

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:37.500
thing other than bombs is there a more

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:39.180
band I would say this as somebody thinks

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:43.380
is one of the best games ever made is

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:46.650
there any reason to play this guy if you

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:47.610
don't have like I just can't tell when

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:48.870
you're supposed to play him do you play

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:51.210
when you have two bombs and hope to get

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:52.230
up to five you play what you have 99 and

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:56.670
then you're hoping to get you know like

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:57.690
a bomb synergy we got mama mega so no

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.880
who's the loser now

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.990
NL I'm going to use mama mega on this

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.090
floor just because I can

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:05.340
so again Don your blast shield for this

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:06.960
floor in this floor alone look at how

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:11.280
many tarot cards we got as a result of

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:14.580
this dude so I guess honestly I got what

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:16.260
I asked for I asked for a reason why you

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:22.470
would ever take this item and I

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:23.910
straight-up got one and now we can make

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:27.660
our shop worthwhile as well with two of

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:30.440
diamonds but I did get one because mama

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:33.030
mega is in many situations worth the

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:34.860
worth trying to finesse the game for

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:36.510
however I think that's also the first

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:39.270
time I've ever had mama mega payout

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:45.150
there so so we hermit and let me grab

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:46.440
the gyro rune and we will have to fight

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:48.390
those guys but I think it's only gonna

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:50.340
be like a turret ah no because we didn't

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:52.500
finish the room it might actually be the

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:55.200
full room but like if we can't kill a

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:57.360
full room on this run we don't deserve

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.190
our standing right now so we're going to

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:02.850
be completely okay in all likelihood

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:04.350
it's another hermit card which we should

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:08.480
take because apparently I didn't take

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:08.480
the last one which is very silly

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:20.330
it's popping the chariot out of

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:24.200
convenience more or less d-10 it's a

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:30.680
literal garbage item but kind of

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:34.840
interesting get dusted get dusted dude

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:37.430
multistage enemies you kill me here

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:45.050
you're diluting the usefulness of this

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:46.010
incredible mama mega pickup probably

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:47.960
should not have been yet there with

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:50.420
golden keys dude why not crack into it

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:54.260
these guys should be dead great news

00:21:50.420 --> 00:22:00.110
nightlight is actually good converter I

00:21:54.260 --> 00:22:03.820
mean I don't know let's use it once by a

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:05.810
spear at heart and then go to town here

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:10.280
what if we can get a luck upgrade I

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:12.740
can't remember I guess you can actually

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:14.600
get better angel chances by donating a

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:17.090
lot of money but it's still like by the

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:19.550
time that becomes useful in your run or

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:22.790
like likely in your run you're probably

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:24.920
past the point of being able to accept

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:26.420
angel rooms because you've already got

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:32.390
devil precedent which I believe

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:34.690
precludes it anyway all right mom get

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:34.690
roasted

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:43.150
take the polaroid take bottom-right item

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:47.650
just joking top left magneto wow what an

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:51.130
incredible turn of events Meg turn

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:54.480
nothing into Magneto that's the kind of

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:57.190
skill that pays the bills in this game

00:22:54.480 --> 00:23:00.160
their battery charge no there is not

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:02.800
anyway I mean it's not I'm not

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:04.900
complaining it's so much worse than the

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.100
last run but who cares you know we're

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.550
here we're playing we're having a good

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.830
time

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:11.260
the only thing that bums me out is that

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:13.360
five damage even with Incubus is pretty

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:17.230
low like five damage in a seven rate of

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:19.600
fire by the womb I like to be out of the

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:22.870
range of items that we could have you

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:24.820
know when we a range of attributes that

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:28.630
we could have by the time we start a run

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:30.070
you know on a really really good run you

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:32.830
could start with seven rate of fire and

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:34.780
five damage as even at least I mean even

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:37.660
Judas starts a 10 rate of fire and for

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:39.810
damage that's not meaningfully that far

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.810
away

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:46.480
but Judas doesn't start with Incubus and

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:48.670
that's what pays the bills on these on

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:52.300
these even runs anyways these starts

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:55.630
that are a little bit suspect and yet

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:57.340
you know you try to and I mean even this

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:59.790
is madman but you try to grind for the

00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:02.200
win instead of just taking the easy one

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:03.310
but if we've reached the point in which

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.680
I'm complaining about a run in as

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:07.840
Incubus and magic mushroom we're in kind

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.630
of a weird spot but I'm only complaining

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.740
because we only have Incubus in magic

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:14.710
mushroom we don't

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:18.010
mmm pyro admittedly we don't have too

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:20.680
much other great stuff but this should

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:24.190
be more than enough it's a weird spot

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:28.840
for that dude to spawn but far be it for

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:31.750
me to complain with 88 bombs we really

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:34.060
only have to do what we want to do for

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:38.350
the rest of this run up to the chest at

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:41.440
least I'm going to do every room that I

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:43.000
don't hate because every enemy that we

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.710
kill gets us you know one step closer to

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.880
getting crystal ball charged up and you

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:47.830
know over the course of this whole run

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.870
jumper cables could be worth like a

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:51.330
couple of

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:54.480
period hearts not to mention the mapping

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:56.790
it's not a particularly great

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.800
necessarily it could make the difference

00:24:56.790 --> 00:25:00.690
although I am just saving the charge for

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:05.160
you know the chance to get mapping on

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:06.900
the next floor now this is where you

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:11.150
look at it and you go and maybe there's

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:11.150
options wasn't the worst call because we

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:16.860
don't really want a second level Cuba

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:18.630
Meade right now unfortunately of course

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:25.830
we have no idea what we would get if we

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:27.960
had taken those options anyway so no

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:29.850
deal either but anyway we're down to the

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:32.910
next floor Yammer gets saved for the

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:34.380
chest and we've got a seventy

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:35.610
sixty-seven percent chance for a deal

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.620
example I always think of seventy

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:39.210
because I always assume that we've got

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.530
some sort of bonus that's going to take

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:43.920
us to the next level but that's not

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:45.300
always the case you know I thought we

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:48.559
had like pentagram or something but that

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:51.300
might have been the last run as well

00:25:48.559 --> 00:25:53.730
stuff it's tough because deep in my soul

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:56.010
I love the emperor card I also love the

00:25:53.730 --> 00:26:01.280
black rune and I think the black rune

00:25:56.010 --> 00:26:04.860
gets a little bit too little respect I

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:07.970
think it is almost as good as Yara I

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:12.090
think it has a I think it has a higher

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:16.110
or a comparable value expected value to

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:18.900
Yara but a more narrow range like Jarek

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:20.700
could give you eight awesome passes if

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:22.260
you're only able to take one Jarek could

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:24.450
give you eight awesome passives and

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:28.160
that's amazing or it could give you a

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:34.110
terrible actives and that's garbage

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:36.300
angry fly can use exactly the great

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:38.040
thing about black rune is that it it's

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:40.610
like a safety net if you get too many

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:46.380
terrible actives it turns them into

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:48.000
potentially okay passes so I really

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:52.250
really like black rune I think it was a

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.250
very positive addition to the game

00:26:52.690 --> 00:27:00.260
anything that adds in like a decision

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:02.300
that has to be made I think is positive

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:07.820
like a meaningful decision that has to

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:09.620
be made and black ruin definitely fits

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:12.980
the bill plus I just love like

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:16.430
aggregating passive stats as much as

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:17.630
that might seem ridiculous like I don't

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:21.650
know how many times I've said it like in

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:23.930
RPGs I'm the dude who takes the you know

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:26.870
1% extra chance to get a critical hit

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:29.000
over the dude who takes you know I Slams

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:31.790
I'm the dude you're yelling at in dota

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.880
because you level stats that's not trial

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:38.300
level stats but I also haven't played

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:40.970
dota in like four years so I've been

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:43.250
playing a little not much which is

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:45.320
amazing for a MOBA but complained a

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:49.940
little heroes of the storm lately and I

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:53.360
got to admit I understand to some extent

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:55.460
why people that are like really into

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:58.400
League or dota look down on it because

00:27:55.460 --> 00:28:01.250
it is like you don't buy items the games

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:04.660
are much shorter there's no last hitting

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:06.980
but like that casualization of MOBAs

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:10.340
it's got its hooks to me a little bit I

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:13.670
was like this is a distilled MOBA it is

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:15.470
it's less about preparation a little

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:17.300
less at least in my beginner level about

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:21.080
strategy but it still I like the MOBA

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:23.030
trappings that I kind of like so I in

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.680
it's a way like Kate's really into the

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:26.360
game right now I hesitate to use the a

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.880
word wouldn't necessarily say she's

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:30.080
addicted which is playing a lot of

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:33.380
here's this armor it's a way for us to

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:35.240
spend time together and if I'm like if I

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:37.580
can out myself as being like the most

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:40.130
low testosterone individual in history I

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:44.180
love playing support any game I love

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:46.570
playing support I think I if I have a

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:50.270
skill in video games which is debatable

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:54.620
it's like team awareness I can watch my

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:55.790
team and know at least allow me to

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.830
explain before this sounds like bravado

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:59.720
give a pretty good eye on the team and

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:01.340
know when you know oh this person needs

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.940
HP now okay they need the old because

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.580
they're going to rush

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:06.289
in there you know give them the give

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:10.429
them the uber charge you know it's from

00:29:06.289 --> 00:29:13.490
playing a lot of medic in tf2 I suppose

00:29:10.429 --> 00:29:18.340
but the the class at all these support

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:21.350
classes inherit from some extent but

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:29.090
mostly because I can't shoot I'm just

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:31.929
terrible at shooting or I don't know I

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:35.990
did like skill shots in dota like I

00:29:31.929 --> 00:29:38.480
again may surprise you played a lot of

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:41.960
invoker in dota 2 had a great time as

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:42.980
invoker I know you're saying NL how is

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:46.509
it possible that someone with a

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:58.190
single-digit IQ could play in Volkers

00:29:46.509 --> 00:30:00.830
quasi ex build easy easy money ok we can

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:02.600
stop talking dota now I think I'm past

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:04.820
the point where I mean for a DotA

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:06.500
relapse but I understand the pull of the

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.940
MOBA man that's the other thing that's

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:10.070
great about heroes of the storm is that

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:11.720
if you plant them again I'm not trying

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:14.899
to shield for Blizzard necessarily like

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:18.049
they're doing alright but if you want to

00:30:14.899 --> 00:30:20.840
play like 10 games of a MOBA in one day

00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:22.220
heroes of the storm allows you to do

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:26.799
that while also holding down a full-time

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:26.799
job so you know kudos to them for that

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:37.739
let's not make the same mistake we made

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:39.509
earlier in some bizarre twist of fate

00:30:37.739 --> 00:30:45.299
this run is actually going to be faster

00:30:39.509 --> 00:30:46.830
than our last one like we ignored the

00:30:45.299 --> 00:30:48.119
hush fight but we have the chance to go

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:49.710
through with osh fight which we did not

00:30:48.119 --> 00:30:55.669
have in our last I guess he spent a lot

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:58.889
of time like not really min maxing but

00:30:55.669 --> 00:31:01.019
taking advantage of like arcades and

00:30:58.889 --> 00:31:05.820
stuff like that that showed up so that

00:31:01.019 --> 00:31:06.239
we could pop off like crazy but come on

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:08.190
dude

00:31:06.239 --> 00:31:14.489
methinks the judgment does protest too

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:20.509
much Wow good kick good kick see you

00:31:14.489 --> 00:31:22.759
give a judgement money and he usually

00:31:20.509 --> 00:31:24.929
gives you not money

00:31:22.759 --> 00:31:30.210
that's a transaction that I

00:31:24.929 --> 00:31:35.749
fundamentally understand you give a bomb

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:39.599
beggar bombs and he gives you bombs or

00:31:35.749 --> 00:31:42.419
eventually a bomb related item but do

00:31:39.599 --> 00:31:44.190
you see what I'm getting at here it's

00:31:42.419 --> 00:31:46.950
also highlighted the absurdity of

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:49.739
gambling to me to some extent because

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:52.679
you put money into the machine and then

00:31:49.739 --> 00:31:55.679
you get money back or you don't it's not

00:31:52.679 --> 00:31:57.479
an exchange of goods and services it's

00:31:55.679 --> 00:32:01.710
literally I'm giving you money for money

00:31:57.479 --> 00:32:03.960
what a bizarre concept that being said

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:07.229
65 on the canucks to win the Cup next

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:10.799
year one in a thousand odds I'm getting

00:32:07.229 --> 00:32:13.290
that Tesla so Dean you can do it not the

00:32:10.799 --> 00:32:19.050
other sedin though

00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:19.770
now that lowlife peanut butter I'm

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:23.070
joking

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:25.290
Dennis pop okay lovers card nothing to

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:29.280
do the RHP should be under a million

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:30.630
percent fine we're just going to go back

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.610
and get that battery charge so we have

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:34.230
the immediate mapping for the next floor

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:37.710
we got lucky that jumper cable actually

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:39.330
did pay out with a charge in time for us

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:41.940
to use it we got the lovers card out of

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:51.380
it was worth zero but it was still worth

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:53.820
trying okay continue to get dusted Yun

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:56.220
Yair arun finally going to come to

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:57.360
fruition for us I feel this thing's

00:32:56.220 --> 00:33:03.540
going to give me a spirit heart

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:04.950
I was then hoping would give me a luck

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:06.660
upgrade out of those pennies so I could

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:08.220
spin it into well you know it'll drop

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:10.520
the spirit art for us later as a result

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:13.230
of our newfound luck but no such luck

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:16.110
pop it there's our spirit heart can't

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:18.330
spin it though let's go let's go it

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:19.740
you're in the spirit heart that was very

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:22.460
lucky because I did not plan for that

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:22.460
okay whoa

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:31.050
come on babe you got to try to double

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:36.650
these bad boys she's done it so now we

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:41.520
have to seraphim's to little stevens

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:44.370
tool robo babies to Samson's chains

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:47.460
these are a rare and to be precise but

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:49.350
this is a rare collection of familiars

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:53.070
that actually warrant

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:55.050
doubling it's not amazing they're not

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:57.030
like the greatest doubling I've ever

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:59.850
experienced in my life but it's it's not

00:33:57.030 --> 00:34:01.650
bad like crooked penny actually came

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:05.730
through pretty nicely for us here we

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:10.950
picked up like eight familiars on one

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:12.960
room that was pretty nasty but anyway I

00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:15.419
would expect that to basically be the

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:17.879
end of new stuff on this run we don't

00:34:15.419 --> 00:34:21.419
have an amazing luck stat or anything

00:34:17.879 --> 00:34:22.440
along those lines so I wouldn't I mean

00:34:21.419 --> 00:34:25.770
this run looks like it's going to be a

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:28.440
win fairly comfortably we never even

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:31.980
came close but it's a surprisingly like

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:36.360
not that powerful wind a7 rate of fire

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:38.550
and 5.32 luck on paper let me put it

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:40.620
this way you go down to the cosmo you

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:42.240
look at the odds i don't think they're

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:44.340
giving us great odds in this run right

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:45.990
now however it just goes to show you the

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:48.210
power of friendship you know

00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:51.960
okay goes doing great stuff for us

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:54.330
Incubus is doing great stuff for us and

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:57.030
mysterious baby it's doing what it can

00:34:54.330 --> 00:35:00.090
and this is holding us up in this in

00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:01.590
this run in which statistically we're

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:06.030
probably a little bit underpowered so I

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:08.160
would love to kill lust last yeah it was

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:12.420
like it's just not conceivable in all

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:13.980
likelihood we may never get another

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:16.440
chance to use crooked panty but even if

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:19.140
we don't it did what it could when it

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:20.670
could and that's what matters two point

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:22.980
three to luck is usually good for like

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:27.030
an item drop but you know it's a

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:28.500
variable chance so we could get six item

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:31.410
drops in our next six rooms or we can

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:36.450
get zero both of them are are somewhat

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:37.800
within the realm of plausibility the

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:39.840
only one that's confusing me as peepers

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:42.960
I owe no we definitely have to peepers

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:45.600
eyes going around all right so first

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:48.030
swallowed penny play did not come across

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:49.920
the way I wanted but you know what at

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:53.780
least it doubled everything else for us

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:53.780
on the room that actually was huge

00:35:53.810 --> 00:36:01.020
farting up one regular chest doesn't

00:35:56.190 --> 00:36:03.150
matter to me as much I mean I'm self

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:08.990
flagellation will come later it's always

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:11.640
time for that look at this room let's go

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:13.260
what kind of person would I be I think

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:15.030
it let's get it out of the way we don't

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:17.690
have that many keys so I'm going to open

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:17.690
these ones

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:23.160
none of these are that useful right now

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:25.070
I'm going to hedge my bets and open

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:27.150
these ones as well

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:29.460
mr. mega is pretty good and we should

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:33.330
just take static tears because those are

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:36.220
cool everything else we can afford to

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:39.740
lose so we should double

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:42.070
and then we'll open like another two

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:45.680
here and just see how it looks

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:46.910
why not let's get weird with it okay

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:53.540
everything else you can afford to lose

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:56.000
so let's double he's done it we don't

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:58.630
have any more keys at this point so we

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:04.160
might as well just crack into him dude

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:09.590
okay this is actually madness let me out

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:10.220
of this crazy place I can't believe that

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:12.860
worked

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:15.560
I mean we don't have the keys to make it

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:18.230
really work we just created like a 32

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:20.270
items second secret room that's a rarity

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:24.230
so you know what this run add a little

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:27.140
something going for it in the end it's a

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:30.920
very strange array of tiers to finish

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:33.440
this one off alright maybe we should

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:35.660
just shoot straight I was trying to get

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:37.580
like some cool technology zero tears

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:40.280
going but I'm not sure how well as

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:41.810
working out tech zero I'm still trying

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:44.420
to solve I haven't figured that item

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:45.590
completely out yet either way not bombs

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:46.880
or key so we're out of here

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:48.110
