00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.700
hey everybody welcome back to her on the

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.110
line play of the binding of issac actors

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.710
plus we've been doing well on dailies

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.389
yesterday we were like 100 and something

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.830
give me a second today is an Iran that

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.490
goes to Mom's foot so we'll be looking

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.139
for seams unfortunately and yeah

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.359
yesterday one point four nine percent

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.770
with the rank of one to four the day

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.840
before that we were one point four eight

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.939
percent with a rank of one point there

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.769
one hundred and twenty first three

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.900
ranking points different point zero one

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.250
percent relative rank difference top

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.830
score today right now is fifty one

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.630
thousand the top front page is thirty

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.880
seven thousand two fifty one thousand

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.440
thirty seven thousand seems indicative

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.600
of a run in which you can go a little

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.190
further and this is my airplane

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.710
captain's voice thank you for boarding

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.020
daily Airways we're looking at a nice

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.210
smooth short hop to Mom's foot today

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.190
unless we die in the process sorry

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.510
didn't mean to say that

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.360
save that for now okay and we've been

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.750
getting you know back basically not

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:05.100
perfect plate with decent play in Isaac

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.659
an eve run is always a nice test because

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.610
we with a half spirit art especially

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.290
early I mean obviously I prefer have a

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.060
full spirit art or maybe we can blow up

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.470
this tinted rock and give to spirit arts

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.920
and then you know the world's our oyster

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.530
but we can get the whore Babylon pretty

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.869
quickly or we could choose to trade that

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.240
for the relative safety of having a

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.180
little bit more HP I'm not going to take

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:32.460
the pill yet I'll dude we need to that's

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.759
so nice we need to get a bomb one bomb

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.200
can turn into like three spirit hearts

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.549
if we get the right kind of payouts from

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.860
these tinted rocks but for now I'm not

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.689
going to sweat it too much so in terms

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.500
of seams one thing that's worth looking

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:49.500
for is earlier self-sacrifice rooms that

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.570
I normally worry about because like I

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.600
usually go oh it's the depths to when we

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.729
finish the run and mom we should stop at

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.020
the depths too and look for a self

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.369
sacrificing room and if there is a one

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.810
I'm like I probably missed one unlike

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.710
the caves to or something like that

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.450
so if possible we could make that happen

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.640
a little earlier that might be the way

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.830
forward or it might be you know the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.480
sirens song and we should tie ourselves

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.010
to the mast and try to

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:22.190
make it work regardless we have a tell

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:24.410
we had a card we should take blank card

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.580
as the thing so I'm going to use that

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.750
and of course we're not going to get the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.280
full damage bonus forever here but blank

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.140
card is too good to pass up obviously

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.540
we're not going to get a chance to go to

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.040
our shop so hopefully we get a bomb from

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.840
this fine I'll even take like matchbook

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.890
matchbook is basically like a bunch of

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.150
HP Ups probably if we if we get the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.739
spirit oh it's out of the tinted rocks

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.690
or not I don't know like a golden chest

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.510
that's full of garbage or something like

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.239
that but what do you got for me here

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.340
torn photo lovely item thank you very

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.060
much I'm going to take the pill and neva

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.060
no worries down to the next floor with

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.610
drastically improved DPS and a much much

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.220
better active item than you start with

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.450
on this run and really nothing to

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.040
complain about which leaves me in an

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.010
awkward spot for commentary because it's

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:20.600
kind of like my brand is like mild

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.519
inconvenience magnified by like you know

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.720
a hundredfold to make it seem as if it's

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.870
the worst thing ever I actually have

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.600
people there's been like an NL backlash

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.489
maybe not like genuinely but there's a

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.470
lot of like devil's advocate and Chad

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:37.130
now I need to go back over the rules of

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.950
all the NL SS bits which is that they're

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.440
satire like people actually I still to

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.120
this day you know we talk about the deli

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.130
counter situations occasionally on the

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.450
show where I like get a little cheese

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.310
the people have ordered too many meats

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.840
at the deli counter monopolize the deli

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.850
counter workers time and then you know

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.989
monopolize my time they could take a lot

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.910
longer for me to get through the grocery

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.530
store people go well shouldn't they be

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.440
able to do whatever they want of course

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.670
it's a free country you know but I'm

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.950
going to complain about it anyway

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:08.239
because it's it's on brand baby it's on

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:11.000
brand okay okay okay you definitely take

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.590
Incubus the door is not open but by

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.420
taking Incubus we actually are able to

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.600
stick with this item here it's always

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.489
satire I'm surprisingly you would you

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.039
would be surprised maybe it's because of

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.200
my low testosterone count he says as a

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.780
bald man who got shoulder hair at the

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.300
age of 15 but I'm on I'm

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.280
nice person like in real life I don't

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.130
when I'm at the deli counter I don't

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.570
Larry David it up and go hey how many

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.770
hands you get in there buddy like what's

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.490
the meaningful difference between a

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.139
Tuscany ham and a rosemary ham instead I

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.530
just go on my phone and I tweet about it

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:48.139
and I'm like technically I can write off

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.419
this phone bill because it's work no

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.220
that's I don't know if tweeting about

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.320
being mad at the people in the deli

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.990
counter is work or not but you know

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.230
that's that's for the Canadian Tax

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.450
Service to decide we are actually

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.880
balling out of control to a ridiculous

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:08.360
degree early on on this run there's

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:11.630
nothing we can do except take sulfuric

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.150
tears so we might as well like not

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.650
belabor the point too much of course the

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.880
irony is that after getting the sulfuric

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:24.770
tears we could basically go to the

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:26.240
reroll machine if we wanted to but sadly

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.040
the irony doesn't really apply here so

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.110
we can find a second secret room there's

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.950
a lot of tails what makes you small

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:38.630
amnesia verb give us another one makes

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:40.100
you small kill infested and I can see

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.660
forever which actually should allow us

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.810
to more easily make it into our shop

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.070
here wherever you can't buy anything but

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.380
that's okay what if we shoot this guy

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.669
can he ever nah maybe if there was like

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.660
a rock on top of it we could have

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:55.280
exploded him but there we go we got a

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.830
golden chest the golden chest was

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.780
actually really really good I still

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.660
don't think we can get anything in our

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.910
shop and get a car we might as well get

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.130
a card like blank our death is not

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.479
particularly strong but at least it's

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.460
something to do with blank art and

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:13.400
honestly I don't know how you could have

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:16.340
done much better on those floors right

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:21.020
there we made it work for us pretty

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:22.910
nicely and we do I mean lacking a little

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.160
bit in the consumable department but our

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:28.240
damage is ridiculous and I don't know if

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:34.940
maybe we're you know we've got perhaps a

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:35.990
better bead on our DPS than the average

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.669
person would have on this or I mean

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.409
Tammy's head is a lovely item but on a

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:40.490
run in which you're trying to look for a

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:41.840
seam I think blank card

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.490
is more valuable even though Tammy's

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:48.500
head is obviously like ridiculously

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:50.060
strong as well um playing card high

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.830
priestess I don't know I kind of feel

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.389
like blank card death is a little better

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.139
okay sure

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:59.479
just for like room-clearing purposes but

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:02.120
they're both great of course secret room

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:05.030
maybe that would have found it that

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:07.130
would have found it but what I mean is

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:09.770
like I don't think we're the only person

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.360
who's gotten a you know ten point

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.949
whatever DPS right now or ten point

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.509
whatever damage I should say but we

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:18.770
might be in the small minority there

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:20.150
depending on how the first run went for

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.250
people or the first floor went for

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.620
people I should say or we might be you

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:26.539
know running with like 80% of the the

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.979
crowd right now I got no freaking ideas

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:29.449
the thing and that's what's exciting

00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:31.280
about dailies is thinking that you did

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:32.840
really well and not realizing until

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.610
slightly later that actually you

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.669
performed you know above average but

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:39.710
nothing more complicated than that

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:42.530
another one makes you small which

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:44.780
honestly at this point I think kind of

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:49.310
past the point of absurdity two of those

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:56.810
is enough trying to you know eke out an

00:07:49.310 --> 00:08:00.199
extra magic mush if possible does take

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:04.449
us a couple extra seconds but the idea

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:04.449
is it could pretty easily be worth it

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:14.870
secret room could be I still a hold out

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:15.650
hope this could be our secret room let's

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.930
go

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:19.400
we got a verb pill it gives us I don't

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.110
know what the last pill we took was we

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.699
should try to get a good pill and then

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:24.590
we'll feel about things a little

00:08:22.699 --> 00:08:28.729
differently so this is free access to

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:30.050
our item room which gives us a key which

00:08:28.729 --> 00:08:32.959
we can use to go in our shop you got to

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:36.440
get restock and you probably want to try

00:08:32.959 --> 00:08:38.659
the office so good I was going to say

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.610
blank card a playing card is another one

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:42.050
that probably interests you if you're in

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:45.140
there because death is good but a to of

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:47.990
something is way way better so you start

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.490
with restock and we get a blank card

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:52.070
High Priestess again we got a key which

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:54.209
is nice and then blank card card against

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:57.660
humanity is like actually

00:08:54.209 --> 00:08:59.939
good I want the death card but I don't

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.459
want to buy anything else think it's

00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:03.360
actually good like financially speaking

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:07.050
but you know me

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:08.759
same old G I'm not going to spend my

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:12.899
whole life worrying about making sure

00:09:08.759 --> 00:09:14.429
that we use a blank card card against

00:09:12.899 --> 00:09:16.499
humanity every four rooms that's a

00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:18.059
recipe for like an 80 minute daily and

00:09:16.499 --> 00:09:20.699
sure maybe you get a good rank out of it

00:09:18.059 --> 00:09:22.470
but that's never been like my Platonic

00:09:20.699 --> 00:09:25.439
ideal for The Binding of Isaac so I

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:28.889
think I'd be content not doing that

00:09:25.439 --> 00:09:30.449
give me one penny please thank you this

00:09:28.889 --> 00:09:31.829
is important because now we can get an

00:09:30.449 --> 00:09:35.850
arcade on the next floor

00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:37.949
I was almost like the start of bunky

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.959
town it's just important because we can

00:09:37.949 --> 00:09:41.540
get some arcade done and I have a nerd

00:09:39.959 --> 00:09:43.740
funky town in like 20 years

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.749
yeah that's right last time I heard it

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:53.399
was when I was 8 when it was popular in

00:09:45.749 --> 00:09:55.350
1973 um I mean it's a tough call is

00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:57.119
basically what this comes down to I

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.860
think we can afford to lose Whore of

00:09:57.119 --> 00:10:00.059
Babylon for its years upgrade I'm just

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.189
going back to our curse room because we

00:10:00.059 --> 00:10:04.259
can basically and it might be a

00:10:02.189 --> 00:10:05.910
ill-advised decision but we've earned a

00:10:04.259 --> 00:10:08.220
little bit of damage in the pursuit of

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.869
something greater I think and honestly

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:13.259
as far as I'm concerned that's pretty

00:10:09.869 --> 00:10:15.629
good way I had a schedule to but we

00:10:13.259 --> 00:10:17.220
should I think we should grab it in the

00:10:15.629 --> 00:10:18.389
hopes you know we have 10 cents we can

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:22.649
get an arcade on the next floor we

00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:25.079
should have like a caves one caves one

00:10:22.649 --> 00:10:26.220
we should have a 60 something maybe 72

00:10:25.079 --> 00:10:27.929
percent chance of getting a deal with

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.309
the devil so we have an evil based item

00:10:27.929 --> 00:10:31.679
in the form of Whore of Babylon I think

00:10:29.309 --> 00:10:35.369
but um we should have a pretty good shot

00:10:31.679 --> 00:10:37.379
to get 67 okay we should have a pretty

00:10:35.369 --> 00:10:40.499
good shot to lose our HP productively or

00:10:37.379 --> 00:10:41.819
otherwise here and I mean even still we

00:10:40.499 --> 00:10:43.350
still have five damage I actually didn't

00:10:41.819 --> 00:10:44.850
realize how much Whore of Babylon helps

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.429
I guess if you lose Whore of Babylon

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:51.329
then you lose the extra damage that's

00:10:47.429 --> 00:10:53.429
being doubled yeah I think we take it

00:10:51.329 --> 00:10:56.249
you lose the extra damage that's being

00:10:53.429 --> 00:10:57.420
doubled as well well our rate of fire is

00:10:56.249 --> 00:11:00.350
ridiculous but I think I've lost

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.350
sulphuric Tears

00:11:01.579 --> 00:11:07.890
and dude I actually think this is great

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.970
the one thing I'll say about technology

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.860
is it's really nice if you can get a

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:13.110
homing tears along with it

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:14.579
because sometimes the hitbox is like

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:16.860
deceptive you think you're hidden but

00:11:14.579 --> 00:11:19.560
you're slightly off for whatever reason

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:24.990
but this is still very good and this is

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:27.600
our damage at its worst that was pretty

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:31.230
bad but this is our damage at its worst

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:32.820
like it is never going to be worse than

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.260
this damage unless we get like a curse

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.550
of the blind soymilk or something like

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.320
that all we need to do is get back in

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:39.540
the Whore of Babylon state hopefully we

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.980
can do so by picking up a deal with the

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:44.190
devil that improves us as well and then

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:44.820
we're like very extremely off to the

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:46.740
races

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:48.839
I'm still banking on this arcade because

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:50.480
there's that mob trap room that I can't

00:11:48.839 --> 00:11:54.510
access right now

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:56.130
might as well peep this we could replace

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:58.010
the death card it's not that good blank

00:11:56.130 --> 00:12:04.440
cards Stars blank card Wheel of Fortune

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:07.529
well I guess blank cards stars actually

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:09.660
makes a lot of sense right now as we do

00:12:07.529 --> 00:12:15.089
know there's our arcade as we do not

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:17.100
have many keys and the chance that maybe

00:12:15.089 --> 00:12:18.690
we could use this to teleport out of

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:25.800
some rooms we don't want to do if there

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:30.440
are rooms we don't want to do we don't

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.440
know this pill yet there's whore Babylon

00:12:30.769 --> 00:12:37.290
gimpy that's a great pickup let's take

00:12:34.199 --> 00:12:39.300
the pill it's 48 our Energy's blank are

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:42.560
the stars we can use like immediately I

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:46.199
don't really want to play the judgement

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:47.820
it doesn't really interest me playing

00:12:46.199 --> 00:12:50.370
card hermit I think you just use the

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:52.529
Hermit open this bad boy up we don't

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:54.930
want anything in here grab this move

00:12:52.529 --> 00:12:56.279
along okay but what I will do and we're

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.540
so far ahead of schedule I'm still

00:12:56.279 --> 00:12:58.860
freaking out I'm like you know we got to

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.959
go fast we got to go fast we probably

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:02.190
don't need to go that fast you blow the

00:13:00.959 --> 00:13:05.600
judgment for the ridiculous

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:07.550
deal with the devil chance

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.020
and you know what I'm going to do one

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:12.620
last thing here that I think makes sense

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:14.030
and apply a 3-cent spirit art as a

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.980
regular heart that's what I meant to say

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:21.500
but I'm gonna buy a 3-cent heart and the

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:23.150
idea is extra gimpy chances no such luck

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.970
and we could buy spirit hearts and go to

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:27.440
like or try to go to a self-sacrifice

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.550
room because we do not as of yet have a

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:32.800
seam right we already picked up

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:35.420
technology right forgot about that one

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:38.000
there's not really a waste I mean it's

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:40.280
just a very very slight waste of time if

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.650
anything but I forgot that we had

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:47.270
already been where we needed to go on

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:52.520
this floor so in all likelihood we will

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:56.120
get a deal with the devil Abaddon is a

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:57.500
great choice working towards guffy is a

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.940
great choice all that we got to realize

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:02.540
you know we're at 11 minutes and

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:05.750
whatever in this run right now so we

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:08.300
only have like two floors left after

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:13.760
which point the run is over unless we

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:14.960
find a seam so I think if we find it's

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:20.570
tough because you don't want to miss

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:23.090
Vause rush like the dream is a good

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:27.470
pivot there was our other pill 48 our

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:29.690
energy bad necessarily oh that's pretty

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:32.180
good the dream is you teleport out of

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:34.160
boss rush after you finish it you grab

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:35.600
the self-sacrifice room and then you go

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.010
to the lam fight I actually think we've

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.380
got the chance for that you know we got

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:41.600
8 HP and we got a teleport card it's

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:44.030
basically all we need

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:46.670
you are not Krampus which is great news

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:48.200
let's grab this grab this we really want

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:50.450
to be in the Whore of Babylon State so

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.710
I'll take that we might not get the

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:54.110
polaroid so I don't think there's any

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:55.730
cost to having one red heart if anything

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:57.680
is just you know fodder for a future

00:14:55.730 --> 00:15:03.380
deal with the devil so I'm not against

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:05.000
it I felt this way on like the past the

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.590
past two dailies and my ranks haven't

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.970
really reflected they haven't been bad

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:10.130
in fact they'd been they've been pretty

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:13.670
good but they haven't really reflected

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:15.470
how well I thought that I had played or

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:17.030
at least do you know how many points I

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:18.819
thought that I'd gotten relative to the

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:23.169
norm

00:15:18.819 --> 00:15:25.689
but I really think today we've got a

00:15:23.169 --> 00:15:27.539
good steak on having like a decent

00:15:25.689 --> 00:15:31.929
decent run

00:15:27.539 --> 00:15:38.829
we've only been hit maybe twice like by

00:15:31.929 --> 00:15:41.199
by enemies so I really think and and we

00:15:38.829 --> 00:15:43.809
have like almost every upgrade that I

00:15:41.199 --> 00:15:45.819
could have conceived of having on a run

00:15:43.809 --> 00:15:47.799
that's that's this short relatively

00:15:45.819 --> 00:15:49.989
speaking so I'm really thinking that

00:15:47.799 --> 00:15:55.329
today we got a chance at that top 50 but

00:15:49.989 --> 00:15:57.579
we need to find the seam and that would

00:15:55.329 --> 00:16:00.970
at least for me be like the symbolic

00:15:57.579 --> 00:16:02.979
closing oh nice yeah we don't need that

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:06.489
yet because we can take both of these

00:16:02.979 --> 00:16:08.319
actually and be fine and then go back

00:16:06.489 --> 00:16:11.470
and snag the HP if we want to anyway or

00:16:08.319 --> 00:16:14.019
you know don't take it and then we can

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:16.209
take HP on the next floor I I'm going to

00:16:14.019 --> 00:16:17.799
avoid placenta and I'm really on the

00:16:16.209 --> 00:16:18.759
fence about this this was like you know

00:16:17.799 --> 00:16:20.229
if you're looking for your homework

00:16:18.759 --> 00:16:21.429
question for the day not that I should

00:16:20.229 --> 00:16:23.049
be the one assigning it to you

00:16:21.429 --> 00:16:28.439
considering how I've played an Isaac

00:16:23.049 --> 00:16:28.439
recently but oh dude sack boy no doubt

00:16:31.799 --> 00:16:39.069
but why don't I take the center there

00:16:35.679 --> 00:16:44.850
I'm thinking that it's probably related

00:16:39.069 --> 00:16:47.619
to the life steal the life steal seems

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:49.509
not lifesteal but life gained it just

00:16:47.619 --> 00:16:52.299
seems like if I pick up super bandage or

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:53.829
something like that then I could

00:16:52.299 --> 00:16:54.939
accidentally take myself out of the

00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:56.889
Whore of Babylon state which would

00:16:54.939 --> 00:16:58.449
really compromise our pace but then you

00:16:56.889 --> 00:17:00.429
might just argue well why not just not

00:16:58.449 --> 00:17:02.859
take you know super Vantage if it shows

00:17:00.429 --> 00:17:04.240
up oh yeah okay but a couple of points

00:17:02.859 --> 00:17:06.370
there that I would like to make crystal

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.259
the blind is one of them if we never

00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:09.429
pick up items that could be bad with

00:17:08.259 --> 00:17:10.839
curse of the blind we'd never pick up

00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:13.000
items on curses of lying to begin with

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:15.339
and now you maybe you're saying now

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.929
you're getting it except for this that's

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:18.879
not the way I like to live my life here

00:17:16.929 --> 00:17:23.949
I like to live my life like this no

00:17:18.879 --> 00:17:26.319
tomorrow we got so much time here we I'm

00:17:23.949 --> 00:17:28.149
not going to fight on that room unless

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:30.790
we get like a feels like I'm walking on

00:17:28.149 --> 00:17:34.390
sunshine or something like that but

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:37.330
and see good reason not to explore at

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:41.200
this point and moreover it's it's mostly

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:43.480
just that like placenta seems like it's

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:46.750
more harm than good like we never want

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:48.010
the live steel if we only want one red

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:50.110
heart container there's better

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:52.600
opportunities to get those probably in

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:54.429
the future we got nine lives anyway so

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:57.210
nine lives is actually by the way a

00:17:54.429 --> 00:18:01.600
great choice for us when it comes to

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:03.640
doing self-sacrifice rooms because each

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.770
one of those is basically an HP upgrade

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:11.730
so we're looking for self sacrifice on

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:14.710
this floor and I think we have a genuine

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:17.110
chance to make great things happen if we

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:18.970
can find a dude if this is a - of deep

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:21.160
pockets is the greatest purchase because

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:23.049
now we can start doubling things while

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:25.840
also having a teleport card so we can do

00:18:23.049 --> 00:18:28.120
boss rush and then escape from the we

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.620
just use this there is a self-sacrifice

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:32.320
room so we have our we have our angle

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:34.030
now we've done it this is like where and

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.950
it's not the two of I want it but this

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:38.980
is where like the audience starts to

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:40.720
clap for us because you know we landed

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:43.570
the Space Shuttle on the moon that's not

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:46.179
you actually when the lunar module on

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:48.880
the moon okay look thank you for your

00:18:46.179 --> 00:18:51.790
service this country owes you a great

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:57.870
debt now shut the hell up and let me do

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:57.870
my job you don't need any of these

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:04.110
okay okay got our secret room flatworm

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.900
does nothing but we'll pick it up

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:11.330
because bloody penny is potentially like

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:13.740
actively deleterious in all honesty

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:15.210
probably are correct play oh we have

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.590
golden keys nevermind I'm gonna say like

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:18.330
we don't need to explore anything but

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:19.950
with golden keys you might as well and

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:23.400
I'll come in here I'm not taking Isaac's

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:26.120
heart you know I'm grizzled old veteran

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:28.650
I know you're you young pups out there

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:30.240
young dumb and full of something that

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:34.250
starts with C and ends with something

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:34.250
that rhymes with you know Byzantium

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:39.030
chrysanthemums no it's not

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:42.570
chrysanthemums are like yeah I gotta get

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:45.960
on my motorcycle and do a wheelie to

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:48.000
impress the chicks that I can pass on my

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.530
genes you know I'm past that I don't

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.590
need to do this games version of a

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:54.480
wheelie which is okay you didn't drop

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:57.210
just used 2 of hearts we got stars

00:19:54.480 --> 00:20:00.929
we got lovers just use lovers take these

00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:03.870
with you avoid all complications I don't

00:20:00.929 --> 00:20:08.100
need to do a wheelie I'm getting up I'm

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:09.510
into my 30s you know I'm not into my

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:11.190
thirties but I'm getting into my 30s I'm

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:14.730
a little old before my time I'll be the

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:16.230
first to admit that but you know I don't

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:20.340
need to impress ladies either I have a

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:23.760
wife you know what she likes ooh tell me

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:25.590
more about how you know you own your car

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.800
what we don't is paid off next year but

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:30.330
and you know your credit score is good

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:32.790
that's what that's like the 30-year old

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:36.120
version of doing a wheelie is like you

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:38.550
want to get brunch we can even get like

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:41.390
an appetizer that sounds lame you don't

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:45.110
know what the heck you're talking about

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:47.660
it's the greatest thing in the world

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:51.650
okay let's

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:53.750
I mean okay sad I wish there was a

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:55.480
battery you know what we're going to get

00:20:53.750 --> 00:21:01.430
so many charges

00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:04.100
we should buy like one thing I like

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:06.560
having no curses we can actually buy two

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:08.240
things for certain and then the rest of

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.740
these are very debatable so we still got

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.690
to a diamond stars high prices we don't

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:14.540
need these we need to a times we've

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:17.690
stars okay let's go

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:19.160
I think I'm pickup ready we might as

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:21.170
well check this we got tons of time I

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:24.680
don't want to mess this up this is like

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:26.180
an actual chance at a great run well it

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:28.640
turned out to be a good decision to buy

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:32.930
mom's key so don't take this card yet

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:34.520
this is a bad decision so don't take

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:38.750
this pill I should say scary to this one

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:41.660
to a hearts to pop it credit cards we

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:44.360
just pop it it ruins the Steam sale to a

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:45.890
diamonds pop it get that trash out of

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:48.860
here we need the teleport card as the

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:52.250
thing moons fine sure the stars is what

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:53.570
we've been using don't even don't even

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:55.010
give it a chance to get messed up just

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:58.790
go fight just go fight we don't need to

00:21:55.010 --> 00:22:01.340
double just go fight sure there might

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:04.100
have cost us ever so slightly but we

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:08.180
have the right permutation of items

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:10.940
right now this has been handled

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:13.790
relatively properly I think good work

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:17.060
team so we do take polaroid and then I'm

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:22.940
boss rush oh that's why you don't take

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:24.590
placenta magic mush has very slightly

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:28.070
improved our damage because I already

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:31.820
have crickets head but I mean what I

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:34.010
guess you think mr. mega there let's do

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:38.180
it I don't know the speed upgrade is

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:39.740
like relatively worth it shouldn't is

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.330
still there yeah I mean who could have

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.560
predicted that right I'm going to drop a

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:44.530
bomb in the middle just so our

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:46.940
technology shots are more likely to hit

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:49.610
everything you know the faster we do

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:55.130
that the easier life's going to be it's

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:57.400
a word like actually extremely high on

00:22:55.130 --> 00:23:00.800
points relative to where we normally are

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:02.690
on a run that's made it to this point

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:08.450
sixteen thousand before even beating

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:11.320
boss rush is very very very good there

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:13.820
is an enemy somewhere presumably

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:16.730
destined to get the dentist that that

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:17.990
that that it's got a nice BPM here's

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:19.490
you've got to admit okay we got to kill

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:23.330
them before he goes back down nicely

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:26.530
done team and there should be a fast

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:29.780
boss rush remember there's no hush but

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:32.060
suppose in theory there might be a

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:33.880
chance for us to go to the void floor

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:35.900
and we actually have a run that is

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:43.730
relatively well equipped for those

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:45.350
purposes I think now the bummer here to

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:49.340
a very slight extent is that there's

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:52.630
really no reason to use blank card with

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:57.350
anything right now in boss rush oh oh

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:59.240
that was a mild bummer it would have

00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:01.250
been very nice to have like a two of

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.840
clubs or something like that you know we

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:05.210
could have gotten 299 bombs there was an

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:06.920
ace of spades and I suppose you could

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:09.620
have turned all of the consumables into

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.760
keys and then you know there's a lot of

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:12.230
them so these red hearts would have been

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.150
dusted and that's probably a good

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:17.000
opportunity for us to get an extra 500

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:18.170
points or so that's a I'm just coming up

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.990
with a number off the top of the dome

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:24.800
piece but you get the idea

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:28.580
so that's that's a slight whiff but very

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:35.360
very very slight today's daily is

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:41.380
actually great fun engaging very very

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:41.380
strong oh hey see you there

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:46.230
and the puzzle for how to find the seam

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:51.480
or at least what looks like the seam was

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:54.030
a pretty cool one in my world small rock

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:55.380
got to look to bombs for a bomb a dude

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:58.920
dude I don't even know if you take

00:24:55.380 --> 00:25:01.530
kidney stone anymore my reasoning for

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:03.750
not taking kidney stone is that it's a

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:06.930
speed downgrade and I don't think we

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:10.020
need like yeah smart and smart play

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:13.650
there I don't think we need to worry

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:17.640
about our speed but in a way like why

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:19.980
wouldn't we if we have the option so do

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:24.390
you want to spend on bad items here is

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:26.280
the thing like we have 97 cents 97 cents

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:29.190
is worth points it's worth quite a lot

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:31.800
of points so I don't think it's a bad

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:33.780
idea to maybe just stick with 97 cents

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.280
instead of buying a couple spacebar

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:40.160
items we don't care about so this is

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:40.160
going to hurt but it's also like the way

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:47.640
and it is a possibility I hate the sound

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:49.440
from the meat there man it is a

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:51.680
possibility although every passing

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:58.260
spirit heart makes it less likely that

00:25:51.680 --> 00:26:02.430
we will have 1 hp left when we go down

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:05.430
to the lam floor which is not my idea of

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:07.230
a great time but with nine lives and

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:09.180
good damage you should be relatively ok

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:11.850
come on just give me I mean we got angel

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:15.000
statues coming up very shortly here but

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:18.320
give me the seven spirit heart payout

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.490
and then this is like vindication I

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:22.770
don't you do take these because they

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:24.120
give you a like a point multiplier

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:29.270
something that looks like seven spirit

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:32.520
outs to me so we're living the dream

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:36.270
last best thing to make this run truly

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:39.000
pop is you know what don't play this yet

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:40.050
I just realized we have two of diamonds

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.930
and I don't know if we have an

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:46.890
accessible battery charge but there's

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:48.420
not really a good reason not to do we

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:50.400
notice the case of spades

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:53.430
there's not really a good reason not to

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.870
buy a couple of things and then use two

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:55.950
of diamonds which will never need to use

00:26:54.870 --> 00:27:00.960
to double again

00:26:55.950 --> 00:27:03.059
so sure by Plan C get the map jumper

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:06.750
cables is going to charge up our stuff

00:27:03.059 --> 00:27:08.760
more frequently and don't buy the

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:10.830
compass hear me out here we're going to

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:13.230
go to every room anyway grab blank card

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:14.429
to a diamonds just use to a diamonds get

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:15.539
it out of here we're never going to get

00:27:14.429 --> 00:27:18.720
higher than $0.99

00:27:15.539 --> 00:27:22.080
so was it worth it I don't know probably

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:23.309
not really I mean we accrued a slightly

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.769
higher item penalty

00:27:23.309 --> 00:27:27.690
mostly for jumper cables which is going

00:27:25.769 --> 00:27:31.590
to give us slightly more frequent access

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:33.950
to High Priestess but we got a map one

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:42.630
more one more play here there we go

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:47.100
let's go good job team this has been a

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:48.570
very positive daily I feel I feel closer

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.909
to you than I ever have in my life

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:53.039
before let's gets down there sweet range

00:27:50.909 --> 00:27:57.269
up irrelevant blow this thing up of

00:27:53.039 --> 00:28:01.700
course see what you get pretty fly sorry

00:27:57.269 --> 00:28:03.929
what I mean is pretty fly and then

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:06.899
48-hour energy I think you just

00:28:03.929 --> 00:28:09.740
straight-up mash on these enemies with

00:28:06.899 --> 00:28:09.740
High Priestess

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:18.490
you know the drill at this point like I

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:20.830
can't believe we have zero luck this

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:24.900
late in the run but our principle goal

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:29.520
is just to never ever take damage so

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:33.400
we're going to work towards that and

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:35.500
then it would be nice to get to both

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:37.180
secret rooms but I'm not going to sweat

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:40.120
it too much these guys like if you get

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:46.900
hit against them that's a free pass as

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:48.880
far as I'm concerned you know it's very

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:50.740
difficult if they live for like longer

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:54.010
than two seconds it's very difficult to

00:28:50.740 --> 00:29:01.270
dodge them is 37,000 points within the

00:28:54.010 --> 00:29:03.330
realm of possibility no I don't believe

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:03.330
so

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:12.310
full-stop basically I'm not trying to be

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:13.330
negative here but I'm trying to be more

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:19.050
realistic

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:19.050
I don't think 37,000 is plausible

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:25.240
maybe blank card ace of spades plus like

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:26.800
the the red hearts that get dropped by

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:29.640
enemies thanks to GIMP II was actually

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:32.920
like a hugely important part of this

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:34.480
this plan that I was unaware of but so

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:36.840
this dude I'm just going to you know

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:40.690
smack them I'm going to smack them again

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:42.880
this should be the hardest room that we

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:44.110
have on this floor so I don't mind even

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.640
though we've got extra battery charges

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:47.230
sitting outside I don't mind burning up

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:51.460
a high priestess to get some extra

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:56.290
damage done here with that one almost

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:58.360
got me thanks sweet so uh yeah yeah yeah

00:29:56.290 --> 00:30:04.420
that's fine at least we got our HP back

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:07.000
by a gimpy so and actually getting hit

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:08.380
took us to the next level here what's up

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.810
with that like our rate of fire

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:14.800
increased drastically oh you know what

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:17.080
it is spilt milk an item I basically

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:20.770
disrespect all the time but is actually

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:25.810
like half decent in situations exactly

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:27.820
like that so we could leave and maybe we

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:32.380
should leave from a point standpoint

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:35.620
but I'm going to continue to explore a

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:39.430
little bit because I find that who dares

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:40.810
wins you know and by that I mean that if

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:42.820
I don't explore people are going to yell

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:43.480
at me excuse me and not like in the game

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.580
anymore

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:48.160
this is like my penance to show that I

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:49.300
still enjoy the game you might be saying

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:51.190
well what about all that stuff you said

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:52.450
about being you know approaching your

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:53.140
30s you don't need to impress anybody

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:55.030
anymore

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:57.400
well I'm approaching my thirties not my

00:30:55.030 --> 00:31:01.180
fifties once I get into my 50s then we

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:03.520
start you know really doing whatever we

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:05.440
want it's the way it always goes isn't

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:10.450
it oh dude I don't know about this I

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:13.060
mean very happy to have the magician

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:17.530
card occasionally once every four rooms

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:19.060
is not that frequent of course but at

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:21.850
least all of our shots within the

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:22.960
vicinity are going to land and I might

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:25.570
have saved us a little bit of heartache

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:27.400
on that room we've almost recovered for

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:33.280
the second bit of damage that we took

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:35.800
over the lam fight point-wise and you

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:37.260
never know if like a rogue - a spades

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:40.920
could show up at the end and allow us to

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:42.850
really start cranking on this run but

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:44.770
either way we're going to leave this

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:47.530
feeling good this is three good dailies

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:50.320
in a row that are probably going to be

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:53.200
within the top 150 it's kind of moving

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:56.670
the goalposts a little bit but don't

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.670
have too many other options right now

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:07.780
yeah never should have stood there but I

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:10.440
mean how many times we get hit over the

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:13.870
course of this entire run less than 10

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:20.170
even if we've made some a little bit of

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:22.750
questionable damage on this floor yeah

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:24.100
that time I was like should we pop the

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:26.080
magician and then by the time I had

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:29.140
actually thought about it it was far too

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:31.960
late to make a difference but okay the

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:34.060
ai-ai-ai-ai a bad damaged bad damage

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:36.880
it's all coming apart at the end it's

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:38.710
actually not like we're still so

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:40.660
completely fine it's not even funny but

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:41.240
we are gonna probably inch a little

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:43.460
further

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:48.500
out of the top 100 maybe as a result but

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:49.760
still this scene was not guaranteed the

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:53.570
fact that we managed to make it work

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:55.670
it's a nice testament to our to our play

00:32:53.570 --> 00:33:00.500
here if we find a good opportunity to

00:32:55.670 --> 00:33:01.550
use a or to find our secret rooms we

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:05.000
should take it I mean this is the

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:08.810
obvious location but I thought that was

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:13.310
the room that we spawned in this is

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:16.310
another possibility this is a second

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:19.340
secret room possibility this is the

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:22.630
second secret room possibility all right

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:25.580
so we're out of here

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:26.720
99 dude remarkably consistent at least

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:27.830
for now thanks for watching if you guys
