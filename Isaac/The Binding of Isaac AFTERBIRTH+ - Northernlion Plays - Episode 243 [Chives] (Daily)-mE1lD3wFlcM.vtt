00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.700
hey everybody welcome back to nor the

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.470
line please defining class sketch worth

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.280
plus I have bad news for you

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.260
I got rerun and then when I got rerun it

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.490
gave me a million percent which means

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.240
that I have unlocked every achievement

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.990
in the game

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.810
why is there no rerun video well there

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.750
actually is a rerun video it's two

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.340
gigabytes and it's corrupted it will not

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:30.570
play in VLC I've remarked it to mp4 I've

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:34.020
converted it I've you know dumb within

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.340
the scope of my video repairing skills

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.420
things that have worked previously in

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.309
the past I think it is just gone the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.030
data is there but something's messed up

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.680
so it is it exists on my computer at

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.809
least at the present moment maybe one

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.559
day I will figure out a cure it's

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.660
cryogenically frozen but rest assured it

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.340
did happen but did they believe me which

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.940
is you seem achieve and managed you're

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.550
ok now

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.559
I mean you can see wait wait wait wait

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.390
this is the run that I was on I guess I

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.309
can show you this for like 10 seconds so

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.119
you at least know that it actually like

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.310
exists here

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.140
this was the run as you can see it's on

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.939
the fourth rerun right there it's

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.189
actually if I remember correctly it's

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:20.490
really bad right now because I lost some

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:22.259
items doesn't look that bad but it's

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.060
much worse than it was I was doing some

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.909
loops in like two seconds here but

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.070
anyway this is my rerun run over even

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.430
Ruby Redmond we're gonna do the daily

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.110
today as Kane apparently people tweeted

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.790
me in this at today's daily is fun

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.400
that's not why I'm doing it I'm doing it

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.170
because the start of the day I want to

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.619
get back in my daily Isaac meditation

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.270
looks like scores today closer --ax

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.990
sixth place with a fifty four thousand

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.369
score that's very good with fifty four

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.140
thousand she's the suffix daily master

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.060
okay yesterday

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.110
579 6.8 six percent that's fair

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.350
I missed the seem today let's do better

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.299
so this one is a seamless which is

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.420
actually extremely nice because I do

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.129
think by and large I tend to play better

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.530
on the seamless daily so I tend to rank

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.569
better

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.700
on the seamless dailies it's probably

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:20.200
because I'm the highest skill Isak

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.900
player on planet earth so it's a tough

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.819
call actually so you know the only way I

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.560
could not come in first on a daily is

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.170
when some cheesy stuff happens like oh

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.550
it's supposed to go just a mom but if

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.950
you put your finger in the right spot

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.630
and tickle until my face turns blue then

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.910
you get to go down to the you know the

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.530
womb and about that lifestyle that's

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.019
obviously me being a little bit

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.670
facetious if you got suspicious on your

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.920
NL bingo card make sure to put an X

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.709
there but yeah I mean a lot of some

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.170
videos yesterday it's frustrating but

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:57.430
life goes on basically you know it's

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:00.640
nice to have like a job even when you

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:04.630
lose a day or half a day of work yeah

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.340
you know it could be worse life goes on

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.900
I get to have a good excuse to play a

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.700
little bit more Isaac today and those

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.790
episodes were junk anyway they actually

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.680
weren't the rerun episode was like again

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.880
90 minutes long so that one hurts to

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.870
lose and then I had like a random Eden

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.130
run that was like 55 minutes long and

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.420
hurts to lose a little bit as well maybe

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.070
I shouldn't have spent so much money but

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.540
I'm trying to get the blood bag because

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.880
the speed upgrade pays dividends an

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.250
extra HP don't hurt either but you don't

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.799
really want Baltar lying card on the

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.870
other hand I can't imagine ever

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.220
finishing this run and being like why

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.920
did we take blank card the only

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.850
exception is if there's an amazing item

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.530
like elsewhere close close to the blood

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.109
bank level here an amazing item

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.829
elsewhere deeper in the reroll chain

00:03:50.109 --> 00:04:00.250
there but blank card is great for

00:03:53.829 --> 00:04:02.079
winning and also great for getting

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.970
better daily scores if you can get you

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.560
know the two of cards or anything of

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.239
that sort so we just want to get over

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.720
five cents although I'll admit it would

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.250
be nice if we could also grab you know

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.040
the blood bag even the IV bag

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.950
temporarily might be fine we have three

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.390
bombs I have no idea where the secret

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.039
room would be I'm going to guess it's

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.940
probably here but with three bombs I'd

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:29.259
rather look for the second secret room

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:31.060
seems a little bit easier to swing and

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:33.970
we may want to go to the shop and buy a

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.380
tarot card but I guess we'll wait till

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:41.319
the next floor just so we can guarantee

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:43.389
ourselves the the best chance to also

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:45.039
get an arcade along with it again like

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.750
without knowing what's in the shops all

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:50.080
shops are equal right now so we might as

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.090
well wait for the next one it's just as

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.740
likely to have you know like the Sun or

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.539
the Joker or something like that as the

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.490
one that we have on this floor with the

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:58.960
added incentive of actually being able

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.610
to get a blood bank out of it as well so

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:06.009
um good daily scores today 54,000 is

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.840
excellent that's urge to score top score

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:09.160
is like fifty or sixty one thousand I

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.570
should say don't think I've ever had a

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.080
score in the 60s so don't get your hopes

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:16.449
up too much but maybe today's the day

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.289
probably not but maybe today's the day

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:21.909
grab this and then you know this is

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:24.970
actually something we probably shouldn't

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:26.620
do because we're running out of time but

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:30.250
I'm going to do it nonetheless I'm going

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:34.720
to play this thing two more times there

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:36.699
is definitely a case to be made let's

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.139
just go I we could go back for the shop

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:39.880
here but I think it's the right idea to

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.409
get a move on um there's a case to be

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.330
made that we should take child's heart

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:47.710
however I'm hoping that we get something

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.150
that actually we should check it right

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.840
away I'm hoping that we get something

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:56.949
that makes a blank card year out blank

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:59.020
card year a blank card blank room we're

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:03.490
going to Yara it gives us another blank

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:05.050
room we get a Huggle oz and a pair throw

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.219
then we got two years sitting on the

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.509
ground so blank Rd row is obviously

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:09.370
amazing what I was getting at is I hope

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:11.320
we get Guppies tails so that we can open

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.860
all these golden chests for free I think

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:17.169
it will probably pay dividends more than

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:21.270
anything else right now but anyway this

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:25.570
is a really really really good situation

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:27.820
remember the sensible approach that you

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:31.120
should take to a year arune with blank

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:35.830
card and that is you should double stuff

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:37.210
up like all in one room we're unlikely

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:41.020
to really want

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:43.570
the era rune to double anything of value

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.919
right now like on this floor per throws

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.830
different is use it on like a deal with

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:49.840
the devil but right now we have no real

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.550
design if we could pursue that that'd be

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.830
nice but we did lose our per throw room

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:59.229
because it was blank rune okay is coming

00:06:53.830 --> 00:07:01.419
some slack self but yarrow we can afford

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:03.150
to use pretty much as much for

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:08.410
consumables as we would like because I

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:12.340
mean this actually already allows us to

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:15.849
get unlimited balms and keys so you

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:19.630
really should go hard on this one again

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:22.060
I assume that basically everybody is

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.889
going to probably get to the point where

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.419
they're doing this on today's daily and

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:29.289
that's fine if you look at that score

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:31.139
tick up this is incredible

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:34.240
throw a bomb down I mean we have

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:38.110
infinity so not feeling too bad about

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:40.750
that skin 299 keys and then you're good

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:42.280
to go um I'll tell you what place a bomb

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.349
don't take too much time here obviously

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.900
replace a bomb because we want to see if

00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:49.000
we can get some money they still might

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:51.669
give us points they do still give us

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.440
points so we should grab them you can

00:07:51.669 --> 00:07:57.250
always create you know again infinity

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.930
more later so this is definitely one of

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:02.169
the highest scores I've ever had this

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:03.849
early on and a run alright so we'll

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:07.509
never have to worry about any consumable

00:08:03.849 --> 00:08:11.080
except for money again if we see money

00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:13.449
on the ground we should just double it

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.479
right away remember we can't blow up a

00:08:13.449 --> 00:08:17.979
donation machine or anything like that

00:08:15.479 --> 00:08:19.810
well first off go to the shop because if

00:08:17.979 --> 00:08:21.909
there's a battery charge in the shop

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:25.840
yeah you just pop the aera and now you

00:08:21.909 --> 00:08:29.099
have infinite consumables so now we have

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.099
unlimited money as well

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:37.919
double it once more and I want to see

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:40.770
what we get out of our cards here

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:42.300
it's a joker card I'm just going to use

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.860
it basically because we can and there's

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:47.820
Guppies tail we don't really want the

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:53.399
razor blade we obviously want to stick

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:55.680
with yera but first let's get to 99

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:58.170
cents we this is actually more dangerous

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:01.680
than it looks right now and the reason

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:06.589
for that is very simple it's going to be

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:09.660
very tempting to take forever here in

00:09:06.589 --> 00:09:12.350
fact I think we should just go but we

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:17.279
need we need to take Gera with us and

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:19.110
it's because we have time we are we have

00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:21.500
we have space rather it's maybe a better

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:23.940
way to put it we have no worries about

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.560
that being like a last shop that's good

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:31.020
sure I understand that is a reroll

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:32.520
machine in it but we we can't let

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.810
ourselves get twisted up in there for

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.760
too too long because it's going to take

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.490
you know 100 million years for us to

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.660
finish that so I think we've got to make

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.370
sure that we're still on pace for boss

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.810
rush sure being able to buy like

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:46.589
unlimited items from the shop would

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:48.900
probably do so but better safe than

00:09:46.589 --> 00:09:50.190
sorry I think we will take caffeine pill

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.560
the speed pills should pay dividends

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:54.480
health up is fine we still don't want

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.580
razorblade let's go so being only like a

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:59.730
minute behind schedule here is totally

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:04.350
ok you should keep this right off the

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:06.029
bat and see what we get I don't really

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:08.390
want to hear that that seems like a bad

00:10:06.029 --> 00:10:08.390
Yara

00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:16.610
yeah I don't really see this being

00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:19.699
anything but awesome right now again

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:24.139
we've almost reached the swag bonus cap

00:10:19.699 --> 00:10:25.670
for like everything is it worth a bomb

00:10:24.139 --> 00:10:29.059
to never have to spend a key on this

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:31.699
floor I mean numerically doubtlessly yes

00:10:29.059 --> 00:10:33.230
stop taking so much damage though we

00:10:31.699 --> 00:10:35.059
could start doubling early but I think

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:36.529
that rather wait for a room that's you

00:10:35.059 --> 00:10:38.600
know to skip some of the doublings for

00:10:36.529 --> 00:10:43.610
me this room is actually totally fine

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:49.549
for doing that now hmm not very proud of

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:54.139
my performance there we have to and and

00:10:49.549 --> 00:10:57.769
should guppies head

00:10:54.139 --> 00:11:03.489
guppies head able useless faiths reward

00:10:57.769 --> 00:11:03.489
not as useless as able but not very good

00:11:03.699 --> 00:11:08.420
now what's the problem with this run

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:10.129
again I would never suggest that we're

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.959
in a bad spot that would be

00:11:10.129 --> 00:11:14.540
intellectually dishonest but what we are

00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:18.199
is physically underpowered

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:20.360
we're like a powerful sorcerer but we

00:11:18.199 --> 00:11:26.569
lack the ability to succeed in like

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:28.579
Hanahan combat right now and in the end

00:11:26.569 --> 00:11:31.790
that's what Isaac comes down to you know

00:11:28.579 --> 00:11:33.499
is having to kill some enemies sometimes

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:37.540
those enemies can even be a little

00:11:33.499 --> 00:11:37.540
difficult it's easy to forget but I

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:43.369
don't know we'll see how things go here

00:11:41.869 --> 00:11:46.639
I don't want to make a catastrophic

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:49.519
mistake with my trinket like I think

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:51.499
we've got a great trinket but we do also

00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:53.299
have 99 keys and the ability to get

00:11:51.499 --> 00:11:55.519
unlimited keys in the future but I also

00:11:53.299 --> 00:11:58.040
don't think we really need to get a

00:11:55.519 --> 00:12:01.779
charge like the charge penny or whatever

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.779
it's called a good black bean

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:09.420
we also yeah nevermind we have golden

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:10.889
keys already touched on that we didn't

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:14.660
go to the secret rooms last floor either

00:12:10.889 --> 00:12:18.570
did we gonna be taking pills just

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:21.570
basically because we can but yeah I'm a

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:23.730
hoping and and maybe this is a situation

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:27.630
in which we should have taken the Joker

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:29.970
card or we should have mind our shop to

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:32.250
try to get to deep pockets or a starter

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:34.199
deck cause I'd like to hold a Joker card

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:40.320
with blank card and a year a room with

00:12:34.199 --> 00:12:45.839
blank cards so beggars in this case can

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:48.750
be choosers where are you we sort of

00:12:45.839 --> 00:12:49.920
have unlimited resources so we should go

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.570
back and double even though it's going

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:54.870
to make us a little bit behind schedule

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:56.370
you know it's I think we're swinging for

00:12:54.870 --> 00:13:00.720
the fences on this run I really think we

00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:03.420
have a chance to be you know in that

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.040
upper echelon basically I don't want to

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:07.350
be negative to you but if you didn't

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.610
take blank card in that first item room

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:10.139
if you had a little bit of a brain fart

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:11.459
or you undervalue that item for whatever

00:13:10.139 --> 00:13:14.310
reason you're going to cost yourself

00:13:11.459 --> 00:13:15.779
big-time NF sucks but it's also the way

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:17.490
the cookie crumbles on dailies you know

00:13:15.779 --> 00:13:20.040
I played really well I saw it on

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:21.690
yesterday's daily and I ranked pretty

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:24.720
badly because of the fact that I missed

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:26.810
the scene so one little you know flap of

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:29.850
a butterfly's wings can have a

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:34.550
catastrophic impacts on these dailies

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:37.079
here got to buy mom's bottle of pills

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:39.630
full health pill it's nice to know it

00:13:37.079 --> 00:13:41.370
exists at least but I mean again with

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:43.199
the blank card era we could double

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:47.490
everything in there every consumable at

00:13:43.199 --> 00:13:49.740
least but none of them can really be

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:51.269
held so we don't really care and again

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:56.100
I'm leaving the penny on the ground

00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:57.660
because I do have a good reason I'm just

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.100
trying to make sure I don't get hit here

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.800
I'm leaving the penny on the ground

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:03.510
because we have unlimited pennies inside

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.220
of us right now that's a weird way to

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:07.500
explain that but you get what I mean

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:10.920
like we have no shortage of pennies we

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:14.350
can create infinity pennies what we

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:18.890
can't create is more time though

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:21.020
so speed is of the essence right now you

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:23.120
know Gavin Rossdale of Bush did say

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:26.390
speed kills if you know what I mean but

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:28.190
in this case maybe it should be more

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:29.780
about pace but we can't call the song

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:32.020
pace kills because we'll get sued to

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:34.940
Christ by the salsa company so I

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:38.510
understand the Rossdale conundrum that

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:40.040
was bad damage binky is fine thank you

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:44.600
for the tears up we'll take both of

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:47.770
these contract from below is actually

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:51.140
pretty good on dailies mom's knife is

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:54.980
wonderful okay so all of our damage

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:57.230
related concerns are now gone we and

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.540
this is not meant to be too much of an

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:03.710
exaggeration we should never get hit

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:05.870
again though by anything that isn't us

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:07.040
going into curse rooms for example and

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:09.530
we do want to go into curse rooms

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.970
because we got the guppy dream even if

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:15.520
we do have mom's knife the guppy dream

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:20.900
is worth pursuing in my opinion at least

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:22.430
what should we double probably spirit

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:26.780
hearts right away seems like the

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:29.420
sensible call but in a way we've almost

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.770
like we priced ourselves out of doubling

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:34.310
because we don't need to do it anymore

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:35.750
but we should maybe open the golden

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:39.350
chest I kind of wish I could fly around

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:45.470
them but those contain trinkets it's not

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:47.960
bad to mill for trinkets see that was I

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:49.550
tried to out think dirty that's your

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:53.770
principal mistake right there

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:53.770
take this we don't need to double then

00:15:54.700 --> 00:16:01.750
world card world card

00:15:58.029 --> 00:16:07.339
in tales of derring-do good vision

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:11.269
Worldcon with who just to take as I must

00:16:07.339 --> 00:16:15.079
find you in the Isaac let me find you

00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:23.440
and please give me unlimited HP dang gas

00:16:15.079 --> 00:16:25.579
will who man what's our luck that is one

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:30.800
I'm not complaining

00:16:25.579 --> 00:16:31.910
I'm just observing feels like I'm not

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.310
really getting that much in the way of

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:35.870
consumable drops at the same time we can

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:37.310
create unlimited consumable drops

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:40.250
through the power of you know our

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:42.920
unlimited resources but yeah that was

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:45.320
probably the worst conceived dodge in

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:49.510
Isaac history very lucky to have not

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:49.510
been penalized for it

00:16:49.959 --> 00:16:55.180
let's go peep this ooh

00:16:52.670 --> 00:17:00.010
that's the good gravy okay so

00:16:55.180 --> 00:17:00.010
unfortunately we can't like yera

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:09.260
the gift but we can yera lucky pennies

00:17:05.959 --> 00:17:14.600
to get like an extremely good luck stead

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:18.730
and also money so how much luck do we

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.730
want I mean how much you got basically

00:17:23.919 --> 00:17:31.970
I'm going to buy that 15 cent item

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:33.470
obviously I actually just I don't know

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:36.740
if I can handle it here this this is

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:38.090
silly the range ups are largely

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:41.480
irrelevant

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:44.870
I want to avoid crossing the level of

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:46.370
absurdity right like we also still have

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:48.320
to get out of this floor I want to keep

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:49.640
that in mind I don't care about doubling

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.250
a Lucky Penny sure we could get more

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:54.590
than 31 lucky you're not wrong 31 luck

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:57.410
for all intents and purposes is infinite

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:59.600
though and we got to go like actually if

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:03.290
we want to make boss rush we have to go

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:06.639
I'm going to take solace in the fact

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:09.440
that on that floor we've got

00:18:06.639 --> 00:18:11.360
31 luck up graves that seems like pretty

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:15.889
good value and then I'm going to move

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:17.509
along here because we are about a minute

00:18:15.889 --> 00:18:20.600
and a half behind schedule it didn't go

00:18:17.509 --> 00:18:22.460
to the curse room on that floor and I

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:28.580
will carry that regret to my dying day

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:30.440
but should a year at this because

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:33.019
they're free to open right like the

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:35.389
other ones got to have the Kiera font as

00:18:33.019 --> 00:18:41.960
well yeah we should always ierra

00:18:35.389 --> 00:18:43.580
like golden chests if they show up we've

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:47.720
already gotten two of the worst golden

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:51.549
chest items so it's unlikely that

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.549
they're not going to be sweet as heck

00:18:52.929 --> 00:18:58.759
well one things are sure on the lam

00:18:56.149 --> 00:19:03.100
floor I'd be expecting to get some items

00:18:58.759 --> 00:19:03.100
with 32 luck I don't really want this

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:15.320
but I'll tell you what now that's the

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:20.049
good stuff right there right there tears

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:25.970
down fairly irrelevant pretty flies good

00:19:20.049 --> 00:19:30.769
and keep moving again shops good item

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:33.200
room already done progress progress is

00:19:30.769 --> 00:19:36.740
the big deal here let's crack on these

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:38.509
while we can the lock ups are probably

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.309
not necessarily worth it right now in

00:19:38.509 --> 00:19:41.990
fact the money is not worth it either

00:19:40.309 --> 00:19:44.299
keep in mind we have as many points as I

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:47.860
often have after I beat boss rush if the

00:19:44.299 --> 00:19:52.460
boss rush is particularly heinous so I

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:54.950
am zero percent sweating our points

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:57.559
right now what I might be sweating a

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:59.269
little bit is our ability to make it the

00:19:57.559 --> 00:20:00.350
boss rush in if we have it all the tools

00:19:59.269 --> 00:20:03.409
of the trade but we don't make it the

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:08.210
boss rush then to some extent this is

00:20:03.409 --> 00:20:11.600
all for naught but we're going to make

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:13.580
it considering we're roughly on pace we

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:15.860
should be fine okay there was actually

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:18.240
like a good

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:19.980
option here I'm gonna take Kim bean

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.150
conception as well but yeah Rawdon are

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:24.270
sorry experimental treatment worked out

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:25.290
for us I went big on the deal with the

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.730
devil and that's because of single

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:28.950
spirit heart is infinite spirit hearts

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:30.660
for us we can't create the first one out

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:36.150
of thin air but if we ever see one

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:40.640
you know we're set now it's not worth it

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:44.160
I mean it is but we can't justify it

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:47.180
the damage is unnecessary and that could

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:50.280
be extremely relevant right now like

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:51.720
these are not even worth picking up from

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.340
a point standpoint from a consumable

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:58.310
standpoint we're already at 99 bombs so

00:20:53.340 --> 00:21:00.570
it's also irrelevant Europe on Hank Ben

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:03.770
the other thing a hero phone card just

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:03.770
gives us everything we need as well

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:10.160
we're actually I shouldn't have been as

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:12.540
anxious as I was way ahead of schedule

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:14.610
much more than it might originally seem

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.900
I thought maybe this is going to ask me

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:21.150
to reroll my whole run I think we got a

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:22.310
great case to not do that that's going

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:24.680
to be our yera

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:28.940
repository I think right there because

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:28.940
we need the spirit hearts

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:39.180
purity is pretty good I might have been

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:42.540
ignoring secret rooms by the way which

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:45.900
is a pretty bad play in our present

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:48.630
situation there's really no reason at

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:50.250
all though we were I felt pressed for

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:52.410
time whether or not we were is debatable

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:56.960
but I felt pressed for time for a while

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:59.670
so it's not like it was done maliciously

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.780
now we should continue to move on but

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:02.400
just make sure you go back to the

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.630
spirits however many there are

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:08.970
hopefully the shop is in this direction

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:11.040
as well go on somewhat skeptical rarely

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:14.540
I think our secret rooms the difference

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:16.010
between a great rank and a bad rank so I

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:17.760
[Music]

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:19.440
just hope this isn't one of those

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.030
dailies where you know the way that you

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:23.040
get an extra five thousand points is you

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:26.940
just stand and double the same room

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:30.240
forever and then you recognize that you

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:32.280
get like still one point more from every

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.830
penny than you lose in the time it takes

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:39.900
to pick it up so it becomes just kind of

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:41.250
like needlessly match the space bar over

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.840
and over pick up a battery let the

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:45.990
pennies absorb themselves on to you you

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:47.220
get the idea if it's like that it's like

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:50.070
that okay I think we've already

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:52.920
benefited a lot from this item the

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:54.420
combination I should say but we're

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.220
taking these because we're honestly

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.180
bereft of time to come back keep

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.820
reminding you do you want to do boss

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:02.250
rush as well keep in mind after doing

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:04.530
boss rush you wanted to hush and we will

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:07.230
do hush because I can't imagine us being

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:11.310
slowed down too much here this has to be

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:13.320
the right way I mean it's not that it

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:14.760
must be the right way it's that if it is

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.340
in the right way we're in a tough spot

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:19.920
so last two things your second secret

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:22.560
room shouldn't hold us back too much and

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:25.140
then secondly if I can get a better deal

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:31.020
with the devil chance here I would like

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:32.490
to and we'll take Bombay I will take it

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:33.750
a health up it's not going to be useful

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:39.230
right now but we're getting the negative

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:41.390
anyway if I can get a red heart

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:42.770
then we can trade it away to our deal if

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:45.200
it's Krampus Krampus oh it's not that

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:46.610
bad we'll take we'll take a headless

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.080
baby I think it's irrelevant wait we got

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:49.760
the Polaroid instead of the negative so

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.520
we're lucky we got we were able to get

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:57.020
rid of that like that okay so very

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:59.990
important boss rush to things double any

00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:01.610
consumable that you see that you can

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:05.300
pick up because it's better to start the

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:16.970
doubling early yes even that bomb I

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:20.990
think again I'll then the other thing

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:23.600
was going to be don't get hit the thing

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:26.390
is like what I was just saying is it's

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:33.770
possible picking up a bomb only gives us

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:37.580
three points right now but if it only

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:41.990
takes us half of a point of time to get

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:44.750
it then that seems extraordinarily worth

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:46.010
it right and also we're doubling all

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:50.360
consumables so if there's ever anything

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:52.100
here that I'm missing like maybe there's

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:55.640
a spirit art on the ground that could be

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:57.050
valuable although I would hazard a guess

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.700
it's unlikely to make an enormous

00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:02.900
difference right now oh there's our

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:06.980
spirit hard I picked up a bomb and then

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:09.440
to dodge one of the bombs I stupidly

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:13.870
walked on creep or just got hit by the

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:13.870
enemy not too shrewd on my part

00:25:17.139 --> 00:25:25.789
this is fine a little crowded but

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:30.590
completely fine just watch out for beam

00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:32.090
based enemies like that a no disrespect

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:34.399
for your service but I'm a twitch

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:36.110
streamer get me out of your element

00:25:34.399 --> 00:25:38.659
which tree okay what do you guys what do

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:45.080
you got for me I'll wait how long are

00:25:38.659 --> 00:25:49.220
you going to make me wait though I keep

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:52.179
getting confused and again I take

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:57.009
responsibility for this but we can't fly

00:25:52.179 --> 00:25:57.009
it feels like we should be able to fly

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:09.320
just because we're so powerful in like

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:13.389
every other area of the game also boss

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:16.700
rush becoming a little complicated here

00:26:13.389 --> 00:26:23.899
just a lot a lot of stuff on the screen

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:25.759
I think I walked on creep there is there

00:26:23.899 --> 00:26:28.870
an enemy under the under the soil

00:26:25.759 --> 00:26:28.870
oh it's war

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:37.670
I can't be sure that we're actually

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:39.470
gaining points out of our incredibly

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:41.060
strange gambit but do it if you could

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:48.860
just make that happen for me on a

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:51.320
regular basis I'm in so now I think I'm

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:53.120
going to stop doubling and it's really

00:26:51.320 --> 00:27:01.850
just because I'm worried about crashing

00:26:53.120 --> 00:27:05.030
the game thank you for breaking all the

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:06.920
TNT okay we have Maggie's bow I think we

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:11.570
do not care about Maggie's bow so we're

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:13.490
just going to Maggie's go like that was

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:17.870
still like another 50 something points

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:19.880
there it is worth it to pick up the

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:29.840
bombs at least when they're extremely

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:31.490
close together like this man not the way

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.270
I want to live my life though okay let's

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:33.950
get out of here

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:36.110
no tinted rocks going down to the next

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:38.750
floor have taken some damage but I

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:48.200
really am like 4k above where I normally

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:52.970
am at this point if you want to rank

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:58.940
well on a daily beat your average score

00:27:52.970 --> 00:28:02.300
but okay watch me unravel take ten

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:04.220
damage on suit and we actually should

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:06.320
not take any damage on Satan here

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:09.500
because if we fight Satan something's

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:13.220
gone terribly wrong also lying on the

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:20.330
floor lying on the floor I come on done

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:23.600
I want to double that Blanc Rd era is

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:25.490
still the bee's knees once we get down

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:27.800
to the chest I'm assuming we're getting

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:31.130
two chests per room thanks 232 luck and

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:33.320
contract from below and then on top of

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:38.420
that we're going to throw in like the

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:39.860
added ability to yera that not saying

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:42.500
we're getting four chests per room I'm

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:45.080
just saying maybe we're going to get

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:47.860
four chests per room oh you got to take

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:50.360
a spider bite

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:52.309
if there's anything we need on this run

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:56.480
of course like even with moms knife I

00:28:52.309 --> 00:29:01.340
still am chasing that guppy dream sad

00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:06.519
bombs we got 99 bombs so and we will

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:06.519
probably got 999 bombs at this point but

00:29:07.659 --> 00:29:23.690
should really just get the ability to

00:29:12.169 --> 00:29:27.080
fly if possible so I think we should use

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:29.119
this go in where we get juice beer it's

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:31.610
okay in a not a teleca's I'm excited

00:29:29.119 --> 00:29:35.149
it's okay friends the end is okay I'm

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:42.830
going to leave grab this

00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:45.350
use it grab this well played need to

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:49.340
make it to the hush fight we could also

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:51.590
in you know I'm not complaining he says

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:54.200
before complaining every time but I'm

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:55.970
not complaining we could use a little

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:58.190
bit more damage though right like seven

00:29:55.970 --> 00:30:00.049
damage mom's knife it's killing things

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:02.509
quickly you don't need a whole lot of

00:30:00.049 --> 00:30:05.769
damage to succeed with moms knife but

00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:05.769
there's room to improve

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:13.730
the astute amongst you may have just

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:15.260
recognized that that's a visual tell it

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:16.820
indicates I got a Skype message it's a

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:20.000
very nice one it's from Bayer taffy it

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:22.730
says I'm glad you're not dead just about

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.160
the nicest thing anyone's ever said it's

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:30.430
not to me it says Austin it was gotten

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:30.430
over his bout of dysentery or whatever

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:39.170
those of you keeping score Bayer taffy

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:40.430
also says I got the true ending in

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:42.920
hollow Knight and then he gave it to

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:46.160
okay signs like that so that's good and

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:49.520
then he says the white palace though and

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:50.750
he gave that a thumbs down this is what

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.340
everyone's like you got to do the true

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:54.320
ending in Holland I it's so wonderful

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:57.590
and I'm started making progress in that

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:59.930
direction then they go yeah but like the

00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:04.180
white palace does suck but I guess you

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:06.200
know it's a rite of passage you know

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:09.710
it's like everyone's like you know

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:14.210
college is great exams suck though yeah

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:16.130
you got to go through the exams to get

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:16.880
the degree the juice is worth the

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:18.920
squeeze

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.120
so we're almost got but you got a 72%

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:23.240
chance of a deal with the devil that

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:25.480
could take us to the next level here as

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.480
well

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:32.870
and we should make the Hajj fun I'm just

00:31:31.519 --> 00:31:36.679
trying to look at like our score right

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:38.840
now I do think I don't want curses at

00:31:36.679 --> 00:31:42.440
our obviously but I do think there's a

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:44.120
chance we could hit fifty something

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:47.809
thousand whatever cervix is at fifty

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:50.240
four thousand not to like just be

00:31:47.809 --> 00:31:51.559
competitive I mean of course it is a

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.029
little bit of competitive spirit in me

00:31:51.559 --> 00:31:57.279
as well search is a very good daily

00:31:53.029 --> 00:32:01.279
player very good player in general let's

00:31:57.279 --> 00:32:03.500
bookworm it would be nice to have a

00:32:01.279 --> 00:32:06.169
score that's competitive with her for

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:08.240
certain however it's also just a good

00:32:06.169 --> 00:32:15.620
kind of barometer for how we're doing on

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:17.360
this run I think we will unfortunately

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:19.669
be dealing with a damage penalty that's

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:21.110
a little higher than we'd expect the

00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:22.940
average to be near the top of the

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:25.279
leaderboards here so that might preclude

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:31.220
us from really reaching for the for the

00:32:25.279 --> 00:32:33.320
sky but try nonetheless who knows maybe

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:37.850
we even got a leg up on the competition

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:39.669
somewhere that I'm unaware of I haven't

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:42.350
taken any damage down here either so

00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:44.629
well that's not true but we haven't

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:47.000
taken any unproductive damage down here

00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:50.480
we got hit on the curse room but of

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.549
course ok slightly nerve-wracking that

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:59.690
we have found ourselves at a dead end

00:32:52.549 --> 00:33:01.570
but not to worry some again it's as long

00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:06.649
as you're using your time productively

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:09.320
it's optimal to get into the the time

00:33:06.649 --> 00:33:12.049
gated rooms like the second before they

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:13.700
expire it means you got to do more on

00:33:12.049 --> 00:33:16.009
the floor previous you know you maximize

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:18.830
your point totals there however it is

00:33:16.009 --> 00:33:20.509
unfortunate that the optimal outcome is

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:23.029
right next to the most suboptimal

00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:25.059
outcome which is not making it like at

00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:25.059
all

00:33:28.129 --> 00:33:37.980
so like again this is a good idea but an

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:40.200
idea that sort of annoys me but just

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:45.749
don't get trapped on this room look at

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:50.159
the points though look at the points

00:33:45.749 --> 00:33:52.590
very very slowly increase so we got a

00:33:50.159 --> 00:33:54.960
few extra hundred points out of that at

00:33:52.590 --> 00:34:03.480
the cost of some very very important

00:33:54.960 --> 00:34:06.119
time would I do it again yes I really

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:09.720
think wherever we can find the

00:34:06.119 --> 00:34:12.329
opportunity to slightly you know what we

00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:14.069
actually have to go increase our chances

00:34:12.329 --> 00:34:22.139
the better we're going to say this isn't

00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:24.359
a boss fight we're in L dude that was

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:28.520
actually a horrible showing on my part

00:34:24.359 --> 00:34:28.520
but that's okay just beat mom's heart

00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:33.839
make it to the hush fight don't die we

00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:40.020
actually lost like 600 points while

00:34:33.839 --> 00:34:42.540
having to go faster it's okay so void is

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:46.879
theoretically worth it but I don't think

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:50.359
it is in this case the cost of the extra

00:34:46.879 --> 00:34:54.599
three spirit arts might not be worth the

00:34:50.359 --> 00:34:55.919
additional value that we receive here

00:34:54.599 --> 00:34:59.400
could be wrong

00:34:55.919 --> 00:35:04.859
so I mean obviously you have to take the

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:09.690
taro cloth it's a card yet the taro

00:35:04.859 --> 00:35:14.490
cloth is just incredible for us um you

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:16.380
definitely want a homing knives our rate

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:19.790
of fire is largely irrelevant zodiacs

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:22.079
okay but I think you want halo of flies

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:24.300
maybe we should actually double the

00:35:22.079 --> 00:35:26.280
chess because it's not going to double

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:29.339
them it's going to multiply them by like

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:31.170
a hundred thousand we have taro clock oh

00:35:29.339 --> 00:35:36.170
it doesn't work with blank cards okay

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:36.170
well noted disappointing but noted

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:40.210
kind of hoping for some spirit odds we

00:35:38.859 --> 00:35:42.519
should be fine either way

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:44.229
go ahead actually there's no reason to

00:35:42.519 --> 00:35:49.210
take Steven there is you want the damage

00:35:44.229 --> 00:35:53.489
permanently and Pandora's box does

00:35:49.210 --> 00:35:56.319
nothing for us here so let's move along

00:35:53.489 --> 00:36:01.269
this is another important fight because

00:35:56.319 --> 00:36:03.759
I kinda I wouldn't say I Bob stood too

00:36:01.269 --> 00:36:06.099
much at the end of the last floor but I

00:36:03.759 --> 00:36:08.769
took damage that was unnecessary to take

00:36:06.099 --> 00:36:12.430
by pretty much any you know conventional

00:36:08.769 --> 00:36:14.140
human measurement so to make up for by

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:16.059
not getting hit or not taking

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:17.369
unnecessary damage on the hush fight

00:36:16.059 --> 00:36:19.450
would be a start

00:36:17.369 --> 00:36:21.160
things are going to start to move real

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:22.420
fast after this we've we've done

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:26.200
everything we need to do we've checked

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:28.359
the boxes I think I tend to play faster

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:30.999
than average which actually leads to me

00:36:28.359 --> 00:36:35.200
having usually a pretty big advantage on

00:36:30.999 --> 00:36:39.839
dailies because it's it's normally not

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:42.430
too much of a problem to make these

00:36:39.839 --> 00:36:44.229
these time gated rooms and this is no

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:46.029
exception but I'm assuming that probably

00:36:44.229 --> 00:36:49.269
you know everybody on planet Earth was

00:36:46.029 --> 00:36:51.339
able to do that today I got freaked out

00:36:49.269 --> 00:36:53.229
I was standing in what I thought was a

00:36:51.339 --> 00:36:56.349
good location and then I got freaked out

00:36:53.229 --> 00:37:04.479
dude we didn't get hit those so nothing

00:36:56.349 --> 00:37:08.099
to worry about yet might not be safe but

00:37:04.479 --> 00:37:08.099
halo of flies is doing a bang-up job

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:21.089
what's coming next beams of light no not

00:37:13.529 --> 00:37:25.460
beams of light all right so we're

00:37:21.089 --> 00:37:25.460
definitely not go oh this sucks

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:32.880
yeah did that to myself 100% doubled

00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:45.930
back you never double back on that

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:48.180
attack that was kind of a he's done its

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:50.630
style moment there dude that dodge was

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:56.369
excellent okay so we're going to the

00:37:50.630 --> 00:38:00.150
Cathedral now again another Cathedral to

00:37:56.369 --> 00:38:02.549
me it doesn't even really make any sense

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:04.319
at all we're still waiting on the gappi

00:38:02.549 --> 00:38:08.160
dream and I'm hoping this is our moment

00:38:04.319 --> 00:38:09.720
but we'll see well see it's not a moment

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:11.579
but there is a spirit heart so you know

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:16.829
what this becomes yarrow 101 right here

00:38:11.579 --> 00:38:18.390
I think it's a little too early to

00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:20.519
estimate my score but I wouldn't be

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:22.349
surprised to see myself in the 50,000th

00:38:20.519 --> 00:38:24.210
if we're in the 50,000 I wouldn't be

00:38:22.349 --> 00:38:28.369
surprised to see yourself in the top 100

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:28.369
which is as good as I can ever ask for

00:38:29.539 --> 00:38:33.960
not as good as I can ever get but as

00:38:32.759 --> 00:38:37.009
good as I can ever ask for because

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:39.390
there's a lot of you know very instant

00:38:37.009 --> 00:38:41.819
unknown stuff that goes into those

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:43.319
mercurial high scores and that sounds

00:38:41.819 --> 00:38:45.960
like I'm suggesting cheating but I'm not

00:38:43.319 --> 00:38:48.559
but you know I know some advanced level

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:51.210
techniques there is some like you know

00:38:48.559 --> 00:38:55.950
theoretical physicist level techniques

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:59.039
that I'm unfamiliar with so what should

00:38:55.950 --> 00:39:01.079
we do on this floor keep doubling those

00:38:59.039 --> 00:39:02.460
spirit oh it's just in case and also

00:39:01.079 --> 00:39:04.250
because they give you one of the few

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:10.410
ways to actually get points but for

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:13.049
consumables but also we should be

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:16.079
looking for secret rooms and we should

00:39:13.049 --> 00:39:18.119
explore absolutely everything I have to

00:39:16.079 --> 00:39:20.130
exercise my constitutional right to vote

00:39:18.119 --> 00:39:22.619
a little later but we can you know

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:24.660
politics can wait

00:39:22.619 --> 00:39:27.119
what's its early voting how Canadians

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:29.519
can you be oh that might be late for

00:39:27.119 --> 00:39:32.309
early voting I'm not going to be late it

00:39:29.519 --> 00:39:37.229
runs for like you know 10 hours of

00:39:32.309 --> 00:39:39.719
something wait we have a charge why not

00:39:37.229 --> 00:39:43.829
open every golden chest in existence

00:39:39.719 --> 00:39:45.569
after willing them into existence as as

00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:49.650
follows here well there is one reason

00:39:45.569 --> 00:39:53.099
again could crash the game could

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:56.479
accidentally lose the era rune there is

00:39:53.099 --> 00:40:02.940
a little risk not much but a little risk

00:39:56.479 --> 00:40:10.999
built-in eventually I think you stopped

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:13.349
getting any points for uh for swag so

00:40:10.999 --> 00:40:14.940
we've got to be coming close to that I

00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:17.809
think of all the consumables we picked

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:17.809
up the least money

00:40:17.839 --> 00:40:22.950
self-sacrifice room doesn't give us what

00:40:20.489 --> 00:40:28.019
we need on this right there just lowers

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:29.940
our point total and of course it does

00:40:28.019 --> 00:40:34.680
take us some time to go back here and

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:36.119
double every single time is this our

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:38.819
moment sure well you know what why not

00:40:36.119 --> 00:40:41.969
do okay so for those of you following

00:40:38.819 --> 00:40:45.719
northernlion skype corner good friend

00:40:41.969 --> 00:40:48.269
robert AKA alpaca patrol is just linked

00:40:48.269 --> 00:40:56.039
poorly drawn Bart Simpson on it and the

00:40:58.319 --> 00:41:02.670
shorts

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:02.670
[Music]

00:41:03.559 --> 00:41:11.099
well we've gained a few points just a

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:14.489
few hundred but I don't know if I

00:41:11.099 --> 00:41:16.410
believe that we gained something from

00:41:14.489 --> 00:41:18.660
coming into that room because we were

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:21.779
not at forty one thousand and we're

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:23.099
still not but we're a little closer it

00:41:21.779 --> 00:41:24.539
seems like we hit diminishing returns

00:41:23.099 --> 00:41:25.950
there after a point I think it's fair to

00:41:24.539 --> 00:41:27.539
say get out of here with your eat pant

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:30.229
bullshit Robert I don't care about a

00:41:27.539 --> 00:41:30.229
pant okay

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:44.410
infamy

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:46.570
that's not bad by opening that chest

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:52.240
we lost like 30 points how does this

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:56.110
such a thing even happen here I don't

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:58.450
understand like it seems like it's

00:41:56.110 --> 00:42:02.410
actually starting to be good not to open

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:05.740
chests like like they're actually not

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:08.110
paying dividends anymore we're going to

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:09.790
enter into a weird situation pretty soon

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:12.820
by the way like first off we definitely

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:16.290
do not want that and r.i.p anybody who

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:16.290
accidentally picks that up right now

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:33.160
sure sure no no um you you are a moron

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:36.850
man no secret room where could it be

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:40.390
oh my could it be now like all of our

00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:43.810
extra progress was destroyed by walking

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:48.640
into that blue fire that really chaps my

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:50.170
lips oh dude this does not though I've

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:52.600
been asking for this for a hundred years

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:55.560
thank you so much okay so we're

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:58.120
basically done with this run right now

00:42:55.560 --> 00:43:01.000
except on the next floor we have to make

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:03.070
a decision are we going - oh that was

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.920
close are we going to grind out points

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:08.140
or are we going to be as Amy boy

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:11.740
and are we going to double every single

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:13.330
item that we come across and pick them

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:14.440
all up regardless of whether or not

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:16.810
they're transformative because it will

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:18.820
cost us points but it will be more fun

00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:23.260
assuming the synergies actually makes

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:27.160
sense so sure we could have gotten more

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:29.770
items by leaving this but I'm not going

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:31.930
to d4 that's madness

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:35.330
I can't believe we didn't get to be owls

00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:38.490
above transformation either but

00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:40.770
I'm thinking we're not even going to be

00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:44.490
in the fifty thousands on this one but

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:52.160
it's close I think we'll probably be in

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:54.780
the extremely high 40s so I I don't know

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:56.490
top hundred might be a little bit of a

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:58.230
stretch sadly due by the way I have

00:43:56.490 --> 00:44:01.560
thirty three luck where's all my chest

00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:04.760
have I like created an overflow error or

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:06.930
something there they are

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:10.170
well if we're not going to get chests

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:13.680
every room it was already mathematically

00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:17.360
smarter to just double one room instead

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:17.360
of doubling multiple rooms but still

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:23.010
pretty fly is all right they're just an

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:25.260
aberration we got the Beelzebub

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:26.220
transformation bomber boy is terrible

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:28.560
let's go

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:31.770
also Seraphim we're losing like 50

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:37.820
points per item these enemies are very

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:42.170
rare had no idea the secret room is here

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:42.170
50 points per item is no joke

00:44:46.279 --> 00:44:56.519
we should really only take stuff that's

00:44:49.559 --> 00:44:58.349
actually dynamite then no oh god I'm

00:44:56.519 --> 00:45:03.209
trapped in the pit of breakfast escape

00:44:58.349 --> 00:45:06.329
escape I mean the cancer item is

00:45:03.209 --> 00:45:07.949
probably pretty good for us as well yeah

00:45:06.329 --> 00:45:09.469
that's too much stop talking about eat

00:45:07.949 --> 00:45:11.579
the hand I don't care

00:45:09.469 --> 00:45:16.559
why'd you leave the keys up on the table

00:45:11.579 --> 00:45:18.119
go on through this might have cost us

00:45:16.559 --> 00:45:19.739
like a thousand points total you know

00:45:18.119 --> 00:45:22.199
what that's okay look at our fates

00:45:19.739 --> 00:45:25.169
reward has never been so happy are you

00:45:22.199 --> 00:45:28.259
seeing the wonderful face reward action

00:45:25.169 --> 00:45:31.559
that he's got going on here why did I

00:45:28.259 --> 00:45:34.619
use Yara by the way I had to rid myself

00:45:31.559 --> 00:45:40.949
of the monkey's paw yeah we can take

00:45:34.619 --> 00:45:44.039
that that's not gummy that also ain't

00:45:40.949 --> 00:45:45.589
Falco I think we need to get ourselves

00:45:44.039 --> 00:45:49.349
out of this floor as quickly as possible

00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:51.719
or I'm I can't resist taking items is my

00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:55.380
kryptonite dude it always makes Isaac

00:45:51.719 --> 00:45:58.919
more fun when you take items easy plays

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:59.729
we're done I'd say top 150 we're 47th

00:45:58.919 --> 00:46:01.499
that's pretty good

00:45:59.729 --> 00:46:02.369
I can live with that for now thanks for
