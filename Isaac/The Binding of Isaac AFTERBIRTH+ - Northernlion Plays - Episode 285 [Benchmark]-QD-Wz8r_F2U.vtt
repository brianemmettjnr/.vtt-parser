##

00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.380
everybody welcome back to normal and

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.400
plays a binding once again applause it's

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.529
a daily we've been doing well lately

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.970
yesterday's daily thirty four thousand

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.540
two hundred and fifty six points rank of

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.219
one thirty one percentile rank of one

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.410
point five eight percent I'd like to get

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.170
those down in the you know below one

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.460
percent if possible but you know last

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.230
three days one point four eight one

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.210
point four nine one point five eight

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.250
can't really complain so what do you do

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.199
after you've been you know consistently

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.910
hidden those goals for a few days all

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.020
you should take a break you deserve no

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.300
you put another tally in the wind column

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.899
you keep that momentum going

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.040
the Samsun run it goes to the end it

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.520
should be paused here because I'm all

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.980
tabbed looking at the scores we go back

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.660
to the front page here top score 63,000

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.280
tails I know you watch these videos

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.160
sometimes how did you do that it's

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.469
amazing number two who foo fifty five

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.360
thousand eight thousand Point Gulf who

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.300
food sometimes you trash-talking me on

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.680
Twitter I'm coming for you you get that

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.309
I don't know how you got like the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.470
variance of a freaking casino sometimes

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.210
you got some 55,000 point scores that I

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.220
can't even think to attain sometimes you

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.979
got like you know a thirty thousand

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.979
point score all right so forty nine to

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.280
seventeen 49 to 63 thousand is where

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.619
we'd like to be but realistically forty

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.430
nine to fifty five thousand will put us

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.600
in the top 30

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.920
so let's go set here for long enough

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.360
it's not an Excel floor so probably do

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.180
you want to go to the curse room right

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.619
off the bat and we'll get that started

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.930
but I believe that you know I I want the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.450
card I'll spend a bomb to look for the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.090
card this is how it like dailies make

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.950
this a big deal am I going to use a bomb

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.570
to get a card I don't know that's a

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.729
tough decision I mean the lovers card is

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.590
actually very useful on if we can get a

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:59.040
an arcade for the next floor especially

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.170
did you see that dodge I'm not trying to

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.149
necessarily over hype it but requiring

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.920
me to stand still to dodge the enemy

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.420
that's shot in a like v-shaped pattern

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.899
that felt pretty good

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.470
I'm a believer though you know if you're

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.180
doing well just keep doing what you

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.440
do you know what do you do when you

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.820
slump just keep doing what you're doing

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.350
you're noticing perhaps there's a common

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.090
trend which is I just keep doing what

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.980
I'm doing as long as I believe that what

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.010
I'm doing can work and there's evidence

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.080
to support that I like it

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.820
you know I was always a kid in school

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.370
and people find this hard to believe it

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.920
it's not meant braggadocious I was

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.880
basically like a Poindexter in high

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.460
school but I never skipped one class in

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.410
the entirety of high school I was going

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:54.180
after that perfect attendance badge not

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.740
because you know I wanted to go oh

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.960
there's nothing better to do today and

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.900
like learn the Krebs cycle once again

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:04.470
but like sincerely you're like I got

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.720
I've been there 90 days in a row to just

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.880
skip the 91st day sure it might not be

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.710
catastrophic but you know I'm throwing

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.480
away a little bit of progress there also

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.250
it helps that I went to the high school

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.270
in like the world's smallest town and

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.580
the only thing within walking distance

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.920
was a convenience store I mean a lot of

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.720
people did skip class but they just you

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.920
know hey what you do when you skip class

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.920
I hung out behind the school yeah I

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.540
didn't learn any stupid knowledge that

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.350
could have helped me I just stood

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.209
outside smoked two cigarettes over the

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.010
course of 70 minutes like I'm not

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.920
ragging on you for your personal

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.989
lifestyle choices there but it always

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.040
seemed to me like you know the time was

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.810
better served in the classroom and then

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.310
you know that's why I got beat up I

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.170
didn't actually get beat up I was I mean

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.030
I now we're getting into like you know

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.140
personal stuff but yeah you know I was

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.480
you can ask Michael al Fox we were like

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.790
not cool but we were okay in high school

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.550
we were like secret nerds that nobody

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.140
knew about

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.000
or maybe everybody knew about it but

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.650
nobody wanted to tell us so this is

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.830
important we got to find our secret room

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:23.850
it must be here get one penny get an

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:26.110
arcade get one penny get an arcade get

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:34.120
one penny get in arcade god

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:35.500
yeah get one penny get in arcade I'm

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.090
gonna stop talking about my high school

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:42.280
crew what what can book of shadows give

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:46.240
us here that could save us um I mean it

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:51.250
could give us a shovel geez okay I mean

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:54.460
we don't need to rush but I got a peep

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:58.120
the chance that y'all okay look at that

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:01.449
that is our like crowning achievement

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.599
right there got nothing else to do on

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:05.800
this floor this is fine i don'ti won the

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:09.310
Dead Sea Scrolls I don't like Dead Sea

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.050
Scrolls but we have it and it can

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.370
contribute to bookworm didn't help us

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.169
out too much there but that's okay if we

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.449
get an arcade on this floor as a result

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:20.080
of our of our actions I'm going to feel

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:21.849
like a dang genius and we did get a

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.500
year's upgrade on the last floor as well

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:28.840
that's pretty solid in fact I think that

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.819
blue cap oh my god we did get an arcade

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.349
he's done it the blue cap is one of the

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:37.089
you know probably in the top third of

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:38.860
boss items that you could possibly pick

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:41.800
up so what's the what's the draw here

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.080
how do we like really how do we get into

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.529
the top 10% of ranks on the second floor

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.949
here

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:49.599
real simple if we're able to at first

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:51.339
stop we're going to get like ridiculous

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:52.599
damage and money on this floor so if we

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:54.250
can get keys to turn that into

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:56.259
meaningful shops for this floor the next

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.779
floor and beyond that's sweet

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:01.449
but really that the principle draw is IV

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:05.139
bag if we can get an early IV bag we've

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:07.839
got kind of endless damage potential a

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:10.750
golden key a Justice card that gave us a

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:12.550
golden key and another Justice card this

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.979
one didn't give us a golden key which is

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:19.089
good because we don't actually want to

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:21.789
building Keys debatably we might not

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:23.349
even want one that much but you can use

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:25.990
it for the Arcadian shop on this floor

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:30.009
no we definitely want one don't be silly

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:31.839
okay now oh we got IV bag so we'll lose

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:33.580
them sea scrolls pick up IV bag we're

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:36.190
probably at the damage cap for this

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:39.009
floor so I don't feel too much of a need

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.790
to go for broke there but we might as

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:41.470
well I mean

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.940
pick up money wherever is available

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.390
right there's a luck upgrade out of that

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:48.520
as well

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:50.080
oh boys we got this one we are going to

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.680
be a little slow just by virtue of the

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.540
fact that I mean like it's popped off

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:59.110
already we've had to take some time to

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.580
accomplish our objectives here that's

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.340
going to happen from time to time but

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:07.180
that's absolutely okay all a golden key

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:09.270
on this floor how did they know what do

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:13.600
you get for the man who has everything

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:15.940
it's ridiculous how much this one extra

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.790
penny might have changed the the

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:21.240
complete course of this run so I also do

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:25.630
feel the need to point out as always on

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:29.100
IV bag plus cracked dice is like a ten

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:32.770
out of ten break the run get unlimited

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:35.140
resources sort of upgrade however I want

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:38.250
sure my friend Corey twitch.tv slash

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:40.270
Black Flag do those dailies where he

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:42.190
sometimes not every time because they

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.960
take like two hours each do those

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.660
dailies Reigate IV bag and crack dice

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.340
and it's annoying it's not I mean you

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.900
might want to watch it at some point at

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.190
a curiosity's sake I'm not saying you

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.620
shouldn't watch his dailies because he

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:57.130
like very consistently outranks me

00:07:53.620 --> 00:08:00.340
however it's not my style of play

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:04.900
spending like two hours on the on the

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:07.210
arcade just you know IV bag reroll IV

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:09.760
bag cracked ice tea 20 IV bag crack size

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:12.160
D 20 uh you know scapular has given me a

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:15.220
spear at art IV bag crack size D 20 it

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:20.050
is the you know a very very reproducible

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:21.760
way to get a good score when all the

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:24.640
stars align it I don't begrudge anybody

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:27.070
for doing it certainly I find it oh this

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.260
is like pretty solid find it more

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:34.740
honorable than like you know just not

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:37.330
fighting and why not not fighting a

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:38.979
delirium because little delirium is hard

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:43.330
but all I mean again I don't really but

00:08:38.979 --> 00:08:44.680
you that either you know you got AB you

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.120
know play the cards are given if the

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.250
game is given you these cards you should

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.380
take them that tears up doesn't work how

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:53.649
am i at the tears cap already it seems

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:56.110
not plausible but sack o sacks

00:08:53.649 --> 00:08:57.970
is good and it was great actually and

00:08:56.110 --> 00:09:00.129
piggy bank I think is just going to give

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.809
us so much more money because we're

00:09:00.129 --> 00:09:03.309
going to be using the IV bag constantly

00:09:01.809 --> 00:09:07.089
that it seems like a very appropriate

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:10.839
choice so it felt fine to me and in here

00:09:07.089 --> 00:09:12.579
honestly I mean I'm going to take my

00:09:10.839 --> 00:09:15.720
shadow even though it minimizes our

00:09:12.579 --> 00:09:20.160
ability to use the IV bag somewhat

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:22.540
because we can generate like a bunch of

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:27.879
shadows off of it so it seems like a

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:29.619
sensible play to me ace of clubs grab

00:09:27.879 --> 00:09:32.860
this get out of here I don't really want

00:09:29.619 --> 00:09:34.779
the ace of clubs but we can actually use

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:37.300
ace of clubs like extremely nicely with

00:09:34.779 --> 00:09:39.009
IV bag so get like a ton of bombs out of

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.300
it first things first obviously you know

00:09:39.009 --> 00:09:42.429
with the amount of spirits we have you

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:46.720
want to do that and we could choose to

00:09:42.429 --> 00:09:47.709
get money here and and getting money

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.720
might not be the worst thing in the

00:09:47.709 --> 00:09:51.550
world that was fairly bad damage I'll

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.959
admit the first time we've been hit on

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:54.759
this run though and there were many

00:09:52.959 --> 00:10:00.550
opportunities for us to get tagged so I

00:09:54.759 --> 00:10:02.769
don't mind it too much we also need to

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:04.990
go faster we're like a minute behind

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:09.509
schedule because of well because of the

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:14.670
arcade more or less so we do have a

00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:14.670
desire to go a little faster admittedly

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.749
so just cool it a little bit here hang

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.879
demand is unnecessary I forgot we could

00:10:19.749 --> 00:10:23.740
fly actually so I think the easy play is

00:10:21.879 --> 00:10:25.529
you crack this open with that B bag take

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.850
the pill pillows friends to the end

00:10:25.529 --> 00:10:31.629
probably pick up that money ace of clubs

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:33.850
this money and then go explore in this

00:10:31.629 --> 00:10:36.069
direction down here just in case is an

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:37.149
easier like dead-end opportunity it's a

00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:39.809
good use of eights of clubs and you

00:10:37.149 --> 00:10:42.309
don't get too many so generally speaking

00:10:39.809 --> 00:10:46.389
1/2 red heart allows us to go to that

00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:48.160
cursed room guilt-free lovely you don't

00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:50.769
get hurt on the way in which I forgot

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.350
about on the way out clearly I forgot

00:10:50.769 --> 00:10:54.129
about in the way and I should say um

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:58.350
double key room

00:10:54.129 --> 00:10:58.350
why not why not right

00:10:59.529 --> 00:11:08.740
a four-room rerolls all the pedestals of

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:11.050
course it's very dicey on my part I'm

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.459
just going to go for it right away it's

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:15.310
possible that there could have been a

00:11:12.459 --> 00:11:19.360
better use for that but again I'm a

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:21.160
little strapped on time here not quite

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.110
to the point that I should be like you

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:26.920
know afraid of how this run looks right

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:29.499
now but enough to be keeping an eye on

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:31.059
it number two is unlimited bombs and we

00:11:29.499 --> 00:11:32.769
got another key back anyway and then two

00:11:31.059 --> 00:11:35.079
of clubs they can just blank ruin right

00:11:32.769 --> 00:11:36.459
away and to give us algae's and then you

00:11:35.079 --> 00:11:39.610
hold two of clubs and that's like our

00:11:36.459 --> 00:11:41.860
ace in the hole for points if we can get

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:43.569
like a you know blank card or just you

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:49.540
know we're never going to have to use a

00:11:43.569 --> 00:11:51.339
bomb again unless we want to but number

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:54.249
two does slow us down a lot that's worth

00:11:51.339 --> 00:11:58.569
noting because it's cost us boss rush

00:11:54.249 --> 00:12:00.430
opportunities in the past if we can make

00:11:58.569 --> 00:12:01.839
up like fifteen seconds on the next few

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:08.620
floors like that's fine by me we got a

00:12:01.839 --> 00:12:10.509
hermit card we got a death card secret

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.220
rooms of course should be very easy for

00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:13.509
us to come by kind of feel like we

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.889
should just hermit card right away so we

00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:18.519
don't the backtrack and then we'll come

00:12:14.889 --> 00:12:23.290
back and grab two of two of whatever's

00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:27.009
at our earliest opportunity to a clubs

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:29.110
yet hermit card grab this to get trinket

00:12:27.009 --> 00:12:31.750
smelter you got mom's purse might as

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:33.100
well grab a second trinket I would love

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.899
to have a chance at an arcade on the

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:38.740
next floor IV bag gives us a good shot

00:12:34.899 --> 00:12:40.809
there but we want to avoid wasting too

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.100
much time infested is completely okay

00:12:40.809 --> 00:12:43.990
I'm going to be out of this floor about

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:47.860
a minute behind schedule again and I'd

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:50.649
consider that relatively okay nothing to

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:51.250
nothing to sneeze at at least alright

00:12:50.649 --> 00:12:52.899
again

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:55.420
Bighorn every time this time though

00:12:52.899 --> 00:12:56.740
Bighorn is not going to say the easiest

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:59.740
boss for us to fight because that would

00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:02.529
just be wrong but at least you've got

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:04.389
damage don't always have damage when you

00:13:02.529 --> 00:13:06.519
fight this guy trying to avoid throwing

00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:09.809
my own bombs into the mix just you know

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:09.809
keep from complicating things

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:15.980
we're almost out of this again minute

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.270
behind schedule not too bad considering

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:21.560
we have ten damaged we should be able to

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:24.620
recover alright grab this Jesus juice is

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:26.630
decent we've got a two of clubs again so

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:28.400
we can use that to buoy us a little bit

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:30.020
in this situation now we only need one

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.810
more two clubs and we're at 99 bombs

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:35.210
could be a big point boon for us so step

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:36.830
one you probably IB bag you didn't have

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:39.590
to IV bag in there in hindsight but

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:41.960
amnesia and X lags

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:46.100
and these just not that big of a deal

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:49.760
but it is a little annoying two keys

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:51.890
gives us not two keys and a speed

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:55.220
downgrade all right this is where I

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:57.080
start to become mildly alarmed with the

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.640
situation just because seems like

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:02.440
there's a lot of things conspiring to

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:05.420
keep us out of this boss trap room but

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:11.150
still a little bit of time to recover

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:13.190
from this and how I didn't get hit there

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:14.990
is a little beyond me if I'm being

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:16.580
honest and sorry I mean we're in a

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:19.310
relatively comfortable position any we

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:21.940
can coast fairly easily here would be

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:24.589
nice to get some deal with the devil as

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:26.600
options here like up our base damage a

00:14:24.589 --> 00:14:30.100
little bit pump pump the jam pump it up

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:32.360
while our feet are stumping for example

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:37.250
okay we need to start spitting out more

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:38.540
bombs because we're actually possibly

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:41.180
going to be like two minutes behind

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:42.890
schedule here and you know what there's

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:45.260
no shame and being two minutes behind

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:49.970
schedule there's a little bit of shame

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:52.250
and being late as Kanye West said I'll

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:54.430
be on time for that I ain't thought of

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:56.630
no songs that would rhyme with that

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:58.370
nothing thought of no lines that would

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.290
rhyme with that that's I think that's

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:03.140
correct

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:05.870
I'm a punctual person to the point of it

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:08.530
being comic you know if I have to do

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:10.550
something in 90 minutes I will be like

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:12.110
tonight you don't understand I can't do

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.820
anything else right now what is the

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:16.400
thing that I found crazy because I'm

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:18.200
like consistently two to three minutes

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:21.840
late for the NL SS but that's a result

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:23.520
of I'm not blaming anybody else

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.910
as a result of having to coordinate

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:28.920
other people it introduces some overhead

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:31.440
but as far as you know twitch streamers

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:36.630
go we're relatively punctual on the

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:38.400
analysis I think grand Papa fly here

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.870
quickly but in in real life when it

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.630
comes to like a doctor's appointment or

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:47.820
something never late just does not

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:50.640
happen I used to have to drive you know

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:53.790
across like from Vancouver to another

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.600
city once a week to get there at 6:30

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:57.180
p.m.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:59.670
rush hour so but you know few million

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:01.440
people live in this area and many of

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:04.040
them commute because you know property

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:07.340
prices are out of control

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:10.020
there's a busy road still never late

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:11.670
unbelievable you said the consistency is

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.320
unlike we've ever seen before now they

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:17.340
didn't say that of course that's madness

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:19.230
but you got to go a little faster here I

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.520
don't understand lateness but we talked

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:25.020
about this so many times before I don't

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:28.820
know if I want to reach read this this

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:31.290
floor ah that was just very dumb but

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:35.430
this floor loops around on itself in a

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:37.890
strange way like a mad villainy song mad

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:42.030
villain mad villains bent like the album

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:45.630
came out of 2003 cubby slack okay like I

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:47.670
said two minutes behind schedule but it

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:51.120
depends you know are we supposed to be

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:53.400
at work at 9:00 and it's 9:02 or we

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.470
supposed to be at work at 9:00 and it's

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:59.700
like 8:15 normally we leave the house at

00:16:55.470 --> 00:17:03.000
8:30 you know we can make up for that we

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:04.800
take a we take a turn down like the

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.959
detour and the detour is not that well

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.790
trafficked we're in a great spot as far

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:11.160
as I'm concerned but we do need to go a

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:13.470
little faster you know against sometimes

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:15.660
you get bogged down in like the minutia

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:18.930
if you're running it's almost the curse

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:20.220
if your run gets too good too fast you

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:22.860
can find yourself in these positions

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:24.540
where like you know you don't understand

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:28.230
I have to go back to the arcade because

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:29.850
that could get another you know 1.3

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:33.510
damage over the course of the next four

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:35.020
years it's the right play on a non daily

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:38.020
but on a daily we got to be a little

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:39.550
and more a little bit faster so gimpy I

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:43.980
mean is a great choice on this run we

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:47.140
only have one luck but it's not bad but

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:48.280
this floor it would be very very nice to

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.900
kick it into gear because if you miss

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:53.140
boss Rochelle you know never forgive

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:55.600
myself definitely should not have used

00:17:53.140 --> 00:18:03.600
the IV bag on the way in that is going

00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:09.010
to hurt probably no we got saved okay

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:10.000
progress we're also like I mean because

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:11.770
of the fact that we don't have as many

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.840
red hearts although gimpy will fix that

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:17.470
pretty quickly we're going to take a

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:20.670
little longer to get to our maximum

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:24.550
damage here which is sort of annoying

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:29.110
but we should be able to sort it sooner

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:31.090
or later which is why I'm looking for

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:33.280
red hearts here also looking for like I

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:34.720
mean a devil card is fine but looking

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.630
for like an emperor card we can't really

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:39.010
peep that I think we've got a we got to

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.970
kick it into gear as if you know our

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:43.090
life depends on it

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:44.860
so nothing here is necessarily worth

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:47.290
buying potato peeler you know the fun

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:50.080
item does give us a permanent damage

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:51.760
increase but it's not really a good fit

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:55.210
with IV bag if we're looking to get the

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:58.600
maximum possible damage bonus just can't

00:18:55.210 --> 00:19:01.720
hit that bomb fly I guess cricket's body

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:04.930
so good lowers our effective range but

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:09.220
small price to pay to hours crank on

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:10.540
that let's go let's go one Emperor card

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:13.210
completely solves this because if we

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:15.130
have a devil card for the boss fight or

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:18.430
sorry for boss rush nothing could stop

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:19.600
us and I'm deliberately like not talking

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:20.680
about what our points are going to be

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:25.540
like on this run cuz I'm a little

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:32.400
concerned about our ability to get to

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:32.400
boss rush right now come on dude come

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:39.100
but we're not too far off from it but I

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:42.050
gotta be honest we're at 12,000 here on

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:46.490
the depths one oftentimes that's where

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:49.250
we are on the on the depths to like let

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:51.080
me enter boss rush so of course there's

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:52.850
always the chance of momma mega as well

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:56.480
I should go back for that key but I'm

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:58.190
getting like mad paranoid right now keep

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:03.350
in mind we've also got to make the hush

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:08.330
fight so like there's we got things to

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:10.340
do man this run now that was pretty bad

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:12.559
this run is good enough that we should

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:15.350
not be missing you know important

00:20:12.559 --> 00:20:17.150
milestones you know it's our kids

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:19.100
baseball game he's pitching for the

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:21.350
Little League World Series we're showing

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:23.000
up late saying sorry you know my car is

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:25.520
too fast they couldn't get here in time

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.460
does it it's it's tone-deaf it doesn't

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:30.470
make any sense

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:33.590
straight up brownie I hate you you're

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:35.870
not dodge able on a regular basis Thank

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:37.580
You gimpy for hooking me up here but I

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:38.870
know it looks like I'm tilting to the

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:40.820
extreme right now but we got to get

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:43.490
right next to this boss to hit them

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:45.830
because they don't follow the rules of

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:49.360
engagement that we all agreed upon in

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:50.570
the eyes of Geneva Convention stop

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:53.809
jumping

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:57.020
stop jumping he's immune to the bombs

00:20:53.809 --> 00:20:59.540
heal him the bombs heal him you have

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:03.260
screwed yourself good sir you have

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:06.050
screwed yourself okay now this is still

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:09.440
fine but we need to go extraordinarily

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:11.480
fast we lost like 500 points there dang

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:13.280
it I didn't realize until too late that

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:16.240
number two was the source of all of my

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:16.240
problems there

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:26.820
okay can we still make it yeah why not

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:28.620
right so now we broke our tears cap I

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:30.809
guess I didn't realize that mr. Dahle

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:33.030
does that unicorn stump is like super

00:21:30.809 --> 00:21:35.550
cool if you have anything that does

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:37.920
damage and we do in the form of my

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:41.220
shadow but then we have to give up you

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:42.870
know IV Bank and make it happen so I'm

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:44.250
going to crack into that just yet we

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:46.429
don't have anything to kill mom quickly

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:49.559
either so I'm actually getting pretty

00:21:46.429 --> 00:21:53.630
concerned about our chances of greatness

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:57.990
here got a people card just in case its

00:21:53.630 --> 00:22:06.600
Emperor maybe I mean he responds great

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:11.340
as well so I'm like very very not mad

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:13.440
about that shop if we're going to make

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:14.610
boss rush we got it we got to go I don't

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.670
think there was a card in there we would

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:19.230
have seen it nine point eight eight

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:28.170
damage nothing wrong with it

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:29.460
no arcade necessary for certain maybe we

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:32.280
should just be bombing our way through

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:35.880
all these rooms but what can you do dude

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:38.100
what can you do dude oh there we go okay

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:44.309
let's go okay this one's got to be bombs

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:49.680
through no question this one cannot be

00:22:44.309 --> 00:22:51.930
bombed through let's go

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:59.250
fifteen seconds there's no time pop this

00:22:51.930 --> 00:23:04.110
get that five damage bonus pop-up pop-up

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:07.550
let's go grab this grab this get in

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:10.800
there we did it it was scary

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:12.000
there's death touch and permanent

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:15.450
polaroid invincibility

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.860
okay now is all forgiven no no no not

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:20.340
not all is forgiven

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:22.440
this was this was incredibly like

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:23.970
touch-and-go things got dicey er than

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.410
they had any right to be I don't even

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:28.470
know what I'm touching and taking damage

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:32.450
here but now we can relax ever so

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:34.950
slightly stop taking damage

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:36.390
another hero font card that's good for

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:38.700
the next floor

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:43.440
we probably hit our own bomb back there

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:47.190
as my guess but this is the dream come

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:49.410
true man we should be able to make the

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:52.920
hush fight easily we're well above our

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:59.640
normal threshold for points here just

00:23:52.920 --> 00:24:02.000
watch out for your own bombs don't worry

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:05.970
about any consumables just yet who cares

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.190
only worry about you know getting to 50

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:11.300
bombs so that when you pop two of clubs

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:11.300
you get that point bonus

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:18.470
nicely done okay papa a butt bomb in the

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:21.770
center here

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:25.100
I want to crack into the center so I can

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:31.340
break it open and fire more easily

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:33.680
through it there's 50 bombs that means

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:36.500
we can finally use two of clubs or open

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:38.810
the 17 thousands man nothing wrong with

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:40.430
this we also I didn't even point it out

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:41.810
because things were getting super tight

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:43.070
here now I feel like I can relax a

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:48.590
little bit and maybe actually have some

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:51.560
genuine commentary but like we got to

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:53.330
humbling bundle which is amazing for us

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:55.400
and it means like if we can ever get

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:58.130
restocked we could just buy infinity

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:59.210
things on the shop I am a little bummed

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:01.970
that we didn't get to go to our deal

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:04.490
with the devil but by the time we found

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:05.900
the boss fight or were at least looking

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:09.200
for the boss fight I would have given us

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:12.260
like a less than a 25% chance to make it

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:14.420
into boss rush so think honestly we

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.950
should just be thankful that where we're

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:18.050
kicking it right now and we're going to

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:19.880
make it in time for hush like the damage

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:21.260
that we're outputting right now that was

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:24.910
so bad but the damage that we're out

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:24.910
putting right now is ridiculously good

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:32.480
dude I stopped

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:33.950
I'm just interrupting my own shots here

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.710
so that I don't accidentally put bombs

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:38.270
down and I got to admit like the big my

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:43.630
if I have a regret on this run that's

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:45.980
definitely the the the dangle fighter

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:47.870
whatever the poop monster is called in

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:51.470
this day and age you never know man

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:54.380
you never know because like there's no

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:57.110
reason for me to have eaten it as badly

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:59.450
as I did there but what's done is done

00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:01.580
we're here and again we got more points

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:03.320
than usual like drastically more points

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:06.020
than usual not saying we're going for

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:07.880
top 30 everybody should have more points

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:09.710
than usual right now just saying we got

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:12.170
a chance so Ivy begged you know again we

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:19.510
could get a lot of and actually we

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:19.510
should but be careful my thinking is uh

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:24.750
you know we want luck upgrades but you

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:32.420
can only get luck upgrades they won't be

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:32.420
in double pennies so I don't even know

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:38.190
it seems like we're gaining nothing from

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:39.450
doing that so let's just grab these we

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:41.550
should we should stay at a half heart

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:43.380
interval that'll make us better for the

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:45.330
next floor and get the heck out of here

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.760
and we did get some don't pick it up

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:49.560
don't pick it up we did get a compound

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.730
fracture as well which is really nice I

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.650
hope it's Center judges with crickets

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:56.760
body you would think that it would but

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:59.070
you never know seems like we're

00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:01.620
generating a lot of Tears so so I'm

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:02.210
guessing that it does do what it says on

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.490
the tin

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:08.780
justice card spirit heart it's good

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:08.780
because we didn't really want to pick up

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:16.080
we didn't really want to pick up or use

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:18.440
the hero font card right away pay

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:21.570
attention you know it's kind of hard to

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:23.160
see where we're going here with all

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:25.080
these things on the screen but we

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:31.740
probably won't be able to explore

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:34.970
everything but we should explore as much

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:37.560
as is appropriate which is kind of like

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:39.120
obvious you know you should always it's

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.930
like saying you know you should try to

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.210
do your best

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:43.860
oh no kidding like I mean there are

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:46.860
probably fringe scenarios in which it

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:48.600
makes sense to not try your best but you

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:53.790
know it's not exactly a revelation is

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:55.440
what I'm trying to get at the tricky

00:27:53.790 --> 00:28:01.770
part is figuring out you know what what

00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:04.140
is our best in this in this case you

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:05.520
were able to crank up our damage there I

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:07.770
don't know we're not at a half heart

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:10.620
anymore so invincibility is compromised

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:12.330
but it's not that meaningful I'd like to

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:15.510
be out of here by like 26 minutes you

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:19.050
know what sun card helps out a great

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:24.630
deal there moon card moon card to moon

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:28.460
cards always check these at this point

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:28.460
there's not much reason not to

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:38.920
must be at the damaged cap by now 26

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:40.420
minutes very doable I'll even fight the

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:42.550
mini-boss because we have certainty even

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:44.830
if we're out of your Pella geez even if

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:46.630
we're out of here by you know oh that

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:49.900
was so dumb I meant to use the hero fun

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:51.970
even if we out of here by you know 26:45

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:53.710
it doesn't matter because we know that

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:56.620
we're going to be out of here by 26:45

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:58.480
because we know where the boss is so the

00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:01.150
next floor introduces a certain level of

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:03.100
uncertainty for sure but this floor is

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:06.250
going fine but we are we're making some

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:07.810
mistakes I'm not necessarily proud of so

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:10.630
let's work around that you know start to

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:12.160
tighten up a little bit we do still have

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:15.940
to beat hush probably the best way to

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:24.510
beat hush is to have a lot of HP when

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:30.040
you go down there hoping to get to 99

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:33.760
keys as well which you with I'll do with

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:39.250
a humbling bundle should be like

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:41.380
extremely plausible just about the

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:43.390
easiest boss fight of all time and we

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:46.320
get a deal with devil so we want this

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:50.380
because it gives us a better base oh

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:51.790
it's like it hurts it hurts because we

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:53.800
won't be able to use IV bag but it's

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:56.620
like almost certainly the right decision

00:29:53.800 --> 00:30:03.190
nonetheless because it's amazing I want

00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:06.540
some HP though gotta try this that's

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:06.540
like a lot of everything

00:30:06.919 --> 00:30:14.610
it is worth it because like have you

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:17.280
noticed like I think our our damage

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:18.900
scales really nicely as a product of the

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:21.150
number of shots on the screen so

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:24.720
doubling the shot output seems to have

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:26.190
been sensible but it is fair that you

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:29.600
know we've compromised the ability

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:32.250
ability for IV bag to do anything at all

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:38.429
alright it will be very easy to get into

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:41.880
our hush fight here it would be amazing

00:30:38.429 --> 00:30:43.950
to snag HP on this floor but I don't

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:51.630
know how it happens like Black Lotus of

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:55.380
course if possible not against it to the

00:30:51.630 --> 00:31:00.179
every chest it's worth like ridiculous

00:30:55.380 --> 00:31:03.750
amount of consumables well obviously

00:31:00.179 --> 00:31:07.850
there's no Black Lotus then so guess

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:14.309
where the other easy way would be to buy

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:15.570
a an HP upgrade on the next floor I'm

00:31:14.309 --> 00:31:16.860
trying to think of their HP upgrades you

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:19.350
can buy on the shop and I think the

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:21.299
answer is no so we can just get one from

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:23.610
one of the item rooms on the Blue Room

00:31:21.299 --> 00:31:25.470
that would be something or an HP upgrade

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:28.710
pill this is amnesia though we'll take

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:29.940
it we'll just take it like I just don't

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:35.549
want to fight these enemies because they

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:37.950
could teleport me we'll take it once

00:31:35.549 --> 00:31:41.549
we're ready to leave this floor relax is

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:42.990
totally fine and this everything needs

00:31:41.549 --> 00:31:49.740
to be blown up here we got golden bombs

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:51.450
so just make yourself safe give yourself

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:56.160
that extra deal with the devil chance

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:58.919
2.5 percent you never know man 2.5%

00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:00.900
deals meaningless until it's 2.5 percent

00:31:58.919 --> 00:32:03.980
that keeps you from you know passing a

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.980
class or something like that

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:10.090
so I think we might as well pop amnesia

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.799
right now we prot I mean we do have time

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:15.700
to explore there's no probably about it

00:32:11.799 --> 00:32:18.880
but I'm excited once we go down to the

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:25.330
hush fight we're officially like in the

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:27.510
clear as far as time specific stuff goes

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:32.130
we did get a deal with the devil

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:34.720
see also devil uh guppy items but no

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:38.350
okay so we got basically nothing there

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:40.480
I just wanted to pop that to get it out

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:43.540
of the system here we are on the hush

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:45.910
fight house today is daily going I gotta

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:48.250
say is pretty good

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:50.820
guillotine a prayer card that's tough

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:53.530
guillotine gives us a benefit long term

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:56.080
within a but like a possible cost

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:59.110
associated with it of being hit more

00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:01.179
frequently we really don't need any of

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:06.309
this like it's just not quite good

00:33:01.179 --> 00:33:08.020
enough so I guess we'll see roon bag is

00:33:06.309 --> 00:33:10.870
good I mean we have enough money to buy

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:16.299
something we might as well buy BOGO

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:22.660
bombs and then you know get back to 99

00:33:16.299 --> 00:33:25.270
cents well 96 cents might as well blow

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:28.179
this up we got tiny glitter bombs for

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:30.220
some reason / aus subkick well

00:33:28.179 --> 00:33:31.600
guillotine breaks the tear cap which

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:35.700
makes me think it's useful but prayer

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.700
card gives us a better ability to use

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:40.870
the blood bank in the future but I

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:44.490
thought a damage up and lowering the

00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:44.490
tear cap made a little bit more sense

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:54.040
the pill is paralysis I think took us

00:33:50.049 --> 00:33:56.460
from 765 to less than 765 so that was

00:33:54.040 --> 00:34:01.210
ill-advised but not a huge problem

00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:03.280
alright let's go for it here so the

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:07.059
thing that stinks about this is that we

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:09.419
can't use IV bag because we've

00:34:07.059 --> 00:34:11.740
compromised our HP but it was

00:34:09.419 --> 00:34:15.149
doubtlessly in my opinion the right

00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:15.149
decision to take Incubus

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:21.930
if anything that were probably pickups a

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:24.160
little earlier that we could have

00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:28.420
ignored on the deal with the devil but

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:30.550
instead chose to stick with I think the

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:32.890
less bombs we output the better for now

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:35.890
so I'm going to try to remember to

00:34:32.890 --> 00:34:38.050
interrupt my shots mid shot as most as

00:34:35.890 --> 00:34:39.370
possible or as much as possible was

00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:41.140
great about fighting hush right now is

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:44.320
that he's got a hitbox that's as large

00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:47.200
as the freaking you know Burj Dubai it's

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:50.080
not plausible to miss him with a large

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:53.440
proportion of our like reflected shots

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:56.050
here so I got no complaints on offer

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:59.050
there it's going to take a little while

00:34:56.050 --> 00:35:00.550
but think you know as long as we don't

00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:03.550
get hit too too much we're going to be

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:05.410
fine it's not conceivable to be like you

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:07.510
know it's never conceivable to ask for

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:09.130
perfection you know you don't have to be

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:11.350
perfect in this world you just got to be

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:13.360
good enough most of the time and that's

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:15.100
you know that's not the message that

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:16.960
your teachers the teachers they're

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:19.570
sending to you but like you can be a

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:21.550
functional adult and be like kind of a

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:22.990
piece of garbage most of the time I mean

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:24.640
that in like the good piece of garbage

00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:27.130
sort of way you know not in the bad

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:28.780
piece of garbage like I Drive better

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:32.040
when I'm drunk but you know piece of

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:34.420
garbage like them don't really like

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:36.580
answering the telephone like you can be

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:41.070
an adult like that as long as you get it

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:41.070
together much of the time

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:47.730
people like the system is designed for

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:50.770
garbage like myself to at least survive

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:52.300
as some of your teachers aren't going to

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:54.609
tell you I'm not giving you an excuse to

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:58.000
be garbage I'm just saying perfection is

00:35:54.609 --> 00:36:02.770
not a reasonable ask most of the time

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:08.349
sure if it's like a I'm trying to think

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:09.849
of a good realistic example it's hard

00:36:08.349 --> 00:36:12.490
because society doesn't give you that

00:36:09.849 --> 00:36:14.619
many options you know well here's one

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:15.849
that reflects a little poorly on me but

00:36:14.619 --> 00:36:17.440
that makes it the perfect anecdote

00:36:15.849 --> 00:36:23.560
because I'm only selling myself out I

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:26.109
forgot to pay my electricity bill like

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:28.390
six weeks ago I get email it's the

00:36:26.109 --> 00:36:30.130
danger of going paperless man sometimes

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:31.540
you know you get an email and you're

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:33.490
like all the electricity bills in and

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:35.230
then I just forget about it so I got an

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:38.200
email from the electricity company and

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:39.700
they were like hey here's a reminder to

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:41.770
pay your electricity bill we're not

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:43.450
trying to put you on the spot or

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:44.680
anything but you should really pay his

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:46.630
electricity bill we're giving you like

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:49.119
an extra week to do so and I was like

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:51.670
thank you electricity company that was

00:36:49.119 --> 00:36:55.119
very nice that's an example of how

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:56.470
society it's designed to catch you when

00:36:55.119 --> 00:36:59.410
you slip through the cracks a little bit

00:36:56.470 --> 00:37:01.690
sometimes unless you know that that is

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:03.220
also an example of my electricity

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:05.740
company being very nice though because

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:07.690
you could definitely have you know then

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:09.099
be like we've got another situation and

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:11.020
this one reflects a little bit more

00:37:09.099 --> 00:37:13.210
poorly on us as well but also on our ex

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:14.710
landlord do the air irune sick we don't

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:20.080
need that don't pick it up to waste a

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:22.630
waste of points in if you want to learn

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:25.119
more about the residential tenant act in

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:25.420
British Columbia this is the channel for

00:37:25.119 --> 00:37:26.859
you

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:31.480
British Columbia being the province that

00:37:26.859 --> 00:37:33.040
I live in in Canada we in in British

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.570
Columbia usually when you rent a place

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:37.240
you sign a lease it's an agreement

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:38.830
between a tenant and the owner or at

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:40.060
least the manager of the property that

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:40.990
you know you're going to live here

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:42.430
you're going to pay this much rent

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:46.240
monthly and this is the duration of the

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:48.280
contract unlike most places in Canada at

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:52.960
least when the lease runs out if neither

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:55.220
party has given each other notice that

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:56.750
they are terminating the agreement

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:58.280
continues month-to-month so what that

00:37:56.750 --> 00:38:00.260
basically means is you know if you're

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:02.210
living in a place you got a year lease

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:04.369
the lease runs out you're still living

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:06.080
in it until the landlord tells you you

00:38:04.369 --> 00:38:08.000
know hey 60 days from now I'd like you

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:10.160
to move out or you tell the landlord hey

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.960
60 days from now I'd like to move out

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:15.880
we should go reroll skeet order oh we

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:18.980
shouldn't hold the re-roll and use it

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:21.920
you didn't get hurt on it we should hold

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:25.040
the rear roll and use it on the yarid

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:28.820
Ches so we had a month-to-month

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:32.599
agreement with our landlord this is a

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:34.130
perfect situation everyone was happy but

00:38:32.599 --> 00:38:35.750
the thing is you know normally you give

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:37.310
them pre-authorized checks oh I know

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:39.980
what year is it but now you give him

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:41.450
pre-authorized checks and once the lease

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:43.340
is over we got to give him a check on a

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:45.619
monthly basis instead so one month

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:48.730
straight up I just forgot it's November

00:38:45.619 --> 00:38:52.220
1st at like noon rents due on the 31st

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:54.530
landlord called me was taking a poop

00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:55.940
which had to be embarrassing for her

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:57.950
despite the fact that she didn't know

00:38:55.940 --> 00:39:00.170
and she was like hey just so you know

00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:03.470
like because you didn't pay rent we're

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:05.150
gonna have to begin eviction proceedings

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:07.280
against you I was like that seems a

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:10.940
little ridiculous do you want me to just

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:14.089
go drop off a check downstairs right now

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:15.830
I'm literally I live like you know a few

00:39:14.089 --> 00:39:17.630
floors above the office I can just go

00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:20.410
write a check instantly and drop it off

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:23.990
and she's like eh okay that'll be fine

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:26.720
you know you I'm not trying to defend

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:31.810
myself but people forget things

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:34.550
sometimes they it's better to assume I

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:37.010
mean we mine per throw and that to be

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:39.740
honest but it's better to assume you

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:42.200
know a mistake then then malice like she

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:44.420
just went straight into these people are

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:46.010
going to try to invoke squatters right

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:48.380
to live in this place and maybe that's

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:50.240
maybe I'm judging her too harshly I can

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:52.520
hear the devil's advocate voice of

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:56.150
Nikolas here and he's going not the

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:57.710
developer the game rockleesmile but he's

00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:59.630
in the background going oh maybe she's

00:39:57.710 --> 00:40:02.060
had bad experiences with tenants yeah I

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:04.820
mean I do cut her some slack for that

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:07.800
probably that's true but also it's like

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:09.930
0% my fault except that I did forget

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:12.630
I was 12 hours late delivering the rent

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:13.950
check because I just forgot but you

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:18.030
catch more flies with honey than vinegar

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:20.010
man and really the joke's on her because

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:21.600
we moved out and ever since then she's

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:23.400
been able to hike up the rent like 30%

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:28.640
because it's a seller's market right now

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:31.230
so clearly come on give me a second Yara

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:34.350
clearly were the ones who won in that

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:39.540
situation we got perthro perthro Guerra

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:42.090
perthro that's what we want okay you

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:43.260
know that that's my that's my advice to

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:46.080
you if you're doing business dealings

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:48.570
it's always better start with a friendly

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:50.130
reminder you know we have you'd be

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:53.040
surprised we have that happen all the

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:56.460
time all the time you know we do

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:59.280
sponsored stuff not some companies are

00:40:56.460 --> 00:41:01.800
amazing about paying on time and some

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:06.390
companies or not you'll always start

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:09.450
with a friendly reminder you go hey just

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:11.460
you know this was supposed to be due two

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:14.130
days ago it's not a big deal just making

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:17.430
sure you got the invoice by the way

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:19.380
great commentary tell me more about this

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:21.690
behind the scenes business dealings but

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:23.370
then you know from that point onwards if

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:26.730
you want you can start to get a little

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:28.530
like listen to your Joker's will got a

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:32.760
ramshackle operation you think I'm

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:35.370
running okay we definitely want this we

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:38.160
definitely want shielded tears we have

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:40.110
these were close to Beelzebub but not

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:42.390
quite there I think everything else here

00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:44.280
can be rear old even though we might be

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:46.800
able to have a ridiculous rate of ah you

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:48.120
know what I'll take this just because

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:50.070
it's going to make a rate of fire like

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:51.330
soy milk level yeah okay and then maybe

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:53.520
the other tiers that would take us to

00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:54.870
one but I'm going to re-roll anyway try

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.370
to get a little better and dude we got

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:59.790
to health upgrades out of that which is

00:41:56.370 --> 00:42:03.530
incredibly good are we at bookworm

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:07.140
I do not know no we're not okay

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:10.140
start by doing this give yourself a

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:11.520
little bit of a damage up here so this

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:14.620
is obviously like this run is

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:18.950
unbelievably strong right now

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:21.840
[Music]

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:24.360
is 45,000 within the realm of

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:27.720
possibility I absolutely think so and

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:30.090
what do I owe this to I'm not even

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:34.350
messing with you it's the fact that we

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:38.340
got that fifth cent out of the fire on

00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:40.440
the on the second floor or sorry on the

00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:43.530
first floor if we had not got everything

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:45.420
else hinges on that on this run sure we

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:47.550
made like what I would consider a pretty

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:48.150
good play to get into boss rush no doubt

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:50.910
about it

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:53.280
yo you want to get a few hospice in no

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:55.260
memeing I'm for real like Kanye West

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.980
that's a message I just got from dengue

00:42:55.260 --> 00:43:00.480
sling here

00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:03.540
I mean I'm not going to lie to him I do

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:06.090
want to get a few hot peas in but now's

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:07.530
not get back to you in mere moments here

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:11.700
damn once I've ranked well on today's

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:13.500
daily on sous the real benefit of on -

00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:18.120
straining dude I got to close this the

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:22.530
message box here the real benefit of on

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:29.730
sous is that we know where we're going

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:31.680
so 45 I don't think necessarily we're

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:37.020
going to be at 45 but I think we got a

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:39.960
shot certainly okay we're at the damage

00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:41.730
cap I would never deign to suggests that

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:43.560
were guaranteed to be front page but you

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:45.360
know there should be an extra couple

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:48.540
thousand points somewhere to be found on

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:50.040
this run including the bonus at the end

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:51.750
I wouldn't be surprised to see this be a

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:54.480
front page daily and what did I tell you

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:55.980
at the outset here you know Winston

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:57.900
Churchill said when you're going through

00:43:55.980 --> 00:44:00.350
hell keep going if you're going through

00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:03.780
heaven keep going baby

00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:05.730
experience more heaven we're in an

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:08.400
amazing spot here and we've finally been

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:10.350
playing well and earning it I mean this

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:13.800
is going to incur a penalty but we we

00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:20.550
already have one rate of fire as lame as

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:22.830
this is there's no reason for us to for

00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:24.300
us to go from one rate of fire to one

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:26.760
rate of fire you know it's going to cost

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:29.450
us points in the process it's a

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.450
necessary evil

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:33.730
so we do want to pick up consumables and

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:38.590
you know we want to at least look at

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:40.210
items because all come on 1.78 speed

00:44:38.590 --> 00:44:42.910
wasn't enough to get across there that

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:44.610
was a lazy play on my part well we'll

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:47.530
pick all this stuff up on the back end

00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:49.900
the Gantt I grabbed was actually like a

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:52.240
very very smart pickup and I don't say

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:53.980
that very often usually when I pick up

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:57.700
anti grab it's like oh I shouldn't have

00:44:53.980 --> 00:45:01.980
picked up anti grab this case was was

00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:06.340
drastically different so we want to

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:07.720
black rune one bad item because I don't

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:10.540
think we've had too bad items ever

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:19.990
dropped do the pencil I'm going doll you

00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:22.630
gotta take it got to take it it is

00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:24.640
giving us points I do want to say it

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:29.650
it's giving us points I'm trying to like

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:31.480
get another chest so I don't want the

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:34.020
backtrack to get use out of the black

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:36.670
room there we go

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:38.350
super bandage is not worth it gets

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:41.980
sucked son thanks for the speed upgrade
