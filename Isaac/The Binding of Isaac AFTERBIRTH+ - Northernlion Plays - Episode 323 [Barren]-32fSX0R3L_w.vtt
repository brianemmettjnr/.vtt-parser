00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.350
hey everybody welcome back northernlion

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.580
the finding amides were going for with

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.250
number 10 already

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.719
give me a loss give me a keeper run it's

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.440
not gonna be one of those it could be

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.940
blue baby judas actually like also dicey

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.960
i wanted to go for a character that was

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.449
a little scarier qc1 g v 7 v 2 again we

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.119
got 3 numbers 5 letters sometimes it's a

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.460
good sign obviously I'm being facetious

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.060
but at the same time am i yes I am but

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.840
am i yes okay so what are we looking for

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.469
here I guess to be honest with you the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.489
dream is we use the d12 on this room to

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.649
turn some of the rocks into tinted rocks

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.690
and then also have TNT right next to

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.160
them that we can blow up but the odds of

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.300
this working are pretty low we also have

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.600
like the burning basement on the cellar

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.379
which is just the most annoying possible

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.140
set up in Earth's short history I choose

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.650
it right up against this rock we can

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.090
choose if that's all good for one penny

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.510
it's not particularly great in the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.830
hindsight but hey we did get one penny

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.560
out of it and that takes us to five

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.770
cents theoretical chance that we could

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.030
live long enough to get a spirit heart

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.400
and then use the spirit hearts that

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.439
carry us to greatness pill can't be bad

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.790
or it can't be can be fatal

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.070
we got to be careful that key is very

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.740
important key equals shop equals spirit

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.070
heart equals we survived except there's

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.390
no spirit heart in the shop which is

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.710
something that I think it's just variant

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.900
that's been happening an awful lot

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:46.439
lately and making me feel like I'm not

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:49.170
the happiest camper in the world buy a

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.420
bomb the bomb gives us access to tinted

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.189
rocks which is potentially worth it I

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.880
honestly think I'd rather use book of

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.100
Belial right here than on the boss fight

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.320
I'd rather use it on both and hopefully

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.930
we'll get an easy opportunity to do so

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.250
but I was like pretty confident I was

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.729
going to get hidden I never remembered

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.039
those guys do one full heart or or not

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.629
certainly the champions do one full

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.870
heart but they might all do one full

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.870
heart

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.960
okay easy money there's a bomb we still

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.460
have not seen any tinted rocks and we're

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.510
not going to get a charge which is a

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.300
super bummer

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.090
but okay you got six cents now we place

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.590
the bomb that allows us to get to

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.940
another bomb and something else it could

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.610
have blown up it didn't get anything out

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.550
of it jeez Louise this is a dry start

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.310
man we should really look for a second

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.540
secret room in the hopes of getting

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.760
something important there you know

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:50.610
health-wise Wow

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.170
at least it's I mean I I recognize that

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.330
by saying this I itseems like I might be

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.550
dooming myself to death but I think we

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.510
played this floor about as right as you

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.370
can get and yet I do find myself a

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.220
little frightened about what the future

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.900
holds here and should be honestly I

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.400
almost got hit I can't even see the poop

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.720
because it freakin blends in with the

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.550
ground so much just get dusted well and

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.810
truly far away from me please thank you

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:25.260
polly dak with another horf pill who

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:29.790
cares dude this is the weirdest Judas

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.200
start we played it right the last thing

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.880
we can do to just try to play it even a

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.380
little writer is ya horf our way into

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.110
the secret room and then the secret room

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:44.459
okay now admittedly has taken us up to

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:48.060
19 cents and at this point I think we'd

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:51.090
be willing to invest in not worrying at

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.650
all about what we get from our well I'll

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.100
tell you what take this try to earn more

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.660
than you spent we lost one penny in the

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.050
process and accidentally bought a pill

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.400
and got a ticket I was gonna buy that

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.350
anyway and I was going to buy this

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.550
anyway so I'm out I wasn't going to buy

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.630
deep pockets because we couldn't afford

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.280
it and and also the key and you know

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.410
potentially the card as well so I'm out

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.580
of here I I will here you can't tell me

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:19.770
nothing on that floor we played it right

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.120
didn't necessarily turn out as awesomely

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.280
as I would have expected and we still

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.860
are suffering from the standard problems

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.150
of being Judas right now without any

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.419
guaranteed way out of the situation

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.490
to be honest with you but so I mean you

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.550
can see some of the stuff that I'm eager

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:40.020
to see here as well like for example

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.669
there is a tinted rock all we need is a

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.259
single bomb to be able to access the

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.780
tinted rock we were able to buy a bomb

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:47.160
on the last floor I used it foolishly to

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.050
try to improve our run when I should

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.000
have saved it for the potential of you

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.110
know modest future gain but who knows

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.639
that will probably give us a golden

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.250
chest that gives us a bomb when we play

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:58.949
it anyway so really like we got to look

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:04.050
out for number one on this run because

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:05.750
they're not given us the we're not given

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.389
us the tools we would normally consider

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.940
nearly essential for survival here so we

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.889
will go to the item room unless we get

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.300
enough money to justify going to the

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.729
shop instead in the hopes of getting

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.610
either a bomb or a spirit are the odds

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:22.139
of us having neither of those are zero

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.880
percent which on this run means they're

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:33.419
at a hundred percent because apparently

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:36.060
health is a lie help come on come come

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:38.940
on I want you to hit I don't want you to

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.419
hit me I want you to get hit by me one

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:48.270
more one more

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:51.060
problem solved friendzone is okay we did

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.070
have a run it was our last run it was

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.530
kind of built on the attack fly for the

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.630
early stages of it but it's not

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.610
something I'd like to really roll

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.199
long-term if I could get the opportunity

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.909
to go with something else like for

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:06.860
example our tears I would prefer to use

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:09.690
those to deal damage we're one cent away

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.849
from being able to possibly get our

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.650
spirit art not only gives us peace of

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:16.050
mind guarantees us to deal with the

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:19.970
devil more or less and also gives us all

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:22.289
thank God also gives us the ability to

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.060
take a deal with the devil that doesn't

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:27.030
give us HP without dying in the process

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:29.220
so yeah I'm eager to see what this

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.659
tinted rock holds and now we got like

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.659
ridiculous numbers of bombs

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:37.280
straight up we should not have come to

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.240
this room we should have just gone to

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:48.169
the tinted rock first tinted rocks

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:50.479
actually but 100% we've earned this win

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:52.639
if we win this run which is still you

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:54.050
know we're very much early on here but

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:58.009
if we're able to pull out a win we

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:59.539
deserve it just due to the terrible

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:00.469
nature of how things have looked here

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:04.129
from the start I mean of course we're

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:06.050
Judas we got that extra damage but we I

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:07.849
mean I shouldn't even act like HP is

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.379
guaranteed with two tins of drops

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:11.990
because obviously the first one didn't

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:13.759
pay out the second one did and the risk

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.949
of sounding ungrateful is still not a

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:19.250
whole heck of a lot one spirit art is

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:22.039
like the low end of possible payouts

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.509
there the secret room I'm tilting myself

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:25.639
here for the secret room gave us nothing

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:28.279
either so dude let's just move on this

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:30.770
is getting ridiculous to be Judas and go

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:32.330
too slow to make to feel like you're on

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:38.740
pace for boss rush is kind of hilarious

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:40.940
that's that's a rarity for certain but I

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.349
mean even if we take one hit we

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.199
shouldn't take our deal with the devil

00:07:42.349 --> 00:07:46.940
so let's curse to the blind anyway

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:48.650
that's right so maybe we should have

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.770
taken our HP before we came in here but

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:55.879
we'll see we'll see what we get and we

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:58.729
eat what we like what's that apple crisp

00:07:55.879 --> 00:08:00.919
by karin some one of those Apple Jacks

00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:03.379
not apple crisp it's one of those cereal

00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:07.039
brands razor blade okay so that was

00:08:03.379 --> 00:08:08.360
horrible and it was an HP upgrade so we

00:08:07.039 --> 00:08:09.710
could have taken something else but we

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.659
go down to the next floor at least

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:15.259
having deal with the devil precedent but

00:08:11.659 --> 00:08:18.770
yeah man that sucks but that's the point

00:08:15.259 --> 00:08:21.110
of that curse to some extent is to throw

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:25.279
your equilibrium into a bit of a tizzy

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:28.669
so I'm just happy we lived honestly and

00:08:25.279 --> 00:08:30.020
after we got the deal with the devil we

00:08:28.669 --> 00:08:32.349
didn't want it's actually good that we

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:34.940
got HP so we can use that HP to

00:08:32.349 --> 00:08:36.469
basically pretend that nothing ever

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:42.700
happened

00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:45.040
I'm used to used to do this runs kind of

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:50.320
being settled one way or the other by

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:54.630
now usually you're either dead or loving

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:58.000
it the Leslie Nielsen film about Dracula

00:08:54.630 --> 00:09:00.010
that's dead and loving it can't help but

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.650
feel that there would be worse things

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:04.660
about this run right now than it just

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:11.890
being over with but obviously we're

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:16.150
trying to hold it together just get

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:18.610
rattled son thank you okay what are we

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:21.820
looking for I mean I really don't want

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:26.410
to go to the boss trapper or mob trap

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:28.360
room yet I want to get free I want to

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:32.110
get for you I want to get free ride into

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:34.420
the Sun she never loved me she never

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:36.280
loved me she never loved me why should

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:38.770
anyone come here come here come here

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:41.020
I'll take your photo for you it's been a

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:42.610
while since I listened to get free by

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:45.880
the vines as featured of course

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:49.180
prominently in the young adult classic

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:56.620
agent Cody Banks filmed in Vancouver and

00:09:49.180 --> 00:10:02.260
Burnaby British Columbia Wow from

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:05.440
downtown dude I'd prefer not to spend my

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:07.570
only key to that's exactly what I was

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:10.090
hoping would happen so I mean I was

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:11.740
willing to do it but I'm glad we didn't

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:13.030
have to because we basically that's the

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:17.980
greatest stroke of luck we've had on

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:20.470
this run so far you know what you know

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:23.140
would salvage this run you're darn right

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:24.940
better play of course not no having more

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:30.660
numbers in the seed that's the problem

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:30.660
so home the seed is two alphabetical Oh

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.140
analogical

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:44.380
we have not really improved at all not

00:10:42.459 --> 00:10:46.839
just in hurricane play over the course

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:48.820
of many years but we haven't improved

00:10:46.839 --> 00:10:52.060
the the quality that's run at all

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:53.230
we got default stats the only thing

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.750
we've gained is deal with the devil

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:57.910
precedent and a little fly baby that

00:10:55.750 --> 00:11:00.279
sometimes does something but isn't

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:05.050
really bringing the heat all I thought

00:11:00.279 --> 00:11:20.500
we could squeeze through there I hate

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:23.290
this I hate this you got to go dude this

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:27.760
is actually what I picture hell to be

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:34.870
like for me at least it's just non-stop

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:37.420
like pretty bad Isaac runs there is

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:40.360
another we need a bomb to get to oh no

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:44.170
it's moved now okay we need a bomb to

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:47.860
get to this I will take it because we

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:52.089
have to oh my god it's special rooms I

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:56.260
didn't think that they existed but it

00:11:52.089 --> 00:11:59.260
turns out the legends are true Chewie

00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:01.000
we're home an item room in the shop 11

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:04.570
minutes Caves 1

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.459
despite being Judas no HP let's keep

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.940
this dream alive teamwork makes the

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:09.190
dream work

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.600
who's my on my team here I don't know

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:13.300
all of you watching out there in YouTube

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.430
land hopefully so we want to buy a

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:18.310
spirit art for survival and we want to

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:21.550
buy whatever else we can get we are

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:23.290
working towards Beelzebub thankfully and

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:25.029
for eventual eyes pretty nice if we

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:26.680
survive that initial hit and of course I

00:12:25.029 --> 00:12:28.450
don't know why I was talking like you

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.670
know we have any chance in the world to

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:32.560
get a spear at art obviously there's no

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.880
spirit arts for sale because that's that

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.770
would imply that we live in a nanny

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.240
state where people give you what you

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:40.899
want sometimes instead well you got to

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:42.370
do is create your own spirit art out of

00:12:40.899 --> 00:12:45.670
the ether when they don't give you any

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:47.589
freaking tinted rocks no problem no

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:49.930
problem really is what it is just a

00:12:47.589 --> 00:12:52.060
normal good old

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:53.050
situation then we got nothing to worry

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.790
about here as we head into a big room

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:58.030
why would you be scared heading into a

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:59.980
big room on an alternate harder

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:03.130
difficulty version of the standard floor

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:04.960
that you're already underpowered for we

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:11.280
should I mean this could be the end of

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:13.240
our lives so thank you revenge fly I

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:21.190
don't really want to walk through these

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:26.080
guys you know oh man oh geez oh man

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:35.860
there we go this room also is garbage

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:40.120
I don't know what I need here that helps

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:41.620
a lot thank you the stain is not the

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:44.920
worst enemy we could be fighting right

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:46.390
now I actually wish at this point we

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.270
hadn't taken deal with the devil

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:52.540
precedent almost every time and I don't

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:55.060
that's like the least mild or sorry the

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:57.720
least exaggerative exaggeration i've

00:13:55.060 --> 00:14:00.010
ever made but almost all of the time

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:02.220
deal with the devil president ends up

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:04.780
being more of a positive than a negative

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:07.510
just this situation in particular that's

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:09.700
horrible we did not beat the odds but we

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:11.050
did get a luck upgrade so let's head

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:15.100
down to the next floor with a chance at

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:16.750
an arcade and one HP has Dudus no spirit

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.940
hearts because Pierre and I do not exist

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:20.170
yeah well maybe if you went to a shop

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.610
you could have gotten so I went to all

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:23.350
the shops you know maybe if you blew up

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:24.550
the tinted rocks you could have got well

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.590
I blew up all the teams of drums well

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:28.810
maybe if you didn't get hit twice

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:30.520
despite having never improved your DPS

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:31.900
over the course of the first three

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:35.320
floors well you know what you got me on

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:37.240
that one might have we would have been

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.700
able to preserve the first spirit our we

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:41.650
got but but we got hit once or twice so

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:44.550
you know what I guess I have no defense

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.550
to offer here

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:55.060
that was bad but we kind of have to I

00:14:52.830 --> 00:15:02.320
don't want to say play chicken but we

00:14:55.060 --> 00:15:04.680
got to be a little aggressive no did it

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.680
work

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:12.940
we got a half heart she waited to see if

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:14.500
we could get like dark Judas and then

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:18.960
gotten three spirit outside of it was

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:24.670
dude what what is this run it's actually

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:27.040
just straight-up garbage and I mean that

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:31.120
in the best like it it actually has outs

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:33.430
which I respect and appreciate it as

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:36.820
sincerely is like a mustard I like it

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:41.140
has these orbitals that actually do

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:42.850
damage without that this would maybe be

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:45.960
one of the worst runs I've had in like a

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:49.180
couple months with those there is a

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:51.310
conceivable world a dimension out there

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:55.720
in the multiverse in which I actually

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:57.190
come out with a win here we don't need a

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.960
whole heck of a lot because you never

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:01.660
need a whole heck of a lot you know we

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:04.030
got three thousand hours in this game

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:06.670
most of the time you know if we could

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:11.200
just get like nine lives might be enough

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:13.740
even with junk junk almost everything to

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:18.100
be honest with you all we need is a

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:21.010
renegade nine lives to show up would be

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:24.840
in a great spot hey a single spirit

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.840
heart ever wouldn't be the worst thing I

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:30.070
completely spaced on the fact that we're

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:32.170
still like one hit away from dying from

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:34.090
any champion ever

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:35.260
we're also on the fourth floor which

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:37.420
means we're more than halfway to getting

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:41.230
to the womb where any hit from any enemy

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:43.150
will kill us so rarely like very very

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.710
very rarely well you have one HP when

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:46.540
you go to the womb but I suppose it is a

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:50.320
theoretical possibility it's something

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:53.080
that could happen okay I let him get a

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:56.560
direct hit there I can't really pretend

00:16:53.080 --> 00:17:01.450
like that one's not on me good work team

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:02.930
good work the hanged man okay well to be

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:05.120
honnest with you

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:06.530
I think you look at the hanged man and

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:10.579
you go well that's free access to the

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:12.110
curse room although we will die if we

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:14.569
get hit once after that point but the

00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:20.089
curse room presumably a chance to give a

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:22.850
spirit hearts it's very tempting could

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:25.699
also get three cents and extra HP there

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:28.610
as opposed if we needed it so we found

00:17:25.699 --> 00:17:30.410
our special rooms to Ken hey you know

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:31.910
there are perks to having one HP we

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:34.730
don't have to come up with a novel

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:36.440
strategy to make it inside of our boss

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:40.340
trap room that'll just you know we're

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:43.179
pre-approved and we need it let's see

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:44.690
what we can actually get going on here

00:17:43.179 --> 00:17:47.900
okay

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:52.910
iron bar it's a modest and I do mean

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:55.340
modest damage upgrade so we now can no

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:58.460
longer fall back on having no damage

00:17:55.340 --> 00:18:00.470
upgrades instead I have to say we have

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:02.210
one damage upgrade but it's not that

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:05.660
good and it takes a little bit of the

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:08.900
punch out of my ax out of my punch bowl

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:12.200
here please no Greaves how we just

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:16.580
fought you I get that I instantiated you

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:19.220
like by blowing up a statue or something

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:22.309
but still do there's two breeds on one

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:23.150
floor it's getting absurd here it's

00:18:22.309 --> 00:18:28.429
getting ridiculous

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:30.290
I just want to I actually could not have

00:18:28.429 --> 00:18:32.450
constructed a run in which spirit arts

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:35.330
are less likely to exist I don't know

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:36.710
how like every shop is not at a spirit

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:49.040
art and then on this floor we got two

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:53.870
Greaves what's a boy to do oh Jesus okay

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:56.720
well step one you blow up the explosive

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:58.670
barrels that way you can't get hit by

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:01.100
them okay and then you're just Dodge and

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:03.320
you do have a 30% chance of a deal with

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.970
the devil you might want to deliberately

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.170
take half a heart of damage so that you

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.400
don't get a deal with the devil because

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:09.380
it's going to be Krampus and I don't

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:11.570
know it's probably gonna be some version

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:14.480
of Krampus that we've never seen before

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:16.999
you've got twenty new attacks and

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:19.249
one of them is he shoots both lasers at

00:19:16.999 --> 00:19:22.399
all times any spins around while he does

00:19:19.249 --> 00:19:23.899
it so like maybe we want to sanitize our

00:19:22.399 --> 00:19:25.639
inputs so we don't get screwed there oh

00:19:23.899 --> 00:19:26.779
we didn't get it anyway so that's

00:19:25.639 --> 00:19:28.309
nothing to worry about instead we'll

00:19:26.779 --> 00:19:32.809
just take hangman down to the next floor

00:19:28.309 --> 00:19:35.059
healy is the run of all time this is

00:19:32.809 --> 00:19:41.119
like an actual challenge run is like how

00:19:35.059 --> 00:19:46.609
long can you live with the based hex

00:19:41.119 --> 00:19:48.080
Judas let's not base steps you got a 0.8

00:19:46.609 --> 00:19:49.899
damage okay you're right I did get a

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:56.509
zero play a damage increase thanks to

00:19:49.899 --> 00:19:58.879
iron bar plus the damage multiplier

00:19:56.509 --> 00:19:59.600
innately just from being Judas in the

00:19:58.879 --> 00:20:03.649
first place

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:06.169
what's okay we have two hangman I really

00:20:03.649 --> 00:20:17.139
didn't want to do that but what can you

00:20:06.169 --> 00:20:17.139
do we're probably going to die here I

00:20:17.499 --> 00:20:25.820
actually throw myself like on the mercy

00:20:21.259 --> 00:20:29.210
of the court I don't know what could

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:31.369
have done to make that happen

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:33.080
I guess the serious answer that I could

00:20:31.369 --> 00:20:34.759
give you here is first off I'm sure that

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:37.789
was an entertaining video by isaac

00:20:34.759 --> 00:20:40.039
standards secondly i mean i guess we

00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:43.129
could have just not taken that hit on

00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:45.859
the second floor but good lord that was

00:20:43.129 --> 00:20:47.239
awful hey check out this seed let me

00:20:45.859 --> 00:20:49.399
know what the path to victory is if

00:20:47.239 --> 00:20:50.779
you've managed to find one for yourself

00:20:49.399 --> 00:20:51.799
