00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.690
let's go I only do two things

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.059
sin and win and I'm feeling particularly

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.309
pious today so let's do some linen

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.519
instead of some sin and hey it's Isaac

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.880
let's not a great intro but that's fine

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.939
dude you got lemon mishap an amazing

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.449
rate of fire decent damage horrible HP

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.630
but dude yeah good good use of lemon

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.429
mishap even like just like my brain sent

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.279
a message to press the spacebar and then

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.870
a millisecond later it went hey here's

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.670
another message calling yourself an

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.320
idiot for not stopping that massive

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.940
message from reaching your fingers but

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.579
anyway we're starting at the tears cap

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.920
which is ridiculously good that's

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.030
actually like as far as I'm concerned

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.430
it's like we're starting with like eight

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.930
or nine damage hopefully this is a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.289
library back here and we can start the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.420
Popoff but this is actually from a tear

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.020
standpoint I would describe this as an

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.329
11 out of 10 we never start with 5 rate

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.480
of fire maybe if you got soy milk you

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.680
start with 1 which admittedly is better

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.729
but your damage is going to suffer

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.710
obviously we've got other problems on

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.200
this run like for example not sure if

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.840
you've noticed but my HP is literally

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.380
zero but well his zero plus a little

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.979
asterisk that says uh you know act like

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:27.900
you've been there before I hate that

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.479
room just like it's a jerk room and I

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:35.009
don't like it I think we should try to

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:39.240
buy the 15 cent item I don't expect it

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.290
to be a spirit heart but it could be

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.680
something that's useful for us

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.060
regardless it might be worth a shot here

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.680
let it even see that there was a second

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.630
button there which is my own bad not

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.420
that it ended up mattering let's try it

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.780
it's habit which is good although a

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.780
little bit not essential for the present

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.399
moment so as much as I've tried there

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.290
there's no way out we basically just

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.680
have to not take damage which is why I'm

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.119
going to our item room ideally ideally

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.299
first we're going to go to this item

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.299
room

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.640
to week to week so wins all erased by

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.520
this freakin Tomo monster shot a bomb

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.680
off screen I can't even see let's go I'm

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.320
back I'm not Mauro still a good rate of

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.320
fire decent speed terrible spacebar

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.739
items but dude I'm actually my mood went

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.239
from like a nine to a four right there

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.910
I'm not mad though I can't really be mad

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.560
at anybody but myself even though if I

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.739
think both of the hits that we took

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.709
there were a little rich like the the

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.810
TNT room I just hate I walked in moved

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:05.459
literally zero as far as I'm concerned

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.019
at least and was was summarily hit for

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.440
one full heart and then I got hit by a

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.940
bomb effectively from an enemy that did

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.290
one full hearts I mean what can I say

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.670
you know that's the kind of damage you

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.180
got to avoid if you're going to pop off

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.230
with a big streak you might be saying an

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.780
island districts over what about

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.870
starting like a new save file I don't

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.720
know to be honest with you the my my

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.820
tilt factor on that is to err on the

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.000
side of not having a new save file

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.980
because I think it was like not

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.420
necessarily 50/50 but a pretty even

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.660
split in terms of like what people

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.980
wanted to see and then I thought about

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.630
it and I was like I love the zany

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.459
interactions between the items that's my

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.549
driving force and Isaac do I really want

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.019
to do ten runs that only go to Mom's

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.940
hearts are people really going to want

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.180
to watch ten runs that only go to moms

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.920
heart and then you know another ten runs

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.079
that only go to Satan and another 10

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.460
that only go to the Cathedral etc

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.650
etcetera so

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.580
I'm out of two minds about it still if

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.200
there's like an overwhelming push to go

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.030
for that than I understand but I'm kind

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.530
of like I'm in crossword puzzle mode

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.850
right now with these with these even

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.330
runs I've been having a good time on

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:20.320
them I am beyond displeased that I

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:22.330
squandered a tear cap start but it was

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.160
kind of under exceptional circumstances

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.650
the two pieces of damage we took they're

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.550
not unavoidable of course but hard to

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.870
avoid for certain it is a bummer though

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:37.390
nonetheless is that a Tomo buddy you

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:39.730
want soon hello all well I'm going to

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.830

unknowns battlegrounds anybody want to

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.060

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.590
wants to play battle grounds with

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.160
madness but because you know everybody's

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:51.010
their families etc etc just now Malthus

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:55.380

new order not a bad game of course but

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.550
it's like the best laid plans of mice

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.560
and men want to make a John Steinbeck

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.140

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:19.439
little prick that's a what I'm most mad

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:25.080
those

but dr. evil is the one who says just a

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:33.629
little prick I forget who says the other

00:06:30.929 --> 00:06:35.249
part might be that guy was with Willie

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:36.539
Nelson who might actually be a famous

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:39.059

everybody welcome to the show Telmo

00:08:06.389 --> 00:08:11.249
thanks for being here you go see his

00:08:08.369 --> 00:08:14.029
movie comes out this Friday it's called

00:08:11.249 --> 00:08:14.029
the big sick

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:18.560
I was just the name of a movie I wanna

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.960
see not trying to suggest that you know

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.050
any of the lead actors look like cats or

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:26.570
anything it's a little bit of a

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:29.090
ridiculous tenant deposit in the first

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:31.130
place that's a chest anyway this run is

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:33.320
in a very very good spot love of coal is

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:39.550
a pretty good passive considering we've

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:44.090
got okay yeah dude so will summon a

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:51.890
delirious to be used here you killed you

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:53.300
kill a boss I'm going to roll a mega

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.650
penny here which is actually crooked

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.660
penny the reason for that is

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:58.550
unbelievably simple even a child can

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:01.310
understand it it's a better item and

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:03.170
it's more fun it recharges faster it

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:05.360
gives us more Zayn potential and is

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:07.880
simultaneously stronger and I resent

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.410
this for having an 11 room chair 911 but

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:12.260
a 12 room charge which i think is

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:16.940
actually ridiculous given that the item

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:19.190
is sort of not that good not necessarily

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:21.650
bad but twelve rooms to get a boss that

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:25.460
other bosses can kill in 10 seconds is

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:29.060
like extremely who cares voice when does

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:30.770
it come out on pc i love crooked penny

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.900
probably used it a little too much

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:35.260
people got a little sick of it for a

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:37.940
while and you know what that's fine

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.170
we've we've given it a period to cool

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.900
off a little bit and now it's like

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:48.140
glorious it was a lot more fun when it

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:51.110
could duplicate empty pedestals but you

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:52.820
know i understand the problem i mean i

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:54.350
understand but i don't understand i

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.300
understand it's not working as intended

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:59.090
but at the same time if you want to nerf

00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:00.890
the item taking away the thing that like

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:03.140
super savvy players not saying myself

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:04.640
but the people who you know positive the

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.350
idea in the first place taking away

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:09.590
something that super savvy players can

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:11.720
use to win easily is a little ridiculous

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:12.730
when the item itself is still like a ten

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.810
out of ten

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:18.920
the occasional doubling or quadrupling

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:21.139
is worth so much more than the random

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:26.600
item pedestal for that igress

00:10:21.139 --> 00:10:28.189
I digress you got to go for the free

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.290
shops we've had like a pretty good track

00:10:28.189 --> 00:10:35.029
record on these I wouldn't suggest that

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:36.559
like let's try to duplicate it yeah why

00:10:35.029 --> 00:10:38.660
not right getting another spider mod

00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:40.819
dude get another I can see forever pill

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:43.279
who cares another Emperor card

00:10:40.819 --> 00:10:44.779
duplicated dude see if I freakin where's

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:49.790
my spider mod oh there it is is just

00:10:44.779 --> 00:10:51.410
kind of obscured up there and then

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.209
they're all gone but who cares we should

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.559
have but mom actually doesn't matter I

00:10:53.209 --> 00:10:56.899
was going to say like we should have

00:10:54.559 --> 00:10:58.129
blown up the donation machine and then

00:10:56.899 --> 00:10:59.959
made a bunch of money and we could have

00:10:58.129 --> 00:11:01.309
turned a profit but dude this is still

00:10:59.959 --> 00:11:03.379
pretty sick maybe I should have bought

00:11:01.309 --> 00:11:04.519
the fourth spider mod but why buy the

00:11:03.379 --> 00:11:07.249
spider mods when you're getting the

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:07.999
spider mods for free seems pretty

00:11:07.249 --> 00:11:10.220
foolish

00:11:07.999 --> 00:11:12.169
I like having three spider mods walking

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.749
around you're dealing some you know

00:11:12.169 --> 00:11:18.589
weird status effects on the regular kind

00:11:14.749 --> 00:11:19.939
of cool and that's the reason that well

00:11:18.589 --> 00:11:24.049
one of the many reasons that crooked

00:11:19.939 --> 00:11:27.079
penny is our item of choice here when

00:11:24.049 --> 00:11:28.819
the children go to bed I asked this

00:11:27.079 --> 00:11:32.119
question because I've actually lost

00:11:28.819 --> 00:11:34.819
touch with the real world I typically go

00:11:32.119 --> 00:11:36.379
to bed here's the industry I work in let

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:37.699
me let me add a little bit of a preface

00:11:36.379 --> 00:11:40.129
to that to make the joke hit a little

00:11:37.699 --> 00:11:42.559
harder here's the industry I work in I

00:11:40.129 --> 00:11:43.999
have one of the most normal sleep

00:11:42.559 --> 00:11:45.769
schedules among my peers and I

00:11:43.999 --> 00:11:49.610
consistently go to bed around 3:00 a.m.

00:11:45.769 --> 00:11:51.499
so the big word there is consistent sure

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.689
you know a lot of professionals go to

00:11:51.499 --> 00:11:56.029
bed at 3:00 a.m. and wake up at 11:00

00:11:53.689 --> 00:11:59.179
yeah like doctors and nurses work in the

00:11:56.029 --> 00:12:01.249
third shift understandable like we have

00:11:59.179 --> 00:12:03.169
we have an equilibrium my sleeping

00:12:01.249 --> 00:12:05.509
schedule never needs adjusting except

00:12:03.169 --> 00:12:07.970
when I change time zones it's it's

00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:10.910
pretty it's consistent which makes it

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:12.610
kind of a rarity in the well in our

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:14.749
YouTube and twitch circle at least I

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.799
don't know when normal people go to bed

00:12:14.749 --> 00:12:18.529
but I especially don't know when

00:12:15.799 --> 00:12:19.850
children go to bed here's let me let me

00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:21.470
ask a question if you have a

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:24.199
one-year-old child they go to bed before

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:27.160
or after 7:00 p.m. 7:00 p.m. sounds

00:12:24.199 --> 00:12:31.939
ridiculously early yet at the same time

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:33.619
isn't that like I actually am 50/50 is

00:12:31.939 --> 00:12:34.550
what I'm trying to suggest that could be

00:12:33.619 --> 00:12:38.120
a brave

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:40.820
lie or it could be extremely appropriate

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.380
I remember being like probably like

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:45.950
seven or eight and going to bed at

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:48.050
roughly 8 p.m. I also remember our

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:53.589
teacher in 6th grade asking us hey

00:12:48.050 --> 00:13:00.019
what's your bedtimes and then no no

00:12:53.589 --> 00:13:01.490
matter of fact he'll know someone in the

00:13:00.019 --> 00:13:03.649
class said 11 p.m.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:05.180
I mean this was the year 2000 but some

00:13:03.649 --> 00:13:07.279
one of the classes at 11 p.m. and

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:09.200
everybody went like well no wonder you

00:13:07.279 --> 00:13:11.089
had like a C+ average right

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:13.070
like we didn't say that but I mean we

00:13:11.089 --> 00:13:15.709
were all thinking at least me and the

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:21.290
teacher we're thinking that I'm sure but

00:13:15.709 --> 00:13:24.320
like 11 p.m. that's crazy so that's I

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:26.470
know that children go to sleep before 11

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:30.800
p.m. that's pretty much where my

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:32.120
understanding lies at this point this

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.550
kind of things you got to know because I

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.870
think about it sometimes I get Dan also

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:37.970
has a grade sleep schedule even though I

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:39.529
mean he's awake at 11:30 as time as who

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:41.990
cares you know it's pretty normal for an

00:13:39.529 --> 00:13:43.850
adult you know it's when like Letterman

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:45.920
comes on OK I'm a hundred years old

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:53.839
that's when Jimmy Fallon comes on it's

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:58.190
not that late at night but sometimes

00:13:53.839 --> 00:14:02.089
they'll get like a message from Dan on

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:04.459
skype at like 7:00 a.m. his time so

00:14:02.089 --> 00:14:06.320
literally comes in at 4:00 a.m. my time

00:14:04.459 --> 00:14:10.070
dude we gotta go for the double Steam

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:11.060
sale no it's so much better to get

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:12.529
everything for free than to get

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:14.000
everything half-price I do that again in

00:14:12.529 --> 00:14:16.399
a heartbeat well knowing what I know I

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.560
wouldn't but you know follow the things

00:14:16.399 --> 00:14:24.470
we're equal I would anyway that's crazy

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:26.270
like if Dan wakes up at 4:00 my time we

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:28.520
essentially are living on opposite sides

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:30.500
of the world because I my sleep schedule

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.690
is about one timezone off of what it

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:36.649
should be like I'm on you know Hawaiian

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:38.810
time or something like that and then he

00:14:36.649 --> 00:14:40.730
wakes up at a normal hour three time

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:44.899
zones away to think about that sometimes

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:46.209
it's almost like like Dan's American and

00:14:44.899 --> 00:14:48.100
I live in Japan or something

00:14:46.209 --> 00:14:52.230
like that we only overlap for a small

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:54.790
portion of the day it makes me so sad

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:56.619
but I think that's probably I don't know

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:59.470
if there's any two members of the NL SS

00:14:56.619 --> 00:15:02.619
crew that actually overlap for more than

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:04.179
like 14 hours in terms of like their

00:15:02.619 --> 00:15:05.860
waking hours and I'm not sure if that's

00:15:04.179 --> 00:15:07.899
mathematically possible to have us all

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:09.670
be spread distant enough to make that

00:15:07.899 --> 00:15:13.629
happen but I know bear gets up like

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:15.519
early PST which probably gives them the

00:15:13.629 --> 00:15:20.649
best chance dude let's double I want to

00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:24.100
double familiars 20 20 24 hours ago I

00:15:20.649 --> 00:15:26.829
want a double for me I use two five

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:34.480
babies yes one for baby no I want to

00:15:26.829 --> 00:15:35.709
double familiars so it's alright got a

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.170
battery charge which is what we were

00:15:35.709 --> 00:15:41.050
looking for in the first place here I

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:43.240
want like I'll settle for three farting

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:48.910
babies and a partridge in a pear tree

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:49.480
let's go so obviously I'm going to take

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.369
the hit

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.360
could have used High Priestess but we

00:15:51.369 --> 00:15:54.429
probably would have been hit at the same

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:57.189
time so now we got four farting babies

00:15:54.429 --> 00:16:00.360
behind us and the Padre are to use that

00:15:57.189 --> 00:16:00.360
jokey treat

00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:05.709
dude this round has been little on the

00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:07.240
same side to the extent that I've

00:16:05.709 --> 00:16:08.639
already forgotten the fact that we lost

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:11.230
our streak at the start of this video

00:16:08.639 --> 00:16:12.610
bums me out to think about but now it's

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.290
like a memory of the time when I tried

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:16.480
so hard and in the end it didn't even

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:17.860
matter you know it's not so bad they

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.089
always talked about it as if it was a

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.040
terrible thing I don't think it's that

00:16:19.089 --> 00:16:22.540
bad

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:24.160
memory is maybe better than being in the

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:27.579
moment we're talking about something as

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:29.379
as just upsetting as losing a streak in

00:16:27.579 --> 00:16:33.009
the binding of issac that would be an

00:16:29.379 --> 00:16:35.319
embarrassment we're going to have a deal

00:16:33.009 --> 00:16:38.690
with the devil chance we'd like a deal

00:16:35.319 --> 00:16:41.390
with the angel and get that

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:45.620
guaranteed mega stand play get dusted

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:51.040
you got dusted you know what the angel

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:55.310
HP will just snag it I mean like this

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:57.440
prop it's not a good now you mean I'm oh

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:59.810
no we lost Celtic Cross we didn't have a

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:02.150
bomb to blow this thing up well I do

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:03.830
something I can do actually unless the

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:05.720
door stays open which I really doubt

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:07.850
that it will but let's go back and try

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:11.750
to make it happen when did I use my last

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:13.370
bomb probably to blow up the shop which

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:15.199
allowed us to get for farting babies so

00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:23.060
actually in hindsight I'm not really

00:17:15.199 --> 00:17:27.079
that mad I'm that furious so we might

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:28.820
not be able to fight Mega Stan I would

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:30.950
find it in my heart to forgive myself

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:34.280
but it might take some time yeah let's

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:35.450
head downwards here I don't know what it

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:39.650
is you know I think different people

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:43.910
have different different needs when it

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:45.830
comes to sleep I used to have I do

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:48.050
insomnia again I don't like to say

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:50.960
because it might be like an actual

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:53.090
medical term some people call I have OCD

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:54.890
when they what they really mean is like

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:57.860
I prefer when my house is clean you know

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:59.840
see these like kids don't washing my

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.890
hands just gotta keep washing them I

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:04.040
don't know why I keep doing the hand

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:06.410
thing you know so I don't like to make

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:08.570
light of like actual conditions and you

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:09.980
know that not being able to sleep

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:12.140
weather insomnia or not is so

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:15.890
frustrating really awake and you're like

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:18.080
I feel awake right now but I know that

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:19.190
as soon as I have to be awake all I'm

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.480
going to want to do is sleep and I'm

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:23.960
going to feel like overtired like

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:27.230
garbage so I I relate to that 100% many

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:29.270
like a few times at least when I was in

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:30.950
Korea you know teach a full day of

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:33.800
classes come home can't fall asleep

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:35.720
teach another full day of classes then

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:41.030
go home they sleep for like two hours

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:43.370
be like why can't I sleep just the most

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:46.120
frustrating feeling one of the more

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:49.130
frustrating feelings at least but my

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:51.770
insomnia ever since I started doing this

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:54.620
job it has worked itself out like nine

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:57.500
8% it's probably like one day every two

00:18:54.620 --> 00:19:00.680
months where I I get like four hours of

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:02.870
sleep like I find it hard to fall asleep

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.610
but once I'm out I'm out like a light

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:06.110
I think it's because I don't have

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:08.140
anything to wake up for if I have to

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:10.100
wake up for anything it's a nightmare

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:13.070
you know even if it's like I'll have to

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:18.890
be awakened 9 a.m. I go to bed at like 2

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:21.230
I said like 8 5855 9:00 9:05 9:10 9:15

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:22.700
and then one Hail Mary like 9:30 alarm

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:25.850
that's like if you're seeing this you

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:28.490
better be out of the house so I think

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:31.220
it's for me it's like not having to be

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:33.710
up as is what allows me to fall asleep

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:37.460
more easily but I think the reason some

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:39.200
other youtubers end up with like busted

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:40.880
sleep schedules is quite the opposite is

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.610
that without having like a place that

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:45.560
they have to be they they're never

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:47.120
forced to maintain a routine and as a

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.260
result you know they're like I'm not

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.780
tired so I'm not going to go to sleep

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:52.430
and then they don't go to sleep for like

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:54.020
an extra hour and then it just starts

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:56.570
that cycle it's the summer vacation

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:59.510
cycle you know like your sleep schedule

00:19:56.570 --> 00:20:01.750
just gets off by like an hour more every

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:04.670
single day I can relate to that as well

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:07.430
and I'm happy I've found my groove it's

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:09.470
honestly one of the reasons a little

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:12.620
inside baseball year but hopefully at

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:18.320
least interesting while also being

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:20.810
completely ridiculous it's one of the

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:23.120
reasons I like the NL SS being in the

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:26.030
early afternoon it means my sleep

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:29.300
schedule actually cannot get worse than

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:31.670
waking up at like 2:00 p.m. actually the

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:33.590
more like waking up at 1:00 p.m. because

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:35.630
the half the shows are at 2:00 p.m. now

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:38.000
anyway so that might seem ridiculous but

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:41.570
you know a lot of people waking up like

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.240
5 or 6 so I'm happy I have something

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:45.710
that kind of anchors me it's like you

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.050
know I'm not about to miss a show

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:49.760
because I you know I woke up late

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:52.160
because I'm gonna get first off it's my

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:54.410
job and I feel bad and then there's the

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.240
monetary issue of like I'm basically

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:57.470
skipping a day of earning and then

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.810
there's the element of like I'm going to

00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:02.300
get roasted because I couldn't wake up

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:04.070
for 2 p.m. that's ridiculous but

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.149
honestly having like that degree of

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:07.309
routine is

00:21:05.149 --> 00:21:08.869
important for me I think as a means if

00:21:07.309 --> 00:21:11.839
it ever gets to be like 4:00 in the

00:21:08.869 --> 00:21:14.929
morning I'm like I don't want to stay up

00:21:11.839 --> 00:21:16.849
because I have to be up soon but I don't

00:21:14.929 --> 00:21:17.629
deign to have all the answers it's a pet

00:21:16.849 --> 00:21:20.210
peeve of mine

00:21:17.629 --> 00:21:22.909
people go oh you know all you have

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:25.909
depression well I used to be sad and

00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:28.429
then I just watched a great British Bake

00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:31.869
Off and now I'm happy all the time so

00:21:28.429 --> 00:21:33.830
that's you know that's I'm actually like

00:21:31.869 --> 00:21:35.330
essentially ignorant of what depression

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:38.749
feels like I'm just using that as an

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:41.299
example of something that I hear all the

00:21:38.749 --> 00:21:43.369
times I haven't you have anxiety yeah

00:21:41.299 --> 00:21:44.899
you know sometimes when I'm on a roller

00:21:43.369 --> 00:21:46.879
coaster I get nervous but then I just

00:21:44.899 --> 00:21:48.769
thought I'm probably not gonna die and

00:21:46.879 --> 00:21:53.899
they didn't solved itself you know it's

00:21:48.769 --> 00:21:56.409
it's not really helpful Janice your your

00:21:53.899 --> 00:21:58.729
anecdotal evidence is not helpful Janice

00:21:56.409 --> 00:22:00.830
you're describing a normal range of

00:21:58.729 --> 00:22:03.769
human emotions not brain chemistry run

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:05.509
amok Janice I don't know anybody named

00:22:03.769 --> 00:22:11.749
Janice which is why I'm leaning on this

00:22:05.509 --> 00:22:13.219
so hard because I can be like the

00:22:11.749 --> 00:22:15.159
ultimate insult if I actually have just

00:22:13.219 --> 00:22:17.779
forgotten someone I know named Janice

00:22:15.159 --> 00:22:20.269
first it's like she's talking about me

00:22:17.779 --> 00:22:24.999
oh you doesn't even know I exist

00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:29.330
Oh bill two golden hearts here not even

00:22:24.999 --> 00:22:31.879
mad we're gonna try to get boss fresh

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:33.139
but we'll see how it goes so yeah I like

00:22:31.879 --> 00:22:37.690
in really saves if you have trouble

00:22:33.139 --> 00:22:40.070
sleeping you know I understand your your

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:43.549
concerns resonate with me for a lot of

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:46.249
my life probably like once a week I

00:22:43.549 --> 00:22:50.989
would get like you know three hours of

00:22:46.249 --> 00:22:53.269
sleep or less now it's three hours of

00:22:50.989 --> 00:22:56.029
sleep or less is actually once a year

00:22:53.269 --> 00:22:58.460
that's like hey we booked a flight and

00:22:56.029 --> 00:23:00.950
it's at like 8 a.m. which means we have

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:04.190
to be at the airport at 6 a.m. which

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:07.460
means we have to be in a taxi at you

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:09.559
know 5:30 a.m. that's like the okay well

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:11.479
tomorrow is just going to stink that's

00:23:09.559 --> 00:23:13.489
so I was gonna suck and then it'll be

00:23:11.479 --> 00:23:14.419
good that's like a once-a-year thing

00:23:13.489 --> 00:23:17.210
yeah you

00:23:14.419 --> 00:23:18.919
four or five our sleeps maybe like once

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:21.080
once every two months or something like

00:23:18.919 --> 00:23:22.669
that if I oh I didn't go to the item

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:26.690
room I did go to the anima meeting go to

00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:29.239
the shop it's still pretty bad but it's

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:32.779
like hate quit bragging basically hey

00:23:29.239 --> 00:23:35.629
let me inundate you with how healthy my

00:23:32.779 --> 00:23:37.700
sleep life is well you watch this in bed

00:23:35.629 --> 00:23:39.909
and are distracted by me speaking a

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:48.859
little bit louder than usual right now

00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:52.190
jerk move a nail jerk move No thank you

00:23:48.859 --> 00:23:54.919
sir okay well here's the deal if it

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:56.809
doubled I would have I would have taken

00:23:54.919 --> 00:24:00.350
the items and gone for it but without a

00:23:56.809 --> 00:24:04.100
doubling now because I'm going to play

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:07.309
click pose as you jump without doubling

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:11.809
I can't justify it we got a cool run

00:24:07.309 --> 00:24:13.519
going on here though don't squander your

00:24:11.809 --> 00:24:15.799
devil deal champ this is like the the

00:24:13.519 --> 00:24:18.109
worst setup you can add for devil deals

00:24:15.799 --> 00:24:20.359
we whipped on a good chance and lost the

00:24:18.109 --> 00:24:22.519
spirit heart so now we have 100% chance

00:24:20.359 --> 00:24:24.559
but if we ever get hit without getting a

00:24:22.519 --> 00:24:31.489
spirit heart first you know is the whole

00:24:24.559 --> 00:24:33.350
thing comes undone so it is very very

00:24:31.489 --> 00:24:35.659
squander able right now and I can't help

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:37.129
but think that for farting babies is not

00:24:35.659 --> 00:24:39.200
necessarily going to help me that much

00:24:37.129 --> 00:24:45.410
but what about a partridge in a pear

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:48.479
tree full outing babies 3 spider mods

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:48.479
[Music]

00:24:50.230 --> 00:25:02.539
2.67 luck and spacebar is crooked penny

00:24:57.409 --> 00:25:07.690
let's try that again for 5 squandered

00:25:02.539 --> 00:25:09.200
winds for fighting dude 3 spider mods

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:13.309
2.67 luck

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:14.960
and now spacebar is crooked pan he is

00:25:13.309 --> 00:25:17.600
why nobody invites me to go caroling

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:19.609
they always invited me once and I go I'm

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.320
not a very good singer and they go oh

00:25:19.609 --> 00:25:24.739
that's no problem we just do it for fun

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:28.849
and then and never get a callback

00:25:24.739 --> 00:25:30.980
I warned you I'm cognizant of my own

00:25:28.849 --> 00:25:33.980
weaknesses in the acoustic Department I

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:35.359
think lyrically speaking if you ever

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:39.230
need somebody to come up with you know

00:25:35.359 --> 00:25:41.840
parodies on the fly I've got a got a

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:43.879
fast brain when it comes to searching

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.649
the rhyming dictionary and you know

00:25:43.879 --> 00:25:47.119
trying to make a bit up on the fly and

00:25:45.649 --> 00:25:49.429
I'm very grateful for that I think

00:25:47.119 --> 00:25:51.739
that's a relatively rare skill and a

00:25:49.429 --> 00:25:54.499
valuable one to have in this business it

00:25:51.739 --> 00:25:55.879
helps to be quick with it and at the

00:25:54.499 --> 00:26:00.019
risk of Tooting my own horn I think I

00:25:55.879 --> 00:26:03.499
fit the bill but singing just garbage

00:26:00.019 --> 00:26:05.029
try I try to walk away and I choke I

00:26:03.499 --> 00:26:09.080
might try to say goodbye and I choke

00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:13.039
that's it frickin ruin it but yeah the

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:16.730
singing is just does not does not work

00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:19.429
with my brain for whatever reason if you

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:21.049
play me two pitches simultaneously I'll

00:26:19.429 --> 00:26:22.909
go yeah oh that one's higher that one's

00:26:21.049 --> 00:26:27.200
lower this is not a joke by the way if

00:26:22.909 --> 00:26:28.489
you play me unnoted and play me another

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.789
note that's different

00:26:28.489 --> 00:26:34.190
I'll be like that's the same note I

00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:37.309
think something on a on a tonal level is

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:40.159
like broken in my brain or you can play

00:26:37.309 --> 00:26:41.960
like in like an A or something you could

00:26:40.159 --> 00:26:47.029
play like an F right after it and I'll

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:48.849
be like that's the same note excuse me

00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:51.440
excuse me sir

00:26:48.849 --> 00:26:51.980
you know I'm meant to be the Bernie

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:56.119
Taupin

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:59.239
to somebody else's Elton John the Louis

00:26:56.119 --> 00:27:01.399
Vuitton John Louie Elton John there we

00:26:59.239 --> 00:27:03.230
go it works took an extra second I'm not

00:27:01.399 --> 00:27:05.090
gonna waste my doubling on a Bob's

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:07.009
rotten head what do we do get our get a

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:11.119
solo Bob transformation it probably

00:27:07.009 --> 00:27:13.369
doesn't work well we do still have the

00:27:11.119 --> 00:27:15.710
deal with the devil slash angel awfully

00:27:13.369 --> 00:27:17.389
at this point we got HP and the runs not

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:21.109
set in stone that we're going to win so

00:27:17.389 --> 00:27:22.549
I'd really welcome the deal with the the

00:27:21.109 --> 00:27:25.820
devil to be honest we should have been

00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:28.419
hit there and walk this dog through

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:28.419
spider mud

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:38.620
little little anxious about this mr.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:42.880
Fred been showing up with a little bit

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:44.410
more common lately but not with a little

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:47.260
bit more in a way been show I have a

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:51.040
little bit more commonly lately commonly

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:56.650
it's the bus on the womb this is not the

00:27:51.040 --> 00:28:00.400
tune then and remember I have to admit I

00:27:56.650 --> 00:28:02.650
go to like probably the grocery store

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:08.650
with the best soundtrack I've ever been

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:11.130
a part of in my life I'm going to

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:13.000
continue to anecdote momentarily

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:16.660
obviously I mean we'll take the ability

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.250
to fly why not double it but I don't

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:22.170
what do we get for doubling the ability

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:24.040
to fly right oh no that was not smart

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:27.070
we're at the grocery store yesterday

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:31.270

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:32.980
told you life was gonna be this way yeah

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:35.260
that's right the friends theme song I'll

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:36.940
be there for you by the Rembrandt's it's

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:38.890

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:40.300
these days the rest of planet Earth is

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:42.670

memory but now it's back I I don't know

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:56.450
how I mind flooded myself into believing

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:59.900

00:30:56.450 --> 00:31:02.830

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:40.030
with no secret room access I'm out of

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.030
here

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:45.230
like Kevin O'Leary on shark tank ever

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:48.170
since he was a turncoat went to the

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:50.090
United States to make more money on

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:53.030
television came back to try to win the

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:55.730
leadership of the Conservative Party and

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:57.320
then in you know a surprising sort of

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:58.760
like one-two punch dropped out of the

00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:01.460
race to endorse another candidate and

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:02.630
then that candidate lost that's exactly

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:08.960
what we just did right there

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:10.430
please don't get hit get these farting

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.559
babies lined up as an impenetrable

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:16.280
shield they're not going to block beams

00:32:12.559 --> 00:32:20.300
though and they shots can curve past the

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:29.809
wall but dude they're there holding the

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:37.400
line that was actually sweet we didn't

00:32:29.809 --> 00:32:42.700
get to doesn't matter what they say I

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:42.700
mean this is from the professor that day

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:52.010
with Janet Jackson number two Eddie

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:54.200
Murphy as Sherman blue okay I don't know

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:56.630
I mean it is off the Nutty Professor to

00:32:54.200 --> 00:33:02.059
soundtrack ins doesn't matter doesn't

00:32:56.630 --> 00:33:03.350
really matter by Janet Jackson but we

00:33:02.059 --> 00:33:05.710
don't need to go down this road like a

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:08.330
hundred percent here I'm kind of like

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:11.480
focusing on it a lot I just slipped into

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:13.190
this voice but I'm kind of like dude I'm

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:16.280
not mad I just think it's funny that you

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:18.890
would give me a run with 3.4 damage on

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:20.420
the cathedral like I think it you know

00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:21.950
you're welcome to do that but it says a

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.960
lot about the kind of game you are right

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:25.520
now honestly and I guess the joke's on

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.170
me because I thought we had something a

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:30.620
little different more respectful going

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:32.390
here but clearly I'm the fool that arts

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:34.280
but it's not like we had a devil chance

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:38.630
regardless

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:41.870

00:33:51.800 --> 00:34:00.740

from the NL SS I don't want to revisit

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:32.690
like Daryl the social outcast who may

00:34:31.129 --> 00:34:36.169
have also murdered his family and

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:38.120

Jack miss like he wears like a purple

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:07.339

since we all moved to us

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:37.940
now I don't know I got a little bi you

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:39.590
think okay let's good forgivers and

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:41.180
comment airily on this run but do you

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:42.680
see the fact that we have the five point

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:45.910
six seven left but yet three point four

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:50.270
zero damage makes me want to cry

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:51.620
at least that works okay we're going to

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:52.820
double our damage we already got

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:55.400
bookworm I think so

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:57.560
it's not super relevant we definitely

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.970
want this we definitely don't care about

00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:01.250
that but we'll take it regardless and

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:03.260
you'll listen odd mushroom is a modest

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:03.920
damage increased robo-baby 2.0 nobody

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:08.600
cares

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:11.950
- good pills please - all - good pills

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:11.950
we can't take advantage of but still

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:24.070
just keep them at a distance treat these

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:27.010
guys like I store mushrooms feed them

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:30.440
these you can keep them in the dock

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:34.580
watch my language a little bit just a

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:36.250
word NL I know okay and like I know I'm

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:40.340
with you

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:44.570
clink twice being held against your will

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:47.750
yum hard I want to explore the floor

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:51.770
because we have six luck so way we give

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:56.420
me a second six luck is giving some hope

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:57.810
to me we could salvage this mediocre

00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:00.000
[Music]

00:38:57.810 --> 00:39:01.800
yeah it's this love by maroon 5 you know

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.690
I'm not the biggest Adam Levine family

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:05.340
we gotta admit the kids got a voice he's

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:06.840
also like 10 years older than me I just

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:08.820
called him a kid which is insulting but

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:10.410
you know what I'm starting to think that

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:13.770
guy just might make it with a little

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:15.240
can-do attitude and some luck won't be

00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:17.460
the last time you've heard the name Adam

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.960
Levine and every time you'd say

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:20.610
something like that in an episode you

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:22.290
just mutter a prayer under your breath

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:24.810
please don't die in a terrible accident

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:27.000
before this video comes out not only

00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:29.160
because that would invalidate 38 minutes

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.810
and 54 seconds of work on my end but it

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:37.640
would also make me look like a terrible

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:41.640
human being you know what I'm out dog

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:43.230
I'm out like Brett W Wilson was after

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:47.210
the third season of Dragon's Den because

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:47.210
he was too nice to say no to people

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:58.660
so telepathy V mega Satan I mean you saw

00:39:56.530 --> 00:40:07.600

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:10.350

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:13.600

my house bro you gotta lock your doors

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:25.060
locking your doors is like a plus floor

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:27.400
sorry I misspoke you didn't hear that

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:30.490
locking your doors is like a plus four

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:34.260
on cloud this week bro hope you don't

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:37.240

be honest you tarik doesn't have

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:43.000
anywhere else to go

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:47.800
Vanessa threw me out because I call the

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:50.080
Vanessa but her name is Vanessa and I

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:53.200
gotta say calling your wife by the wrong

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:55.119
name is very not in this week extremely

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:56.560
not cool but I'm waiting on my sources

00:40:55.119 --> 00:41:00.630
to report back with some data on that

00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:02.350
tarik out but also still here

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:05.310
something's going through our hearts I

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:05.310
feel bad for that guy

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:15.950
you know it's it's hard to be a social

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:18.230
media guru this day and age maybe I

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:20.480
don't know I've got some pretty good

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:23.180
social media advice it's take pictures

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:26.650
of your cats when you want to and

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:26.650
everything is going to be okay

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:33.890
stop shooting your beams at me telepathy

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:36.380
does not stop beams and this presents a

00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:41.480
problem for me we should be using that

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:44.600
this line of farting babies to stop any

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:49.820
and all like potential incursions on a

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:51.860
my real estate here bro you got to stop

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:53.870
calling it my real estate property

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:55.930
ownership is at an all-time high in

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:59.060

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:23.180
