##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.929
hey everybody welcome external

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.890
amplifying about to get her plus we lost

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.230
our last run

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.010
very embarrassing was it as Isaac no it

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:17.609
was as apollyon is that yes is right

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:22.140
okay well let's play as a character that

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.869
we've already done boss rush but don't

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.619
have to have not done Scholl and Judas

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.410
fits the bill

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:33.500
what's my methodology they're beating

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:37.430
Scholl QV FC 800 X wow that sounds like

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:43.559
it's like a biological waste processing

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:48.090
machine the QB MC 800 X turns corpses

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.960
into okay's I don't know if you put

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.079
corpses in a biological waste you know

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.190
purifying machine I think you're just

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.899
you're supposed to put like bloody

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.989
bandages and stuff this isn't growth

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.309
this is science okay you know what do

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.260
you think our hospital Billy I don't

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.030
even know if this is true what do you

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.150
think a hospital does with bandages that

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.010
have like you know human DNA in

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.780
potential you know infectious materials

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.979
on them they got a they got a purifier

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.229
I'm pretty sure you throw it in like a

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.210
big old steamer or boiler or something

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.009
like that then you throw it in the trash

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.240
otherwise it's probably like mad illegal

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.650
I don't know I'm just taking a guess

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.850
there that's my assumption that's you

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.409
know what they say when you make an

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.479
assumption you make an asset option I'm

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.119
not going to risk this at least not yet

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.439
oh if we see this in - Drock I don't

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.420
recall I'm going to place a bomb I

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.549
thought I placed it too far away and

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.659
became a little annoyed with myself but

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.369
I didn't we literally broke even spent a

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.439
bomb in the key to get a bomb in a key

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.619
but resource-wise we're doing pretty

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.740
well right now or resource wise if you

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.700
will look we have to stop fighting each

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.990
other in the english language okay

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.780
we got to fight out we've been the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.770
lingua franca as hilarious as that

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.110
sounds for many many years but now we're

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.190
killing ourselves with this constant in

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:18.090
language bickering how are we supposed

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:22.770
to fend off competition from upstart

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.630
languages like Klingon and JavaScript if

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.730
we're too busy bickering amongst

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:36.510
ourselves some troubling rhetoric um

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:40.019
okay he'll this guy fudge C sharp Mary

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.690
JavaScript let's grab this head

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.060
downstairs we didn't get any spirit

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.380
hearts I will say I think the start of

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.410
games has gotten a little bit more

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.080
difficult because it's not as well I'm

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.580
not as open to the idea of blowing up

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.060
our donation machine obviously you need

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.620
resources for it to begin with but I'm

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.299
not as open to the idea of blowing up

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.500
our donation machine to get a spirit out

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.600
on the first floor because we need to

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.700
get all the shop upgrades before that

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.260
really feels like it's a smart idea

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.780
otherwise we know take it two steps

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.730
forward one step back I went for a long

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.280
walk this morning I'm going to tell you

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.350
two steps forward one step back not a

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.060
very efficient walking algorithm it's

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.530
like the bubble sort of walking this has

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.359
become an insufferable video already

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.680
there's an anecdote I'm listening to

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.920
this audio book it's called algorithms

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.440
to live by it sounds nerdier than it is

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.989
I promise you that although basically it

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.850
takes a computer science approach to

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.859
many tasks that we have in our modern

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.720
day life and attempts to show you the

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:42.180
most efficient or effective ways to

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.680
organize those past it gets a little too

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.720
precious for me sometimes where it's

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.840
like you know here's the optimal way to

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.340
organize you know hey here's how you

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.410
should fold your laundry and I'm like

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.090
look I don't want this to be a self-help

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.430
book it's a general interest sort of

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.480
thing I don't think I don't want to my

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.950
wife is going to come in I'm going to

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.000
have an Excel spreadsheet open she's

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.650
maybe hey what do you do what I'm like

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.510
don't worry I'm sorting my laundry in

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.209
the most efficient way plausible but

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:10.150
apparently in 2007

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:13.390
Barack Obama as a senator visited

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.739
Google's headquarters and had an

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.370
interview that I can only assume is

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:20.380
scripted with the Google brass in which

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.870
they asked him what's the most efficient

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.440
way to sort a list of 32-bit integers

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.820
and he laughed and said I don't know but

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.800
I've got a feeling the bubble sort is

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:35.560
the wrong answer and then the audience

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.930
erupted in the uproarious applause and I

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.870
find this anecdote hilarious because I

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.330
can I'm not suggesting that Barack Obama

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.669
is a stupid individual by any stretch of

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.580
the imagination you know he's the

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:51.520
Statesman politician dignified

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.650
regardless of your political beliefs you

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.789
know he handled himself with the quorum

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.020
and always struck me as being very

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:02.650
erudite however I know how this dude

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:06.490
knows what a bubble sort is he was born

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.930
in like 1961 that doesn't mean you know

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.400
there are many computer science born

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.780
1961 and you don't have to be a computer

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.550
scientist to know what a bubble sort is

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.940
it just strikes me is the sort of thing

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.669
that like a lawyer turned politician

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.919
doesn't necessarily have any incentive

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:24.099
to know oh my god that's the first time

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.960
we've ever gotten basement boy and if

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:28.510
it's scripted that's hilarious although

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.250
I guess not all together unexpected so

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.080
this is I'm just having fun with these

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:37.500
runs basically no pets coming through in

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:43.240
the hope that's coming through in the

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:45.400
dialogue here but I think that contract

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.900
from below is a better item for

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:53.020
accomplishing a win then careful then

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.720
black powder but with 1.60 speed early

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.659
on on this run why not give black powder

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:02.349
a chance to disappoint me right try

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:03.610
using that as your pickup line by the

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:06.370
way we probably wouldn't be the first

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.199
time that a politician has you know

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.590
misrepresented themselves to get votes I

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:13.870
suppose for other examples of that see

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:17.760
every politician in Earth's history

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.760
anyway let's move along here

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:26.190
he is right though a bubble store would

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.480
be the wrong and that would get you

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.460
laughed out of the Google interview I

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.350
can only assume because it's something

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.850
that I would say and I think that's the

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.270
approach that I would be expecting as

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:38.700
well excuse me sir we're going to new

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:42.540
hits earth do you have a permission to

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:44.310
be here sir we don't allow snapback

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:48.090
Canadian flag baseball hats on the

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:49.800
Google canvas bears out honestly

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.600
borderline racist as far as I'm

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:56.400
concerned let's move along here

00:06:51.600 --> 00:07:02.940
I'm joking Google ok Google Play over

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:05.880
killed by men at work the runs going

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.860
great so far the odds of us having a

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.510
perfect run are I would say a hundred

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.820
percent of the present moment perfect

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:13.620
run just meaning we never get hit so far

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.930
so good in that department big horns

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:19.230
always a little bit of a test I think

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:24.660
we've already gotten no I'm trying to

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:26.490
think we've gotten mama's boy now we've

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:30.270
gotten basement boy and I think we've

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:31.979
gotten dark boy no we gotten spelunker

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:38.100
bully but not maybe we've done to all

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:39.960
the boys I'm not sure I mean we are an

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.220
okay Isaac player these are achievements

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.919
that the first time through we're like a

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.360
little difficult now we're doing the max

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:47.280
dentally which i think is a great sign

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.220
that you know we've continued to improve

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.650
a little bit over our rebirth lifespan

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.840
despite the fact that results don't

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:58.640
always necessarily indicate that either

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.640
way oh free spirit hard

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:04.610
we'll continue moving right along here

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:10.800
just get in here what's up thank you

00:08:10.139 --> 00:08:12.360
okay

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.070
oh you know what this is actually a

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.860
wonderful situation for us to be in the

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:18.479
begin with because we also have so much

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:21.030
money to donate to our shops and the

00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:21.990
Golden Key is one thing but I don't

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:24.120
think we're gonna get to two hundred and

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:25.710
fifty cents on this run by the play some

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.880
smart money I wouldn't place it on that

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:31.979
I would instead invest in blaze Pizza

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:34.529
America's fastest ever growing chain of

00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:37.110
food service establishments funded

00:08:34.529 --> 00:08:39.599
largely in part by NBA superstar LeBron

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:42.960
James well we got to donate about

00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:44.670
negative ten cents to a spades is nice

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.339
and the boomerang is terrible all right

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:55.080
let's move along my number one priority

00:08:47.339 --> 00:08:56.490
is is donating money again I think I'm

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.900
going to not go to the curse room

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.630
because we haven't taken damage so far

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:03.360
so it might be unnecessarily kind of

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:05.190
precious but I think that we should stay

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.080
away from deliberately taking damage not

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:09.060
for survival because we could you know

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.190
get to birthstone at once your knock out

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.209
those achievements that I may or may not

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.709
have gotten that have completely

00:09:12.209 --> 00:09:16.410
forgotten about will do a more you know

00:09:13.709 --> 00:09:18.089
rigorous kind of analysis of our

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:21.510
achievements once we get within striking

00:09:18.089 --> 00:09:22.860
distance of real platinum god which we

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:27.029
are not even close to at the present

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:30.810
moment but for now maybe just you know

00:09:27.029 --> 00:09:32.670
make smart decisions if there's one

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:36.990
thing oh that's pretty good if there's

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:38.850
one thing I'm jealous of Americans for

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.350
is that the proper way to structure that

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.150
sentence and I think there are many

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:44.630
things to be jealous of Americans for

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:48.620
but if there's one thing in particular

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:52.200
it's the precedence of many many

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:54.150
fast-casual dining chains and I'm it

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.160
sounds like the way I've structured that

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:58.529
sentence is I've typical NL

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:00.270
facetiousness it's not the case I'm not

00:09:58.529 --> 00:10:02.490
joking not at all in fact I've never

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:05.190
joked in my entire life but up here in

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:07.230
Canada we're still I mean we have our

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:08.070
own stuff going on up here of course

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:10.030
we've got you know the standard

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:13.330
McDonald's Burger King Lindy

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:14.650
etc we also have our own Canadian stuff

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.420
like there's a chain called Harvey's

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:18.490
they do some weird stuff so that

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:20.020
sometimes they it's a burger joint but

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:22.060
they started serving like rice bowls

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:24.310
except you can replace the rice with

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:26.200
french fries it is like sometimes I'm

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:28.450
like who's running this joint like an 8

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.010
year old it's a little weird but you

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:31.660
know RVs they got some good things going

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:33.100
for them they like they'll dress your

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.630
burgers the same way that they will

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.460
dress your sandwich at Subway you know

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:38.110
you go through like a deli counter and

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.730
you go okay give me extra peppers and

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.410
pickles bla bla bla nobody else is doing

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:44.590
that

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:45.790
that I know of and of course we've got

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:49.140
five guys you don't have internet but

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:51.220
we've got some in and out like knockoffs

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:55.200
like there's a place in Vancouver called

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:56.920
Cali burger it's a really we all check

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.200
nothing wrong with that

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:01.990
it's the burgers are delicious and I

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.850
gotta say for only $18 for a

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:07.710
cheeseburger is a pretty smokin feel

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:10.300
they are delicious though

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:13.060
I'll give you that I'm making a joke

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:14.830
that $18 is too expensive for a

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:16.540
cheeseburger but you know you make that

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:18.010
decision when you look at the menu or

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.870
when you've locked in and decided fine

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:21.730
I'm already here I can't just walk out

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:23.160
that'd be awkward okay I'm done with

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:27.760
this room

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:30.340
but we're still living in like a like a

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:33.730
Chipotle era but I do want to point out

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:35.050
as well some of our Canadian chains are

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:36.190
supposedly a lot better than the

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:37.510
American counterparts I don't know about

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:38.980
vice-versa like there there's probably

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:43.630
some that flip the script there as well

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:45.340
but our a and ws are like relatively

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:47.890
high - your fast food and I just what

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.240
I'd tell Americans like oh yeah a and W

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:51.850
is expanding like crazy here they're

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:55.600
like really they've been out of business

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:59.190
here since like 1962 but anyway you know

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.190
what looks let's go for broke there

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:04.210
I have I've even had a chick-fil-a once

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:05.730
in my entire life that never expanded up

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:09.430
here I understand there's some personal

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:12.010
concerns with the executive management

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.820
of chick-fil-a but chicken sandwiches

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.560
are delicious

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:17.380
I'm not saying that absolves them of

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:19.150
that but I am saying that it absolves

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:21.130
them a little bit because they sell

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:23.110
chicken sandwiches I guess is right if

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:25.660
the sandwiches suck I would be I would

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:27.040
find a way more easier way more easy to

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:30.310
stick to my principles I guess is what

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:32.560
I'm trying to say and again I've never

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:35.950
told a joke I'm not being facetious at

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:37.750
all but beyond this I've never eaten

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:39.850
that a long john silver's as I

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:42.250
understand it Long John Silver's not

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:43.780
really that good I've never talked to an

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:48.690
American who's like oh yeah I love Long

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:51.790
John Silver's but I just there's like no

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:53.380
fast-food seafood in Canada there used

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:54.820
to be a couple of places place called

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.890
Arthur Treacher's I'm pretty sure it's

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:58.270
out of business the place called Salamah

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.620
Gundy pretty sure it's out of business

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:05.050
you know these these are around when I

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:06.340
was like five no achievements but I mean

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:08.020
I'm feeling pretty good about my

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:11.890
performances so far I don't believe that

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:14.560
we've taken damage here and let's

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:15.670
squander that again we might have

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:21.420
already gotten this achievement in the

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:23.890
first place but anyway I love seafood

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:26.040
I'm not going to go on another tangent

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:28.960
about how like you know I think that

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:30.910
yeah I knew it I'm not going to go on

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.020
another tangent about how like I find it

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.310
weird that people don't like fish

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.890
because it tastes too fishy that's

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:39.370
another I will eat almost any kind of

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:41.590
seafood you know give me a abalone clam

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:45.100
oyster mussel I like the whole thing I

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:46.930
don't care I would eat oysters way more

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.460
often if they weren't expensively you'll

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:51.520
ever go to a place that has oysters it's

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:53.920
always like you know three dollars a no

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:55.270
oyster I'm not paying eighteen dollars

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:58.860
for six Oscars I could get a

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:58.860
cheeseburger at Kali burger for that

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:04.370
see it was like a little tie back or tie

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:09.740
in there call back that's what we call

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:16.430
it in the industry nothing we got bombs

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:18.410
we can check could be big but yeah it

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:20.120
like I something you can get a

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:21.499
filet-o-fish sandwich but it's not the

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.100
same I don't want to fillet a fish

00:14:21.499 --> 00:14:23.930
sandwich

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:26.180
I want like fish and chips I want clam

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:31.579
strips I want chicken and wild liver

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:35.779
meow mix me a mix please deliver I've

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:37.459
never eaten add a jack-in-the-box I've

00:14:35.779 --> 00:14:39.350
never read not to talk about we have

00:14:37.459 --> 00:14:42.100
them but that's a different story I've

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:45.980
never eaten at a Carl's jr. although

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:49.160
when I went to Japan when I went to

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:51.769
Tokyo they had a Carl's jr. that had

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:55.370
recently opened up in Akihabara and they

00:14:51.769 --> 00:14:58.069
had people in Carl's jr. garb outside of

00:14:55.370 --> 00:15:01.490
it like flippin signs and like enticing

00:14:58.069 --> 00:15:04.309
Japanese businessmen to go to the Carl's

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:05.990
jr. and I know what you're thinking what

00:15:04.309 --> 00:15:08.779
a stupid idea that would never work it

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:10.970
was working gangbusters that there was

00:15:08.779 --> 00:15:14.449
like a 35 minute lineup to get into the

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:17.420
Carl's jr. and when we walked by like

00:15:14.449 --> 00:15:19.339
made eye contact with me didn't mention

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.930
anything didn't didn't speak a word of

00:15:19.339 --> 00:15:23.149
Japanese they were just like this guy

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:24.889
knows we're running nothing this guy

00:15:23.149 --> 00:15:26.600
knows and thought were the 35 minute

00:15:24.889 --> 00:15:28.850
wait to get into the Carl's jr. so we're

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.980
just gonna like you know let bygones be

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:32.509
bygones he's not gonna you know try to

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.980
spoil our hustle and we're not going to

00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:37.670
give him the disrespect to trying to

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:39.379
keep it I'm sure I don't know if Carl's

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:41.300
jr. is that bad by the way I'm mining it

00:15:39.379 --> 00:15:45.980
as a little bit of a joke I'll admit

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:49.699
that was pretty dumb and let's go but

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:51.259
yeah like I'm jealous but I think that I

00:15:49.699 --> 00:15:54.230
would become accustomed to it too fast

00:15:51.259 --> 00:15:56.809
cuz already like I don't appreciate

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:58.160
variety and fast food to begin with if

00:15:56.809 --> 00:16:01.399
I'm at a place that has like a Wendy's

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.779
of Burger King a KFC and a McDonald's

00:16:01.399 --> 00:16:04.639
I'm going to the Wendy's every time it's

00:16:02.779 --> 00:16:06.259
not like I'm going last time I had

00:16:04.639 --> 00:16:07.089
Wendy's was three months ago so I'm

00:16:06.259 --> 00:16:10.720
going to go to the can

00:16:07.089 --> 00:16:13.329
this time some well let's go off on a

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:16.029
tangent that make sense here that is

00:16:13.329 --> 00:16:20.110
truthful I guess I should say I almost

00:16:16.029 --> 00:16:22.059
never have changes in my food preference

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:24.220
and I I'm not trying to say that I'm

00:16:22.059 --> 00:16:26.499
like you know Dae because I think a lot

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:28.300
of people is the standard rule if you

00:16:26.499 --> 00:16:34.089
have to say does anybody else the answer

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:35.939
is always probably however I think that

00:16:34.089 --> 00:16:38.829
there are must be dozens of us out there

00:16:35.939 --> 00:16:41.379
because personally what makes you larger

00:16:38.829 --> 00:16:44.860
well they all make you larger if you you

00:16:41.379 --> 00:16:47.230
know everything in moderation right but

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:50.259
personally like I know some people were

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:52.689
like I just can't eat another chicken

00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:54.670
breast I don't understand that well I

00:16:52.689 --> 00:16:58.029
mean I guess I understand it I'm gonna

00:16:54.670 --> 00:17:00.370
go for the guppy dream I understand it

00:16:58.029 --> 00:17:05.679
but I don't I don't feel it deep in my

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:07.870
core if I enjoy a meal I'll enjoy it

00:17:05.679 --> 00:17:09.579
tomorrow I'll enjoy it you know for a

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:11.799
week straight I got no problem with it

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:19.990
we're in actually a dangerous spot here

00:17:11.799 --> 00:17:21.850
now you are an actual idiot okay I'm I

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:23.559
have to own up to this first off I do

00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:26.380
want to say f you to the game just for a

00:17:23.559 --> 00:17:29.110
second because I took no damage for the

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:31.179
first like four floors and then didn't

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:32.620
get enough HP to help me survive here

00:17:31.179 --> 00:17:34.240
but I digress I shouldn't have walked

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.380
into the champion trying to avoid an

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.419
enemy that only would have hit me for

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:39.130
half damage but you know let's let's go

00:17:37.419 --> 00:17:39.520
give me a negative two streak at the

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.390
area

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:44.559
I actually I know you wouldn't do it uh

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:46.390
everybody gets one I suppose we'll mess

00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:51.100
that up something fierce and then get

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:53.059
another run on camera here but I could

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:57.009
eat the same food

00:17:53.059 --> 00:18:02.019
as long as I enjoy it forever I think

00:17:57.009 --> 00:18:02.019
without any psychological you know I

00:18:02.259 --> 00:18:07.190
thought it was empty and I was going to

00:18:04.519 --> 00:18:10.100
lose my freakin mind

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:13.700
without any kind of psychological impact

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:15.950
on a negative standpoint another kind of

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.970
guy who can eat Soylent or drink Soylent

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:22.460
all day every day

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:25.119
I do enjoy not that Soylent necessarily

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:30.049
tastes bad but I do enjoy the process of

00:18:25.119 --> 00:18:35.210
masticating and eating food that tastes

00:18:30.049 --> 00:18:36.889
particularly delicious but if it has no

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:39.470
negative health benefits I could eat

00:18:36.889 --> 00:18:41.389
like a windy spicy chicken sandwich

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:44.119
every single day and be completely fine

00:18:41.389 --> 00:18:49.999
with it so I don't really understand why

00:18:44.119 --> 00:18:51.470
I'm so eager to seek out variety because

00:18:49.999 --> 00:18:53.899
lord knows if there was a Long John

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:55.100
Silver's in my you know town I probably

00:18:53.899 --> 00:18:56.809
would have even there once and then been

00:18:55.100 --> 00:19:00.769
like never again but it's just the fact

00:18:56.809 --> 00:19:05.809
that I can't okay all these American

00:19:00.769 --> 00:19:08.029
chains are so downright offensive to

00:19:05.809 --> 00:19:09.499
Canadians not opening branches up here

00:19:08.029 --> 00:19:11.080
because the market research doesn't

00:19:09.499 --> 00:19:13.100
support it yeah whatever

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:17.090
something-something sees the means of

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:22.429
production get the guillotines out I

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:24.230
want my fried fish sandwiches okay now I

00:19:22.429 --> 00:19:27.649
am a little bit embarrassed that we lost

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:29.659
the last run despite playing well it was

00:19:27.649 --> 00:19:31.999
just weird we played really badly on

00:19:29.659 --> 00:19:33.950
that one floor and took like three hits

00:19:31.999 --> 00:19:36.980
and that was enough to erase all of our

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:38.779
like nearly orders of magnitude better

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:42.940
than normal play up to that point this

00:19:38.779 --> 00:19:45.500
runs you know shaping up nicely got

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:47.330
we're going to have a tinted rock which

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:49.940
I hope it's not small rock because our

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:51.860
speed we we have small rock on Lots I

00:19:49.940 --> 00:20:02.030
think we do now but I don't think we've

00:19:51.860 --> 00:20:05.630
ever seen it yet sorry thank you we have

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:08.120
lump of coal right off the bed which is

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:09.830
just a nice damage augmenter if not an

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:14.840
outright damage improvement in its own

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:16.520
right we could use I mean I'm going to

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.710
ask pretend out of 10 items because we

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:20.270
had a loss 17 minutes into the episode

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.710
it wouldn't be the worst thing in the

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:23.240
world that we could really just kick the

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:25.310
crap out of the game over the rest of it

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:27.170
but probably when you have ten point

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:28.700
seven seven damage you should stop using

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:31.400
your orbital reveal damage because it

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:33.080
makes you look like a tool okay uh you

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.900
grab this first and then this actually

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:37.910
gives you HP and now you can fly and

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.230
your rate of fire is a lot better and

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:44.090
everything is looking like it's coming

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:49.070
up roses here I think at least

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:51.470
everything's coming up roses here's an

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:54.940
etiquette question for you when is it

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:57.680
okay well I want to preface this by a

00:20:54.940 --> 00:21:00.950
topic header I want to talk about

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:03.200
restaurant closing times because I think

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:05.420
I'm encountering a paradox in closing

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:09.610
times first I mean one last call for

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:12.470
alcohol Sophia Nisha with ski or beers

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:14.960
if a restaurant closing time is 9 p.m.

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:17.900
what's the latest conceivable time that

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:19.670
you can go into that restaurant this at

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:22.130
8:59 I think we would all agree this

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:24.230
it's certainly not 901 we would all

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:27.410
agree on that can you step into a

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:28.610
restaurant that closes at 9:00 at 8:59

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:30.650
and expect to be served

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.850
I would also accept that I would expect

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:34.250
the answer from the majority of people

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:36.110
is no because we all have kind of an

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:40.330
understanding that the time that a

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:43.280
restaurant closes is not necessarily the

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:46.190
time that it's actually active like a

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:48.320
restaurant stops being active like

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:49.909
fifteen minutes before it closes I guess

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:51.580
this is what I'm trying to ask 30

00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:55.220
minutes before it closes

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:58.610
what do you think I say this because

00:21:55.220 --> 00:22:00.649
Kate and I had some ramen join me really

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:02.149
like in the West End of Vancouver called

00:22:00.649 --> 00:22:04.789
Don beau delicious

00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:06.200
there's locations I think in the US as

00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:08.450
well and in Japan if you ever find

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.649
yourself with the opportunity to go

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:11.809
check it out I would recommend it

00:22:09.649 --> 00:22:14.230
fantastic there's a few locations in

00:22:11.809 --> 00:22:16.519
Vancouver as well but anyway I digress

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:19.730
they close at 11:00 we know this because

00:22:16.519 --> 00:22:21.860
we go there to often leave our apartment

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:24.769
at about 10 tons of time then we run

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:27.549
into traffic you know there's people we

00:22:24.769 --> 00:22:30.590
live on a street that gets kind of like

00:22:27.549 --> 00:22:32.240
it gets blocked basically because people

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:34.909
like just sit on it and put on their

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:36.379
four-way flashers and then you know

00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:37.970
there's cars parked on both sides and

00:22:36.379 --> 00:22:39.950
then cars just blocking a lane and

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:41.870
you're like okay I'll just wait for you

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:44.240
to come back to your car or for there to

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:46.669
be like so much of a gap in traffic that

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:48.740
I can fit through that took us like an

00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:50.360
extra five minutes and then you know is

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:52.100
that apparently parts of downtown

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:54.320
Vancouver are basically quarantined

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.490
because of drunk idiots so it's okay we

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:58.309
got a detour around that we ended up

00:22:55.490 --> 00:23:00.049
showing up like 15 minutes before closed

00:22:58.309 --> 00:23:03.139
which case cooled that makes me a little

00:23:00.049 --> 00:23:04.399
uncomfortable and they served us but

00:23:03.139 --> 00:23:05.870
they were and it was a perfect situation

00:23:04.399 --> 00:23:08.330
actually they served us they were like

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:10.100
to see no it's last call so whatever you

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:11.330
order should be everything that you want

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.649
to order you can't add anything to your

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:15.409
meal because we got to get out everybody

00:23:12.649 --> 00:23:16.940
and then you know as soon as they

00:23:15.409 --> 00:23:18.830
brought the food they also brought like

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:20.210
the credit card reader and we're like

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:22.059
it'd be sweet if you could pay now and

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:24.379
then you could take your time eating

00:23:22.059 --> 00:23:26.509
like this is perfect but a lot of

00:23:24.379 --> 00:23:27.950
restaurants don't do that like sometimes

00:23:26.509 --> 00:23:31.009
we'll walk into a place that says it

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:33.980
closes that you know 11:00 it's 10:40

00:23:31.009 --> 00:23:36.139
and then we go to walk in and you know

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:37.789
somebody just Complexo comes up to us

00:23:36.139 --> 00:23:39.730
and goes oh sorry it's closed you can

00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:42.110
close whatever you want I'm not you know

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:43.610
saying that you over a we can donate now

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:44.779
I'm not saying that you shouldn't be

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:46.129
able to close your restaurant whenever

00:23:44.779 --> 00:23:49.870
you want but if you're not going to take

00:23:46.129 --> 00:23:53.950
people in starting that

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:55.960
you know 10:45 or whenever maybe your

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:57.970
closing time should be 10:45 but then if

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:59.470
you made your closing time 10:45 you

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:00.909
have to stop taking people in at 10:30

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:02.380
and eventually your closing before you

00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:03.909
even open you see what I this is where

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:06.220
I'm getting that this is the meat of the

00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:08.559
discussion for me is oh my god

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:10.240
I'm sorry I'm on such autopilot right

00:24:08.559 --> 00:24:12.270
now and I apologize it's like the eighth

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:15.159
time in a row we've taken Bob's brain

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:17.799
despite is mostly hurting us but I still

00:24:15.159 --> 00:24:21.880
like it when is it okay I mean I've

00:24:17.799 --> 00:24:23.440
previously we don't want to take this

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:30.960
many one makes you larger pills but I'm

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:33.490
gonna previously I think I was like I

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:42.460
was like a 20 minutes before closing

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:44.440
sort of Roy let's go so if a restaurant

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:47.020
closes at 9:00 if I'm showing up after

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:54.610
8:40 I at least have a back-up plan in

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:55.750
mind I cannot see what's happening but I

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.010
don't know I'm interested to know what

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:58.899
people think about it seems like the

00:24:57.010 --> 00:25:00.460
kind of thing that people would hold

00:24:58.899 --> 00:25:02.080
that didn't actually take any money out

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:03.549
of it it seems like the sort of thing

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.799
that people would be indignant about all

00:25:03.549 --> 00:25:07.510
I would like is if every restaurant did

00:25:05.799 --> 00:25:10.630
it the same way that that ramen

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:13.210
restaurant does it where it was like hey

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:15.730
you know this is when we'll stop serving

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:17.470
you and this is when we want to close

00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:19.149
the doors and get out of here because

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:22.299
right now it's just like you got a guess

00:25:19.149 --> 00:25:23.770
like you wouldn't go to a fancy like you

00:25:22.299 --> 00:25:27.309
know I'm going to get a four-course meal

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:28.659
15 minutes before closing time but you

00:25:27.309 --> 00:25:30.399
know if you're if you're McDonald's

00:25:28.659 --> 00:25:32.380
closes in five minutes you might still

00:25:30.399 --> 00:25:36.059
consider that okay to walk in that's

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:40.600
every restaurant should have a last call

00:25:36.059 --> 00:25:41.649
for food and enterings and then a time

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.450
when the doors are shut

00:25:41.649 --> 00:25:45.730
not that we're not accepting anybody but

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:47.409
like we're doing to be out of here by

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:49.330
this time and we can we're well within

00:25:47.409 --> 00:25:51.820
our rights to ask you to leave if you

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:54.669
get like too far beyond this time as

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:56.870
within the bounds of reason I'm just

00:25:54.669 --> 00:26:00.020
throwing it out there is it possible

00:25:56.870 --> 00:26:01.970
you know a more apt approach to running

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:04.490
a restaurant business there's another

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:08.690
many people out there I don't understand

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:09.920
it mostly I like to eat the concept of

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:11.720
owning my own restaurant is just

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:14.360
terrifying to me I would never want to

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:15.740
do it if that's your dream absolutely

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:18.530
more power to you and I don't mean this

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:21.559
to be insulting at all I would never do

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:22.790
it but I hope that you're if you're

00:26:21.559 --> 00:26:24.020
considering doing it you're also

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:25.130
watching this episode because I'm going

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:28.280
to give you some tips that I think are

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:31.070
very important yeah you're going to need

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.880
to have depending on the restaurant

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:33.559
going to need to have waiters or

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:36.200
waitresses right people to bring the

00:26:33.559 --> 00:26:39.350
food out take orders every restaurant

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:43.100
should do the Korean thing where they

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:46.429
have a button that you press that goes

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:49.010
beep boop and when you press that it

00:26:46.429 --> 00:26:51.710
sends it puts like your table number up

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:53.360
on a screen so the server's are like

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:57.020
okay this person wants something right

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:59.510
now I know you're going to say an L

00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:02.090
can't you just like say excuse me but

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:04.340
there's a whole like waiting game that

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:05.990
comes about you're like oh can can you

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.250
give me some water and then someone

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:09.080
walks by why didn't you give me the

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:11.270
water oh you know that's not our service

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.530
I don't think this is that our server I

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:14.090
don't remember exactly what our server

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:16.340
looks like Oh our server went on break

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:18.679
now we got you know Antonio's going to

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:20.240
be our server but you know he's busy

00:27:18.679 --> 00:27:21.710
with this other table over here that's

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:24.020
ordering a cheeseburger it was like nine

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:25.880
different replacements that they want on

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:28.610
it so it's going to take us a while the

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:30.890
beep-boop is the ideal setup the other

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:33.650
way that you do it is not it's not a

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:35.120
drill people in South Korea if they

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:36.770
don't have the beep boop button that you

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:40.880
press that summons someone to your table

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:43.160
you straight up just Yelp shogi oh you

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:44.900
yell it in this in the middle of not a

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:48.170
restaurant really but in the middle of

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:50.140
your establishment and then someone is

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:52.640
summoned to your table so it's like

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:56.660
every group of friends has a dedicated

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:58.610
Chokey oh you know Town Crier whose job

00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:00.290
it is to summon someone to the table you

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:01.340
know you get a little especially in a

00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:02.510
foreign country you get a little

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:02.880
diminutive you're like I don't really

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:04.650
want to

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.120
you know what if they make fun of the

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:09.030
way that I say Tokyo and then somebody

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:10.770
else is just like drug it out so I like

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:12.650
going out to eat Korean food this case

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:16.770
mom because she has no chogi Oh shame

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:20.670
she will just I mean yes I understand is

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:22.230
it Dave Chappelle quote it fits but she

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:24.630
will does Wayne Brady at the chair you

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:27.210
know but she will she will chill go with

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:28.380
the best then I'll juggle for food I'll

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:30.870
choke you go for drinks

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:32.730
she'll chögyal for like extra kimchi

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:34.110
and that's why she's an essential part

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:38.250
of the dining experience

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:39.750
I won't chug yell for kimchi it just

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:42.270
makes me feel too self-conscious to ask

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:43.830
for more of a free thing like someone is

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:44.340
servant to your table to give you free

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:47.580
stuff

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:49.500
I mean you are paying I guess for the

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:54.890
meal built it's a built-in cost I'm just

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:57.390
saying I have like inexplicably and

00:28:54.890 --> 00:29:00.210
unredeemable screwed this run obviously

00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:02.460
a home in obviously we had that first

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:05.160
death to begin with but like then also

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:10.070
beyond that I I can't control this

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:12.000
character anymore and our stats are good

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:14.880
but I don't think they're good enough

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.160
for me to be in this ridiculous of a

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:19.110
state I also want to point out our deal

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:21.630
with the devil chance is just stupid

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:24.180
thirty eight point one three percent

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:27.750
chance how in the world have we created

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:28.860
that that's like extra evil via the pact

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:30.510
or something like that

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:32.310
but then we got a deal with the devil

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:35.070
but we've also blown up a donation

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:36.930
mission like on it I have no idea what

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:40.610
we've done to create this this hellscape

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:43.020
of my own image but it is going

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:43.680
relatively quickly and I don't want to

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:46.230
blink

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:48.870
you know don't don't compliment me too

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:50.670
hard I'm not posting you know 17 minute

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.900
Judas loss the only reason I saved it is

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:54.660
because I thought the commentary through

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:56.640
the start was pretty good sometimes I do

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:59.850
have episodes like that maybe like once

00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:02.130
a month I'll just completely mess up an

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:05.070
Isaac run and just be like I'm not

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:06.810
posting the commentary is not good

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:09.600
enough and the play is horrible you only

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:12.270
need to get 50% you know what if you got

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:13.860
you know 0% quality commentary if you're

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:15.240
at least doing pretty okay in the game

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:18.480
that's fine but

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:22.020
dude we actually might and this would

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:25.740
redeem completely my earlier mistakes

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:27.750
and also making myself enormous here we

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:29.970
might be able to get level 4 bandage

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:32.539
girl which would be that was one of the

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:37.080
last rebirth achievements I got for sure

00:30:32.539 --> 00:30:41.789
we already have level 3 will go contract

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:44.429
from below but nothing else actually we

00:30:41.789 --> 00:30:46.559
have done boss rushes Judas so we don't

00:30:44.429 --> 00:30:49.080
have to do boss rush since you just have

00:30:46.559 --> 00:30:51.750
good use of a key which I think means

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:54.690
I'm going to just teleport right now and

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:55.980
I'm going to donate sure you getting

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:58.080
those are good items to buy don't get me

00:30:55.980 --> 00:31:02.039
wrong but we had a long uphill battle

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:07.860
here in terms of donations so I do not

00:31:02.039 --> 00:31:10.500
mind donating more contrite from below

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:13.710
is nice but we are looking to up our

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:17.630
damage actually like an in tears quite a

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:23.130
lot if possible because more or less

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:26.669
this run is just like weird and I would

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:29.640
like to have it be as easy to win as

00:31:26.669 --> 00:31:31.710
possible if we could create that

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:33.360
situation or a situation that fits that

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:34.860
bill I would be a very happy cancer Oh

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:36.870
why'd you do it well you know what we

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:40.620
get the gummy chance anyway let's forget

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:45.620
to experience charge bars charging buys

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:45.620
as I days end our names

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:53.830
I also like when I moved to Vancouver on

00:31:51.789 --> 00:31:57.039
the subject of restaurants I was like

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:58.630
dude some of the restaurants doesn't

00:31:57.039 --> 00:32:00.070
have a reputation for the city wise got

00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:03.429
a reputation for restaurants closing

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:05.440
early but anyway some of the restaurants

00:32:03.429 --> 00:32:08.049
are open 24 hours that's like blowing my

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:10.000
mind coming from the town that I grew up

00:32:08.049 --> 00:32:12.039
in even like I'm McDonald's or a Tim

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.429
Hortons being over 24 hours is crazy

00:32:12.039 --> 00:32:17.919
talk right then you know I went to a

00:32:15.429 --> 00:32:19.919
McDonald's at like 3 a.m. and was like I

00:32:17.919 --> 00:32:24.010
never want to see that again

00:32:19.919 --> 00:32:26.679
ok just did it but you get a lot of you

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:28.830
get a very cosmopolitan crowd at a 3

00:32:26.679 --> 00:32:30.970
a.m. McDonald's you get the guy you know

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:35.169
waking up for his night shift to the

00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:37.179
hospital you get a lot of people you

00:32:35.169 --> 00:32:38.860
know just in from the bars or you know

00:32:37.179 --> 00:32:39.340
an after-hours party or something like

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:41.710
that

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:44.230
and then you get people for whom like 3

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:45.610
a.m. it's you know that's that's the

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:48.309
middle of the day for them and that's

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:53.049
the scariest card of all you know the

00:32:48.309 --> 00:32:55.360
nocturnal sort of vampire crowd with no

00:32:53.049 --> 00:32:57.159
substances in their systems just

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.899
willfully at the McDonald's at 3:00 a.m.

00:32:57.159 --> 00:33:01.990
like if I'm at the McDonald's at 3:00

00:32:58.899 --> 00:33:04.210
a.m. something has gone wrong like we

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:06.100
were on a road trip then we got stuck in

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:10.179
traffic for like 7 hours or something

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:11.799
like that or you know we stated we were

00:33:10.179 --> 00:33:15.250
a little come on for one drink we stayed

00:33:11.799 --> 00:33:16.570
out all night that's you know I'm the 28

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:18.909
year old man it doesn't happen to me all

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:21.639
that often anymore something's gone

00:33:18.909 --> 00:33:23.049
terribly wrong the people who plan to be

00:33:21.639 --> 00:33:25.120
in the McDonald's at 3:00 a.m. are the

00:33:23.049 --> 00:33:26.500
ones that really make me feel out of my

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.850
element you know you're and you're

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:31.179
entitled to live your life however you

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:34.510
choose to but I'm like this isn't this

00:33:31.179 --> 00:33:36.460
isn't my scene I'm better off at all

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:37.809
more I've got a 40 point 6 3 percent

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:42.429
chance of getting a deal with the devil

00:33:37.809 --> 00:33:45.100
on any given floor for some reason how

00:33:42.429 --> 00:33:53.100
is it possible that we have high speed

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:55.630
and yet I am so slow like I am actually

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:57.220
not quite a double our earlier speed

00:33:55.630 --> 00:34:01.860
since taking that speed down but like

00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:04.500
not super far away from it and yet

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:08.730
I guess maybe you carry like a slowing

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:10.470
factor with the with one makes you

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:12.570
larger or is it just because we are

00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:15.359
larger it makes me think that we're

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:19.560
going slower I don't know a couple of

00:34:15.359 --> 00:34:22.740
different potential outcomes here the

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:24.359
next dream would be to have enough one

00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:26.520
makes you smaller pills to return us to

00:34:24.359 --> 00:34:35.100
normal size but I'm just going to be

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:36.899
honest I'll see that happening to be

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:40.590
100% honest with you I never should have

00:34:36.899 --> 00:34:43.649
given up the I don't know the name of

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:45.869
the trinket but hairpin whatever it is

00:34:43.649 --> 00:34:47.850
is that the Zap the one that charges

00:34:45.869 --> 00:34:49.770
your spacebar item holding whenever you

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:52.139
walk into a boss fight because it's

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:53.310
really really good when you're rockin

00:34:52.139 --> 00:34:57.679
Book of Revelations and don't

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:57.679
necessarily have you know infinite HP

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:04.850
which I think certainly fits the bill we

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:07.890
find ourselves in right now

00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:13.640
good fight forty point six three percent

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:17.010
chances screwed me angry fly bomb bag

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:21.000
pupula duplex and notched axe they're

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:22.350
all pretty not good but we can at least

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.680
get a move on here remember we don't

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:28.320
have to do boss rush we could do the

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.670
hush fight remember if you do huh she

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:33.200
can't do Sheol and if you do Sheol you

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:35.430
can't do hush so we might just take the

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:41.790
easiest possible way out here as my

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:44.670
thinking that's my expectation of things

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:46.680
at least and this run is good I mean the

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:49.560
last run is good we should have won

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:51.810
easily on that last run just threw away

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.610
a little bit of HP it's not quite the

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:56.280
same situation as the time that I gave

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:58.380
up you know seven spirit arts to a blood

00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:03.140
bank thinking you know I'm King Kong

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:03.140
ain't got nothing on me it's more like

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:13.140
you know we just find ourselves in a a

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:15.690
bad spot here a spot where we had no

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:18.320
insulation from failure I guess is what

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:18.320
I'm getting at

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:25.880
we made a couple of bad mistakes and

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:26.990
then okay I will take it but we made a

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:30.110
couple of mistakes and we didn't have

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:33.850
any like you know what's the word intent

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:33.850
like an emergency fund to protect us

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:38.750
keep using Book of Revelations you're

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:40.640
going to be fine

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:42.290
I don't know if I stomped on that enemy

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:45.430
or the orbital did damage or what but

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:48.460
this floor is all-important because we

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:51.170
will find out if we get our level 4

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:53.840
bandage girl level 4 bandage girl

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:58.010
couldn't care less more more or less

00:36:53.840 --> 00:37:00.040
from a functional standpoint although it

00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:05.530
is better than a level 3 bandage girl

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:05.530
but I'm more what more interested in

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:09.200
possibility of just getting that

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:12.370
achievement knocked out and it looks

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:15.470
like it's going to get knocked out so

00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:16.760
you know I'm very excited about the fact

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:18.650
that we've actually managed to knock out

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:22.010
these achievements ASAP I had to farm

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:23.870
these for like weeks the first time I

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:25.790
came through this is actually just sort

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:27.920
of incredible I'm not going to take a

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:31.760
speed down pill I'll hold it I'm not

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:34.520
going to take it and I'm just going to

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:38.060
level with you the odds of me doing hush

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:41.210
of 0 not near 0 well you know what

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:42.770
they're infinitesimal if I accidentally

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:44.960
walk into the hush fight I'll do it

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:47.060
or if I get so strong that there's no

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:48.680
other you know sensible course of action

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:52.730
I'll do it but I don't want to fight

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:54.860
hush being this large cuz hush you know

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:58.250
it's better if you're a little wily you

00:37:54.860 --> 00:38:00.110
know if you can reliably dodge between

00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:03.170
these shots we're far too large to make

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:05.090
that conceivable dude okay I'll be

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:08.620
honest it was a little bit of a rush job

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:08.620
here but it's getting the job done

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:15.710
turns out this run is like a little

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:17.840
better than expected and yet still like

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:20.240
statistically a lot worse than the last

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:22.190
one in every category except HP you know

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:24.500
what I've been learning throughout these

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:26.810
new save file runs is that HP is

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:33.350
actually more precious than I was giving

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:37.820
a credit for at least on Judas runs yeah

00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:48.460
so wait the cathedrals now open since

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:51.170
when since well did we do the cathedral

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:53.510
they had mine flooded sometimes that

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:55.550
aspect I think we did do the cathedral

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:57.350
or at least had the option to do the

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:59.359
cathedral on our last run that had to

00:38:57.350 --> 00:39:04.340
hush because I'm remembering I think

00:38:59.359 --> 00:39:07.720
that there was the that there was the

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:07.720
beam of light that could take us up

00:39:10.609 --> 00:39:15.799
I might be mistaken but I think that

00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:18.410
that is correct

00:39:15.799 --> 00:39:21.230
either way probably beating Isaac is

00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:23.749
going to give us the win here I don't

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:27.739
think we can see what we can have the

00:39:23.749 --> 00:39:31.099
chest although we this run is capable of

00:39:27.739 --> 00:39:34.309
beating the chest I would as you might

00:39:31.099 --> 00:39:36.140
expect prefer not to okay because I want

00:39:34.309 --> 00:39:41.259
to get this just the hideousness off the

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:44.150
screen here there your speed upgrade

00:39:41.259 --> 00:39:48.890
1.48 speed has me feeling like default

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:51.559
speed normally does you know you're too

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:52.880
large when you walk into a room and the

00:39:51.559 --> 00:39:55.700
only way you know that there's enemies

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:57.380
because the doors are closed it's

00:39:55.700 --> 00:40:00.069
structured like a your mama joke but

00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:02.299
it's actually a yo mama reality I

00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:04.099
actually cover so much of the screen I

00:40:02.299 --> 00:40:06.920
have no idea where enemies are on the

00:40:04.099 --> 00:40:08.509
regulator which is an expression I say

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:14.180
all the time I'm always saying on the

00:40:08.509 --> 00:40:15.470
regular just part of my vernacular fine

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:18.069
it really fits the northernlion

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:18.069
aesthetic

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:27.350
unlike the whole bubble sort tangent now

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:39.300
if you could please just let us go this

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:40.530
has got to be the right path and you'll

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:42.570
forgive me I hope for being a little

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:46.410
eager to get this run in the books first

00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:50.460
off anytime I get a loss I'm eager to

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:52.619
follow it up with a win not necessarily

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:55.830
as quickly as possible but on the the

00:40:52.619 --> 00:40:58.920
next closest run as possible secondly I

00:40:55.830 --> 00:41:00.690
took like 11 1 makes you larger pills

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:04.290
and have compromised my ability to

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:05.910
essentially even play this game at a

00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:15.540
certain level which I feel comfortable

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:17.070
so ah there is I'm a little eager to put

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:18.750
this one in the books get whatever

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:23.040
unlock you get on a note so I'm still

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:24.570
thinking like if unlock I mean the

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:26.280
pentagram I think is a default item what

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:31.670
else you online is Judas may be dark

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:31.670
Judas her Judas a shadow I should say

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:40.800
the mark I think the mark is available

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:42.510
by default as well the oh hi mark

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:44.790
see they said joke away from me by

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:47.700
making it a default item I know you're a

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:50.130
fan of Tommy Wiseau Edmund you betrayed

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:52.350
me yo you can sort of see the shots

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:54.840
through your own face even with one

00:41:52.350 --> 00:42:00.720
makes you larger that's actually really

00:41:54.840 --> 00:42:02.400
nice are we done you ever done if we've

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:06.980
seen this ending if we not know we

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:06.980
haven't I don't know man ok

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:15.420
to be continued

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:17.100
the guillotine disappeared in the

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:19.830
basement now that's not what I expected

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:20.820
but we did get one part of the polaroid

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:21.900
