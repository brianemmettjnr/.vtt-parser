##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.430
everybody welcome back northernlion The

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.109
Binding of Isaac after birth plus I'm

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.800
gonna do the whole video just talking

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.450
like this like I'm a real influencer

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.590
anyway yesterday's daily obviously I'm

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.599
not going to do the whole video talking

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.160
like that so don't call myself an

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.779
influencer unless we're talking about

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.539
influencing the sales of men at work's

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.869
greatest hits album contraband the best

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.670
of men at work 36 - yesterday 0.44

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.310
overall percentile great score died in

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.439
delirium honorable way to go considering

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.829
we push it to the limit to begin with um

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.550
today it's it's like my perfect storm of

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.469
bad runs it is well Kayne I like being

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.100
Kayne 4.20 damage right off the bat

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.800
tremendous however we're only going to

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.430
mom's foot table score today is 49,000

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.020
frontpage goes from 34 to 49,000 I guess

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:58.020
is the obvious way to phrase that um I

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.520
hope that we find a seam but it we

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.660
there's like some best practices I

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.760
haven't been following for finding

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.949
scenes lately for example right off the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.760
bat if we get a teleport card never use

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.939
it never use it until you find the boss

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.950
rush and apart from that I mean you know

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.310
that eihwaz ruin existence you know the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.990
shovel existence aside my friend Corey

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.369
twitch that DV / flack blag about

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.770
dailies and he was like I didn't know

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.990
this he's like top 30 maybe in the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.560
dailies top 50 overall he's got great

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.990
daily scores lots of top-ten finishes

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.780
but he said did you know that the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.420
contents of a deal with the devil can

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.630
change based on when you see the deal

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.710
with the devil so I guess there's like a

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.240
almost like a butterfly effect style

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.159
causality chain that happens like if you

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.170
use the Joker card versus earning a deal

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.970
with the devil naturally it could change

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.009
what you see in that deal with the devil

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.840
based on maybe what you saw throughout

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.430
the rest of the floor like if there was

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.259
another special item for example on the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.869
floor so on the run where I couldn't

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.700
find a seam it was like three dailies

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.369
ago I couldn't seem to find a seam to

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.690
progress past mom's foot he said that he

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.879
found the shovel and his understanding

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.129
of that was that

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.659
the shovels simply existed for him

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.280
whereas it didn't for me but I didn't go

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.739
back and watch that daily as possible

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.599
even plausible that I just actually had

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.069
the chance to get the shovel and totally

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.379
brain farted it wouldn't be the first

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.930
time we're going to try to do a little

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:31.170
bit better than that this time Dingle

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.579
with speed is not bad to fight so we'll

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.250
kill him and we'll save High Priestess

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:39.060
for the inevitable Big Horn fight that

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:43.859
always happens on dailies and Jesus

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.659
juice is quite good as well I just the

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:49.379
only reason I'm bummed by that is

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:52.379
because it's the second fat finger in as

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:55.459
many dailies and that may also screw me

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.299
a little bit when it comes to the

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.629
getting the deal of the devil on the

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.519
next floor well I guess not but if well

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.840
I guess mitten directly it could because

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.209
we could have killed a boss that could

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.230
hit us instantly instead of having to

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.389
actually fight him but you know what

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.069
it's up to us to persevere over what is

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.680
basically the dumbest mistake I've made

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.810
in a long time I got a you know if

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.280
something happens twice I'm still likely

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.500
to think it's a coincidence in this case

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.819
instead of you know something that

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.739
requires immediate attention well I

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.659
don't know is NL's keyboard okay I think

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.939
this is what might happen to my uncle's

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.430
keyboard interface drivers before they

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:32.280
crash completely no it's just poor

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:36.239
placement of the of the hand here so

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.859
it's really up to us to persevere the

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.209
big loss was not so much taking the

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:41.250
damage it was losing the card which

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:46.159
could prevent us from taking damage at a

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.159
more a more dire point in the future

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.840
don't like when the spawners get kind of

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.220
stuck there so our damage is five point

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.509
three one right off the bat here that's

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.879
very very good halo of flies is also

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:04.799
excellent works us towards Beelzebub

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:08.489
which is a little unlikely to manifest

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:10.590
itself too soon but still I will say how

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:14.400
hilarious would be if the right path was

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.440
actually to take damage and why I left

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.380
there um it's the right path was to take

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.380
damage come down here go to the boss

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.940
Trap room and then use the boss Trap

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.080
room you know maybe it gives you like go

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.410
head or something like that and then you

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.380
just

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.230
the run it's plausible maybe a little

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.420
unlikely but but plausible and this is a

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.450
boss fight for which we would have loved

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:40.050
to have had High Priestess to be honest

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:42.180
with you this is a tough one so I think

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.900
the the easiest thing we can do right

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:53.130
now let's take it slow

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:56.310
we've got infinity time all we got to do

00:04:53.130 --> 00:05:03.210
and we've taken damage on this room in

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:05.060
the past with certainty best thing you

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.100
can do just keep moving

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.540
whenever possible try to kill the

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.740
fistula parts when they're over the

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.170
chasms but it looks like we're going to

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.240
survive and honestly this survival comes

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.130
down to and and not just survival but

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.410
like of course getting the deal with the

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:23.610
devil - basically comes down to the fact

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:25.620
that we got five point three one damage

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.400
this early you know what this is a total

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.870
angel run we don't need to beat

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.310
ourselves up over this one I think we're

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.500
fine with our existing trinket and we'll

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.690
just use this and this gives us two

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.700
bombs which is actually amazing it also

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.240
gives the shop access and there's two

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:44.340
luck upgrades in there along with two

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.640
cents to begin with we want to use one

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:50.130
bomb well we'll see what's in this thing

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:57.480
as well but we want to use one bomb

00:05:50.130 --> 00:06:00.330
come on to get the bomb the double bombs

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.860
that are in that other room and then

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:06.090
maybe it doesn't look like any of these

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.710
are likely to necessarily give us coins

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.500
so we don't need to sweat that a loss on

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.810
soo so that's a next floor kind of pick

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:16.380
up I'm going to grab this the ace of

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:18.210
clubs we could use the ace of clubs on

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.770
like I mean we don't want to take

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.510
forever here but we can use basic clubs

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.669
right here there's one extra bomb for us

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:26.700
you never know how important that may or

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:30.060
may not be and then inside of our shops

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.140
there any thing we can get we could buy

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.610
another spear and our we could blow

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:36.090
those guys up and look for something but

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:38.400
I think I'm content where I am should

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:41.520
not give us a secret room but

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.009
Hey two extra pennies and then there's a

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.630
lot of second secret room locations the

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:48.570
last thing I will say is that we could

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:51.780
blow up the mushrooms in the secret room

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:54.449
and look for like magic mush but maybe

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.770
because I've been low on bombs this

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:56.940
whole run I'm like I don't really want

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.639
to do that right now

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:02.009
I just don't really want to do that

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:03.930
right now don't think that's the

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:05.220
direction our run should be taking we

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.169
should be focusing on our strengths

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.389
instead of our weaknesses I don't know

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:11.190
why I'm phrasing it in this voice that

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:13.380
clearly have some kind of connotations

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:16.789
along with it all the one reciting what

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:19.500
appears to be a sound business strategy

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:21.240
really says a lot about me I think that

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.830
this is the voice that I default to when

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:28.560
I want to say something self-righteous

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:32.280
and possibly vapid okay I'm revealing a

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.599
lot about implicit you know emotions

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.070
that even though I had I'm learning a

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:38.160
little bit about myself a lot about

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:40.800
living and a little about loved one

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.620
makes you small is totally fine and some

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.030
of today's daily at large right now we

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.770
have made a decision that will have you

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:48.449
know its own butterfly effect sort of

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.400
repercussions we chose not to take an

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:52.349
item on the deal with the devil and it

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.729
totally extremely very much was not

00:07:52.349 --> 00:07:55.229
because I was worried about picking up a

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:58.340
one heart item walking on the spikes and

00:07:55.229 --> 00:08:00.060
then dying instantly it was because oh

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.919
let's uh maybe we would be getting

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.090
closer to Beelzebub there I'm not sure I

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:05.250
guess a little shove isn't done

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:08.039
Beelzebub enabler so we wouldn't have

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:09.960
Beelzebub yet but infestation should

00:08:08.039 --> 00:08:15.020
count in my opinion I'd like I think it

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:18.030
does count is what I mean well ya know

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:20.789
ideals they can be great I chose to take

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:22.229
I wouldn't even say it's taking the

00:08:20.789 --> 00:08:24.120
conservative approach I actually just

00:08:22.229 --> 00:08:27.990
think in this case it's the sensible

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:29.159
approach because none of the items in

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:31.560
that deal to that will we're good enough

00:08:29.159 --> 00:08:34.620
to justify giving up half of our HP I

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.240
know there's like there's a thought that

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.740
if you don't take every deal with the

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.209
devil item the for when you have the

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.159
opportunity and it gives you precedent

00:08:39.209 --> 00:08:44.459
like you're being a baby about it but I

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:48.240
disagree you know it's a smart decision

00:08:44.459 --> 00:08:50.760
in our case to limit that risk because

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.600
neither the items were that interesting

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:55.529
to be frank

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:58.440
you or that useful so I stand by this

00:08:55.529 --> 00:09:00.120
decision until we get deals with the

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.649
angel they give us absolute garbage at

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.279
which point I no longer stand by this

00:09:01.649 --> 00:09:05.339
decision

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:07.079
and I reserve the right to blame my

00:09:05.339 --> 00:09:08.880
decision on the people who created the

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:10.949
daily instead of taking any degree of

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.800
personal responsibility for it myself as

00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:17.639
is my right as a twitch streamer and

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:20.279
youtuber now by the way you might be

00:09:17.639 --> 00:09:22.410
saying NL your noisy got to get a

00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:24.389
compressor I've seen the comments I've

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:28.199
seen the tweets the reddit posts and

00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:31.019
hell's got to get a compressor they

00:09:28.199 --> 00:09:33.480
always go that they and I'm not saying

00:09:31.019 --> 00:09:35.490
that the criticism is invalid at all but

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.990
in my head I'm still a do to my

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.149
underwear whoo cords videos in his

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:41.399
office that is about the size of a shoe

00:09:39.149 --> 00:09:43.620
closet because that's I mean literally

00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:45.899
the depiction of a pound living right

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:47.699
now but they always go like it's

00:09:45.899 --> 00:09:48.990
unbelievable that is his business and

00:09:47.699 --> 00:09:50.639
this is the way you treat this customers

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:53.699
not like you know what you're right but

00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:55.470
it hurts to hear because it's like I I'm

00:09:53.699 --> 00:09:57.300
the kind of person who I can spend like

00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:00.720
infinity hours making content but if I

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:02.339
gotta fix one little sub optimization

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.310
about it it's like all it's pulling

00:10:02.339 --> 00:10:10.199
teeth man like I can't deal with it for

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:14.329
some reason it's like selective ADHD not

00:10:10.199 --> 00:10:17.250
to you know take sympathy for having a

00:10:14.329 --> 00:10:21.029
disorder I don't necessarily have but

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:25.170
give me the spirit are near we do ok I'm

00:10:21.029 --> 00:10:29.490
going to go back to the cursor right now

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:31.560
then but yeah it said I'm recording

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:33.240
these OBS OBS has a software based

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.100
compression for the microphone that

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.269
means when I yell really loudly it

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:40.649
shouldn't make your ears bleed anymore

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:44.650
however it makes if you can only take

00:10:40.649 --> 00:10:46.940
one what do you take Holy Grail

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:50.940
[Music]

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:54.600
wafers great but Holy Grail for the HP

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:57.120
and to be able to fly I think is our go

00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:00.630
here why that over dead dove I value the

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:03.390
HP more than I valued the spectral tears

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.710
that's the easy answer there anyway so

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.670
the compressor is not on right now you

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:06.390
might be saying I don't notice a

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.800
difference that's because the

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:11.700
compressors not on because it made my

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:13.320
hole every time I talked a bit I wasn't

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:15.420
yelling it made me sound like kind of an

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.940
old-time radio announcer and not even in

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:23.430
the cool like you know fallout sort of

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:25.770
way so I need to I need to find some

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:27.480
better settings for that compressor but

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:30.420
rest assured you know a change is going

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:34.110
to come either way my change came like

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:37.590
Sam Cooke it's a Kanye West I think

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:43.170
that's we major it is we major of course

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:45.660
it's we major now wouldn't mind picking

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:47.160
up a little extra damage here we're not

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.450
going to get it from the angel obviously

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.150
you got to fight the angel statue either

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:54.270
way gives you better angel chances in

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:56.340
the future for one we're gonna be like

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:58.860
less than a minute and a half I'm

00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:00.450
scheduled it's not enough to cry about

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.430
but it is enough to maybe start to get a

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:03.510
little worried other people might have

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.980
made a different decision there and I

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:07.890
can understand a decision being made to

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:09.650
take to take the wafer I can even

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:12.690
understand a decision being made to take

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:16.160
we would what's the point I can

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:18.870
understand a decision being made to take

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:25.290
dead dove although I very much disagree

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:26.580
with a dead dove choice really hoping

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:32.520
that was going to blow up in his face

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:34.680
oh come on so what do I want from the

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:36.420
boss honestly I want chaos not from the

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:39.600
boss because that's not possible but I

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:42.780
want I want chaos from the shop whenever

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:44.310
we can afford it because we need to

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:46.920
stack up damage if we're going to make

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:50.670
boss rush and we are not looking like

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:52.740
that's too freaking likely right now

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:54.120
because deals of the angel are lower on

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.649
damage to be given no matter how much

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:58.410
you like deals with the angel you have

00:12:55.649 --> 00:13:01.200
to admit the high damage items tends to

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:03.180
be clustered on the deal with the devil

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:06.870
the oh the Angels got a couple great

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:08.519
ones do not get me wrong dude did you

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:10.470
just save my life right there we got

00:13:08.519 --> 00:13:12.510
three point five zero damage up I'm an

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:18.060
extremely happy camper and I'm moving

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:19.970
along here still looking for guppy items

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:22.649
tears ups whatever I can get

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:26.100
speed up okay what makes you small not

00:13:22.649 --> 00:13:27.630
against it we have no chance at an

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.220
arcade here which honestly is kind of an

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:30.450
oversight on my part I spent more money

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.399
than was necessary and we could have

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:34.019
used ace of diamonds to create one more

00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:37.110
penny to give us an arcade chance but

00:13:34.019 --> 00:13:39.329
the other thing I will say is it was

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:40.709
unintentional but maybe it's for the

00:13:39.329 --> 00:13:43.950
best because we don't really have time

00:13:40.709 --> 00:13:45.959
to be messing about with the deal with

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:47.730
the devil or a blood bank shenanigans

00:13:45.959 --> 00:13:49.589
right now or any arcade shenanigans for

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.470
that matter being is behind schedule as

00:13:49.589 --> 00:13:53.730
we are we just want to make sure that

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:55.529
it's weird to say because last round it

00:13:53.730 --> 00:14:01.790
was like the exact opposite but on this

00:13:55.529 --> 00:14:04.410
run the correct course of action is to

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:06.630
take the safe way out by going to boss

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:09.209
rush boss rush is a safe way for us to

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:10.949
give points and ensure that we got a

00:14:09.209 --> 00:14:13.019
chance to do okay on the rankings today

00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:16.190
dude I actually hate that enemy stop

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:19.800
that what are you doing get some help

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:21.390
okay two items here if we can be out of

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:25.560
here by 14 minutes which i think is

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:27.570
fairly fast still we should have a good

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.459
shot here and you know another deal with

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:31.350
the angel wouldn't kick it out of bed

00:14:29.459 --> 00:14:32.010
for eating crackers I don't think I want

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:35.010
lard

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:36.810
I think lard I finally graduated out of

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:39.149
the training wheels lard is a training

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:40.860
wheels item sometimes you're still going

00:14:39.149 --> 00:14:43.260
to want it I mean if I was biking on the

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:44.790
Nurburgring I'd want training wheels see

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.910
this is where the metaphor falls apart

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:50.779
much like a bike that hasn't been

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:53.279
fastened in okay you get the idea I

00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:55.680
don't need training wheels on this run

00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:59.279
anymore we don't need 5 HP 4 is enough

00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:01.260
and the speed downgrade is way more cost

00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:02.610
than it's worth at this point so we can

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.120
blow that guy up for a little extra

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.290
money

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:07.920
we do have Steam sale

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:09.839
we did get the money which is nice so

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.399
we're looking for a higher-quality item

00:15:09.839 --> 00:15:14.880
I don't think the maps quite good enough

00:15:11.399 --> 00:15:18.690
but it's close I'll take a random shop

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:20.279
item instead which is idiotic but we

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:22.709
didn't have anything better to replace

00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:26.040
it why do I say it's idiotic well I mean

00:15:22.709 --> 00:15:29.160
it worked out for us but why would we

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:31.350
ever with a reroll machine take a random

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:34.980
item instead of reroll into an item that

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:37.470
we could actually know about it's a

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:39.060
valid question really makes you think we

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:41.759
should have kept a bomb so we could blow

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:43.139
up an angel statue as well but truth be

00:15:41.759 --> 00:15:45.269
told this actually worked out very well

00:15:43.139 --> 00:15:47.910
better than it had me right - because we

00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:49.339
have swallowed penny which is actually

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:51.000
crooked penny now and crooked penny is

00:15:49.339 --> 00:15:52.860
potentially worth a lot of points

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.990
potentially worth a couple of good items

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:56.519
if we can get the charges to work for us

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:59.130
properly we don't need to pick that up

00:15:56.519 --> 00:16:01.589
yet and I think it's pretty clear 14

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:03.690
minutes is not going to happen and that

00:16:01.589 --> 00:16:06.060
just highlights that 14 minutes was kind

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:10.470
of an idiotic estimation that's why you

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:11.970
make estimates it's not called you know

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.500
an accurate prediction of what's going

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:16.649
to happen it's an estimate it's the best

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:19.760
guess it's an approximation of you know

00:16:16.649 --> 00:16:19.760
you're educated guess

00:16:20.149 --> 00:16:25.440
14:30 is not too bad we do have a deal

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:29.069
with the angel I'm not going to try to

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:30.420
double toothpicks it's too good I think

00:16:29.069 --> 00:16:32.730
you just take Holy Light Holy Light

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:38.639
which is good enough don't mess with it

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:40.620
and now we're still on this grind of

00:16:38.639 --> 00:16:42.899
trying to make it to boss rush but we

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:46.680
are good enough to survive boss rush now

00:16:42.899 --> 00:16:48.839
and really like if I can to my own horn

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:51.329
a little bit here at least we didn't let

00:16:48.839 --> 00:16:53.250
ourselves get beaten down by that

00:16:51.329 --> 00:16:55.589
terrible terrible High Priestess player

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:59.010
Lee it's literally the faith is praise I

00:16:55.589 --> 00:17:02.370
can damn myself with but we didn't just

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:04.110
completely capitulate when I made one

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:08.459
bad play and you know what it's nice

00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:09.839
doesn't always happen but if you'll

00:17:08.459 --> 00:17:11.220
allow me I'm going to pump my own tires

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:13.740
a little bit here because the whole

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:16.559
point of this is so I'm confident enough

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:17.939
to make it into and through boss rush

00:17:16.559 --> 00:17:20.699
and hopefully find a way to get an

00:17:17.939 --> 00:17:23.819
extra steam which one must exist there

00:17:20.699 --> 00:17:26.610
must be a seam because there are people

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:28.169
here with nearly 50,000 points even if

00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:33.320
you have 30,000 points that means you

00:17:28.169 --> 00:17:36.179
made it past you made it past boss rush

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.919
you might not have done boss rush but

00:17:36.179 --> 00:17:40.320
you probably did if I'm being 100%

00:17:37.919 --> 00:17:41.340
honest so we're really at the point we

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:46.769
got to be in there in the next five

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:50.220
minutes so we better look for four good

00:17:46.769 --> 00:17:51.870
opportunities to get the the heck out of

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:57.240
Dodge we could play a self sacrifice

00:17:51.870 --> 00:18:03.600
room that's one way out as well sure I

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:06.240
don't know about a judgement I sort of

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.559
don't really fathom how we would use

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.789
this to get a teleport car but just

00:18:07.559 --> 00:18:10.740
because it wouldn't give us a teleport

00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:13.259
card doesn't necessarily mean it's not

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:15.330
great it's easiest decision of my life

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:19.129
and then you just buy another humbling

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:19.129
bundle for reasons unbeknownst to me but

00:18:20.629 --> 00:18:24.450
okay we don't need the money well we

00:18:23.159 --> 00:18:25.830
might need the money eventually but we

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:27.000
don't need the money right now we got a

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:28.950
humbling bundle anyway that's the

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.269
important part seven cents for

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:34.080
everything out of that shop is a pretty

00:18:30.269 --> 00:18:38.279
solid deal and we are gone

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:40.529
and we're gone in a timely enough

00:18:38.279 --> 00:18:42.720
fashion that I actually am you could

00:18:40.529 --> 00:18:45.750
almost accuse me of being on schedule

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:47.789
which is amazing I think oh this is it

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:52.139
this is our opportunity to pop econo

00:18:47.789 --> 00:18:55.950
just get it out of the system her throat

00:18:52.139 --> 00:18:58.559
her throat algae's a was okay he's done

00:18:55.950 --> 00:19:00.450
it so this is just what you take sure we

00:18:58.559 --> 00:19:03.149
could take perthro for now but i'm you

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:05.580
notice like the the rate of my speech

00:19:03.149 --> 00:19:08.909
correlates to how panicked i feel about

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:11.399
the boss rush timeline on our run so I

00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:12.960
meant like like a seven concerned right

00:19:11.399 --> 00:19:16.409
now because we got the tools we just

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:18.720
need to make it work now okay we're down

00:19:16.409 --> 00:19:22.529
to the next floor we're in a lovely

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:25.019
position definitely we'll be checking

00:19:22.529 --> 00:19:27.990
this out well we got the chance you know

00:19:25.019 --> 00:19:30.600
what you're you're a rascal that's what

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:32.809
you are but I'm going to give it a shot

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.809
regardless

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:42.690
okay we got it

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:45.390
speedball probably like nearly useless

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:47.340
but might have paid for the time it took

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:49.140
to get it on this floor at least we

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:50.250
don't need doctors remote just say

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.680
goodbye to but I don't even pick the

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:54.800
items up anymore I see a self-sacrifice

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:56.820
room and the self sacrifice room is very

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.350
interesting but in a waz rune means

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:01.260
we're precluded from using that self

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:02.790
sacrifice room at least for now what

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.680
we're looking for now is honestly a

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:07.520
blank card from the shop being able to

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:10.020
use blank card a waz is more valuable

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:11.460
than just having one a waz and it's more

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:14.280
valuable than the cricket penny as well

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:15.420
and this is what I'd love about Daly's

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:19.110
even though you might be a little

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:21.270
cynical about that sure looking for a

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:23.130
theme is really lame when you don't find

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:24.750
one it feels like you had a decent daily

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:27.980
ripped out from under you but when you

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:31.380
find it it's like that positive

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:34.440
serotonin release of a plan gone right

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:36.270
like you organized around the principle

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:38.130
and that principle came true and it

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:39.810
makes you feel like a dang genius even

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:41.430
though it's pretty much preordained to

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:45.000
happen by the existence of the run to

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:46.320
begin with so we're still looking for

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.080
our shop we should be able to beat mom

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:58.140
in a timely fashion so I'm not sweating

00:20:49.080 --> 00:21:01.050
the time right now - too much it's a

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:03.780
long trip back to the shop and in order

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:04.830
to get the know we have steam sale

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:06.540
disregard I was going to say in order to

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:10.760
get blank card if it even exists we have

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:10.760
to use a crooked penny but we don't

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:19.429
we got more luck upgrades out of that

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:23.359
that's stupid and hilarious okay Francis

00:21:19.429 --> 00:21:24.440
I mean we there's battery charges so

00:21:23.359 --> 00:21:26.119
yeah that's what I was thinking we might

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:28.869
as well try to double it didn't work out

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:32.480
life goes on we got a minute to beat mom

00:21:28.869 --> 00:21:34.429
we could probably beat her fast enough

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:36.379
to also chance a deal with the devil or

00:21:34.429 --> 00:21:39.200
angel for that matter and I have

00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:42.619
something good happen but we'll see

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:46.340
we'll see we'll see we'll see okay mom

00:21:42.619 --> 00:21:48.580
fight it's a big moment for us boss rush

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:50.929
is of the utmost importance

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:53.330
don't freak out just yet but you got to

00:21:50.929 --> 00:21:55.070
go a little faster I think that's what

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:57.109
we needed a holy light shot to land on

00:21:55.070 --> 00:22:01.429
the foot or on any segment where she

00:21:57.109 --> 00:22:07.159
takes consistent damage come on come on

00:22:01.429 --> 00:22:12.049
come on we got this easy money

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:19.039
no Krampus please I think it's worth the

00:22:12.049 --> 00:22:21.499
check should try it for the free item

00:22:19.039 --> 00:22:29.179
maybe but if you lose it you lose it

00:22:21.499 --> 00:22:31.879
that's the problem you got it you had to

00:22:29.179 --> 00:22:35.119
look I'm sorry you had to look take the

00:22:31.879 --> 00:22:39.669
Polaroid take these get in here and

00:22:35.119 --> 00:22:39.669
lucky blood is a beautiful item

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:52.100
I will say all that mean that was I will

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:55.180
say I'm not using crooked penny in a way

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:57.200
that you probably find that interesting

00:22:55.180 --> 00:23:01.250
remember you can't just forget penny the

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:02.930
double opens chest anymore so you can

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:07.660
use it on occasion to try to get some

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:10.280
doublings of of consumables if we'd like

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:12.050
lofty blood is I mean we're probably at

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:16.480
the damage cap for it but that's fine

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:19.970
the real value in in crooked penny is in

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:21.860
the second doubling because you know

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:23.870
there's a 50% chance I mean this is a

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:26.870
this is ignorant of statistics but give

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:28.790
me a chance here there's a 50% chance

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:32.030
the first doubling fails so if you have

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:33.590
a spirit heart 50% of the time you're

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:34.940
going to have zero spirit hearts of use

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:37.310
crooked penny 50% of the time you're

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:40.430
gonna have to the Eevee stays the same

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:44.150
but that second doubling can give you

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:46.040
four spirit hearts now 50% of the time

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:50.360
you're going to lose to 50% of the time

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:52.340
you're going to have four but still for

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:56.120
some reason despite the fact that if

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:58.880
that principle of like I'm just smart

00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:01.040
enough to know how dumb I am like my my

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:05.690
animal brain is like the second doubling

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:07.520
is the most important one my my human I

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:11.210
know humans are animals okay you're very

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:13.160
intelligent I promise you this but my

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:20.180
higher-order functions are like you're

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:22.100
an idiot but I'm still like but it's

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.300
like you know there's only two options

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:28.970
you can win the lottery or lose the

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:33.800
lottery it's a 50/50 chance for damage

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:35.680
very very poor damage there but it's

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:38.750
okay will persevere I think the actual

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:43.250
the real way that you should approach it

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:45.230
is if you don't need oh brain come on

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:48.020
you led me down this one if you don't

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:50.060
need spirit arts for survival why not

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.260
shoot for the moon if you need spirit

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.880
arts for survival you should probably

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:55.640
pick up every single one that shows up

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:56.980
because a loss matters that much more

00:24:55.640 --> 00:25:03.280
like a loss of the spirit

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:06.070
matters that much more as much as it

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:07.150
pains me to admit the real like here's

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:13.450
the way I'm looking at this right now is

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:15.549
that it's possible that we may be unable

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:18.100
to hit the scene we want to hit because

00:25:15.549 --> 00:25:19.929
it may require a self-sacrifice room we

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.760
don't necessarily have a ton of HP with

00:25:19.929 --> 00:25:25.630
which to be making a self sacrifice room

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:30.600
work right now so it might have been the

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:33.340
best choice of action to try to double

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:35.230
relic and Holy Light just so that we

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:36.700
could pick up I mean in that case we

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:38.110
would pick up two relics for the extra

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:43.179
spirit hearts and one Holy Light cos

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:45.010
holy light doesn't stack but the danger

00:25:43.179 --> 00:25:46.480
of that is if it had failed we probably

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:48.700
wouldn't have even made boss rush so

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:51.520
that's why I that's why I took the again

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:54.429
with a sensible approach there but that

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:57.040
sensible approach becomes less sensible

00:25:54.429 --> 00:25:59.410
in a situation like this where it's

00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:01.480
possible it might hurt us we just need a

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:02.380
couple more spirit out stairs to seize

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:08.890
the day here

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:13.210
carpe diem means a fish hospital carpe

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:16.049
diem sliding into those carpe diem is

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:22.120
like you can do it hmm

00:26:16.049 --> 00:26:27.790
the black hole uh we do not care thank

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:30.309
God it's a legitimate eihwaz rune now

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:32.500
it's all about self sacrifices I'm like

00:26:30.309 --> 00:26:37.799
3,000 points below where I'd like to be

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:42.790
and that is pretty huge bummer so I

00:26:37.799 --> 00:26:45.309
would do we know this know if we could

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:47.049
get a self-sacrifice your mother's floor

00:26:45.309 --> 00:26:49.150
that's fine by me I'd like some spirit

00:26:47.049 --> 00:26:50.440
arts to maybe make it pop otherwise

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:53.290
we're going to be in a pretty dicey

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:54.910
situation where we like 150 percent need

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:57.580
the spirit hearts from the self

00:26:54.910 --> 00:27:00.400
sacrifice room the finance the endeavor

00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:03.160
here the other opportunity is haggle

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:05.169
eyes room we got to get out of this

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:07.210
floor though like there's there's a

00:27:05.169 --> 00:27:10.080
trophy at the end of this floor I think

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:10.080
it's worth going for

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:17.010
okay rarely does that work but I still

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:18.750
think you try what I mean by that is

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:23.010
that there's no trapdoor here

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:25.830
we can't just live for the next two

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:30.020
floors as if we're fine we have to as

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:30.020
quickly as possible find our way out

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:38.760
which typically at this point the high

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:41.280
percentage is a self-sacrifice room the

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:45.870
more likely we are to bring that to

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:51.059
fruition the better we could also just

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:52.380
pick up infinity consumables we have

00:27:51.059 --> 00:27:54.000
taken the deal with the devil item now

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.050
so if we get super lucky we might be

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.580
able to get like a shovel

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:59.730
we've got a couple of cracks of the

00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:03.330
shovel actually so be a great time to be

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:05.670
bailed out that's not the shovel and I

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:08.010
almost walked into the trophy neither of

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:10.620
these are the shovel however I think you

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:12.870
definitely take that and then we save

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:17.309
our HP in case we need it like

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:19.320
immediately to go to a I had sincere

00:28:17.309 --> 00:28:21.090
apologies because we should have at

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.110
least tried to double little brimstone

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:23.550
if we didn't want a little broom we

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:26.610
should have tried to double it because

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:28.500
what's the worst case scenario you don't

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:33.179
get it but you get a penny out of it

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:35.400
it's actually like a win-win so that was

00:28:33.179 --> 00:28:43.300
that was a weak play for having crooked

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:47.870
penny and I admit that readily sure

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:49.400
so we have at least two items if any of

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:50.930
these other ones have items they might

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.250
we should take the sacks right off the

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:55.400
bat because we might get super lucky

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:56.990
with those if any of these other ones

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:59.390
were preordained to have items they will

00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:04.660
continue to have items so be lucky for

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:04.660
us that's going to be a lot of money

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:17.270
it's worth something to spirit hearts

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:18.830
I'll live with it that's probably going

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:21.680
to be our third and fourth spirit are

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:26.210
not just third still though okay that's

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:29.270
going to be another one let's just a

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:30.950
freaking spider dude bad luck we didn't

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:32.660
quite get the consumable bonus I was

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:35.380
hoping for there if I'm being honest I

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:39.710
was hoping being like 24,000 maybe

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:41.920
mildly unrealistic so I think you start

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:47.150
to panic a little bit here

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:48.920
you lost start to panic a little bit

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:50.780
here and go alright how do we get out of

00:29:48.920 --> 00:30:00.830
this one would be maybe stars into a

00:29:50.780 --> 00:30:03.170
narrow room barring that curse room here

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:06.980
maybe secret room into the curse room I

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:08.330
mean know so then we choose whether or

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:11.500
not we want to go into the curse room I

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:11.500
think we're probably going to want to

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:19.580
death to his spades maybe we should have

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.990
tried to double to a spades but I think

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:23.480
I've established on this run that I'm

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:24.830
I'm a wittle baby who does in life and

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.990
who's cuckoo penny I do like to use

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:29.420
crooked penny I'm just you know I'm

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:32.260
shaking off the boss rush adrenaline

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:37.100
that had me playing fast and loose and

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:38.660
I'm feeling the burn a little bit yeah I

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:44.240
was going to say there's no self

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:45.770
sacrifice room here just cannot exist we

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.300
also probably should have tried to

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:48.860
double the eihwaz room now that I think

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.420
about it I would have given us two and

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:52.670
maybe given us the ability to get to a

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:54.140
self-sacrifice room and this is an awful

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:55.360
moment because all of a sudden

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:57.160
everything is becoming

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:58.929
for me of course you should have gone to

00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:00.549
the second or you should have tried to

00:30:58.929 --> 00:31:03.309
double the eihwaz room to make it to a

00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:05.799
less ruins it's a daily it's not just

00:31:03.309 --> 00:31:10.299
like well you got screwed here like live

00:31:05.799 --> 00:31:12.730
with it like you actually fairly easily

00:31:10.299 --> 00:31:14.820
miss the chance of the seam now it might

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:16.809
have turned the eihwaz room into junk

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:17.980
how maybe you shouldn't have tried to

00:31:16.809 --> 00:31:23.140
double the a washer now that I think

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:26.710
about it because if you just used that's

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:32.530
such a bad bomb if you would use the

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:34.270
eihwaz rune that gives you a guaranteed

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:35.679
or at least like a 90% chance of going

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:37.450
down to the womb one as long as it's not

00:31:35.679 --> 00:31:39.250
a crawlspace so you go down to the womb

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:41.380
one you get some guaranteed points hope

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:46.450
for a self-sacrifice room if you try to

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:48.250
double it you get a 50% chance of being

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:49.780
able to get that second one but if you

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:51.160
don't get the first slide you definitely

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:53.770
look like an idiot I don't know it's

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:55.299
close I didn't from an honest appraisal

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:57.669
sort of situation I think this one feels

00:31:55.299 --> 00:32:00.700
like a judgment call but we still ranked

00:31:57.669 --> 00:32:01.960
okay but I'm regretful because I should

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:04.299
have shot for the moon but I didn't

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:05.440
anyway and I'm paying the price thanks
