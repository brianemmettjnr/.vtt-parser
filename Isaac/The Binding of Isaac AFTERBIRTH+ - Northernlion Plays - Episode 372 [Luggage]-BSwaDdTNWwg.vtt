00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.540
everybody welcome anchor on the line

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.009
please binding of issac after birth plus

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.170
where I continue to go to the wrong

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.550
savefile remembering that we are doing

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.990
new save files now star is boss Russia

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.639
we haven't done anything at Samson so

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.550
that's first priority the start is boss

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.800
rush as well which is on the list for us

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.699
we I think I'm gonna unlock I don't know

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.500
what I think I'm going to go through

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.039
puberty again as I say that I think I'm

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.099
gonna go click and gonna unlock of the

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.599
lost last if possible well second last

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.630
is you gotta do the keeper nonsense as

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.430
well but um we got like so much on the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.219
to-do list still don't forget about

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.790
greed mode probably should not have used

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.460
that but let's be honest who cares right

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.070
make a minor mistake the first you know

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.230
opening two seconds of a Samson run in

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.910
which you've already gotten a really

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.000
really good spacebar item combined with

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.500
the fact that there's a little extra HP

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.670
involved as well I think we're in a

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:04.680
relatively safe spot right now it's been

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.840
going pretty well honestly I'm feeling

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.490
slightly rejuvenated by the new save

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.420
file people seem interested in it that's

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.240
nice for me to be honest with you Isaac

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.340
is like I mean there's another analogy

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.960
people use for this but people use this

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.240
analogy for I should say when Isaac is

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.369
kind of like pizza you know even when

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.869
it's bad it's pretty good except for

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.549
those episodes which are horrible those

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.740
are some kind of abomination like you

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.210
find on Survivor like you know we're

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.840
going to feed you a pizza but the crust

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.490
is made out of you know your family you

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.750
know it's maybe a little bit on the dark

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.110
side for what I should have done here

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.390
but anyway about any pizza that's not a

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.799
joke pizza and I'm not talking about a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.240
joke pizza like a people that has

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.640
cucumber honor to some time talking

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.409
about joke pizza like it's a challenge

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.540
like we blended the ingredients of it

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.220
see the analogy is not holding up that

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.930
well right now but even when Isaac's bad

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.250
I have a fun time plain is what I'm

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.560
trying to get at so the fact that it's

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.149
more enjoyable to other people is good

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.250
because I'm somewhat tone-deaf to that

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.799
sort of that way of thinking about

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.799
things I'm always like on the baseline

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.959
you know sometimes people they accuse me

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.640
of not being excitable and that's the

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.580
case

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.140
I'm definitely not at least in anything

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.800
but battlegrounds I'm not the kind of

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.480
youtuber who's like I actually like my

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.069
instinct is to get quieter here but I

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.500
want to shout and be like oh my good you

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.360
freaking killing who this freakin Hicker

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.100
you know that's not the kind of guy I am

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.870
that's the sort of stuff you like

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.840
watching nothing wrong with it you know

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.560
I am friends with a lot of people who do

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.360
have that style and masking uh not

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.989
necessarily true I watched someone

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.810
madness videos sometimes when I've got

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.220
nothing better to do and you know the

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.489
point is this isn't a video about

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.980
mattress because who cares good boy

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:55.820
I'm sorry okay Hogan is not that

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.860
excitable but it's not because I'm like

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.019
dead on the inside that might surprise

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.930
you I actually I'm just did like a

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.470
relatively baseline like seven out of

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.280
ten enjoyment with life to begin with

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.330
genuinely when people are like what do

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.310
you want to do I'm like I don't know

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.950
what do you want to do they think I'm

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.780
deflecting the question but actually you

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.420
know other people have strong

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.640
preferences about the ways that they

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.670
want to spend their leisure time for the

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.079
most part I'm relatively like copacetic

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.090
you know you want to go to the copy shop

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.070
sure let's go you want to go see a movie

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.930
sure I mean I don't really want to see

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.549
that but I'll give it a try

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.410
yeah what's okay I had a good time of

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:37.340
the theater it's in a nice comfy chair

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.590
in the air-conditioned environment so I

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.930
find myself that like manufacture a

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.790
certain level of like intense sometimes

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.040
people will be allowing me it happens

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.890
all the time in the release of the

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.870
relationship shuffle which is you know

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.180
where do you want to eat happening from

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.829
time to time where do you want to eat I

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.910
don't know where do you want to eat it's

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.530
gotten to the point where I just have to

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.350
make something up I really don't care

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.110
where I eat anytime I get food I'm a

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.230
happy camper so even though I'm paying

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.480
for it I'm still a happy camper for

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.980
whatever reason but so now I have to

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.350
make something up be like what do you

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:17.780
want to eat let's say a Mexican nah okay

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:20.900
Japanese not okay what do you want to

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.389
eat Thai there we go it's just that step

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.759
one of the necessary interaction

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:28.939
towards figuring out where we where we

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.319
eat I'm assuming everybody out there

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:36.860
knows what I'm talking about it's a very

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:38.509
common situation I'm like except when it

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.539
comes to skydiving and rollercoasters

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:43.009
I'm a real life yes-man you know the

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.449
movie with Jim Carrey that everybody

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:45.710
tells me is pretty good but I don't

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:47.449
think it's very good because I watched

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.900
it when I was 21 years old not when I

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.729
was 14 at least when it comes to

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.370
restaurants I'm a yes man you want to go

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:57.529
eat it's a straight-up

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.800
real restaurant in Vancouver you want to

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:03.020
go eat at Harambee the West African

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.930
restaurant dude let's give it a try I've

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.870
never eaten it let's give it a shot I've

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.029
never eaten ghanian cuisine you want to

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.550
go eating McDonald's okay I didn't have

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:15.800
a yesterday let's give it a shot

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:19.729
probably not the best habit but you know

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:23.199
what looks son treat yourself the

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:25.939
chicken McNuggets Mel is unbelievable

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:28.039
intoxicating an aphrodisiac aphrodisiac

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:31.909
achill it's probably not the real word

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:33.949
I don't think McNuggets aphrodisiac

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:37.669
can't get cake cake cake you wanna know

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:39.680
burn now it's a song by Billy Joel I

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.919
mean please don't sue me for all of my

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.229
money anyway I don't even know what I'm

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:46.550
talking about at this point but I'm

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.589
assuming that there are people out there

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.360
who share this with me basically any

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:52.069
time I go out to a restaurant I'm pretty

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.860
happy dude unless it takes like you know

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:56.659
70 minutes for my food to arrive but I

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.009
feel like I've got a necessary step in

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:59.509
the chain of figuring out where to eat

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:01.129
which is suggesting a place that is

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:04.159
either accepted or denied and then

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:05.509
working from there so we also do not

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:09.770
want to become dark Judas but I'm super

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:11.089
stoked to have gimpy at least and we

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.649
should go play the blood bank some more

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:14.870
because an IV bag might even be a better

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:18.620
call than a Book of Revelations although

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:20.149
now that I think about it we want a book

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.589
of revelations because there's a chance

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:23.120
to get a fourth level meat boy which is

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:24.740
actually an achievement and an

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:30.080
achievement that took me an awful long

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:31.849
time to get yeah we do not want IV bag

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.970
well we I mean we sort of want it but we

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:36.110
don't want to

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.819
we don't want to give up what is a

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.669
pretty good chance to get a fourth level

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:42.110
meat boy I can't remember if you need a

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:43.250
fourth level bandage girl as well but I

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:50.180
suppose we'll find out

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:53.300
I do have strong preferences for movies

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.699
out that was AI was a false dilemma

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.560
their fall situation that I created

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:59.780
there when I said that you know let's go

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.520
to the movie theater and see something I

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.009
don't want to see that's where I get a

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.930
little I wouldn't say snobby but you

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:09.320
could not and I'm not trying to insult

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:12.699
anybody I would rather do now I would

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:14.660
rather like talk to the bank about

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:16.820
something then go see the new

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.740
Transformers movie you would you have

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:22.310
nothing you would have to pay me but it

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.810
would have to be like an unusual

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.789
situation to get me to see the new

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.470
Transformers movie it's not because I

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:29.389
think I'm better than the Transformers

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:32.509
films because I know I'm better than the

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:35.900
Transformers films and you should be too

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:37.610
I know what you think it NL the first

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.380
one is not that bad and I know you're

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.970
thinking that I'm about to say it is

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.130
that bad but no you're right the first

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:47.419
one although I did not enjoy it was not

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:53.479
insulting I saw the second one in

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:55.130
theaters on a whim and basically did any

00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:57.469
good will I also saw the first one it

00:07:55.130 --> 00:08:00.889
appears in a doubleheader with that and

00:07:57.469 --> 00:08:06.530
live free or die hard of landmark July

00:08:00.889 --> 00:08:10.460
at the multiplex is in 2007 the second

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:11.810
one I think is insulting and I know it's

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.340
playing in theaters right now I'm so

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:17.000
happy that although it's still like

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:19.009
popular it's not nearly the juggernaut

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.139
that it used to be instead you four also

00:08:19.009 --> 00:08:22.610
talked about you know superhero movie

00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:24.469
fatigue I'm not going to go through yet

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:26.840
another video talking about superhero

00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:29.810
movies here but at least those

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.820
predominantly are good say me sure yeah

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:33.560
but you know you got to accept number

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.570
one movie at the multiplex probably is

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.159
rarely going to be like anomaly sub by

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.719
Charlie Kaufman you know I can get down

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:40.700
with that stuff as well but in terms of

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:42.519
like summer films at least we've had a

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:45.980
pretty good track record recently

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:47.600
but again I digress what do we got going

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.699
on in here curse of the tower

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.740
how about curse of the No thank you

00:08:49.699 --> 00:08:56.180
still got to be polite even when we're

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:59.110
rebuking items PhD is lovely and it came

00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:01.730
with a bad gas and something's wrong

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:03.649
there's one thing that annoys me about

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:05.180
that some of the updates that have

00:09:03.649 --> 00:09:07.759
happened Isaac I'm glad that the game

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:11.629
has been updated the dilution of the

00:09:07.759 --> 00:09:14.689
pill rotation is annoying to me just

00:09:11.629 --> 00:09:16.699
from a design standpoint I hate that

00:09:14.689 --> 00:09:18.589
there are so many pills that do

00:09:16.699 --> 00:09:19.189
basically nothing retro vision does

00:09:18.589 --> 00:09:21.319
nothing

00:09:19.189 --> 00:09:22.970
something's wrong does nothing ex lacks

00:09:21.319 --> 00:09:26.660
does nothing I know that they do

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:28.069
something but like you know it's like

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:30.829
when your mom goes what are you doing

00:09:28.069 --> 00:09:32.449
and you go nothing how would you feel if

00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:35.420
she came back and was like actually your

00:09:32.449 --> 00:09:39.079
respiring right now you're metabolizing

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:40.939
right now you know like from from a

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:43.279
functional meaningful standpoint we're

00:09:40.939 --> 00:09:45.500
doing nothing and mom you're being

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:47.060
pedantic I mean try to have a

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.399
conversation with you here and you're

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:54.410
coming over the top with this nonsense

00:09:49.399 --> 00:09:56.630
about metabolizing you know I thought we

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:59.810
were on the level here second level meat

00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:01.370
boy of course the run is great so far

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:03.319
not great enough to be happy about

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:05.089
taking ghost baby but we're ahead of

00:10:03.319 --> 00:10:12.410
schedule boss rush is something we could

00:10:05.089 --> 00:10:15.019
knock out and really like what it comes

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:17.500
down to my friends is that everything's

00:10:15.019 --> 00:10:19.810
gonna be fine fine thing

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.760
mmm is that song still in the public

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:25.750
consciousness Alanis Morissette one hand

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:28.810
in my pocket everyone knows ironic

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:31.660
most people know you ought to know which

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:34.870
at all stand by to this day Alanis

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:37.870
Morissette went full-on mom rock around

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:38.950
like the hands clean era look you don't

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:40.630
have to know this stuff unless you're

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:42.670
Canadians again we played so much

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:44.470
Canadian music up here because legally

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:47.890
radio stations and TV stations have to

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:49.660
but anyway and I understand why we're

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:52.180
not going to get into that yet again you

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:56.380
want to know I stand by that as like a

00:10:52.180 --> 00:11:02.230
song that actually rocks and maybe that

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:04.300
makes me you know a 34 year old mother

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:05.890
of three I got no problems with that you

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:08.620
know mothers are some of the strongest

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:11.920
people I know he said without really

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:14.710
knowing what it means and I think it's

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.700
the perfect example of that adage I mean

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.050
we talked about it in a battleground

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.400
episode recently there's a perfect

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:21.010
example of that adage you know you got

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.750
your whole life to write your debut

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:28.990
album and then you know that's why the

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:30.610
sophomore slump happens sometimes you've

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:32.260
got all these fresh ideas and takes you

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:36.010
you know six years to write all the

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:38.260
songs for whatever people say I am

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:41.170
that's what I'm not and then I mean it's

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:43.060
okay I'm not I know this is a Arctic

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:45.070
Monkeys pankaj now there's still big

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:47.350
fans nothing wrong with that Roberts one

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:51.550
of them for example anyway there's

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:56.380
dozens of us full house we could use it

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:58.930
potentially the land is more said Jagged

00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.970
Little Pill was a landmark you know you

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:03.160
ought to know kind of rocks ironic a

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.839
little bit of a mean song in this day

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:07.990
and age I suppose but at the time it was

00:12:04.839 --> 00:12:09.339
like whoa look at this it's a song with

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:12.190
the story about things that are

00:12:09.339 --> 00:12:13.600
coincidental one hand in my pocket

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:16.470
nothing wrong with that I'm trying to

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:18.170
think of what else is even on that album

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:21.680
nothing

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:22.940
do women plus great karaoke song good

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.190
one in rock band as well

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.779
Alanis I'm giving it up to you you know

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:28.760
I'm not saying you've had a hard time of

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:30.500
things I'm pretty sure that you could

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:32.149
probably live off Jagged Little Pill

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:35.180
residuals for like the rest of your life

00:12:32.149 --> 00:12:36.620
all I'm saying is you don't get I don't

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:40.070
think she gets the respect she deserves

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:42.670
in today's modern world you know Shania

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:45.019
still has a place of the table

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:47.420
thanks to come on over being you know

00:12:45.019 --> 00:12:48.980
one of the eleventh best-selling albums

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:51.350
of all time or something like that

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:53.949
Alanis has been washed away by the sands

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:56.329
of time and I don't think that's okay

00:12:53.949 --> 00:12:57.920
she's up there in the Holy Trinity of

00:12:56.329 --> 00:13:02.120
Canadian singers from their Canadian

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:04.430
female singers from the 1990s and 2000's

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.079
Janet Wayne Celine Dion Alanis

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:10.970
Morissette back when we were on top of

00:13:06.079 --> 00:13:15.500
the world the pre simple plan some forty

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:18.920
one era sound tracking the capturing of

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:21.019
shiny ponytails worldwide oK we've been

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:24.850
to all the rooms that are likely to have

00:13:21.019 --> 00:13:27.470
some merit here oh I don't love this but

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:32.600
actually like having an orbital to fight

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:35.420
Ragman is very nice but rah mega was

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:38.600
actually Rag mega doesn't respond to

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:41.380
orbitals that well mostly because the

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:44.350
he's got like the force field around him

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:45.829
makes him a little dangerous I was done

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:50.779
all right

00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:54.709
I was actually I'll accept this pretty

00:13:50.779 --> 00:13:56.089
good fight um I don't think we had five

00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:57.380
cents when we came down here so I'm

00:13:56.089 --> 00:13:58.940
actually just going to continue to book

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:00.680
it we have a good excuse we'd like to

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:05.829
make boss rush that's on the to-do list

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:05.829
for us we could get it to happen here

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:12.450
you know what I am going to talk and now

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.980
I'm not going to talk about can con it's

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:16.200
one of those things that you know it

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:18.570
blows people's minds when they hear it

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:20.310
because if you're in America there's so

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:23.970
much American media that you're like oh

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:25.380
it isn't that a little nationalistic to

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.610
have a requirement that your country

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.800
play a certain percentage of its own

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:32.040
music yo we got to preserve our cultural

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:37.830
identity before it you know gets just a

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:39.540
washed over with the American media we

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:41.730
have a healthy representation we know

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.410
who Bruno Mars is but we also know who

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.610
Tom Cochran is you know life is a

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:48.210
highway I'm going to ride it all night

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:51.240
long we know who Kanye West is but we

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:54.390
also know who buck 65 is and chaos it

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:56.370
wasn't chaos like a little popular in

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:58.710
the United States the other ones like

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:02.360
trying to get down because you're moving

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:05.910
up and no or at the crabs in the bucket

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:07.470
this room take it out of the game does

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:08.970
anyone accepting responsibility for

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:11.160
Isaac anymore take this room out of the

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:14.850
game I'm going to start a change.org

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:18.180
petition it's a bad room

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:20.520
one of the worst rooms I have a dream of

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:22.170
an Isaac in which there are no rooms

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.940
with guaranteed damage or at least

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:26.550
damage that's almost impossible to avoid

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:29.910
by any factors within one's own control

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:31.500
alright we need to we're going to make

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:33.330
this a digestible message we're going to

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.890
need to trim that down a little bit it's

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.450
a little overly verbose they've got big

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:41.310
words in there those words offend me

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:42.660
okay um this room is bad and it should

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:48.410
feel bad alright there's a hundred

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:50.150
thousand signatures right there let's go

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:52.070
help

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:54.140
[Music]

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:56.330
I think the progress that we're making

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:58.370
is relatively good so far I like and

00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:00.380
people are going to dispute that I'm

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:02.000
being serious when I say this I like

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:04.190
that we've lost a little bit on the new

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.400
save file and it's not just a steamroll

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:09.050
I also I got some tweets almost

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:12.050
everybody at least as sweet of me has

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:14.120
been in support of the new save file wow

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:18.350
this is what I get you double down on

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:20.720
this room almost everybody this tweeted

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:22.700
me has been like I'm mildly in favor or

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:25.340
very much in favor of the new save file

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:28.850
and I appreciate that without trying to

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:31.250
like silence dissenting opinions because

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:32.510
you know if the majority of people were

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.850
not in favor of this we could easily

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:36.950
reverse trajectory right I did get some

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:38.030
tweets from people were like it's going

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:40.100
to suck that we're not going to get any

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:43.670
of the cool synergies we've actually had

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:46.010
some runs that were a coolly synergistic

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:47.960
like with Jacob's Ladder for example on

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:52.040
our most recent or one of our most

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:53.900
recent runs so there's still like many

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.790
many many cool items in the game and

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.990
synergies as well and another person

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:58.190
brought us to my attention the reason

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.120
there's so many booster pack items

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:01.760
showing up is because they're not

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.200
subject to unlocks so any cool item

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.970
that's in a booster pack is actually

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.699
disproportionately likely to show up on

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:09.589
a new save file because those all come

00:17:07.699 --> 00:17:11.120
on lock this portion little

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:12.740
disproportionately likely to show up

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:14.449
relative to an item that has to be

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:16.430
unlocked or relative to how often it

00:17:14.449 --> 00:17:18.189
showed up you know pre new save file I

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:20.920
guess is what I'm trying to suggest I

00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:24.320
think that makes that makes enough sense

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:25.970
if we can actually unlock or get the

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.949
achievement for having a fourth level

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:31.610
meatboy right off the bat I would be so

00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:33.740
happy because that took me freaking

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:36.230
forever because one of the last things

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:39.800
we did in I think after birth not after

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:41.120
birth plus and then once you get it it's

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:44.480
gone you don't need to worry about it

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:47.300
anymore but it's so annoying we don't

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:49.010
need that it's so annoying to to have

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:50.480
that hanging over your head because it's

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:52.640
almost impossible to will it into

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:55.010
existence like I'm trying to remember

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:57.590
how Kate did it because we did some

00:17:55.010 --> 00:18:00.920
cheesy stuff I think it was like nun's

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:03.080
habit monster Manuel and the ability to

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:05.190
just like regenerate red hearts over and

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:07.929
over

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:09.279
but maybe like scapularis is something

00:18:07.929 --> 00:18:11.289
along these lines that allowed us to

00:18:09.279 --> 00:18:14.080
basically we found a blood bank and we

00:18:11.289 --> 00:18:15.879
were able to use we were able to play it

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.309
get charges on monster man well until we

00:18:15.879 --> 00:18:20.320
got a bandage girl and a meat boy but it

00:18:18.309 --> 00:18:21.700
takes a unique sort of situation to make

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:24.639
that happen it's not the easiest thing

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:27.759
that sort of will into existence so if

00:18:24.639 --> 00:18:31.450
we could just get it done that would be

00:18:27.759 --> 00:18:33.279
awesome I don't think you should get our

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:35.489
hopes up too high because I still think

00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:39.399
at this point it's actually just like a

00:18:35.489 --> 00:18:41.409
one-third chance might seem low but we

00:18:39.399 --> 00:18:43.359
could end up fighting them with Book of

00:18:41.409 --> 00:18:47.769
Revelations we only get one floor on the

00:18:43.359 --> 00:18:53.350
womb with which to fight with which to

00:18:47.769 --> 00:18:57.480
fight yeah death is the last ones wish

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:59.559
to fight death however you don't just

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:01.509
incentivize death showing up you also

00:18:59.559 --> 00:19:05.529
weighted towards conquest showing up and

00:19:01.509 --> 00:19:06.999
you weight it towards them I really

00:19:05.529 --> 00:19:08.379
thought that was going to give us the

00:19:06.999 --> 00:19:10.600
blood bag because it said it was on lock

00:19:08.379 --> 00:19:12.399
so that's fine we got so many spirit out

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:16.779
so we can afford to go fairly hard on

00:19:12.399 --> 00:19:19.149
this one I would love the blood bag

00:19:16.779 --> 00:19:22.480
extra HP is nice but the speed is also

00:19:19.149 --> 00:19:25.029
pretty valuable here getting consumables

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.379
out of this either way tons of money but

00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:28.090
again we're trying to make it the boss

00:19:26.379 --> 00:19:30.549
rush as well so I'm not really

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:33.070
interested in maximizing my money gain

00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:34.690
I'm mostly interested in trying to make

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:36.009
sure this pays out with something and it

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.759
didn't and we didn't get any luck

00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:42.309
upgrades

00:19:36.759 --> 00:19:44.649
that's crazy not the best use of the

00:19:42.309 --> 00:19:49.359
hanged man but a decent use of it anyway

00:19:44.649 --> 00:19:51.549
we got 13 damage for this floor we hit

00:19:49.359 --> 00:19:53.109
the damage bonus camp like a long long

00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:57.820
time ago on the blood bank but that's

00:19:53.109 --> 00:20:01.470
fine 2020 is beautiful actually is like

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:01.470
the best item we've got enough are

00:20:01.739 --> 00:20:05.639
trying to think of what else the

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:12.470
we can do on this floor to really make

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:15.350
life work for us but it dad so when it

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:17.510
comes to the womb one I thought it also

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:19.070
maybe incentivize done incentivize but

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:21.710
using Book of Revelations made it so

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:26.900
only three bosses can show up conquest

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:29.780
which is bad for us at least death which

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:31.880
is perfect or I think mr. Fred as well

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:35.330
and I don't know if there's a relative

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:37.310
percentage to these but I think I

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:38.870
wouldn't start counting my chickens I

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:43.460
guess is what I'm trying to suggest here

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:46.700
now illuminated bulb is a wonderful

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:48.470
choice especially because we can hold

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:50.060
two trinkets but we are going to be

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:52.520
using Book of Revelations pretty much

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:55.040
all the time it's available so it's not

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:57.500
quite a 10 out of 10 trinket right now

00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:01.820
at least in this situation it's not a 10

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:03.380
a 10 trinket the last step here is try

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:05.480
to make boss rush happen I think it's

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:08.600
going to be you know relatively likely

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:10.790
that it will wow he deflected off the

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:14.060
lock just to cost me like another three

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:16.490
seconds that is a new level of

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:19.010
spitefulness that if I'm being honest I

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:20.270
respect a great deal as the spiteful man

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:25.060
I respect that

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:28.180
incredibly thank you very much

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:34.190
you know what it has made me spiteful is

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:37.520
driving I talk about this in a lot of

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:39.920
after scopes but I think the human race

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:42.590
is going to be better off when

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:44.240
self-driving cars become a thing it may

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:46.040
be there's unforeseen consequences that

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:49.450
I can't even imagine at this point but I

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:52.280
do think driving makes us less

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:54.620
understanding towards one another not

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:56.000
because of any like fictional concerns I

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:58.370
have time to fight Krampus let's give

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.850
this a shot oh wow yeah negative look it

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:03.260
is Krampus as well because I play all

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:04.370
these seeds in advance of course to

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:07.430
fetes them to see if they're going to be

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:08.780
any good okay what do we got in here we

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:10.730
want to do it probably no matter what

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:13.110
tractor beam is pretty solid let's give

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:16.980
it a shot

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:19.590
no but not because you know driving

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:21.420
causes us to I don't know put our

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:24.330
interests against our fellow man's I

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:27.690
think it's because I I take it a step

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:29.490
further I firmly believe that human

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:32.549
beings are a flawed organic creature

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:35.790
that technology will eventually fix or

00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:38.580
improve upon at the very least and on

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:40.890
what's great is the best times I ever

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:43.440
feel about humanity is when I'm the most

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:45.540
sequestered from humanity of course

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:47.220
there's always like uplifting videos and

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.929
stuff like that where you go oh well

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.520
this is gay you know my faith in the

00:22:48.929 --> 00:22:51.809
human race restored and I'm okay with

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:54.570
that kind of stuff even though it is a

00:22:51.809 --> 00:22:55.169
little emotionally manipulative from

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:58.470
time to time

00:22:55.169 --> 00:23:01.500
however the less I interact with people

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:03.960
the better I feel about humanity it's

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:07.860
just one of those it's a weird catch-22

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:09.510
right generally at least the more I have

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:13.770
to interact with people especially in a

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:17.280
situation that's you know cooperative

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:20.490
the more I'm like I can't wait for the

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:26.790
time sailing a way we'll try this again

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:32.030
I really can't wait for you on Moz to

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:34.380
deprecate our bodies I trust in

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:37.740
technology to free us from the

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:45.200
selfishness on the freeway okay this is

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:45.200
terrible either way

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:51.380
I think that why I think that human

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:53.900
beings are the best animal now I mean

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:55.670
I'm kind of a Homer pick right like I'm

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:59.420
rooting for the home team they're big

00:23:55.670 --> 00:24:01.970
but I did I had a friend in in high

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:02.990
school and I was you know we were

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:04.910
talking about climate change

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:06.290
yeah even back in like 1930 when I was

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:09.050
in high school climate change was like a

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:11.030
thing and more of a thing than it is now

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:16.670
apparently either way I digress current

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:18.560
events etc etc um but uh she was always

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:20.180
like man human beings are like the worst

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:24.020
thing that's ever happened to earth and

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:25.910
I'm like yeah but like we are pretty

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:28.370
sweet like look at the next smartest

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:31.970
animal we're so much more intelligent I

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:35.210
know like dolphins whales you dogs pigs

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:38.360
etc are intelligent but like I will go

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:41.240
up against any I'll go up against the

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:43.910
smartest dolphin in any test of

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:45.020
intelligence that we measure of course

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:46.910
it's going to be me at something

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:50.390
involving swimming if we're talking

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:52.640
about like pattern recognition was like

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:54.800
put me up in an arithmetic test against

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:57.200
the smartest gorillas on the planet I'm

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.670
telling you I'll win it's not even 99.9

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.410
percent of the time I'm going to win 100

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:03.590
percent at a time it was based on speed

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:06.470
accuracy you know consistency there's no

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:08.420
danger and she's like yeah but like the

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:11.660
planet might have been better off if

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:16.070
just like if we never existed it just

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:17.750
bears existence it's not why we're no

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:19.520
longer friends actually you know it's a

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:21.740
more mundane story we just kind of fell

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.970
out after university we didn't do we

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:24.530
went to different schools we didn't talk

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:26.360
to each other she's got a kid now I do

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:28.610
not have a kid there's no mutual

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:31.460
interest there you know people with kids

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:32.750
I always want to talk about kids there's

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:35.390
nothing wrong with that I get it you

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:37.550
know you might be saying you talk about

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:39.860
your cats all the time well first off

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:43.370
I'm talking you knew this microphone

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:44.510
like nine hours a day I got to come up

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:46.100
with something to talk about I can't

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:49.790
just talk about can con for two hours

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:52.670
again but you have anybody with kids

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:54.950
unfit on your Facebook page they can't

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:58.040
stop talking about it one of my friends

00:25:54.950 --> 00:26:00.200
is thirty he has two kids he's the first

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:03.620
person in our in our very close group of

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:06.500
have kids one of them's like five in the

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:07.070
other ones three I don't need to know

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:11.230
their names

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:14.210
okay not yet wait and see how this whole

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:17.679
you know thing works out I'll learn

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:19.820
their names if it becomes important

00:26:17.679 --> 00:26:21.860
again there's a classic northernlion

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:23.570
example make the people you know make

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.889
yourself the villain of a story and then

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:27.860
turn it around at the end but anyway

00:26:24.889 --> 00:26:31.159
he's always sent us these pictures of of

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:32.960
his kids and we don't care everybody in

00:26:31.159 --> 00:26:33.980
the group is like hey you know the first

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.139
couple of pictures you're like that's

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:38.029
cool more pictures past that you're like

00:26:36.139 --> 00:26:39.350
I don't need to see your kids I'm the

00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:42.019
children to send pictures to your mom

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:44.059
your mom always is going to want more

00:26:42.019 --> 00:26:46.070
pictures of her grandkids you can send a

00:26:44.059 --> 00:26:47.570
picture of her grandkids like putting

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:49.159
their finger in their own butthole and

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:52.309
then licking it and she'd be like oh my

00:26:49.159 --> 00:26:54.440
god that's my grandson it were

00:26:52.309 --> 00:26:57.799
programmed to do so but I don't care

00:26:54.440 --> 00:27:00.950
it's just a kid is complication as far

00:26:57.799 --> 00:27:03.730
as I'm concerned in the cutthroat you

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:06.230
know world of competing for resources

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:08.389
hey I'm going to go Tammy said now I

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:10.370
want more damage especially in

00:27:08.389 --> 00:27:15.139
situations where we don't get the damage

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:16.909
bonus early but anyway he takes it a

00:27:15.139 --> 00:27:18.230
step further sometimes at least it's

00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:20.029
kind of stopped now that those kids are

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:21.889
older but sometimes you'd be like check

00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:23.659
out this photo you send us a picture of

00:27:21.889 --> 00:27:28.190
like his kids in the bathtub I'm gonna

00:27:23.659 --> 00:27:30.139
stop it we don't want that it's like I'm

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:31.820
not saying there's anything gross about

00:27:30.139 --> 00:27:33.470
it necessarily I'm just saying I don't

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:35.899
want to see it I don't want to solicit

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:38.600
photos of you children although you'd be

00:27:35.899 --> 00:27:43.639
splashing is for his sister and I'm okay

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:47.120
cool dude anyway I mean I it's different

00:27:43.639 --> 00:27:48.289
generations I guess but certainly I feel

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.460
bad for the kid I guess is what I'm

00:27:48.289 --> 00:27:51.169
trying to get at here because I

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:53.059
definitely you know gone to family

00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:55.880
reunions and Grandma pulls out a photo

00:27:53.059 --> 00:27:57.380
album what an antiquated concept and

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.059
goes like here's a photo of Ryan and the

00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:00.710
best and I'm like shut the stop showing

00:27:59.059 --> 00:28:03.440
everybody might dangle I mean I think

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:05.720
it's weird I mean it's a little weird

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:08.570
let's be honest but at the same time

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:10.669
it's like remove that photo nephew I

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:12.790
don't want to see that especially like I

00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:16.810
that's my dangles and I know

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:18.910
see it big things have small beginnings

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:21.550
you know Michael Fassbender said it best

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:23.680
in prometheus but either way I don't

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:25.840
want to see that but definitely don't

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:32.170
just send it on prompted to other people

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:33.850
as well it's a little too much your

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:37.330
parents will always want to see this

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:39.550
this is like I'm telling you this for

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:41.320
your own advice and I probably won't

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:42.610
follow my own advice as well I see you

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.930
know there are streamers who have kids

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:46.540
they post pictures of their kids yeah

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:47.950
it's so cute and not really that cute

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:51.940
they're cute to you and that's the way

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:54.100
it should be we actually got our fourth

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:55.120
level meat boy I'm super stoked mostly

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:56.770
cuz it gives me something else to talk

00:28:55.120 --> 00:29:01.750
about rather than just making myself a

00:28:56.770 --> 00:29:03.940
villain over and over but it's dogs oh

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:05.140
if you got a cute picture of your dog I

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.160
always want to see a cute picture of

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:08.290
your dog cats

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:10.060
same deal it's got to be like don't give

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:12.640
me those five out of ten photos give me

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:14.260
the eight send the fives to you know

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.270
your spouse or something like that but

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:18.880
kids are a totally different story you

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:22.930
can send me photos of your children on

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:24.610
Halloween by the way as far as I'm

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:26.440
concerned I'll accept no dissent on this

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:27.460
topic it's going to be two kinds of

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.900
people who respond to this there's gonna

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.890
be people to go wow you don't support

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.880
your friends when they're having kids

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:34.510
what kind of friend are you blah blah

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:36.880
blah that's a first up house high school

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:38.200
because we trust me once your friends

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.630
start pumping out babies and you got a

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:42.280
you care about all these kids you're

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:44.200
going to start to be a little jaded with

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:46.360
it again save your attention for your

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.440
own child I think and then secondly

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.690
there's going to be a group of people

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:51.910
who are like I feel you I'm not saying

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:53.770
you shouldn't be having kids I'm just

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:56.080
saying I don't want to see photos and

00:29:53.770 --> 00:30:00.610
progress reports of them from time to

00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:04.060
time like my friends and I genuinely

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:06.840
have love for this man you know we've

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:09.550
been through thick and thin together

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:11.350
send us a message we have like a little

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:14.050
chat thread with all of our friends from

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:15.790
high school and college and says you

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:17.500
know I was watching Star Wars with my

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:18.910
kid today it was the first class you're

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.430
watching the force awakens with your

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:21.380
three-year-old

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:24.080

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:26.480
little extreme and she said you know I

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:28.910
think kylo Ren is a bad guy isn't that

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:31.880
cute there's a cute this basic level

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:34.310
human understanding I mean excuse me

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:37.540
Emily actually it's a more complex

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:41.060
character than that you see no but I

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:43.420
guess that's the most mundane story I've

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:45.560
ever heard in my entire life

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:49.430
I'm not saying adults should get that

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:51.320
level of credit like I'm over here

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:52.730

that it should be at meanwhile this

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:03.500
three-year-old getting doodles of credit

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:06.260
for recognizing that kylo Ren is the

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:07.580
antagonist in the force awakens it's

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:10.100
