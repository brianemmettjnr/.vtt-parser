##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.510
everybody welcome mention when the land

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.250
planes landing lights get red plus we

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.420
unlock Maggie on the last run gee I sure

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.400
hope she's a fun character to play

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:15.719
everybody's favorite character am I

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:18.570
correct xj 2's 7 vs x there's no way to

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.210
construct the sentence i construct the

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.289
sentence that starts with X that doesn't

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.820
use the word Xavier or xylophone I'm not

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.340
trying to give you an impossible task

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.779
I'm trying to give you a task that is I

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.960
should have been able to that once

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.969
completely my bad oh sorry I forgot I'm

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.710
doing this for you to a freaking Magus

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.710
you're playing five screen I never had a

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.670
chance no conceivable way we could have

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.079
made it out of that situation okay now

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.730
that I put on my youtube joy it's time

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.680
to get back to the rational discourse

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.600
that we normally pride ourselves on in

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.129
this show like for example how much is

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.739
too much food when it comes to being in

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.600
a movie theater I don't have any more

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.100
movie theatre etiquette stories as I am

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.530
recording this rate after I recorded the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.359
last one it would be absurd if I hadn't

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.780
seen another film in the interim period

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:13.189
I have not exactly that pregnant pause

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.070
there by the way what an expression but

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:18.270
sounds like I'm trying to hide something

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.360
from you look I just watched the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.810
Zapruder film on a you know smoky reel

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.890
in my basement an 18 millimeter film

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:31.079
that's not the case we don't have a

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:33.780
basement we live in Vancouver in case

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.829
you had forgot from me not mentioning it

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:41.790
for 14 seconds anyway keep it going here

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:45.780
I talked to like two episodes ago about

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.430
things I wouldn't want in my house and I

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.840
said I don't want an indoor pool I don't

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.310
want a garden you don't have a garden in

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.939
your house you know I don't want a yard

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.549
or a lot um I mean I guess a yard is a

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:00.530
little different I don't really want a

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:03.030
lawn I don't want a driveway you got a

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.549
shovel snow

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.350
but I would like a movie theater I will

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.479
admit that that has stuck with me I

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.700
don't want like a 100 person movie

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.850
theater just a little movie theater is

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.770
fine by me I also think like and this is

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.680
never going to happen probably but a den

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.680
where you had like a pinball machine and

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.690
one good arcade cabinet would be sick

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.720
I don't need I'm not a pinball

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.709
enthusiast but I like pinball if I could

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.239
get one solid pinball machine I would I

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.209
would be cool with it the problem with

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.970
an arcade cabinet though I feel like

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.769
I've seen people I don't know if I've

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.959
known anybody personally that's owned an

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.090
arcade cab owned an arcade cabinet but

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.360
second hand I've heard of people buying

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.350
them and apparently you just lose your

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.209
luster for it pretty quickly

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.340
like I have no interest in owning Donkey

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.989
Kong sorry to tell you that Steve Wiebe

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.660
but I'm not going to buy your Donkey

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.630
Kong jr. machine okay we should buy a

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.590
spirit hard as possible dude so many

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.630
reroll machines

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.940
I want donation machines I think if I

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.130
ever had an arcade cabinet I would want

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.890
it to be like NFL Blitz

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.510
or the NHL Showtime one is it anything

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.670
to show to center ice something like

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.739
that that was NFL Blitz but for hockey

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.760
NBA Jam would be another good one

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.600
something you play when there's people

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.560
around you could have some fun with I

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.680
know a lot of people are going to say

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:33.180
they want the six-person x-men machine I

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.859
have fond memories of going to I think

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.720
it was actually called cyber sports

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.980
world in my hometown I know that sounds

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.890
ridiculous but it was like a Chucky

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.609
Cheese we had bowling alleys and an

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.170
arcade and like a restaurant in it and

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:48.540
as a kid it was like my favorite place

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.600
on planet earth but then it became like

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.510
a roller derby their roller rink and

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.609
then it went out of business but anyway

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.840
like I believe it was called cyber

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:02.820
sports world that's gotta hurt

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.329
it was a it was a lovely time I played

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.650
that game all the time there but I don't

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.840
know I just can't get behind most

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.540
old-school beat-em-ups in this day and

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.040
a lot of you know they serve their

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.269
purpose at a time without a doubt and

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.010
there's been some great ones you know

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.510
I've been teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.199
for turtles in time more times than I

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.580
can count

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:27.630
beating Streets of Rage to a beatin to

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.370
TMNT 1989 actually literally like 25

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.240
times although it was the Xbox Live

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.070
Arcade version for my 2007 however this

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.720
is the longest Larry jr. I've ever seen

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.470
there was an on display this is

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:44.700
outrageous I think I'm more of like I

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:47.639
want NBA Jam that's my style I think I

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.979
don't want to ouroboros a pain here I

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:55.919
don't want area 51 I'm not a big light

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:57.570
gun games guy I don't like arcade racing

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.220
games that much because it always feels

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.870
like the racing sort of sucks and you're

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.220
just paying for the novelty of sitting

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.470
in a chair that's sort of like a race

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:09.720
car

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:11.370
give me MB hm I'm okay with that I would

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.229
love to have like a single bowling alley

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.940
in my house as well but again now we're

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.860
getting into like White House levels I

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.320
also feel like it's the kind of thing

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.789
you lose luster for dude got me hair

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.490
balls like the most common item we've

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:25.260
had in this freaking new save file could

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.849
be worse I guess it could be ghost baby

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:31.710
which is probably running a close second

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:35.220
right now along with robo-baby like when

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.330
I grew up my dad was always like one day

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.430
we're going to move to like a bigger

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.260
house I'm going to get a snooker table

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.150
I'm going to get like a six foot by 12

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.979
foot snooker by the way is a kind of

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.020
billiards I know if you're in Europe

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:47.820
right now you're going why is he

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.560
explaining what snooker is everybody

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.300
knows what it is not in North America

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.669
it's not that common in North America

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.560
you go to like a big pool hall they

00:05:53.669 --> 00:06:00.479
might have like two snooker tables but

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.410
anyway here at least unless it's like a

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:03.720
really good one

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:07.889
maybe then but I don't know the one the

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:10.620
big pool hall Inara in my hometown is

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:12.660
called rax and it's basically like it's

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:17.789
pool but it's also Hooters for whatever

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:20.670
reason and what's ironic is that I had

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:22.710
so many birthday parties there

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:27.660
I don't think I ever had a birthday

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:29.430
party there I'm not sure but I went to

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.440
many birthday parties there and I was

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.450
always like why are them why is it

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:38.280
always just the dad coming to racks with

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:40.470
us but anyway I digress my whole

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.540
childhood adolescence he's like I'm once

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.950
once we get a bigger place I need a 6 by

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.680
12 snooker table I'm gonna play snooker

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:49.590
all the time they got a bigger place

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.140
like 7 years ago you got a 6 by 12

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:54.450
snooker table he played it actually like

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:57.150
a lot and then he sold it

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.590
he was like unites it loses its luster

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:01.740
you don't find yourself playing it all

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:03.360
that often I think a bowling alley could

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.620
be like that a pinball machine I suppose

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.250
a little different because it takes up

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:12.870
much less effective space a little dicey

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:15.600
in here but that's where I go I think

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:20.240
having like a like an eighth person

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.240
movie theater would be pretty cool I

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:25.560
don't want a basketball court I don't

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:28.890
want a swimming pool give me like a

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:32.580
large screen a comfortable chairs with

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:34.950
cupholders in them that's it plus you

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.330
can hook it up with Mario Cart but the

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:37.350
delay is never going to be right and

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.700
there's always going to be one dude

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.920
who's going to be like to hardcore he's

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.140
going to be like input delays not right

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:46.590
so I can't land my blue shells properly

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:48.330
and that guy is Austin moving on no I

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:51.860
can't say for sure I don't know if

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.860
Austin's big Mario Kart guy

00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:00.110
he owns a switch but he only wants to

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.460
play Zelda which I understand that you

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.290
know there's like the meme right now

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.850
that's all there is oh isn't no it's not

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:06.860
an exemplar is just an item over there

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:09.010
the only thing there is the play on the

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:12.169
switches Zelda that's not true

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:13.970
there's also Mario Kart 8 deluxe edition

00:08:12.169 --> 00:08:15.470
in my opinion the most beautiful game

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:17.360
ever made graphically the most

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:19.790
impressive no but the game that free

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:23.360
whatever when I play Mario Kart 8 deluxe

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:26.480
edition I feel like everything is right

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.220
in the universe like everything's going

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:32.300
to be okay like that game is like having

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:35.089
a therapy dog in video game chord this

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:36.380
is not by the way you if you've been

00:08:35.089 --> 00:08:37.339
following the progression of

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.409
northernlion

00:08:37.339 --> 00:08:41.900
you could not conceivably accuse me of

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:44.540
being a Nintendo fanboy i bought a wii u

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.910
when it came out we never touched it I

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:51.529
mean we touched it once every nine

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:54.320
months and when I'll tell you what I'll

00:08:51.529 --> 00:08:56.260
give you the money lebowski Kaiser she's

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.600
huge

00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:02.600
give me five cents please that's two

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:04.730
cents it's not like we can lose our

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.610
progress on the shop but still I want

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:12.670
that spirit art for the next floor

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:12.670
collect him your Chi eager she anyway

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:21.110
forgot what I was saying completely like

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:23.660
a hundred percent forgot what I was

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:30.650
saying what were we talking about mere

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:32.390
moments ago I've totally lost it we're

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:33.950
talking about this is why I thought we

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:36.700
could have a second trip sitter in the

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:39.290
conversation to keep you dedicated here

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:41.420
cyber sports world arcade machine

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:43.370
pinball machine movie theater I

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:47.270
forgotten the rest complaining whatever

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:50.180
okay that's good what happened to it it

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:52.550
was there in my memory what it meant to

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.870
be will eventually what it meant to me

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:58.220
will eventually be a memory of

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:59.960
I'm gonna try so huh and yet so far like

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.970
it's Craigslist in a big city just

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:06.920
littered with arcade cabinets people are

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:08.300
trying to sell I don't want to ruffle

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:12.350
any feathers you know there's like a lot

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:14.779
of classic video games I like I grew up

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:16.970
in the SNES era and I think there are

00:10:14.779 --> 00:10:19.760
some anyway this is not a controversial

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:22.190
opinion there are some genuine classics

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:25.820
from the SNES era some games that hold

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:28.700
up Super Metroid Legend of Zelda a link

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:30.350
to the past Super Mario World Yoshi's

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:34.730
Island you know there's some like

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:37.160
sincere complete classics from that era

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:38.870
games that are not just nostalgia

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:44.779
goggles they're actually like you know

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:47.630
chefs kiss exquisite but maybe it's just

00:10:44.779 --> 00:10:49.940
my age speaking I've gone back and

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:52.790
played a lot of the like 1980s classics

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:55.670
you know I played combat for the Atari

00:10:52.790 --> 00:11:00.860
2600 I play the original pitfall play

00:10:55.670 --> 00:11:06.620
cows sometimes you know my parents were

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:08.720
teenagers in the early 1980s late 1970s

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:10.220
you know when like arcade games were

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.020
starting to explode so sometimes they'd

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.600
be like hey we got you a gameboy game as

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:17.000
a birthday present oh sweet what is in

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:19.190
there it's Defender Plus joust on a

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.589
single gaming cartridge I love my

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:22.670
parents they were trying to bond they

00:11:21.589 --> 00:11:26.209
were like this is what we played as a

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:27.650
kid you play like four minutes of joust

00:11:26.209 --> 00:11:29.510
you know what you're getting into right

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:32.440
that's like those Atari games are

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:33.980
basically just mobile games with no

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.080
microtransactions which makes them

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:39.650
usually a lot better in that regard at

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:42.140
least but except for the fact that every

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:43.820
single play cost you 25 cents in 1980s

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.890
currency which is like a dollar 50 now

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:47.089
but anyways I'm not going to break the

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:49.839
circle Tory the games are the worst

00:11:47.089 --> 00:11:49.839
they've ever been

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.560
let's grab this stuff and move along

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:56.029
here we can do a lot of donation and

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.160
maybe still buy a spear at heart as well

00:11:56.029 --> 00:12:00.650
dim bulb Azera sorry illuminated bulb is

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:04.010
actually quite good what you want to do

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:07.120
is use the bulb or sorry use guppies

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:10.290
head as you're about to finish the room

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:13.420
that way you get the whole room of bonus

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:15.040
like bonus stats and at the end of the

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:20.950
room you still get the benefit out of

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:23.260
Guppies Guppies head that was very

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:24.700
dangerous by the way we have two guppy

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:31.930
items I just realized didn't even

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:33.910
lampshade it at all both of these are

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:36.339
good I think I'm gonna take the parasite

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.570
though because it's better oh we're not

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:39.070
supposed to adult app it's die hard

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:43.180
that's what I'll say about that

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:45.550
um I know greed thank you that's the way

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:53.080
you work him because the reason greed I

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:54.940
like to burn futile but like I respect

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.740
the history lesson that those games can

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:59.589
teach you

00:12:55.740 --> 00:13:00.940
I'm just not I don't know if those ones

00:12:59.589 --> 00:13:03.250
actually reach the point where they can

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:04.480
like age into being classics it's like

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:07.000
movies right when people talk about

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:09.730
classic movies there's like a cut-off

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.250
point the earliest movie that anybody

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:13.510
tells you that you have to watch to be

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:16.450
like considered knowledgeable about

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:19.000
movies is like you know dial M for

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:22.150
murder or metropolis you know movies

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.390
from the 1920s as ancient those are old

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:27.339
movies but like there were 30 years of

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:29.830
movies that came out before metropolis

00:13:27.339 --> 00:13:32.560
we don't talk about them because we're

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:37.930
just feeling it out you know there's

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:41.190
like you know man sneezes video of train

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:44.140
approaching you know these this is a

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:46.450
from an era where it was mostly just

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:48.420
like proving that the technology works

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:50.680
like you ever watched like your

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:54.339
grandfather's Home Videos I'm not

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:57.880
talking about those ones you sicko for

00:13:54.339 --> 00:14:00.520
once I am king shaming but you know it's

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:02.410
always like half the time the lens caps

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.940
on it's mostly just about the fact that

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:05.580
the video is basically a mission

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:07.800
statement that says I have a camera

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:12.310
that's what those movies were like in

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:13.959
1905 or something like that that was

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.850
actually a perfect up you said play

00:14:13.959 --> 00:14:18.430
there that I will probably never

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:20.670
replicate again grab this just for you

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:23.360
know potential bookworms sake

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:25.530
let's go check our curse room as well I

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:27.420
feel like there's something to be said

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:29.910
for that in videogames like one of my

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:31.620
friends got a ColecoVision in like the

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.870
year 2000 I don't know how this

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:36.300
situation presented itself but we were

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:39.540
stoked we were like no game console we

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:42.420
played like 30 colecovision games and

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:45.170
we're like this is not worth our time

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:48.060
now I'm sorry okay I can't even imagine

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:50.700
how difficult it was to make games for

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:53.720
the ColecoVision they're like we need

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:57.870
you to put graphics and sound and

00:14:53.720 --> 00:15:00.690
gameplay into this games you have like

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:01.200
one kilobyte of memory storage so like

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:07.860
have fun

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:11.550
I found pills they opened up my eyes I

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:18.540
found the pills that is demanding with

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:20.070
that understanding if you can and I'm

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.720
not going to do too much research here

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:23.610
because I'm just giving myself more work

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.980
at this point but I welcome your

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:28.530
recommendations for like a good Atari

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:32.310
2600 game that survives without

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:36.540
nostalgia glasses there's some on the

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:39.570
NES I really really like Super Mario

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:41.460
Brothers - not the turnip one but like

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:44.310
the Japanese Super Mario Brothers - The

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:46.080
Lost Levels ooh cancer trink is pretty

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:48.450
good and we can use Guppies head however

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:51.780
we please I think that is like that game

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:53.250
holds up Super Mario Bros 1 as well

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.930
apart from that I haven't played that

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:56.640
many to be honest with you I think you

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:57.540
know Castlevania 3 Dracula's curse is

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.850
pretty good as well

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:02.280
there's got to be some other ones but I

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:03.930
think I think the NES era is where you

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:06.990
can start to say like these games

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:09.390
actually some of them stand up not all

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:12.630
of them but some of them stand up oh

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:14.700
dude original contra and super see yeah

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:16.860
okay there's there's a few classics no

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:19.020
doubt then even if you were born in like

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:21.180
the year 2000 I'd be like and maybe this

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:23.370
is me becoming my parents but I'd be

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:25.290
like you gotta at least try superseded

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:28.500
it's so good I played Super C for the

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:30.870
first time when I was like 19 it wasn't

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:32.810
like I was I had nostalgia goggles on

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:34.820
for it even supercedes not as good as me

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:36.950
contra but for some reason maybe it was

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:41.270
easier I kind of enjoyed him more at the

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:44.240
time of conception but but I could be

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:45.529
wrong I kind of liked missile command

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:52.339
that games okay

00:16:45.529 --> 00:16:55.430
I can't imagine though like if you went

00:16:52.339 --> 00:16:58.060
to an arcade today and I totally

00:16:55.430 --> 00:17:00.589
remembered what I was about to say now

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:02.270
which was that when I was a kid there

00:17:00.589 --> 00:17:04.250
actually was an arcade in our mall and

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:05.990
it was a it was a lovely time thank you

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:08.900
very much for sack head this is a great

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:10.730
item there's always this game I love to

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:14.810
play where you got anywhere is like a

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:16.579
firetruck and you got into it and you

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:20.449
drove around putting out fires it was in

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:22.430
like black and white vector art anyway I

00:17:20.449 --> 00:17:26.420
digress just these are memories for me

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:28.430
at this point why would you do that but

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.710
it turned out so maybe I can't complain

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:33.080
this is a genuinely very strong run I'm

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:34.340
liking it a lot and there is an Isaac's

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.510
room back there we should try to give a

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:37.730
shot as well probably a good time to

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:39.679
point out if you consider yourself

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:43.850
photosensitive when it comes to flashing

00:17:39.679 --> 00:17:46.190
lights Mike's life life I want to turn

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:48.350
this episode off things are flashing

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:51.380
I like flashing a lot considering that

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:53.510
we're only on the Deaf's one grab the

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:59.240
speed upgrade happy to have it

00:17:53.510 --> 00:18:06.350
Oh guppies calm dunk dunk dunk dunk go

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:07.429
pee spoon let's go peep the this is

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:10.100
gonna be the strongest run we've had

00:18:07.429 --> 00:18:15.340
since we started I think that was pretty

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:17.780
dumb this is said what was I gonna say

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:21.410
we were uh we were talking about our

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:22.670
case oh yeah I don't know maybe because

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:29.060
it's because I didn't grow up in that

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:30.920
era but I like Missile Command a space

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:33.050
invaders I like the space invaders

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.850
reboot they did in like 2009 for

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:38.960
Nintendo vs I thought that was a great

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:42.220
game that is I wouldn't say slept on but

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.220
not talked about that much anymore

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:46.630
probably because it was a remake of

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.270
space invaders that came out in almost

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:55.930
2010 but it was it was the critical

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:58.240
darling at the time okay the Timnath

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:59.740
which is okay I don't really want to

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.390
gamble right now because I do want to

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:03.100
try to make boss rush if I could knock

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:05.370
out boss rush with Maggie I don't know

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:10.960
what we unlock for that or for anything

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:12.550
but it does give me another thing ticks

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.710
off the post-it note which helps me out

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:16.570
and let's be honest as soon as we fire

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:18.820
one shot the parasite turned out to be

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:20.890
like a very very right decision for us

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:23.770
here because as soon as we fire shots

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:25.330
the parasite combined with Jacob's

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:33.460
Ladder just rips through the enemies

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:36.010
here they tried to stop us they don't

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:38.260
want you to get healthy um okay let's

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:41.340
get out of this surprisingly long floor

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:43.840
and we'll try to get the boss rush ASAP

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:45.730
we got to be approaching ten wins at

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:47.530
this point that might unlock Sheol

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:51.280
certainly it turns mom's heart and it

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:52.840
lives we'll see I actually you might

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:57.880
think I should be pessimistic and you

00:19:52.840 --> 00:20:02.920
may be right I may be crazy but I think

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:05.230
we should be able to make it to boss

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:08.890
rush if we pick the right direction on

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:11.350
like one or two here on our first or

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:16.840
second try I should say I will also say

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:18.850
I think pac-man is a pretty good game in

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:22.060
terms of its place in videogame history

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:25.810
of course very important but as like a

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:28.600
game I do think pac-man holds up but I

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:32.500
don't know like just sort of barely I

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:34.840
think oh you know what I was gonna bring

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:38.740
up earlier was you think about like if

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:42.550
you went to an arcade in 1980 let's say

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:44.380
you played 12 games that's $3 doesn't

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:46.690
seem like that much money $3 for a whole

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:50.230
day's entertainment right that first

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:51.430
thought that's only 12 games I know some

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.930
people everyone's like I used to go to

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:54.110
the arcade with two quarters and I play

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:56.000
all day come on

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:58.130
I don't think so you're not Billy

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.049
Mitchell I love you but you know Billy

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:02.570
made sure at least in the pac-man

00:21:00.049 --> 00:21:04.850
Department or the hot sauce Department

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:06.220
in all other departments superior but I

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:09.230
mean come on

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:11.840
you got to you got to attack we asked

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:16.100
the Billy Mitchell's got the hot sauce

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:16.570
game down pat anyway so you spent three

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:19.640
bucks

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:22.700
inflation is like on average three

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:23.690
percent per year at 37 years at three

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:25.519
percent inflation

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:26.690
I can't desert an inflation calculator I

00:21:25.519 --> 00:21:29.539
can use for this I'm going to check it

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:30.950
in a second because things times is

00:21:29.539 --> 00:21:33.440
tough here I don't think we're gonna

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:39.639
make boss rush I'm I'm actually booking

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:40.909
it as quickly as I can see what we can

00:21:39.639 --> 00:21:47.419
do

00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:51.799
Thank You rank Tom Mitchell is abili his

00:21:47.419 --> 00:21:54.200
hair miss order feeling sorry didn't

00:21:51.799 --> 00:21:59.360
mean oh and so Billy Mitchell there come

00:21:54.200 --> 00:22:03.350
on come on come on what we as far as I

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:05.889
mentioned we made it well at least we

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:08.950
didn't like punish ourselves too much

00:22:05.889 --> 00:22:11.659
they didn't give us the 20th second I

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:16.460
thought they would give us until 2000

00:22:11.659 --> 00:22:17.899
you know 0.99 and I you broken my heart

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:23.740
is what you've done here Edmund you

00:22:17.899 --> 00:22:25.880
broken my heart that was super close so

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:27.260
all the you know that gives us time to

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.659
punch it into the compound interest

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:32.539
calculator compound it's not compound

00:22:29.659 --> 00:22:35.419
interest but inflation calculator

00:22:32.539 --> 00:22:38.409
okay Inflation Calculator from the Bank

00:22:35.419 --> 00:22:44.269
of Canada a basket of goods that cost

00:22:38.409 --> 00:22:47.510
three dollars in 1980 would cost nine

00:22:44.269 --> 00:22:51.590
dollars and two cents in 2017 that's not

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:55.760
that bad you know a few hours of

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:58.580
entertainment for uh for ten dollars

00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:00.740
that's actually I expected it to be like

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:03.169
twenty three dollars or something like

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:04.429
that it turns out that I was I've been

00:23:03.169 --> 00:23:06.230
under this false impression that our

00:23:04.429 --> 00:23:10.190
cave games were very expensive

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:11.570
I will say though you know you paid a

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:15.380
quarter for those games back in the day

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:20.540
I think that with age they get at least

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:23.270
3% worse every year so they should still

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:25.400
cost a quarter in today's village would

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:28.400
you go to like a bowling alley and they

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:30.410
got a you know area51 machine that's

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:32.840
rigged up and it costs 50 cents per play

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:35.570
you're like come on guys I understand

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:38.030
prices rise but this game has not

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:42.679
changed you know you you bought it in

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:45.740
like the year 2000 but you need to get

00:23:42.679 --> 00:23:47.270
it refurbished there's one area 51

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:50.960
mechanic on the eastern seaboard you've

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:53.780
got to fly them in why I'm flying in and

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:55.130
pay them like you know $800 an hour as a

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:59.720
consultant or something like that I

00:23:55.130 --> 00:24:03.559
don't think so and arcade cabinet is a

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:05.750
static good game should always cost the

00:24:03.559 --> 00:24:13.580
same as when it came out probably it was

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:16.070
a few notable exceptions I will say of

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:19.340
all the casualties of like you know

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:21.860
businesses at least in my era our caves

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:24.200
kind of hurt a little bit I was going to

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:26.030
say hurt the most but there were some

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.950
cool arcades when I was a kid you guys

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:29.870
ever had the play tiem I know there was

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:31.760
one like I went to the one in

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:35.000
Mississauga which is near Toronto

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:36.620
Ontario the capital of Canada now I'm

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.850
just contributing to misinformation but

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:44.240
it makes me feel good so to spread

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:47.049
ignorance about my own country it's

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:49.340
basically just a huge arcade like

00:24:47.049 --> 00:24:51.260
enormous and then you go and you play

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:52.940
arcade games and you win tokens or

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.929
tickets on those arcade games you trade

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:56.059
them in for something at the end of the

00:24:53.929 --> 00:24:57.890
day they had all the cool ones like they

00:24:56.059 --> 00:24:59.750
had silent scope where you get a sniper

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:01.700
rifle and then the one where you like

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:03.410
get on it and it's skis and you actually

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:05.600
like use your legs to control the game

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:07.280
things that at the time you got to

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.690
remember we didn't know the Microsoft

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.250
Kinect would eventually come out and

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:12.169
make us very cynical about this sort of

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:13.580
stuff so at the time we were like this

00:25:12.169 --> 00:25:14.540
is the future of gaming but it's not

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:17.639
quite there yet

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:19.709
spoilers young Ryan it still is

00:25:17.639 --> 00:25:22.709
think it ever will be that's okay we've

00:25:19.709 --> 00:25:26.700
innovated in other areas of the industry

00:25:22.709 --> 00:25:30.269
oh yes my favorite Marvel film the areas

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:33.149
of the industry anyway those places were

00:25:30.269 --> 00:25:37.229
cool they had at the one in Mississauga

00:25:33.149 --> 00:25:38.940
at least they had a a Tekken 3 arcade

00:25:37.229 --> 00:25:41.579
cabinet that was actually like a booth

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:44.549
with green screen and it tracked your

00:25:41.579 --> 00:25:46.079
arms and legs to map to moves for the

00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:48.719
characters it was basically like a

00:25:46.079 --> 00:25:50.849
terrible Kinect I know that goes without

00:25:48.719 --> 00:25:53.669
saying I suppose but it was a worse

00:25:50.849 --> 00:25:57.329
Kinect but at the time I was like is

00:25:53.669 --> 00:25:58.669
incredible the novelty was there and you

00:25:57.329 --> 00:26:01.820
know you weren't

00:25:58.669 --> 00:26:03.899
it didn't seem like that bad of a deal I

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:05.399
don't know my parents were the ones

00:26:03.899 --> 00:26:07.440
signing the checks at that point let's

00:26:05.399 --> 00:26:10.289
be honest so I have no idea to be honest

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:12.089
but to me it always seemed like you know

00:26:10.289 --> 00:26:14.369
you might spend 40 or 50 bucks of the

00:26:12.089 --> 00:26:16.440
play diem you know because the kind of

00:26:14.369 --> 00:26:19.999
crappy games were 25 cents each but some

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.999
of the ones that have props were $1.00

00:26:22.099 --> 00:26:29.940
dude Jacob's Ladder just relax a little

00:26:24.779 --> 00:26:31.679
bit we know these pretty flies okay

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:34.440
Metro visions okay so you might spend

00:26:31.679 --> 00:26:36.389
like 40 or 50 bucks on three or four

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:38.129
hours in the place it's not necessarily

00:26:36.389 --> 00:26:39.809
the cheapest day out but you know maybe

00:26:38.129 --> 00:26:42.269
not that much more expensive than going

00:26:39.809 --> 00:26:43.529
to see a movie at the time with the you

00:26:42.269 --> 00:26:46.379
know if you're paying for a few people I

00:26:43.529 --> 00:26:49.169
suppose joke read as only use Joker

00:26:46.379 --> 00:26:50.129
right now and see if we do oh oh hey no

00:26:49.169 --> 00:26:51.059
we're fine

00:26:50.129 --> 00:26:52.320
we don't need to take this because we

00:26:51.059 --> 00:26:53.579
have a hundred percent chance we should

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.169
have say the Joker for the next floor

00:26:53.579 --> 00:26:57.559
but it probably doesn't actually matter

00:26:55.169 --> 00:26:57.559
at all

00:27:01.539 --> 00:27:08.539
it seemed like a good deal at the time

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:09.919
now like pinball's sort of still around

00:27:08.539 --> 00:27:11.179
like there's some hipster bars in

00:27:09.919 --> 00:27:11.960
Vancouver that have pinball and that's

00:27:11.179 --> 00:27:13.130
really cool

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.659
because you go there and you go I'm

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:16.070
going to be awesome at pinball and then

00:27:14.659 --> 00:27:17.630
you play pinball and you're like people

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:19.789
it's hard there's like a lot of

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:22.789
intricacy and also these machines are

00:27:19.789 --> 00:27:27.289
beautiful works of functional art but

00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:29.630
now like more stuff online we a couple

00:27:27.289 --> 00:27:30.860
of years ago me Josh Michael Fox and a

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:34.330
few of our friends went to Niagara Falls

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:37.159
and they have like an arcade sort of

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:41.240
thing in downtown Agra Falls in the

00:27:37.159 --> 00:27:44.570
Canadian side but the arcade sucks like

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:47.419
it's not games anymore in the same vein

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:49.309
as like arcade games like I know that

00:27:47.419 --> 00:27:51.500
sounded like a ridiculous sentence like

00:27:49.309 --> 00:27:54.380
the big machine the marquee machine that

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:55.250
this Boston Pizza arcade was like Deal

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:59.779
or No Deal

00:27:55.250 --> 00:28:05.149
so you go there and you like pick a case

00:27:59.779 --> 00:28:08.600
and then the computer offers you 50% -

00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:10.669
one of what the added up value of the

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:12.470
average value of the remaining cases and

00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:14.299
then you say no and then they go you

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:16.279
want a million dollars and you get like

00:28:14.299 --> 00:28:19.909
a bunch of tickets but it's not really

00:28:16.279 --> 00:28:22.580
that enjoyable there's no skill

00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:24.289
necessarily Deal or No Deal is a game

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:28.279
show I will always harp on there's no

00:28:24.289 --> 00:28:32.720
skill whatsoever involved in literally

00:28:28.279 --> 00:28:36.890
is like dice roll the game the the

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:38.890
banker calls you up and goes hey the

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:42.020
average value of the remaining cases is

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:45.440
$15,000 we're going to offer you 14,500

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:48.380
are you willing to you know take on a

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:50.240
level of risk knowing that we're trying

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.820
to sucker you just a little bit like

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:54.799
it's the most stupid anyway look if you

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:56.499
love to Deal or No Deal more power to

00:28:54.799 --> 00:28:58.639
you

00:28:56.499 --> 00:29:00.559
it doesn't make for a good arcade

00:28:58.639 --> 00:29:02.629
cabinet it was like that and doodle jump

00:29:00.559 --> 00:29:04.879
and then the Guitar Hero arcade cabinet

00:29:02.629 --> 00:29:06.619
where I put in a dollar and then

00:29:04.879 --> 00:29:08.269
accidentally hit the green button too

00:29:06.619 --> 00:29:10.519
many times messing around and ended up

00:29:08.269 --> 00:29:14.659
having to play slow ride by Foghat

00:29:10.519 --> 00:29:16.159
uneasy which is just about like that was

00:29:14.659 --> 00:29:19.309
probably the worst dollar I've ever

00:29:16.159 --> 00:29:23.259
spent in my life if I'm being honest and

00:29:19.309 --> 00:29:23.259
I've I've thrown some dollars away

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:30.649
anyway I lament the loss we are kids the

00:29:28.489 --> 00:29:32.289
problem is I think people always go we

00:29:30.649 --> 00:29:35.619
should bring them back

00:29:32.289 --> 00:29:37.700
you know bar-kays kind of exists but

00:29:35.619 --> 00:29:39.309
maybe they're gone for a reason maybe

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:42.739
they're better left in the past

00:29:39.309 --> 00:29:47.389
what was that enemy the little white

00:29:42.739 --> 00:29:49.519
circle maybe it's better a you know

00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:53.619
meant as a memories of what it meant to

00:29:49.519 --> 00:29:53.619
me when I tried so hard and cut so far

00:29:54.460 --> 00:30:02.119
because like it is kind of nice to have

00:29:56.749 --> 00:30:03.230
a communal space where you could where

00:30:02.119 --> 00:30:04.820
you could like get together with

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:06.139
like-minded individuals and plate things

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.879
now we play it in the privacy of our own

00:30:06.139 --> 00:30:09.350
home there's nothing wrong with that you

00:30:07.879 --> 00:30:11.600
know we get the socializing from being

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:13.519
online but you know when the arcade you

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:16.460
weren't going hey I fudged your mother

00:30:13.519 --> 00:30:18.320
you fudging idiot blah blah blah my

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:21.019
trash Todd game needs some work to be

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:22.940
fair but you know in this day and age I

00:30:21.019 --> 00:30:24.710
can't I don't know I play player unknown

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:26.739
battlegrounds with a voice on sometimes

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:30.139
it just makes me want to die

00:30:26.739 --> 00:30:31.639
people said I've talked to one guy he

00:30:30.139 --> 00:30:34.970
said hey do you want a piece of my hot

00:30:31.639 --> 00:30:36.679
dog pizza and I said no and he he didn't

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:38.269
respond to that but he was making some

00:30:36.679 --> 00:30:40.850
noise into the microphone it made me
