00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.750
hey everybody welcome back Sonoran lion

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.299
place defining classic at birth plus we

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.980
are just steamrolling these remaining

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.139
challenges with speed out of the way we

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.690
have I rule which we have not ever done

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:18.359
before it looks so easy it goes to mega

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.859
satan knows this is we take inventory

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.260
mom's knife with base stats guardian

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:34.260
shield oh it's I rule like high rule

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:35.430
like The Legend of Zelda I see ok I

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.070
remember this

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.780
I also remember this being not difficult

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.340
which I'm hoping is gonna add to the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.590
streak of successful challenges in

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.260
videos here obviously I mean if we're

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.270
gonna get picky I did lose on the speed

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.370
challenge in the last episode but we

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.020
also won on the speed challenge in the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.239
last episode it just took us a couple of

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.829
tries and if you're not gonna cut me

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.090
some slack on the speed challenge well I

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.760
just don't know what to tell you at that

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.379
point there are negatives that we have

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.530
here we start with the ladder as well I

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.030
just realized but the the big negative

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.150
is probably no item rooms

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.549
the second big negative is I hesitate to

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.470
even call it a negative but okay the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.310
second like almost objective negative is

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.930
we have to go all the way to make a

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.530
Satan which makes this a little bit more

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.150
of a a tricky proposition the third

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.650
thing is that and this is more debatable

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.740
the boomerang just really isn't that

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.630
good it's not bad though it's not like I

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.189
can sit here and say that having the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.200
boomerang is a detriment it's just a

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.860
space bar item that is not particularly

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.810
strong but in many ways it actually

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.390
suffers from the fact that our run is so

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.850
good that it doesn't get the flaunted

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.540
strengths as much because if our run was

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.140
worse than our damage was like garbage

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.880
we would probably end up using well that

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.560
was such a bad play on my part we'd

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.719
probably end up using the boomerang to

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.850
freeze enemies but instead we're just

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.009
never doing that because we don't have

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.180
to do that you know the the knife is

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.219
killing most enemies including

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.580
apparently champion rag man in one or

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.760
two hits so it takes us to five cents

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.670
which gives us a good crack at don't

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.260
take that out of context

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.330
it gives us a good chance a good

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.010
opportunity shall we say at getting a

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.330
deal with the devil on the next floor

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.970
and by deal with the devil of course I

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:28.750
mean arcade we also have a second secret

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:33.730
room with six red chests - spirit hearts

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:36.250
so not terrible puberty is fine perks is

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.780
okay oh you traded a bomb for two spirit

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.610
arts in a few flies the flies aren't

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.910
that valuable but either way it ended up

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.790
being a a unique second secret room

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.560
normally you end up with 12 red hearts

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.660
that you can't even pick up on this one

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.290
we were like a little bit more jazzed

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.850
right off the bat so this is one of

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.590
those weird it's kind of like I don't

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.580
want to be rude to this developers

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.670
because they've made a game that I

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.690
actually like loved and can play

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.720
indefinitely from now until the end of

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.280
time but it's kind of like a little bit

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.340
of a shoehorn challenge it's an

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.750
aesthetic challenge Wow I might actually

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.130
screw up my deal with the devil chance

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.810
but the the speed challenge as much as I

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:23.040
hate it and I think like a lot of it is

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:25.090
kind of poorly designed it's actually I

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.859
still have not ruined my deal with the

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.130
devil chance I'm so lucky it's still

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:32.200
like an interesting way to do the game

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.820
and I can say that now because of the

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.019
fact that I beat the challenge you never

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.310
have to touch it again so I don't really

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.720
have to put my money where my mouth is

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.299
you know what I mean

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.489
this is more like add these items are

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.680
like thematically semi related to one

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.630
another it's just it's not necessarily

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.660
unfun it's just a little bit on the easy

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.730
side because the items that are closely

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.470
related are not always well balanced for

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.870
one another like these are just too

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.640
strong you know if a sword is well

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.140
balanced it's very strong and forerun is

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.650
well balanced it's got positives and

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.530
negatives

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.859
this one is more positive than negative

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.170
without a doubt on planet earth so that

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.239
being said now that I've set myself up

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.670
for the easiest challenge of all time

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.859
let's find a way to end it in a negative

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.090
way for ourselves and make myself look

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:18.880
like a terrible player dude I

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.650
desperately needed that speed upgrade I

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.810
don't know why I'm walking into fire so

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.450
you know what it is speed challenge

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.410
hangover not saying that I should be

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.450
given card

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:34.150
launch forgiveness for any error I make

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:35.440
but think I am used to moving twice as

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.800
fast and it's kind of freaking me out

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.800
here

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:46.560
how is our HP right now by the way got a

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.880
little fast and furious oh we must have

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.290
well we only trained it to of it away so

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.910
we must have to read hearts and no

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.650
spirit hearts left right now or two red

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.850
hearts and a half of one spirit heart

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.890
left right I think we should have no

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.150
spirit hearts though please no curse of

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.120
the unknown one of the only things that

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:04.330
could actually destroy us we have one

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:08.170
and a half actually so kind of a scary

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:12.430
position but in that in doing this you

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:13.780
know this is a run that is long haul and

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.640
it's important to remember that on the

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.280
runs that only go to like mom's heart or

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.720
even to mom they do tend to be a little

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.010
bit easier cuz you know you haven't

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.680
gotten to the difficult part of the game

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:27.940
most of the time by then however if you

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.380
play as if it's gonna be a long run you

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.530
can sometimes create problems for

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.610
yourself just by virtue of the fact that

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.260
you know you take deals with the devil

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.090
pretty aggressively on an average run

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.630
and then you recoup the HP later or

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.760
recoup some sort of benefit later anyway

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.080
some of these runs if you go super

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.520
aggressive at the start you never

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.490
actually get a chance to recoup the

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.990
benefit before the run ends most of the

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.610
time that ends up not really being a

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.470
problem but it's just something to think

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.360
about so this one going all the way

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:59.740
means that being a little bit under

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.650
healthy I don't know what the word

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:05.560
there's got to be a more elegant word to

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.930
choose there but come on being a little

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.250
bit understated with respect to HP is

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.640
not the end of the world as long as you

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.640
survive

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:19.290
not great if you don't survive then we

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.000
start to have genuine problems you know

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.370
what this is a great opportunity to use

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.770
the boomerang for what it was meant to

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:30.810
do and it's also a great opportunity to

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:35.090
remember that you idiot you have the

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:37.530
Guardian shield or the Trinity shield

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.460
did you don't care en masse as Canadian

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:45.330
by the way

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:51.750
carry on my Annie Maas status treated in

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:55.230
the Matrix movies but yes we see the

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:58.140
thing is Trinity was carrie-anne moss

00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:00.450
Karia mosses Canadian it fits into the

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.710
NL s s bid did you know X was Canadian

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.270
people probably knew carrie-anne moss

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.740
was Canadian I don't know maybe they did

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:08.360
maybe they didn't magic mush thank you

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.540
very much thank you very much more like

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.920
hmm

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:17.490
no fake laughs aloud cuz it causes my

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.930
voice illness to rise up again you might

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.150
think hmm

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:23.340
pardon me my thing NL's been sick for a

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.710
while not the case recorded a lot of

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:29.340
Isaac today so if I'm sounded better

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:32.520
dude I'm feeling better I so died first

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:35.520
off thank you for the compliment it's

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:37.050
not always the best you suffered through

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.030
a video and then people die sounds like

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.370
garbage I get that I do but at the same

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:42.570
time it's like well I guess I shouldn't

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.160
have done it at all I should have just

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:46.740
rested pills are em I don't know why I'm

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.560
talking like John Wayne but ya know I'm

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:52.380
feeling part from some congestion I'm

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:59.310
feeling like back to normal which is a

00:07:52.380 --> 00:08:00.660
pretty snap recovery for uh for my

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.310
standards but I talked about that a few

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:04.760
episodes ago so we don't need to go down

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.760
that road again

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:14.880
really just eager to find the boss here

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:18.150
it's an excel floor so once we're done

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.890
with this floor we're pretty rapidly

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:21.450
approaching I wouldn't say the end of

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:23.340
the game but the next phase of the game

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:25.290
you know when we hit the womb and I

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:28.470
would like to go to the shop but I don't

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:30.810
need to do it on an amnesia curse of the

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:32.760
labyrinth kind of like take a quick pee

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:36.810
pup here and see if there's anything

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:40.350
that fits the bill but with no shop here

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:41.880
I will probably just vacate I expect

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:45.150
this to kind of be what an easier one to

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:48.570
tick off the list we're still better off

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:49.980
with the cancer trinket and another win

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:53.760
condition for us by the way that I have

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:56.040
not talked about is if we can just get a

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:59.190
high enough luck stat or a space bar

00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.960
item like dull razor we should be able

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.640
to get a lot of black hearts which

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:06.360
basically I mean I don't want to say it

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:10.040
guarantees our survival but it makes us

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:13.440
much much more likely to survive

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:16.770
thank you trinity shield just by virtue

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:18.390
of the fact that i mean we have more HP

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.070
i was gonna get a little bit more

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:23.130
conversationally elegant than that but

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:25.200
it seemed unnecessary definitely did not

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:27.660
beat the odds but decreased rate of fire

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.850
as well as an extra spirit heart leaves

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:32.820
us very well equipped for the task at

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:35.610
hand sorry I was a little far away from

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:37.260
my microphone there hopefully it didn't

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:41.070
sound like I was in a glass case of

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:45.200
emotion Stephen is a totally adequate

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:47.220
and acceptable damage upgrade 1.69

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:50.130
it's the first damage upgrade we've

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:53.240
gotten all run so I'm not gonna turn on

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:57.050
my nose at it like the antagonists in

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:59.430
Avril Lavigne's magnum opus skater boy

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:01.700
did you know she probably knew she was

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.700
Canadian

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:10.249
that's my guess anyway I mean she always

00:10:08.569 --> 00:10:13.189
talks about it in all her songs she's

00:10:10.249 --> 00:10:17.269
like well I have to make everything so

00:10:13.189 --> 00:10:19.370
complicated you know we're always saying

00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:21.470
eh that's the Kamiya we're always so

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:26.959
nice and we're always saying eh and

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:29.629
we're just so friendly oh I went to a

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:34.670
fight in a hockey game broke out your

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:36.290
frickin hoser originally this bit in my

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:38.990
head was concocted with me just slowly

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:43.220
going insane getting increasingly

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:44.689
Canadian oh you want some extra sugar

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:47.360
with your double-double why don't you

00:10:44.689 --> 00:10:50.889
just call it a triple triple a bud and

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:54.470
then I decided I don't have the my

00:10:50.889 --> 00:10:56.149
illness wracked throat does not have the

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:58.670
energy with which to tackle that bit

00:10:56.149 --> 00:11:00.110
with the tenacity it deserves

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:07.009
so that'll that'll have to wait for a

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:09.559
later day you've got a love blank card

00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:11.929
and if we get an extra penny which I

00:11:09.559 --> 00:11:14.660
know we will combine that with

00:11:11.929 --> 00:11:19.459
strengthen it's pretty good toasted over

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:20.899
flames would be tasted quite nice I was

00:11:19.459 --> 00:11:24.290
gonna say we want Emperor but I still

00:11:20.899 --> 00:11:27.470
like I really do have like a hangover

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:29.600
from the speedrun in my head I'm like we

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.829
need to go fast there's two reasons we

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.970
don't need to go fast one is it is in

00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:34.730
the speech challenge the other one is

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:36.559
we're on the depths 1 10 minutes and 15

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:38.569
seconds into the run so we're already

00:11:36.559 --> 00:11:42.379
going fast and that's not really a

00:11:38.569 --> 00:11:44.870
product of the run being the the

00:11:42.379 --> 00:11:46.309
challenge being happening here or of me

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.769
playing particularly quickly it's just

00:11:46.309 --> 00:11:50.120
the fact that we have mom's knife so you

00:11:48.769 --> 00:11:51.559
know we're gonna tear enemies up pretty

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.779
easily plus we have no 1 cent of the

00:11:51.559 --> 00:11:56.839
backtrack once we've gone to the shop

00:11:53.779 --> 00:12:00.050
because there are no item rooms in the

00:11:56.839 --> 00:12:03.470
first place so the faster we can hook up

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:05.829
our boss fight here the happier we

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.829
become

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:16.890
that was really dumb but it served the

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:19.650
purpose taking that damage served a

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:22.470
purpose it reminded me that I picked up

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:25.830
a thing so if we could find a way to

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:29.700
make that work into our plans then that

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:32.400
would be worth considering but for now I

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:34.170
mean I kind of struggling kommentera Lee

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.180
here not just because of a record a lot

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.800
of Isaac today to begin with but because

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.240
the Canadian bid went off the rails but

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.730
then also on top of that because of the

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.690
fact that the run is just good like it's

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:46.890
3hp

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:48.600
great rate of fire and mom's knife like

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:51.870
you didn't decent damage on top of that

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:54.360
as well but it ends up just being a run

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:56.850
that is good like you can't really say

00:12:54.360 --> 00:13:00.060
that much more about it right now it's

00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:04.980
not so outrageously strong that it's

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:06.390
above reproach but it's certainly not

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:11.490
the kind of run of which you can write

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:13.770
you know tomes and tomes it's like not

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:15.480
an elaborate meal but not so simple as

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:17.700
to be you know some jiro Dreams of Sushi

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:25.170
sort of stuff NL dreams of Isaac you

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:27.030
know more damaged and closer to spun now

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:29.400
you got a you got to question yourself

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:31.020
on this one so first I mean we got

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.750
plenty of time is the important thing

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:37.130
and you pop this and you see what this

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:37.130
guy's got for sale

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:52.200
I'm hoping that he might have battery

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:54.930
charges for sale but I'm scared come on

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:57.540
two hearts Joker card actually pretty

00:13:54.930 --> 00:14:00.920
good blank card Joker is very solid I

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:04.650
think we're gonna strength up then and

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:07.170
I'm realizing now what do we care about

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:12.300
getting deaths touch it's it's mostly

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:13.800
irrelevant all he's done it that's a

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:18.029
stroke of luck we would have survived

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:20.930
probably no matter what but this is a

00:14:18.029 --> 00:14:23.100
it's much nicer to get this I think

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:24.570
blank card a waz would allow us to

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.610
finish the run in like record time but

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:29.100
that's not on our to-do list what is on

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:31.170
our to-do list is getting there with

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:33.390
safety okay now that we got some extra

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:36.390
survivability I'm gonna take deaths

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:37.910
touch for the extra damage even though

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:40.380
it might seem like a little bit

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:42.210
unnecessary and they we went from like

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:44.130
why would we take it our HP is too low

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:45.930
and that's dangerous too why wouldn't we

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:48.150
take it we have so much HP that like it

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.870
would be a pretty big surprise to see us

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.640
die here

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:52.170
although I now realize that having

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:55.620
gotten rid of our strength card that's

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:57.180
not actually the case we under the

00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:01.710
illusion of thinking we had a lot of HP

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:02.790
when we actually sort of don't and we're

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:04.470
under the illusion of thinking we had a

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:11.520
lot of damage when we actually sort of

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:13.920
don't I mean not bad damage but not

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:15.570
particularly good either this is pretty

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.700
much what we want right here a Krampus

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:18.960
fight anything is fine

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:21.959
we know we're gonna have a deal with the

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:24.120
devil because of the fact that we got

00:15:21.959 --> 00:15:25.620
the blank our Joker which means that we

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.300
probably definitely did not need to take

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:29.490
Goathead but it means we could replace

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:32.070
this card with any other card as we see

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:36.390
fit and and may well do so um the here a

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:38.790
font please but this will we're kind of

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:40.830
in like a classic little mid-game limbo

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:43.770
here and to be in this limbo is a

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:46.209
privilege because it reminds me of non

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:48.759
challenge runs

00:15:46.209 --> 00:15:51.309
you know take me home country roads etc

00:15:48.759 --> 00:15:53.439
etc I'm feel in my wheelhouse now

00:15:51.309 --> 00:15:56.319
not everything is crystal clear as to

00:15:53.439 --> 00:15:58.420
whether or not this runs gonna you know

00:15:56.319 --> 00:16:00.850
fulfill its Brown it and promise 100%

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:02.889
but that's the same thing with life man

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:04.269
life is ambiguous we don't know you know

00:16:02.889 --> 00:16:08.740
one minute you could be on top of the

00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:13.029
world one minute you could be even ham

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:14.319
out of a dumpster that might be top of

00:16:13.029 --> 00:16:15.819
the world for you you know I don't know

00:16:14.319 --> 00:16:18.579
how you choose to live your life but

00:16:15.819 --> 00:16:21.850
either way you got to be comfortable

00:16:18.579 --> 00:16:23.499
with the with the dice rolls that that

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:28.869
life may throw at you you know why

00:16:23.499 --> 00:16:32.019
because you got no choice you can you

00:16:28.869 --> 00:16:34.990
can steel yourself and brace for impact

00:16:32.019 --> 00:16:36.999
but in the end you know the twists and

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:41.139
turns are gonna give you a whiplash you

00:16:36.999 --> 00:16:42.429
just gotta go limp and let yourself lay

00:16:41.139 --> 00:16:43.959
your body gets sucked out of the sunroof

00:16:42.429 --> 00:16:49.290
in case of rollover look I don't know

00:16:43.959 --> 00:16:52.540
what I'm talking about but the point is

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:54.009
as we slay these enemies we're gonna

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:55.379
teleport out of boss rush we already

00:16:54.009 --> 00:16:57.850
know our deal with the devil's trash

00:16:55.379 --> 00:17:00.069
because it has nothing in it nothing

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:02.439
that we haven't already taken uh I

00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:04.539
actually like don't want to take damage

00:17:02.439 --> 00:17:07.539
to pick up any of these I know that

00:17:04.539 --> 00:17:10.299
seems like it's a bit of a you know

00:17:07.539 --> 00:17:12.159
babies way out but none of the items are

00:17:10.299 --> 00:17:13.240
that good with moms knife a couple of

00:17:12.159 --> 00:17:14.409
them were really good if we didn't have

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.449
moms knife but none of them are that

00:17:14.409 --> 00:17:22.149
good with moms knife and on top of that

00:17:16.449 --> 00:17:23.289
yeah let's go nuts dude okay in

00:17:22.149 --> 00:17:26.439
hindsight we shouldn't have gone nuts

00:17:23.289 --> 00:17:28.120
there plus 0.79 damages in the whole

00:17:26.439 --> 00:17:35.169
scheme of things actually like worth

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:38.220
noting okay so we just oh no not our now

00:17:35.169 --> 00:17:41.919
stay strong this is real bad

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:45.850
stay strong um I mean this is what's

00:17:41.919 --> 00:17:49.000
wrong NL I thought you was keepin it's a

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:51.940
knee I thought that's what you won't in

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.789
the end I'd overly aggressively trade it

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:57.429
into a bad deal with the devil and here

00:17:54.789 --> 00:18:00.249
we are paying the price but we're also

00:17:57.429 --> 00:18:03.289
not dead yet

00:18:00.249 --> 00:18:05.179
I'll level with you I think there is a

00:18:03.289 --> 00:18:07.210
nonzero chance I could go the rest of

00:18:05.179 --> 00:18:10.159
this run without taking a single hit

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:12.799
some rooms it's really not even a

00:18:10.159 --> 00:18:15.139
product of my own play right now some

00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:18.499
rooms are just very tough draws to not

00:18:15.139 --> 00:18:20.059
get hit on in particular uh this this

00:18:18.499 --> 00:18:22.909
one shouldn't be too bad with that enemy

00:18:20.059 --> 00:18:32.509
could take us out at the at the best of

00:18:22.909 --> 00:18:34.009
times any enemy that I'm done yeah I

00:18:32.509 --> 00:18:35.989
mean I got to accept that that's pretty

00:18:34.009 --> 00:18:38.599
much my own fault I hate to do it but

00:18:35.989 --> 00:18:43.369
I'll restart here that one burns me and

00:18:38.599 --> 00:18:46.009
it's it feels bad to even say it's 100%

00:18:43.369 --> 00:18:47.839
my own fault just way way way too

00:18:46.009 --> 00:18:51.739
aggressive on that deal with the devil

00:18:47.839 --> 00:18:53.029
but you know what it's alright it's good

00:18:51.739 --> 00:18:56.029
to have that you know you are also

00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:58.099
mortal moment and remind myself not to

00:18:56.029 --> 00:18:59.929
play like an idiot see I told you what

00:18:58.099 --> 00:19:01.940
did I tell you like 15 minutes ago as I

00:18:59.929 --> 00:19:03.799
was setting this run up I was like now

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:05.599
that I've set myself up for the easiest

00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:08.749
run of all time let's ruin it and make

00:19:05.599 --> 00:19:10.460
it make it question my mental health or

00:19:08.749 --> 00:19:12.289
something like that it ended up being a

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.849
product of two mistakes and

00:19:12.289 --> 00:19:15.229
unfortunately for me those mistakes have

00:19:13.849 --> 00:19:18.469
been very close together the first one

00:19:15.229 --> 00:19:20.149
was I took dark matter when there was no

00:19:18.469 --> 00:19:22.429
reason to take dark matter and in

00:19:20.149 --> 00:19:25.429
hindsight that looks very foolish the

00:19:22.429 --> 00:19:27.080
second one is walking on the spikes

00:19:25.429 --> 00:19:29.479
immediately after taking dark matter

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:31.999
which is just silly because we literally

00:19:29.479 --> 00:19:33.889
just walked through that room but either

00:19:31.999 --> 00:19:37.809
way this runs shaping up weirdly we got

00:19:33.889 --> 00:19:40.009
nine lives already a couple dad with a

00:19:37.809 --> 00:19:43.070
strong chance at a deal with the devil

00:19:40.009 --> 00:19:46.879
on the next floor we might be looking at

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:49.070
an early game guppy here well let's not

00:19:46.879 --> 00:19:51.649
get ahead of ourselves calling this you

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:54.289
know a cause for an early game guppy is

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:57.349
maybe a little bit over the top already

00:19:54.289 --> 00:20:00.589
yeah okay especially now but I'm gonna

00:19:57.349 --> 00:20:02.359
take IV bag instead of boomerang because

00:20:00.589 --> 00:20:04.190
I think boomerang is a bad space bar

00:20:02.359 --> 00:20:05.629
item I think IV bag is actually an aid

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:07.669
to your space bar item I've come around

00:20:05.629 --> 00:20:09.379
to it in a big way looks good

00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:11.179
range is good let's head down to the

00:20:09.379 --> 00:20:12.340
next floor I'm ready for whatever this

00:20:11.179 --> 00:20:14.170
runs thrown at me

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:19.540
one thing I'm not leaving this video

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:22.030
without having completed I rule this

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:25.180
video will not end with I rule being

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:28.660
like on incomplete if it takes me 15

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:30.520
tries it's happening the reasoning for

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.930
this is extremely simple it's just

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.730
embarrassing they have to take more than

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:37.090
one crack at this in the first place

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:38.860
okay well you know what apparently one

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:46.840
luck is not quite as transformative as I

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:50.490
thought it was stay cool with the knife

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.490
here you know what you're doing with it

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:57.730
just gotta stay nimble keep you on your

00:20:55.630 --> 00:21:02.020
toes stay frosty to those mean the same

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:03.970
thing probably HP please thank you

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:06.220
playing fast and loose with our HP

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:08.710
because losing a few lives heck losing

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:10.090
like eight lives on this early floor

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:12.220
probably is unlikely to make a

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:15.220
difference the best way to lose these

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:16.570
lives is Folgers in your cup but

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.880
actually the best way to lose these

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:22.090
lives would be to get really aggressive

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:24.970
on some deals with the devil that is of

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:26.740
the devil variety good enough we're

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:30.130
gonna go burn penny even though I want a

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:32.890
couple of different things in here yeah

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:36.160
yeah that's really good okay grab this

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:39.010
we can make this work so chaos is

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:42.100
excellent it's also a ladder which is

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:44.380
ironic cuz we already have it let me go

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:49.360
a little aggressive here cuz we're

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:49.840
getting wicked bombs sure I see what

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.970
you're saying

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:54.180
child's heart could be valuable with IV

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:54.180
bag

00:21:55.210 --> 00:22:00.500
kind of a nasty get there okay blow you

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:05.360
up red hearts no red hearts plenty of

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:07.400
keys though excuse me sir uh okay I

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.930
think we have very little to worry about

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.490
right now we got a little less HP than

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:12.230
we started but with chaos plus nine

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:14.180
lives I mean the odds of getting a guppy

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:16.910
item now are through the roof and

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:19.400
actually it's really nice because our

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:22.190
deal with the devil chance isn't that

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:24.320
relevant anymore it does give you more

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:26.030
cracks at items but with every item in

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.340
every pool being scrambled we don't

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:29.840
really have any reason to pay attention

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:31.760
to deals with the devil more than

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.200
anything else in fact if anything we

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:36.230
have less reason to pay attention to

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:38.270
deals with the devil because they cost

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:40.250
us money but have the same pool as

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:42.680
everything else because that's HP I

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:46.580
should say but have the same pool as

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:51.200
everything else so it's not a great

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:52.100
choice I think at least damage would be

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.070
amazing

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:57.590
mom's contact is probably even better as

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:59.300
a standalone we will take PJ's just for

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:02.060
the spear and hard gain early on here so

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:04.190
it also gives us precedent we could have

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:06.380
gone for deals with the angel but in

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:11.690
fact you probably should have but here

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:15.890
we are so I see IV bag right now is kind

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:21.760
of like a bomb generator and maybe -

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:25.010
thank you I mean bless me maybe also a

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.750
luck generator I guess we should really

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:29.870
see it for what it is on the base level

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:33.410
which is a money generator and we could

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:35.540
use that for our space bar item purposes

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:37.280
and the shop purposes is what I mean to

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:39.890
say all right brain is shutting down

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.480
that's okay all we got to do is ride

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:44.270
this one to completion we got a lot more

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:46.550
HP a ton more survivability than we used

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:47.630
to have we will absolutely take sin

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:50.650
robes I know it seems like we're

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:50.650
probably making similar mistakes

00:23:51.929 --> 00:23:57.659
I disagree I think sin robes is a

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:59.730
valuable pickup and I think all you need

00:23:57.659 --> 00:24:02.330
to do is look at our HP to recognize why

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:06.029
even if it does sort of squander IV bag

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:08.549
IV bag has plenty of time to come back

00:24:06.029 --> 00:24:12.690
and fulfill its its true purpose here

00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:16.019
which is I don't know still is still

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:19.039
nebulous like the resolution to a George

00:24:16.019 --> 00:24:19.039
RR Martin's story

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:31.559
locust of death is good sorry locust a

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:35.790
famine in fact it might not just be good

00:24:31.559 --> 00:24:37.890
it might be really good even if our

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:42.210
flies are only doing like five I guess

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:50.190
it's ten point four damage per per fly

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:53.370
it's solid and enough to make a dense

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:54.660
even emboss HP I think I would also and

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:56.940
this is getting a little selfish at this

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:58.600
point but I wouldn't mind getting some

00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:00.290
form of mapping on this run

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:02.280
[Music]

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:05.160
hopefully this still gives us a devil

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:07.500
item from the original pool because we

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:09.660
actually have the capability to just

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:11.760
destroy mega satan as is right now virus

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:13.110
is totally fine by me we already peeped

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:15.000
that we'll head down the next floor

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:18.120
alrighty alrighty alrighty we're in a

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.679
good spot virus is mostly for the spun

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:21.720
transformation I think at this point but

00:25:19.679 --> 00:25:24.660
running into enemies and maybe getting

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:29.400
demon hearts it's not inconceivable we

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:30.870
have one luck just kind of like for

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.340
whatever reason feel more comfortable on

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:34.290
this run that I did on the last one

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:37.980
maybe because on the last one I gave

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:39.780
away all of my HP especially like after

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:41.580
saying that it's dangerous to give away

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:44.370
all of your HP on these challenge runs

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:50.370
but I digress it turns out your bully

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:52.500
isn't that bright easier to talk about

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:58.590
what to do from an optimal situation

00:25:52.500 --> 00:26:00.419
than actually completed apparently not

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:02.370
gonna be opening golden chests I think

00:26:00.419 --> 00:26:04.590
if you give me like a golden chest and a

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:06.570
little amuse-bouche on top of it I might

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:12.500
consider it but a golden chest just

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:12.500
alone not particularly interested

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:29.650
we're just gonna keep it moving here

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:31.870
because essentially we are good to go I

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:33.820
mean if we were doing this on a normal

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:34.930
run how would we feel right now we'd

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:38.740
probably be in the middle of some kind

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:40.840
of song parody for like you know Allison

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:44.560
chains dem bones or something like that

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:47.020
I feel so carry got mom's knife on my

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:49.750
challenge run in doo dee dee dee dee dee

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:51.490
doo dee dee doo dee doo doo yeah that's

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:56.470
two different songs now that last one

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:59.710
became love I rule is a challenge run

00:26:56.470 --> 00:27:01.360
dude du couteau and that's like now is

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:03.340
in the air tonight for some reason um

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:06.690
hey I have too much money

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:08.830
give me a shop so I may spend my money

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:11.670
that was not a good way to handle that

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:14.470
we definitely do not need monkeys pop I

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:16.690
need to spend some of this because

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:22.900
that's like one of the main values of

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:24.940
having chaos is because we can get all

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.320
these amazing deal with the devil or

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:28.390
item room or boss term etcetera etcetera

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:31.120
or angel room for that matter items

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:34.260
anywhere particularly on shops I mean it

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:36.490
comes in handy on greed mode mostly but

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:40.600
it might just be because it's a little

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:43.840
closer in memory okay what have you got

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:46.230
for me nothing of value and it makes me

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.230
very sad

00:27:48.169 --> 00:27:55.009
I was just gonna say mid concocting of

00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:57.739
why it was a positive thing to use the

00:27:55.009 --> 00:28:03.230
chariot there the virus actually came

00:27:57.739 --> 00:28:04.419
out with some value because I'm all

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:07.159
about value

00:28:04.419 --> 00:28:09.379
Burt campers got the mad hits you try to

00:28:07.159 --> 00:28:11.210
match with you try to hold me but I bust

00:28:09.379 --> 00:28:13.039
through there we go we finally got a

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:16.789
shop or at the very least a library

00:28:13.039 --> 00:28:18.049
either one of which is actually worth

00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:20.289
something cuz it's not like we're using

00:28:18.049 --> 00:28:24.830
IV bag for anything

00:28:20.289 --> 00:28:26.779
mr. dolly good enough head of the keeper

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:28.759
probably not good enough but I'm gonna

00:28:26.779 --> 00:28:30.230
take it anyway and the two of spades

00:28:28.759 --> 00:28:31.489
which eight keys should be more than

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:36.019
enough for whatever we need for the rest

00:28:31.489 --> 00:28:39.559
of the game so we can take it which I

00:28:36.019 --> 00:28:40.909
have to admit I was a little surprised

00:28:39.559 --> 00:28:44.059
we could even fit it but I guess you've

00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:51.440
taken more damage than I'd like to admit

00:28:44.059 --> 00:28:52.789
recently you might find me the Smerch in

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.409
the good name of consumables and you

00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:56.389
know what I was gonna concoct a reason

00:28:54.409 --> 00:28:58.789
for why that I think that that's an okay

00:28:56.389 --> 00:29:00.289
thing to do but that's a bad habit we

00:28:58.789 --> 00:29:05.080
got one floor left where shop still

00:29:00.289 --> 00:29:07.340
matter so we got nothing to justify here

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:09.259
you should just go back and do the right

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.940
thing keep your fundamentals strong this

00:29:09.259 --> 00:29:13.970
man it would be so embarrassing to fail

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:15.649
a challenge like I rule I mean I died

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:17.059
but that was on my practice right oh you

00:29:15.649 --> 00:29:18.799
guys didn't know about the practice run

00:29:17.059 --> 00:29:20.629
every time you do a challenge you get

00:29:18.799 --> 00:29:22.879
one free practice run usually I don't

00:29:20.629 --> 00:29:27.340
televise them but on account of my

00:29:22.879 --> 00:29:30.499
illness I thought okay did they buy it

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:31.879
deaths touch kind of oh you know what

00:29:30.499 --> 00:29:34.070
disregard I was gonna say kind of bad

00:29:31.879 --> 00:29:40.899
because of the speed downgrade but no

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:47.440
problem here dev Stu I got very little

00:29:40.899 --> 00:29:50.330
kicking around in my brain the big thing

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:53.029
dude we have twelve twelve twelve the

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:54.590
big thing consumables that is kicking

00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:56.659
around on my brain is some form of

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:59.760
mapping and maybe that's motivated by a

00:29:56.659 --> 00:30:02.200
deep-seated impatience but

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:05.740
you know we got a long run ahead of us

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:07.960
nonetheless it basically goes to the

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:11.080
chest it mega satan runs it's hard to

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:13.540
remember but they probably tend to be a

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:14.800
little bit shorter than chest runs to

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:16.150
begin with because most of the time you

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:18.510
don't end up doing the rest of the rooms

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:21.100
on the chest so I would say that

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:23.230
probably around the same length as a

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:25.750
chest run at this point we're only on

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:27.760
the depths to 38 minutes in or so 30

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:30.720
minutes in okay well I'm clearly like my

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:35.950
internal clock is totally messed up

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:38.500
hello my glands I can only get away with

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:38.830
that excuse for like another 36 hours at

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:44.800
most

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:46.870
judging by my current trajectory so and

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.640
dude I'm not old I keep saying that

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:50.620
hopefully I'll be doing this career long

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:53.650
enough to one day say I'm a little old

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:55.480
if I got up in the mid 30s and and

00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:57.820
beyond you start to I think you start to

00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:00.220
accept that you're in the little old

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:03.460
category at that point I mean you're

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:09.370
young for like a CEOs age no question

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:12.370
but you know you're older than if you

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:14.170
were in the college class you would

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:16.090
probably have a good chance of being the

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:17.830
oldest person well it's a class Willis

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:19.780
60 year old ones yeah but I took classes

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:21.760
where like a 22 year old was the oldest

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:23.350
as well I say that with love I say that

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:25.180
as a person too at night classes you

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:28.660
know as we speak well not literally as

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:30.220
we speak well you know what I mean but

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:31.390
at that point you know if you're 35 and

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:32.770
you're in a college class if you look

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:34.560
around and you're like I don't see any

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:37.720
old dudes you're probably the old dude

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:42.510
and that's okay you know never never let

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:42.510
society keep you from bettering yourself

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:53.350
turned out to not be a golden decision

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:57.460
here but I'm no yeah we didn't take that

00:31:53.350 --> 00:32:00.130
much damage but I'm at the point where

00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:04.360
when I was younger if I got a if I got a

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:07.180
cold say like I'm 13 you get a cold when

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:09.430
you're 13 come home from school you feel

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:10.930
fine an hour later you got like the

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:12.340
sneezing and coughing you take the next

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:14.309
day off school you wake up the day after

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:16.900
that you're good like a hundred percent

00:32:14.309 --> 00:32:19.150
now I'm like a cold is like a three or

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:21.309
four day thing for me and I'm still like

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:22.660
stunned when I get better not because I

00:32:21.309 --> 00:32:24.610
think I'm never gonna get better but

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:27.660
because I'm like oh that's like not a

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:30.370
week of being addled by some you know

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:33.250
semi annoying affliction none of that's

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:35.020
good enough okay head down here I'm also

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:37.090
we didn't get really anything that I

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:41.500
asked for and that's okay but if I could

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:45.490
get a speed upgrade our speed is quite

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:49.170
slow right now we'd like to achieve an

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:51.490
upgrade of the speed variety please

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:56.040
whatever dude if we it was either that

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:56.040
or use a bomb and dodge like 30 shots so

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:08.030
none of them are good the wheel fortune

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:09.770
is like potentially good later because

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:12.350
if we make it to the chest we can use

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:14.360
that get one extra item before the mega

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:17.210
stand fight which we're still well

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:19.130
equipped for we just could use a little

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:21.380
bit more speed in case it's not

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:28.280
abundantly clear I think I'm also gonna

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:29.600
ditch locust of famine which like I'm

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:31.760
not gonna throw it under the bus

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:33.500
completely but a little bit of a whiff

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:44.030
considering like the value that I was

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:46.130
hoping it would bring instead we're

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:47.840
gonna roll mom's pearl which you know if

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:51.080
it even gives us one spear at heart I'm

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:54.770
a happy boy as such bad dodging okay

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:56.540
don't you forget about me and me in this

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:58.160
case is dodging don't forget about

00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:01.520
dodging it was a roundabout way to say

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:02.900
that just a good way to get in a song

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:08.890
that everybody knows from the English

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:12.679
beat so did you forget all about dodging

00:34:08.890 --> 00:34:17.330
hey George what have you changed there

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:21.890
dodging pot - just say me don't be

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:25.030
stupid Nigel the songs about dodgeball

00:34:21.890 --> 00:34:29.200
if we remove Dodge Halladay net

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:32.179
slanderous just a slanderous impression

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:35.950
but I'm suggesting that the English beef

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:43.570
contains two members and they're named

00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:48.890
Nigel and George the English beats

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:52.160
members they have infinity members Dave

Wesley McGowan and dave blockhead right

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:21.860
okay I was completely wrong also they

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:26.480
don't sing that don't you forget about

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:30.110
me don't you forget about me if I type

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:32.900
the lyrics in cadence to the words now

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:36.440
on that's the song by the Scottish rock

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:39.290
band Simple Minds I also see no Nigel

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:44.000
and no George so turns out I'm just an

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:45.620
idiot alright well I tried there there

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.360
may have been times in my past where

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:50.450
that kind of excursion would have

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:52.460
warranted either valuable information or

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:53.960
alternatively at least some vindication

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:57.610
that I was at least half correct but

00:35:53.960 --> 00:36:03.710
that time I I took a gamble and I lost

00:35:57.610 --> 00:36:05.300
it's how he's how she goes dude English

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:08.630
beat that save it for later that's right

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:10.880
save it for later I don't know the other

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:12.470
woods not home Zulu

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:14.780
it's from the Dumb and Dumber Sam now

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:17.780
dude though I'm going way back now I

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:21.470
think this actually might be a reference

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:27.410
to a tangent that I did like many

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:30.260
hundreds of episodes ago where I went on

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:31.610
a similar sojourn and ended up being

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:34.070
correct but I don't know at this point

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:38.240
I'm like 36 minutes in in the video my

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:42.200
brains starting to like melt down I'm

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:43.990
just begging for a speed upgrade it

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:46.280
doesn't have to be anything special

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:47.870
we got chaos we can have a little

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:52.090
literally the world's our oyster I'm

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:54.020
asking you can you give me like IV bag

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:56.030
we don't even have a good deal with the

00:36:54.020 --> 00:37:00.100
devil shot here not that the pool is

00:36:56.030 --> 00:37:00.100
really that exciting to begin with but

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:15.900
nice doing a lot of damage with the

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:22.280
knife here please yeah yeah that sort of

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:25.290
works no that dude here me out here

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:26.760
again not mad not mad

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:32.160
being mad on the internet is a cardinal

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:33.630
sin I'm too old for that however this is

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:37.950
like the worst design boss in this

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:41.280
freaking game it's a tiered delay

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:41.790
downgrade which is okay sure speed up

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:44.040
please

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:47.280
it gave us a speed-up all is forgiven on

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:49.380
planet earth the fact that that boss has

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:51.090
so many phases during which all you can

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:54.630
do is dodge turns it into like a puzzle

00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:56.400
fight instead of Isaac which I'm not

00:37:54.630 --> 00:38:02.390
bitter or anything but at the same time

00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:06.450
if you could just acquiesce excuse me I

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:12.450
think we should go for it we need better

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:13.740
cars or would like better cars you know

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:16.050
there's no reason for us to be trucking

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:17.970
around with these like temperance cards

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:22.050
or Wheel of Fortune giving us one item

00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:24.930
in a million years instead let's get

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:27.090
like one Emperor card makes up for not

00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:30.380
having a speed upgrade for twenty

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:30.380
freakin lifetimes

00:38:35.859 --> 00:38:40.759
I'll level with you you know you bully

00:38:38.689 --> 00:38:43.369
tries to tell it like it is but maybe a

00:38:40.759 --> 00:38:48.519
little bit of a positive spin

00:38:43.369 --> 00:38:48.519
but this runs a little bit on that

00:38:49.329 --> 00:38:55.669
wouldn't you say just a little bit like

00:38:51.979 --> 00:38:57.199
too easy right now and there's just it's

00:38:55.669 --> 00:38:59.239
the problem with moms knife when it

00:38:57.199 --> 00:39:01.160
shows up on a regular run it's like the

00:38:59.239 --> 00:39:02.630
emerging gameplay that drives me right

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:06.289
I'm stoked to get it cuz I'm like hey

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:08.929
another I was just like yeah I got hit

00:39:06.289 --> 00:39:10.219
so far after I knew that I was gonna get

00:39:08.929 --> 00:39:11.779
hit that it was there was like a lag

00:39:10.219 --> 00:39:14.059
time it's like when you burn your finger

00:39:11.779 --> 00:39:18.439
and you have a conscious thought like

00:39:14.059 --> 00:39:19.939
that's gonna hurt I'm dumb and then the

00:39:18.439 --> 00:39:21.469
pain sets in and you go yeah or like

00:39:19.939 --> 00:39:22.759
when you cut your knife with or you cut

00:39:21.469 --> 00:39:25.339
your finger with a kitchen knife when

00:39:22.759 --> 00:39:28.489
you're chopping stuff and you go like

00:39:25.339 --> 00:39:31.429
it's that blood oh it's like the exact

00:39:28.489 --> 00:39:36.549
same feeling there dude I can't fight

00:39:31.429 --> 00:39:39.650
this feeling anymore forgotten what I

00:39:36.549 --> 00:39:42.229
started fighting for every barrel every

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:44.869
song now is just a weird like overkill

00:39:42.229 --> 00:39:51.499
pastiche I could get to sleep

00:39:44.869 --> 00:39:54.349
a sugu publication great song I'm

00:39:51.499 --> 00:39:59.419
begging you game a forty-minute moms

00:39:54.349 --> 00:40:01.579
knife mega satan romp mind you I did

00:39:59.419 --> 00:40:06.739
kind of die earlier in the run so I mean

00:40:01.579 --> 00:40:12.140
I have to accept that I've caused my own

00:40:06.739 --> 00:40:13.759
problems there but what if I didn't you

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:15.429
know what I mean so we'll save the stars

00:40:13.759 --> 00:40:17.929
card the stars card is like a little

00:40:15.429 --> 00:40:21.069
it's like our little lottery ticket

00:40:17.929 --> 00:40:24.890
there's a chance this could buy us a

00:40:21.069 --> 00:40:26.719
little bit of speed on the cathedral for

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:28.189
now I'm just excited cuz like I know

00:40:26.719 --> 00:40:29.689
we're not gonna get an item here but we

00:40:28.189 --> 00:40:31.400
might get a deal with the devil and we

00:40:29.689 --> 00:40:32.359
have as far as I'm concerned we can get

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.619
one item for free

00:40:32.359 --> 00:40:35.569
we don't have permanent polaroid

00:40:33.619 --> 00:40:38.599
invincibility to endeavor towards but I

00:40:35.569 --> 00:40:38.920
would still get rid of one HP without

00:40:38.599 --> 00:40:41.079
being

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:43.510
- cheesed about it and we could but

00:40:41.079 --> 00:40:47.559
there's like no reason - so instead we

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:49.150
will we have the negative right we have

00:40:47.559 --> 00:40:54.280
the negative so we should go down not up

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:57.790
that would have been terrible if we had

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:59.740
gone up there okay so that stars up we

00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:01.930
teleported and it actually could be

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:04.210
quite a distance away here so it might

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:06.160
there's a fairly decent chance that

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:11.230
there's just took us closer to the dead

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:13.240
end in which case I'd be oh no my my

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:17.500
speed in which case I'd be fairly

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:19.299
disappointed but it's I mean that I used

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:23.109
the f-word there for a reason it would

00:41:19.299 --> 00:41:25.030
be fair to have diamonds now worth too

00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:27.549
much under most circumstances this isn't

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:30.369
that bad it does appear to be a dead end

00:41:27.549 --> 00:41:32.619
but it's a dead end that was like two

00:41:30.369 --> 00:41:33.670
extra rooms so what do we care we're

00:41:32.619 --> 00:41:34.809
gonna have to come back here up to the

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:43.390
point where they intersect and then

00:41:34.809 --> 00:41:44.170
that's fine keeping in mind we are very

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:48.970
close

00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:56.530
Oh Lanta I'm playing pretty badly this

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:59.079
run as well but keeping in mind don't

00:41:56.530 --> 00:42:01.329
have too much further to go we got nine

00:41:59.079 --> 00:42:03.190
lives and I pray to God we don't have to

00:42:01.329 --> 00:42:05.079
use them okay I got a little pep talk of

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:06.579
myself right now Northern Line there's

00:42:05.079 --> 00:42:08.500
no reason to be taking this damage these

00:42:06.579 --> 00:42:10.000
enemies you can almost justify it for

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:12.400
the other enemies there's just no case

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.260
to be made you have okay this guy you

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:15.940
should have moved admittedly but you

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:18.160
know you forgive yourself at that one

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:21.880
well with moms knife these enemies

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:23.200
should just be going down not so much

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:27.819
those ones there they're still annoying

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:30.240
mom's knife a damage seven damage we

00:42:27.819 --> 00:42:33.280
should be doing better than this and

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:34.930
that's not a you know the game is

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:37.780
getting too hard that's a you're playing

00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:40.720
like garbage so hold this strength card

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:42.730
the strength card is first and foremost

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:44.049
an augmenter to your mega satan fight

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:47.079
that can make things a lot easier

00:42:44.049 --> 00:42:48.880
secondarily if you end up dying the

00:42:47.079 --> 00:42:51.970
strength card doubles your effective HP

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:54.690
for the mega Satan fight which is

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:58.660
very very far from being insignificant

00:42:54.690 --> 00:43:03.190
and the high priestess is good enough to

00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:08.410
take for a rumor to hear you know take

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:12.490
it maybe stop Satan probably second

00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:18.730
phase first phase should go down pretty

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:20.650
easily dude if we in a single a Fame

00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:23.260
payout oh it was a theme the one that we

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:24.370
lost we have that virus payout so as

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:25.450
much as I'd love to be salty

00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:27.640
unfortunately I can't

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:30.640
we should have stomped him oh my god

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:33.400
okay I'm letting myself and also like

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.820
planet Earth down what in the world was

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:40.710
that

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:40.710
did you see the foot I don't understand

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:48.190
okay we're free but very very frightened

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:53.050
I think it's fair to say what do you got

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:55.240
for me dry baby ten out of ten not even

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:57.550
really joking grab this we got our

00:43:55.240 --> 00:44:04.990
strength card head down here copy items

00:43:57.550 --> 00:44:08.320
two more of them please we're just a

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:10.990
butt ton of spirit hearts I'll accept it

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:13.690
dang health up that's pretty good pretty

00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:18.550
fly also pretty good all right blow this

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:24.000

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:26.650
energy not bad health up very good

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:31.030
justice yes our fill in those red hearts

00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:33.490
please the moon strength we have to

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:36.880
strength cards so if we weren't

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:39.220
surrounded by big rooms I'd be much more

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:41.410
confident about this but because we are

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:44.410
surrounded by big rooms find myself

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:48.370
being mildly perturbed by the situation

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:50.770
at hand I'm gonna fight anyway the

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:55.720
reason I'm fighting it's because I want

00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:57.300
to get one I want to fill up our hearts

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:59.550
as much as possible

00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:02.130
wouldn't mind picking up some items but

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:04.290
I'll you know recognize that if we take

00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:06.900
damage doing this we look like the fool

00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:10.050
we got so so lucky with the the pills

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:11.720
that we got there that my sorry HP is

00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:15.600
already full

00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:16.980
okay disregard disregard we would look

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:18.600
like an idiot if it all went wrong is

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:19.980
what I'm trying to say not that we don't

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:25.380
look like a little bit of an idiot right

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:29.730
now but we would look like even more of

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:32.490
an idiot I think we're very well

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:35.490
equipped if you know what I mean

00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:38.120
especially if we handle the enemies the

00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:41.280
proper way and there is a proper way

00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:41.760
particularly not all enemies are created

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:47.580
equal

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:48.780
we know which ones are we know which

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:50.520
ones are good and which ones are garbage

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:55.860
this one for example is good

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:58.950
unfortunately but not quite as annoying

00:45:55.860 --> 00:46:02.130
as the the stages yet to come and the

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:04.050
chemistry of common life know also

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:06.150
pretty good but the strength card

00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:07.380
nullifies a lot of the the danger of

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:10.740
fighting this guy so we're looking very

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:13.770
very strong now and I can't really say

00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:16.200
much more than like a sincere thank you

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:18.960
to getting to HP upgrades out of five

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:20.850
pills or four pills so without those and

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:26.640
I really think even without like one of

00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:32.190
them we might have just eaten it so rest

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:35.100
assured I have not forgotten how lucky

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:36.990
we appear to have gotten here you do you

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:39.150
have 10 times more HP than the other

00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:41.250
angel statue and if so how have I never

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:42.840
noticed that before so this is where a

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:45.290
trinity shield is supposed to come

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.290
through in the clutch

00:46:48.900 --> 00:47:03.940
just land that damage your smart guy

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:07.359
that was a good way to handle that

00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:09.130
you've dotted okay there but for the

00:47:07.359 --> 00:47:10.450
grace of Edmund and Tyrone go I cuz that

00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:11.560
could have gone wrong and probably

00:47:10.450 --> 00:47:13.060
should have and I'm a little embarrassed

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:13.540
at how close it came to slipping through

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:15.220
our fingers

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:16.540
but hey poker chip a trinket will never

00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:17.500
use thanks for watching hope you guys

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:18.400

future but for now thanks watching and I
