##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.000
everybody welcome ignorant land please

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.770
the binding of issac after birth plus I

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.720
got eight wins in a row but this one's

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.519
going to be weird you know why because

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.820
we're going to do our last achievement

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.830
uh Big Ups to whoever tweeted me this

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.379
you know who you are but I've forgotten

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.029
your alias and that is catalyst of me

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.650
and I apologize but I was like why am I

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.570
missing eleven achievements an Isaac and

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.980
then many people were like verify

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.660
integrity of steam cash I tried it

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.160
didn't work still a good suggestion

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.810
usually one of the things that sorts

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.699
things out I'm not saying it's bad

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.170
suggestion but after a lot of like back

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.300
and forth comments up people were like

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.829
or some one person in particular was

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.750
like go to your secrets page sometimes

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.579
achievements get locked and they only

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.649
unlock if you go to the secrets page I

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.450
went to the secrets page nine

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.340
achievements popped up and all of a

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.230
sudden I've only got two left one of

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.280
them must be a million in 1% and the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.850
other one is the one that we're going to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.199
do today

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.210
it's the rerun achievement okay I

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:58.640
thought I had already done this but

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:03.660
apparently not the rerun achievement is

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:06.060
do three full runs of Isaac going to the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.260
lam and start your fourth run you know

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.200
it gives you the opportunity to do

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.479
victory laps and I'm sure we have to do

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.470
three runs or if we have to do three

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.650
victory laps let me check complete three

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:24.180
victory laps and start a fourth so it's

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.560
going to be madness it's probably going

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.619
to take us a while but I got some time

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.070
so I'll get out of here Thank You Isaac

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.490
wiki but I don't want to accidentally

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.680
blast my viewers with an ad for a mobile

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.060
game unless they got one when they

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.049
started this video in which case thank

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.670
you guys for watching I hope you enjoy

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.140
you know okay yeah so what's the plan

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.490
for this episode is very simple we're

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.979
gonna do three victory lap so that

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.070
requires us going to I've really screwed

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.720
our deal with the devil chances here but

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.250
nice after you screw them you can't

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.850
really screw them much more than that

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.020
Kenya don't touch this guy because he's

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.689
going to be a jerk algae's algid algae's

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.039
could be algae's de gods also great but

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.239
algae's is the big one because we can

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.629
use the temperance card with it but

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.709
let's see sad Dom's I'm in so basically

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.519
it

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:20.939
it's a pretty obvious way to handle a

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.980
run we basically just have to deal okay

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:25.469
stop taking so much damage is a good one

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.719
we have to deal with the run as we would

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:32.989
deal with a normal run to be honest with

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:36.750
you we want this a great deal

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.170
yeah even more than no wait check this

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.889
out

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:45.090
pop temperance get a penny when you get

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:47.519
hit then grab bloody penny take

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.010
swallowed penny oh we shouldn't pick

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:53.760
that up that's fine we should wait for

00:02:50.010 --> 00:03:00.239
the trinket to metabolize every time as

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:01.889
annoying as it might seem but it should

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.019
actually work if you give me a minute

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:06.120
here do that sorry for the freight it

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.669
actually is like as soon as I start

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.620
recording an episode the Skype messages

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:12.120
come flooding in I'm not against it it's

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.629
nice to get by with a little help from

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.329
your friends but still we probably have

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:20.340
not created an endless ability for us to

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:23.010
play this I think we may be gotten a

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.049
little on the lucky side so far but it's

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.970
working out nicely and I can't deny that

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.319
whatsoever I got to turn this down

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.060
though it's a little loud in my ear

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.919
basically you'll forgive me for not

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.689
worrying too much about how much time

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:39.959
this is going to take because

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:43.650
effectively this episode could take like

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.150
an hour and a half to begin with and an

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.489
hour and a half might actually be a very

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.709
sensible amount of time for it to take

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.930
so we obviously want to not die here I'm

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.430
just hoping that maybe ever-so-slightly

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.319
we've redeemed ourselves for the

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.150
absolutely awful damage that I took

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:01.040
earlier on this one we don't need to

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.040
wait for the the trinkets to take hold

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.950
in tanked yeah now swallow pennies

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.350
probably worth it gives us effectively

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:15.340
like a greater than 50% extra bonus

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.870
chance for us to glean the ability to

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.650
continue but I'm really just holding out

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:27.700
hope for blood bag if you refuses to

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:29.710
present itself and truth be told blood

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.960
bag is not the be-all end-all I mean if

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.670
the the best thing that could happen is

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.040
blood bag drops right now so I don't

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.560
lose my sanity the second best thing

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:44.680
that could happen is that blood bag

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:48.040
takes until I get 99 cents to drop but

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.720
this is approaching madness mind you we

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.060
might not be hurting for money for quite

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:58.930
some time okay you know what

00:04:51.060 --> 00:05:01.180
Skype coroner apparently it's just a

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.200
bunch of just a bunch of pictures a

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.520
hollow night

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.800
oh it's Nick drew them I mean they're

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.780
gorgeous drawings I thought it was just

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.130
actually a screenshot of hollow night

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.990
that got posted there and I'm like I

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:18.850
don't I can't escape a hollow night

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:22.150
wherever I go so this is the actual

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:24.700
worst start in terms of my play and then

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.430
also most boring start to an isaac run

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:34.810
ever literally like three minutes of me

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:36.940
playing this blood bank but look it's

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.520
the right play and that's what bothers

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.130
me this is actually where incentivized

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.440
to do this I think I'm just going to

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.030
leave for now though because we are sort

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.820
of approaching the point at which it's

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.340
you know madness effectively um no I

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.930
shouldn't have done that because I mean

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.780
first off we freed some spiders but

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.220
secondly bombs are still somewhat

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.660
precious don't just throw them away for

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.810
no reason here let's just go and try to

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.460
find some item rooms try not to take

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.930
damage and at least you know what that

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.900
blood bank gave us a great chance to

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.490
reset ourselves on this run like we were

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.530
playing pretty badly and now we have

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.390
we've taken some time off

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.770
and then you know the added benefit of

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.529
getting eighty cents out of it as well

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:19.159
as nice but

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:21.169
uh as compared to a normal run I'm very

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:23.499
unconcerned about the concept of boss

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:26.269
rush because of the fact that you know

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:31.219
we're going to be doing several victory

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:32.869
laps so once we get this done assuming

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:35.779
we can do it I mean I know on victory

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:40.939
laps you do lose I was kind of bad you

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:42.919
do lose an item per reroll err maybe you

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:46.669
lose several items per not reroll per

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:48.289
victory lap so nothing is sacred here

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:49.969
obviously we have the chance to lose

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:51.829
some very very useful stuff but I really

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:54.469
feel like if we get the first victory

00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:59.149
lap done everything else should come in

00:06:54.469 --> 00:07:01.129
time right now we need more keys that's

00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:02.659
why I'm laying the groundwork right now

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:04.189
oh yeah you'll have to forgive me this

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:06.679
is the third roguelite I played today

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:08.659
and I really should be speaking Issac

00:07:06.679 --> 00:07:12.829
fluently but I'm making some poor

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:14.899
mistakes and for that I apologize my

00:07:12.829 --> 00:07:17.329
brain is in like tumble seat mode right

00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:20.539
now or something brain playing Isaac you

00:07:17.329 --> 00:07:22.459
heard of it get it through your skull

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:26.169
brain that's a sentence that doesn't

00:07:22.459 --> 00:07:29.689
really make too much sense I suppose I

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:31.309
mean don't really care about the money

00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:32.629
mostly picking it up for the red heart

00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:34.849
potential and also the chance that it

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:41.049
could be luck upgrades which are of

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:44.329
course very valuable I'm stunned and

00:07:41.049 --> 00:07:46.699
maybe grateful at the fact that we still

00:07:44.329 --> 00:07:49.129
as of yet have not gotten the blood bag

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:52.579
we've actually played it like 70 times

00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:54.409
and I I would absolutely welcome you to

00:07:52.579 --> 00:07:56.449
do that math yourself seventy might be a

00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:59.839
slight exaggeration but I don't think is

00:07:56.449 --> 00:08:01.609
that much of an exaggeration you know we

00:07:59.839 --> 00:08:02.899
gotten over ninety nine cents out of it

00:08:01.609 --> 00:08:06.319
never gotten some dimes we've gotten

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:09.499
some nickels and every play gave us two

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:11.089
to three pennies if it didn't give us

00:08:09.499 --> 00:08:12.889
any special coins because of swallowed

00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:17.119
penny giving us one every single time as

00:08:12.889 --> 00:08:20.539
well so I think you buy compost for

00:08:17.119 --> 00:08:24.289
seven cents because it's an easy reroll

00:08:20.539 --> 00:08:27.969
and then I think you reroll it again and

00:08:24.289 --> 00:08:31.129
I'm actually fine with fanny pack

00:08:27.969 --> 00:08:33.019
but I want to buy more stuff and we do

00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:35.899
the same thing here by moms bottle of

00:08:33.019 --> 00:08:37.279
pills use it I actually tried to hit Q

00:08:35.899 --> 00:08:40.399
to use it that's a little Flint hook

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:42.680
influence we're going to reroll it I

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:44.930
don't really care about King baby but

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.959
without any other options I'm okay with

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.959
that

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:54.649
so we have an Omega penny first we got

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:57.350
an ace of clubs which is basically

00:08:54.649 --> 00:09:01.309
worthless cool by the omega penny for 15

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:02.509
cents try to double our items none the D

00:09:01.309 --> 00:09:04.730
if six is good enough we don't need to

00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:07.550
go full on omegap in just reroll it why

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:09.529
buy it just to reroll it hubris i

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:14.089
suppose the idea that maybe we've got

00:09:09.529 --> 00:09:17.209
infinite money i think the battery is

00:09:14.089 --> 00:09:19.819
worth it drop another bomb in here and

00:09:17.209 --> 00:09:21.350
we get Pandora's box Pandora's box on

00:09:19.819 --> 00:09:22.819
this floor is not that good but I'll

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.779
take the two spirit hearts I'm not going

00:09:22.819 --> 00:09:25.730
to be salty about it

00:09:23.779 --> 00:09:27.829
and we still got 15 cents backing us up

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:30.100
here you see what's going on is kind of

00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:32.660
like madness right

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:35.059
we've spent eight minutes on the first

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:37.160
floor and we're actually statistically

00:09:35.059 --> 00:09:38.089
not really that much more powerful than

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.579
we were before

00:09:38.089 --> 00:09:44.839
I will say it's nice to have fanny pack

00:09:40.579 --> 00:09:49.189
working with us so we're going to not

00:09:44.839 --> 00:09:50.600
pick up any pennies here if we get red

00:09:49.189 --> 00:09:52.430
hearts out of fanny pack then that's

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.800
glorious but instead we're going to

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:56.870
re-roll everything in here in two bombs

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.550
and then we're going to blow up I mean

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.990
there's very little I could have done at

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.790
the end of that that bomb exploded

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:05.779
pretty quickly but now we got 12 sad

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:07.220
bombs what a strange situation we find

00:10:05.779 --> 00:10:09.379
ourselves in here early having the

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:14.089
ability to get doubled these six rolls

00:10:09.379 --> 00:10:15.740
is nice spend a lot of time on the first

00:10:14.089 --> 00:10:17.870
floor without getting too much benefit

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.220
out of it though I still it the

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:23.360
groundwork that we've laid is going to

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:26.139
be good for us for the future I hope and

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:29.829
I have no reason you know the question

00:10:26.139 --> 00:10:32.629
the integrity of this run at this point

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:34.220
it you're going to really going to just

00:10:32.629 --> 00:10:36.559
take damage against pain huh I mean I

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:38.149
get that it's small room tin probably

00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:40.760
the hardest of all the pins but that's a

00:10:38.149 --> 00:10:42.380
little silly take speedball for the

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.830
the opportunities that it presents in

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.830
the future

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:53.420
and honestly dude sad bombs crushed it

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.800
right there we got lucky we beat the

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:57.100
odds by a little bit picked up a

00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:02.480
pentagram okay

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:03.890
extremely good we got three HP and we're

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.570
going to buy four hearts with a deal so

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.950
we're going to take Guppies head we're

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.540
going to take betrayal only because

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.890
we're gonna take Abaddon right after so

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.870
then we'll take Abaddon with us and

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:14.690
we're going to stick with d6 though

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:16.399
because it's a great item we got the

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:17.660
battery charge which synergizes nicely

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:19.220
weather we didn't even go to our other

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.360
item room cuz I was so eager to go to

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.420
the shop dude that would have been a

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:25.670
colossal mistake or we know we didn't we

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:27.560
opened it but we didn't go thank you the

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:30.370
nation takes us closer to spawn and now

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:33.019
as well as things went on that floor

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:34.550
slow it down just a little bit play

00:11:33.019 --> 00:11:37.190
better remember what game you're playing

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:41.570
and remember whose game it is that's

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:45.260
right Nikolas software development Inc

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:46.040
and Edmund McMillen don't get above your

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:50.630
station

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:52.730
NL however we in the end we got a lot of

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.800
benefit and it really was just that

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:57.410
four-item deal with the devil did shows

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:59.390
up pretty rarely but is usually good for

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:03.290
at least a little goodness when it does

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:04.760
show up still got enough money to buy

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:07.670
something from the shop if I left the

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:12.529
first floor with 24 cents most of the

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:14.990
time I'd be jazzed dude instead I'm

00:12:12.529 --> 00:12:21.560
leaving it with 24 cents sort of like 23

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:24.800
cents but I also spent like 90-something

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:27.769
probably on the last floor so I'm

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.880
feeling like we're fairly well equipped

00:12:27.769 --> 00:12:31.730
here we don't really care about getting

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:34.459
that money unfortunately we're out of

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:36.230
red hearts now so a temperance card is

00:12:34.459 --> 00:12:38.000
unlikely to have the same value that it

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:43.459
used to the loss of swallowed penny is

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:46.839
like borderline irrelevant that's not

00:12:43.459 --> 00:12:50.149
necessarily worth it but the loss of

00:12:46.839 --> 00:12:51.560
lots of our HP like red hearts makes it

00:12:50.149 --> 00:12:52.519
harder but it's still good because you

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.140
know we were going to take a baton

00:12:52.519 --> 00:12:58.120
regardless now we're at 7 damage which

00:12:54.140 --> 00:13:00.440
is better than having a finicky little

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.640
blood bank synergy you got to take tech

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.769
point five and remember

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:06.470
we're not playing to burn up in the

00:13:03.769 --> 00:13:07.820
atmosphere on the chest first off we

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:11.450
have to take the negative because we got

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:13.670
to go to the lam floor and we only need

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:15.980
to remember that the one time but we

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:18.260
might as well do it every time just in

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:20.200
case somehow doing a victory lap causes

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:23.390
us to lose the polaroid I know it takes

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:28.640
items away of random maybe one of those

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:29.959
items could be the negative right so

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.760
it's probably in our best interest even

00:13:29.959 --> 00:13:35.390
though permanent polaroid invincibility

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:37.010
would be useful if we're going to do a

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:40.279
super long run to try to get this last

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:42.140
achievement why risk it right well the

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:43.579
answer is for the biscuit and I can't

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:46.850
really argue with that because it's very

00:13:43.579 --> 00:13:48.950
pithy you know sports broadcasting

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:50.769
terminology so you got a good point

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:57.769
there

00:13:50.769 --> 00:14:00.980
dream item growth hormones give us the

00:13:57.769 --> 00:14:02.950
spun transformation give us more damage

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:06.680
could use a rate of fire increase

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:09.350
polydactyl is not bad but I think a luck

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.910
upgrade the longer a run goes the more I

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.120
value a lock upgrade let's leave it at

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:13.250
that

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.779
we I don't want to belabor the point of

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:17.449
luck upgrades but if we're going to be

00:14:14.779 --> 00:14:20.300
doing like you know 40 floors of issac

00:14:17.449 --> 00:14:24.920
I'm stoked to have three luck already

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:26.839
let's just leave it at that shops got to

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.850
be around here somewhere there it is we

00:14:26.839 --> 00:14:31.279
may actually make it in time for boss

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:33.800
rush we're probably three minutes behind

00:14:31.279 --> 00:14:38.720
schedule but we're also stronger than

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:39.920
usual I'm you but stronger I don't think

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.110
we need anything else I mean a battery

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.430
charge obviously there's times on a

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:45.649
battery charge is the right call in this

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:47.930
time sooner it is it by the way I do

00:14:45.649 --> 00:14:53.660
want to say it's the key achievement I

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:55.430
think it's stupid arbitrary challenging

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.839
admittedly but challenging for what I

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.850
would consider to be the wrong reasons

00:14:56.839 --> 00:15:01.070
you know it's a challenge of focus not a

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:03.649
challenge of mechanical skill except for

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:05.779
you know storing a bomb so that you can

00:15:03.649 --> 00:15:07.190
bomb a key away first but lose a bomb a

00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:09.019
penny away from a door you otherwise

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:12.020
would have had to you know pick it up in

00:15:09.019 --> 00:15:13.760
front of but this achievement I'm okay

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.530
with you know victory labs are a unique

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:18.170
part of active birth plus

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:24.790
and as much as I've only done them

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:27.410
rarely I accept them as a kind of a

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.790
novel concept I say that because it is

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:30.620
novel not just because it's a me

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:35.740
buzzword for once that's lasted for like

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:35.740
far too long in my vernacular but I

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:42.080
don't know if I love the way they do

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:43.790
looping in this game because I don't

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.770
think it gets harder except they just

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:51.590
take items away from you and in general

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:54.590
I find that losing items in Isaac is was

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:57.100
my fault but still losing items and

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:58.670
Isaac feels anti-fun to me but I

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:02.540
appreciate that it's a hundred percent

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:05.530
optional you know what give me some

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.530
chocolate milk I'm ready

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:12.460
I actually like my dodging cortex

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.720
whatever part of the brain handles

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.190
dodging and Isaac surely a

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.510
neuroscientist knows they've been

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:18.460
studying that stuff since the dawn of

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:23.740
the games launched five years ago six

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:28.990
years ago it's broken today I don't know

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:31.060
why I can't rely on those playing cards

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:32.650
anymore so let's go mom's key got the

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:35.320
mom transformation already I would

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:37.120
expect myriad transformations on this

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.740
run here because we're going to be

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:41.080
getting so many items over the course of

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:43.990
it I would also like other items that I

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:47.350
think are worth more on a victory lab

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:53.820
style run anything that generates hearts

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:53.820
so like a relic is awesome I think

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:59.560
mapping because instead of getting eight

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.850
floors of mapping or you know however

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:04.570
many floors are left at the time you

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:06.550
pick it up you get 15 floors of mapping

00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:08.890
or something well it's not 15 maybe like

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:14.230
you know 60 floors of mapping or

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:16.030
something you have to forgive me it's

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:18.100
the last video of the day but unlike

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:21.670
it's the key I'm actually extremely

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:23.280
confident that barring a game crash and

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:26.290
barring like an order-of-magnitude

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:29.050
terrible run we shouldn't have too many

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:32.830
problems completing this challenge on

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:34.540
the first try in fact I knew there was a

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:35.740
victory lap challenge for the longest

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.910
time I just actually thought we had

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:39.180
already done it I think we did two

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:43.240
victory laps but you got to complete

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:44.890
three victory laps and then start the

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.110
fourth so we're not going to go to our

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:49.570
arcade just going to keep moving here

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:51.100
again boss Russians is a pipe dream if

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.360
we don't make this boss rush I mean I

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.520
was gonna say there's more but there

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:57.580
probably won't be more the timer will

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:58.690
still be at like you know 40 minutes or

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:01.510
whatever it is by the time you finish

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:04.210
the first run I think I really expect

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:06.070
the first run by the way take I mean as

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:09.870
you might expect a normal amount of time

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:13.000
within the range of normalcy and then

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:15.200
every subsequent run unless we lose a

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:20.210
critical critical item a critical

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:21.260
item should be much much shorter so if

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:23.000
you got things to do today

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.620
hey you and me both buddy like for

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.100
example I got three and a half more

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:29.149
Isaac runs to record on this very video

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.889
it's kind of I don't want to say it's

00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:35.029
bittersweet because I don't believe that

00:18:30.889 --> 00:18:36.620
but it's just sweet to be finishing 1

00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:39.409
million in 1% assuming that it actually

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:43.070
unlocks here because you know that's the

00:18:39.409 --> 00:18:44.750
last Isaac achievement hunt I'll

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:46.070
probably ever have to do although who

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:47.450
knows if like there's an Isaac tool

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:51.889
around the corner or something like that

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:56.659
you gotta grab that and you can't coach

00:18:51.889 --> 00:18:58.730
that sports interviews are like the

00:18:56.659 --> 00:19:01.100
funniest thing in the world man I know I

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:05.179
understand why by the way sometimes you

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:07.100
see people and they'll let you know you

00:19:05.179 --> 00:19:08.360
know what give me a speed upgrade we're

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:12.019
going to have no shortage of items let's

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.580
grab that and they go oh man I wish

00:19:12.019 --> 00:19:14.419
Ashley it's like gave honest interviews

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.950
they're always just saying the same

00:19:14.419 --> 00:19:17.480
thing Oh we'd try a hundred and ten

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:19.159
percent blah blah blah but you know

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.659
whenever an athlete says something

00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:22.909
honest in the media they're crucified

00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:24.679
and everyone goes it leads to deplane

00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:25.820
sports you know even if it's about

00:19:24.679 --> 00:19:28.250
sports because that's what

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:30.830
unsportsmanlike attitude Jim he said he

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:32.630
wasn't happy that his coach poison the

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:35.779
lemonade at their cousin's birthday

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:37.909
party you can't have insubordination

00:19:35.779 --> 00:19:39.799
within the team like that Jim a lot of

00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:41.690
gyms in the in the football world but

00:19:39.799 --> 00:19:45.019
anyway that I still I love sports

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:49.760
interviews because there is actually no

00:19:45.019 --> 00:19:53.090
reason for them to exist whatsoever you

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:54.799
know you a bowl or bag your team's down

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:57.289
2-0 at halftime it's marking the eighth

00:19:54.799 --> 00:19:58.700
straight game at which the Canucks have

00:19:57.289 --> 00:20:00.500
not scored first I would have to say

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.940
about that well you know we haven't been

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.389
playing our game tonight you know we

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:06.559
haven't been acting like we wanted it

00:20:04.389 --> 00:20:07.820
you got to give them credit where credit

00:20:06.559 --> 00:20:09.200
is due they've been playing hard they've

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:11.149
been winning the battles in the corners

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.620
and you know we've been given up too

00:20:11.149 --> 00:20:14.299
much we just we can't make it easy for

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:16.399
this we're just go out there in the 3rd

00:20:14.299 --> 00:20:17.990
try to do our best and hopefully we'll

00:20:16.399 --> 00:20:21.260
get the result we want thanks Bo all

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:24.620
right you know like every single

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:26.000
interview is summit verbal spaghett and

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:28.400
this is not me insulting bow whore vet

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.270
who is you know the hope in

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.910
future of the vancouver canucks

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:33.860
franchise every single interview is some

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:35.450
combination of like if you're winning

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.830
you're like we have played our game you

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:38.390
know we got the right bounces if you're

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:40.400
losing we're letting them play their

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:43.220
game it pucks on going our way you know

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.900
I watched football for a long time for

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:47.090
like five or six years it was the same

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:50.830
thing there most of the time although

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:53.090
with the weirdly like more like

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:54.860
adversarial spin on it sometimes I'm

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:55.970
fine with moms wig here by the way let's

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:58.220
get the heck out of this floor

00:20:55.970 --> 00:21:01.190
maybe boss rush champ still exists for

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:06.820
us let's try to add to that chance by

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:09.770
making some plays here that look um and

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:13.160
you might say that's stupid but I get it

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:16.610
you know you're you know 19 20 years old

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:18.020
getting paid to play paid far too much

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.310
money and that's not me insulting them

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:21.080
because who among us wouldn't take the

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:22.880
same deal but getting paid far more

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:27.290
money than you deserve most of the time

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:28.850
to play a game and that's awesome

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:32.720
why in the world would you ever

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:34.250
jeopardize it by trying to say something

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.320
honest during an interview that could

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:38.150
get you into hot water you know might

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.890
end up being blacklisted or something

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:42.350
like that so yeah I'll go up in front of

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:44.500
Cassie Campbell and I'll say Cassie

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:46.790
Campbell is like Canadian sports

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:48.110
broadcaster and I'll say you know we

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:51.500
gave it a hundred and ten percent but

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:52.850
you know they just wanted it more well

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:54.290
did player would never say that because

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:55.810
they would again be crucified you get

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:58.340
the idea

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:59.930
just give me my six million dollar bonus

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:01.070
and adults say whatever you want me to

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:03.140
say in terms of that I'm not going to

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:05.750
get up there and you know put myself at

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:09.620
risk but at the same time I a lot of

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:12.230
stuff I would say six million dollars a

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:14.540
year and you know a gold suite in Rogers

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:17.720
Arena I mean I'm just saying they got

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:20.450
the smoked meat sandwiches in there that

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:22.850
make the make me think the wrong things

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:24.680
anyway this was a bit that I thought had

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:26.780
a lot more potential and I realized that

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:28.490
had been done to death by smarter people

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:30.830
than myself so I decided to kind of bail

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:32.300
out of it but I didn't fully bail I did

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:33.680
like a tuck and roll and it wasn't as

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:36.050
gentle if I think you know the thing is

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:37.190
gonna be a long episode here so some of

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:39.760
the bits are going to work and some of

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:39.760
the bits are

00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:47.399
we are probably going to make boss rush

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:50.789
now now

00:22:47.399 --> 00:22:54.269
the question now becomes do I want to

00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:57.870
impose boss rush on myself there's the

00:22:54.269 --> 00:23:01.380
negative and the answer is no and the

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:03.539
answer is still no and the answer is

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:05.070
still no and you might be saying a wafer

00:23:03.539 --> 00:23:06.570
you might even be saying varicose veins

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:08.039
because on a future pass you might get

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:09.360
dull razor but we don't really want the

00:23:08.039 --> 00:23:11.159
razor you might have been saying

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.799
piercing shots and the thing is you're

00:23:11.159 --> 00:23:15.929
all right on a normal run and I don't

00:23:13.799 --> 00:23:18.919
mean you're all right because you're if

00:23:15.929 --> 00:23:22.409
you're watching this episode

00:23:18.919 --> 00:23:25.139
2950 one of the binding of issac human

00:23:22.409 --> 00:23:27.120
glory or my girl you know please don't

00:23:25.139 --> 00:23:29.130
bring this up if we ever happen to meet

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:32.700
each other in public but it'll be very

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:39.690
awkward for me and by extension both of

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:43.740
us probably but this ain't a normal run

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:46.679
this is a rerun some irony in there I

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:49.860
suppose but it's going to take us a long

00:23:46.679 --> 00:23:54.389
time I don't want to add six minutes to

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:56.549
this run unless the item is very good I

00:23:54.389 --> 00:23:58.080
don't think the wafer was going to save

00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:59.580
us six minutes and I don't think we're

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:02.120
at risk of death at least not as the run

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:02.120
goes right now

00:24:02.299 --> 00:24:07.860
similarly piercing shots are lovely but

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:10.200
do they give us enough benefit to

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:12.029
justify having to do boss rush if

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.679
anything like I know this sounds rich

00:24:12.029 --> 00:24:15.210
considering how much I prioritize boss

00:24:13.679 --> 00:24:18.630
rush on a lot of situations but if

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:20.580
anything boss rush puts us in jeopardy

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:23.970
in that situation because right now our

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:26.610
HP is great with dark bum six luck and

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:29.279
bloody penny we're not really hurtin for

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:31.889
spirit arts either so I'm not going to

00:24:29.279 --> 00:24:33.659
sweat this too much pretty much the only

00:24:31.889 --> 00:24:35.880
thing I would have done boss rush for is

00:24:33.659 --> 00:24:38.220
like a top-tier offensive item and I

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:40.440
don't think as much as I like

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:42.690
Sagittarius I don't think it's a top to

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.940
your offensive item it's up there it's

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:48.320
pretty good

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:51.360
top tier I don't know anyway similarly

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.590
except slightly different there's no way

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:57.610
we're going to do hush

00:24:52.590 --> 00:25:00.760
that's just it's madness I will go back

00:24:57.610 --> 00:25:03.820
and pick up good bomb caches like this

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:06.100
because I mean straight up we got sad

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:08.440
bombs and we got good bomb damage so I

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:09.790
think you know I'm not in a position to

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:14.740
be making enemies there and against our

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:16.720
bosses I pretty much expect a bomb to do

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:17.890
a lot of our work for us here so right

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.630
now I mean the run is great

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:28.480
the real intrigue on this run is going

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:29.680
to be seeing what we lose and then to be

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:32.080
honest with you if we don't lose

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:33.700
something that's catastrophic ly bad and

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:35.200
I don't even know if we have an item

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:37.330
that's catastrophic we bad to lose at

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:39.340
this point but maybe dark bomb would be

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:40.900
the worst because it is like

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:44.740
single-handedly holding up our defense

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:47.860
but if we don't lose something terrible

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:50.050
then the next bit of like why is this

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:51.760
video fun to watch is going to be how

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:53.110
fast can we beat the next victory lap

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:56.410
and see if we lose something down there

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:59.830
because honestly nothing is stopping us

00:25:56.410 --> 00:26:01.690
on this one I'm still trying to get this

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:03.490
I mean it sounds terrible to say I'm

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:05.560
trying to get this euthanasia chain off

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:08.530
here if I don't think it's terrible to

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:11.950
say without getting too political but

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:14.200
like at least there's nothing about a

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:15.760
euthanasia chain that makes it

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.590
substantially worse than the first

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:20.200
euthanasia if you believe the first

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:22.450
euthanasia was in ethical I guess I mean

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:24.280
it sends it bad optically if you're like

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:27.220
come down to the hospital for

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:29.590
euthanasias today but despite the poor

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:32.320
marketing they definitely use like a

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:35.580
communications major over at that at

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:38.830
that hospital I wouldn't dispute that

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:41.950
it's better than paid euthanasia isn't

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:44.680
it maybe maybe this is a road we don't

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:46.450
want to go down but I I am not the kind

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:48.520
of person who deliberately says

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:50.260
controversial things and then goes you

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:53.110
know oh I'm sorry if you got offended

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:56.620
you know but I do resist the notion that

00:26:53.110 --> 00:27:01.420
saying the name of a controversial topic

00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:04.150
is like a little too soon back off like

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:06.040
I feel like I can say the word abortion

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:09.700
without being controversial it's

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:13.270
the word now if I said another word in

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:16.780
front of that like culinary that would

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:18.310
change the context it would be fine if I

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:20.350
said another word like delicious

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:21.460
there better be the word culinary in

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:23.110
front of it or we're going to have some

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:26.290
problems you know that's going to start

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:28.510
to alienate people which is why you know

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:30.160
I don't try to be first stop there's a

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:34.270
couple of reasons I don't talk politics

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:35.920
in videos one of them is that I don't

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:37.600
know anything the other one is that I

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:40.420
want these videos to be inclusive you

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:44.530
know I understand my lot in life is not

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:45.610
being a political scientist if anything

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:47.730
when people ask me about my political

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:51.340
beliefs I say you should ask someone

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:53.050
smart in the arena of politics about

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:57.520
their political beliefs because I'm I'm

00:27:53.050 --> 00:28:01.630
a sheep I'm as susceptible to propaganda

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:02.590
or you know simple-minded politics as

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:04.660
anybody else

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:07.330
I mean we have we have an election

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:09.220
coming up in British Columbia without

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:10.570
revealing too much I was like I don't

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:12.430
know long in a vote for is my first

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:15.160
actual election where I've lived in

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:17.140
British Columbia except for the last one

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.700
which I was just I did can't really

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:21.940
clean ignorance I was just unaware of it

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:23.380
when it happened and I was like I have

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:24.430
no history with any of these politicians

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:25.900
I don't know who I'm going to vote for

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:28.690
or who I'm going to vote against for

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:30.610
that matter and then I took like a

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:34.360
political compass quiz for the region

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:35.800
and it put me dead center between two of

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:38.680
the candidates and I was like I still

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:40.990
don't know who I'm gonna vote for so

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:43.000
like I'm I'm dealing with that myself

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:45.790
you know I I know what my political

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.560
ideals are but you know sometimes on a

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:49.120
local level I'm not going to say that

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.370
those become compromised because that's

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:52.690
not what I mean but you know you think

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:54.580
about different things than you might on

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:56.200
a federal level but this is irrelevant

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.640
okay I almost went in the wrong

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.530
direction there and that's where we got

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:02.230
to consider that we could ruin this

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:05.710
whole video or make it beautiful

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:08.110
depending on your perspective why do you

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:10.330
watch Northern Line Oh for the highly

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:14.320
generalized musings on provincial

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:18.160
politics in Canada like on the one hand

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:19.810
people don't like our current Premier

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:24.370
but on the other

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:27.670
and some people do it's a complicated

00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:29.380
issue dude that's the thing about

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:33.100
politics I'm like why can't there just

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:34.630
be someone that everyone hates that'll

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:37.180
make politics so much easier if there

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:38.890
was a guy with like ninety nine percent

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:42.040
approval rating running against a guy

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:43.630
with a 1 percent approval rating doesn't

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:46.240
have to be a guy either you know I'm

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:49.090
like I'm just throwing out a generalized

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:51.490
pronoun here but the point is I always

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:53.740
make it so hard it's always like 51 to

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:57.970
49 and then you're like well I do love

00:29:53.740 --> 00:30:00.010
the root for the underdog it's I'll

00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:02.440
probably just go for whatever Party of a

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:04.710
color I like the most anyway that's a

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:07.900
joke you should be an informed voter I

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:09.310
may be I'm like a genuine undecided

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:11.140
voter in the provincial election right

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:14.470
now but I am at least a little informed

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:20.440
now unfortunately I've done nothing with

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:23.500
that information which party is going to

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:26.850
give me a free house in the neighborhood

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:32.800
I desire nobody all right call me in

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:34.090
2021 then okay should not have walked

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.830
into that but I mean we're actually

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:38.500
going to finish our first run within

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:42.780
like 35 minutes it's really good timing

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:45.730
and as good as it is it's not that

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:48.910
amazing like we've got really really

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:52.930
well well balanced defense and offense

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:54.970
right now ten damage is obviously good

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:56.080
but it's not like we're just walking

00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:57.610
into a room and everything's dying

00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:00.670
instantly this could be our guppy dream

00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:02.320
by the way that's what I'm hoping for

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:03.910
or we could just get four chests that

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:08.590
are full of bombs I suppose is the other

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:10.810
alternative so I think that there's room

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:13.210
to grow on this run it's just this is a

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:15.160
run that is like is a swimming pool like

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:18.190
it's all the same level that's a weird

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:19.780
idiom because a lot of swimming pools

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:20.980
have like a deep end and a shallow end

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:24.850
but imagine it as a swimming pool that

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:27.430
was all the deep end you know what I

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:29.050
think you take obsessed fan and the

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:31.090
reason you do it is because again we got

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:32.980
a long-term focus right now so we're

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:33.490
trying to get to transformations like

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:36.670
the elves

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:39.040
I would like to be able to fly egged

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:43.360
great item conehead it's not egghead it

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:46.000
just kind of looks like an egghead six

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:50.350
luck means wow this was fast

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:53.470
six luck means we should be able to get

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:55.030
a lot of chests down here but if we find

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:57.640
the boss this quickly I would really

00:31:55.030 --> 00:32:02.850
rather fight the boss then you know

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:06.280
worry about something a little bit more

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:08.290
randomly generated like do we have more

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:11.760
items down here plus again should be no

00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:15.840
shortage items on this run to begin with

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.840
he pushed my bomb away

00:32:20.059 --> 00:32:23.340
trying to throw like if you're not going

00:32:22.169 --> 00:32:28.500
to use sad bombs here what are you gonna

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:30.299
use sad bombs for dude like if we get

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.720
8-inch nails there for a second that was

00:32:30.299 --> 00:32:33.900
weird

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:35.340
yes I would like to do a victory lap all

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:38.279
right so when I'm victory lap number two

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:40.919
here we're still in a grave spot and now

00:32:38.279 --> 00:32:46.020
oh no it does reset the timer so we'll

00:32:40.919 --> 00:32:49.080
totally be in a good spot I would

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:52.169
suggest to maybe do boss rush on this

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:53.460
one and the more strong we get usually

00:32:52.169 --> 00:32:56.220
people use the word stronger for that

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:58.590
but I'm above that the stronger we get

00:32:56.220 --> 00:33:00.000
the more likely we'll do boss rush

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:01.890
because it's less of an investment you

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.010
know we can do it faster get more

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:08.940
rewards for doing it so from a long-term

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:10.950
standpoint I would like to replace the

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:13.380
d6 with very few items but one of them

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:17.220
is a void that has sucked up the d6 in

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:18.690
the process nuns have it absolutely you

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:22.020
know what I think we should convert here

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:27.059
a little early like that looks fine to

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:28.409
me early steam sale also good and then

00:33:27.059 --> 00:33:30.510
we'll just buy one of these you know we

00:33:28.409 --> 00:33:37.140
could donate little maybe the donation

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:41.130
machine resets run to run but I did that

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:43.409
because I think it pays dividends for us

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:45.210
long term Cuba meets nice to have as

00:33:43.409 --> 00:33:46.649
well and we're kind of steam rolling so

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:48.149
this is beautiful but yeah I mean

00:33:46.649 --> 00:33:49.620
converting the HP might be something

00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:50.070
that you look at and go what the heck is

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:51.990
he doing

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:53.520
they might even go oh no baby what is

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:54.899
you doing and the answer to that

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:56.279
question is I'm doing what I think is

00:33:54.899 --> 00:33:58.830
right because I want to get cheap deals

00:33:56.279 --> 00:34:02.399
with the devil and HP that's really good

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:05.059
is normally not that difficult to obtain

00:34:02.399 --> 00:34:08.059
so the piercing shop pickup is

00:34:05.059 --> 00:34:08.059
remarkable

00:34:09.450 --> 00:34:13.810
we are really happy I would say at this

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:15.369
point we didn't go to boss rush in order

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:17.139
to grab it the next big thing that

00:34:15.369 --> 00:34:19.179
really ties this whole run together is

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:22.210
the ability to fly I will also say I

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:24.550
have no idea what item we lost but our

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:27.429
damage still seems glorious so I ain't

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:29.020
sweating it if that's a full run reroll

00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:31.000
you have to do it it's just like it's

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:36.940
written in the code when your run is

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:43.079
stacked thou shalt always reroll or thou

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:44.980
is a little baby now is I don't know

00:34:43.079 --> 00:34:47.800
speaking of which where did demon baby

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:49.480
come from I losing my mind and my

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:53.020
wishing somebody would tell me I'm fine

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:56.500
is this my last resort okay so you know

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:58.599
there is a little HP left in that room

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.640
that's all right dark bomb came through

00:34:58.599 --> 00:35:06.250
in the clutch

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:07.599
we haven't had small rock yet so oh we

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:11.410
can't fly that's right we can place

00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:15.190
bombs but you know it's kind of a lie is

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:19.869
a little unnecessary to get my drift

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:26.859
beans nobody cares restock that's a huge

00:35:19.869 --> 00:35:30.609
one try it card just for just for the

00:35:26.859 --> 00:35:32.109
kicks no battery charge bums me out a

00:35:30.609 --> 00:35:33.790
little bit but we do have a per throw

00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:35.140
room so I mean I'd like to keep the

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:38.619
Pearl room in case we get a deal with

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:40.540
the devil that we don't have a reroll

00:35:38.619 --> 00:35:45.670
for we can just generate a reroll out

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:46.810
here might as well just test it okay we

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:48.940
got another battery but we might as well

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:50.440
just do this right now

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:52.859
we should have taken the battery charge

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.859
admittedly

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.350
well easiest reroll of my life I wonder

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:02.270
if we didn't I wonder if we lost the

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:06.680
pentagram and then that gave me the

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:10.130
pentagram if that's the case lucky us

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:12.560
honestly we will open that I'd rather

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:16.720
reroll black-bean regardless though and

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:19.730
mom's eye is like not good but it's not

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:22.460
bad and there are synergies that do

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:24.050
something with it so you know be happy

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:25.340
about that we still had perthro I guess

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:26.570
you could a / throwed mom's eye we

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:27.830
already have the mom transformation and

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:32.920
the Mon transformation is meaningless

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:34.910
anyway but you get the idea Gavi please

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:38.180
this is excellent

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:39.950
so you definitely I mean if we're going

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:41.180
to take for spirit arts well we're only

00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:43.820
going to take three spirit arts with the

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:45.260
items right now you definitely want this

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:49.100
and you definitely want this and you

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:49.880
don't win Leviathan is the ability to

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:52.400
fly which is nice

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:55.010
you don't win by not taking that item

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:57.110
first simply because we weren't going to

00:36:55.010 --> 00:37:00.080
take more than we had asked for anyway I

00:36:57.110 --> 00:37:04.130
will take a second demon baby but it's

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:06.170
basically irrelevant I might be wrong

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:08.540
there but I actually don't think I

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:12.170
screwed the order up I don't think you

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:14.510
get a benefit 100% of the time from

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:15.830
taking the cheaper item first and then

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:17.120
taking the more expensive item because

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:19.610
that time we were going to spend three

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:23.210
no matter what and we had four hard

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:24.950
containers so you know there's no we're

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:28.330
not getting grandfathered into any sweet

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:33.440
you know low APR financing deals they're

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:35.150
going to keep bloody penny for now I

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:36.800
mean bloody penny with seven luck and

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:40.600
dark bomb is a pretty potent combination

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:44.780
it seems you got a ticket macaque here

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:46.700
it makes flies and spiders do way more

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:49.520
damage and it will kill everything

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:51.770
instantly so I don't think there's too

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:56.510
much of an argument when it comes to

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:58.880
this one it will hurt us on occasion but

00:37:56.510 --> 00:38:01.490
it'll also kill like almost every boss

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:03.530
instantly so if we could get immunity to

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:05.570
some explosions that would be nice or

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:07.850
immunity to all explosions which i think

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:11.480
is the only way the only variety that

00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:16.880
that item comes in so even better it

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:19.100
also probably makes sad bombs worse but

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:21.110
our damage is fifty two point zero two

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:22.850
so not sweating too much pay-to-play

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:25.640
there's options

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:26.870
sack of sacks you get an active item or

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:30.980
an item you don't want you just throw in

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:33.040
a reroll logo bombs mama mega see you

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:35.930
later starter deck now that's an item

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:38.570
grab a little re-roll there re-roll it

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:41.630
whether you get joker re-roll champion

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:43.640
belts lovely item boomerangs not a good

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:46.490
item okay you know what I will buy you

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:48.860
to get you out of the rotation thanks

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:50.330
for the spirit hearts didn't mean to use

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:53.090
it okay but like thanks for the spirit

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:54.770
eyes but see that the problem is here do

00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:56.240
that okay humbling bundle it's a great

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:58.550
item you know what I'll take the five

00:38:56.240 --> 00:39:00.560
bombs thank you for your service and

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:02.270
they'll grab this and I'll reroll get

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:03.890
nivel that's a free reroll in and of

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:06.680
itself weary roll again you get a little

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:09.440
trinket smelting action going on so you

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:11.780
smelt which means in my world that you

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:13.060
dealt and we also take mom's key I think

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:14.900
we get the heck out of here

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:16.100
right we've already been to that deal

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:19.610
with the devil honestly that worked out

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:21.950
really really well could keep buying

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:24.500
cards this is magic mush so so who cares

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:30.590
oh right careful about that one it was

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:35.810
not magic mush also I'm gonna start to

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:37.310
leave some things behind and you have

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:40.100
basically nothing to worry about there

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:42.380
whenever we want HP we can almost create

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:46.640
it out of thin air since oil is spun

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:48.620
which is the emperor card which is our

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:51.770
ticket out of boss rush with a free item

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:53.870
or honestly maybe we do want to skip

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:55.580
some floors or if we can get blank card

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:58.940
we could start to think about putting

00:39:55.580 --> 00:40:01.790
the world's fastest rerun run on the

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:03.710
books especially considering we have

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:06.200
restock it doesn't and batteries for

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:08.740
that matter doesn't seem that much of a

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.740
tall order

00:40:11.559 --> 00:40:19.460
but we got to make it happen first the

00:40:17.269 --> 00:40:21.740
run is now like very quickly gone from

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:23.749
somewhat powerful to outrageously

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:27.470
powerful so actually I mean we're not

00:40:23.749 --> 00:40:28.910
taking soy milk it's in a different life

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:32.599
no problem

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:35.779
here I'll just chocolate milk it saved

00:40:32.599 --> 00:40:38.390
our rate of fire that is a new era of

00:40:35.779 --> 00:40:40.190
greatness for us it actually made our

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:46.730
rate of fire better to take chocolate

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:48.410
milk monstros long so sucks pretty bad

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:54.309
if you're an enemy who didn't like

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:54.309
getting exploded but really nice for us

00:40:56.079 --> 00:41:00.259
we pay to play we actually borderline

00:40:59.059 --> 00:41:05.559
don't need keys anymore because

00:41:00.259 --> 00:41:08.150
remembered where we go and the answer is

00:41:05.559 --> 00:41:13.700
the mind is so good the answer is we're

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:16.880
not going to the chests we're going to

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:18.289
the I don't know why I keep truncating

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:21.470
my sentences my brains running out of

00:41:18.289 --> 00:41:23.239
glycogen or something but we're going to

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:25.220
the lamb fight which we did last time so

00:41:23.239 --> 00:41:29.720
let's keep that going dude three santero

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:31.190
cloth okay thanks for asking there was a

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:36.589
BFF in there which I should have

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:38.180
considered take some money I don't want

00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:40.489
to explode you too much epic antics add

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:43.339
bombs you run the risk I mean I'll take

00:41:40.489 --> 00:41:45.589
a three cent broken modem okay I'll take

00:41:43.339 --> 00:41:51.019
a three cent sack head it's a pretty

00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:53.749
easy decision I'll take a three cent

00:41:51.019 --> 00:41:58.160
black candles you know what I'm here for

00:41:53.749 --> 00:41:59.779
though the diplopia I mean sure doubles

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.489
everything what do you get out of this -

00:41:59.779 --> 00:42:03.819
a spade then we have 99 keys that's

00:42:01.489 --> 00:42:03.819
great

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:14.250
we already have the battery unless we

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:14.250
lost it we don't take fanny pack I guess

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:25.540
PhD is actually bad dull razor we don't

00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:28.090
really need blue map do we more options

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:30.900
still re-rolling like potentially useful

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:30.900
stuff here

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:40.859
we got a at some point though I think we

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:43.619
have to turn off and I don't really have

00:42:40.859 --> 00:42:46.829
a big min/max boner but we got to turn

00:42:43.619 --> 00:42:49.380
it off regardless because there's no

00:42:46.829 --> 00:42:51.750
need for us to min/max on a run that

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:53.520
doesn't get harder as we go along you

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:54.960
know and that's again that's kind of

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:56.670
like the reason I don't find it that

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:58.349
compelling to do rerolls to begin with

00:42:56.670 --> 00:43:01.020
so it's really just like check out how

00:42:58.349 --> 00:43:03.960
strong this run can get you know given

00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:06.780
like no possible checks for the amount

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:09.390
of time put in give it look how powerful

00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:13.020
a run can get so I am NOT against it no

00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:15.300
like if you do that screw you but not

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:17.550
really my my cup of tea we will take the

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:19.619
mark we roll that we'll take a baton

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:22.200
again which has given us a damage

00:43:19.619 --> 00:43:23.579
upgrade against all odds and then we'll

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:26.069
reroll both of these and I guess we'll

00:43:23.579 --> 00:43:28.380
take torn photo for a deer's upgrade

00:43:26.069 --> 00:43:34.800
it's actually like a pretty sizable

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:39.060
tears upgrade pardon me so I think I'm

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:40.650
going to enact go-fast protocol I think

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:43.589
we have Jacob's Ladder from whatever our

00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:46.440
buddy in a box pickup was yeah I'm going

00:43:43.589 --> 00:43:49.740
to enact go-fast principle protocol

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:54.000
whatever because there's more bombs

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:55.890
aeneas there's no reason not to accept

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.880
to literally get like every item in the

00:43:55.890 --> 00:44:01.800
game but if you've got unlimited

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:04.760
anything it loses a little bit of its

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:07.200
luster I find you know because it's not

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:10.140
you're not restrained by anything I will

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:13.800
take stopwatch I will take polka girl is

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:16.740
good I don't need the map I don't need

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:22.619
the compass I don't need the ace of

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:24.210
clubs but I'll you know do that because

00:44:22.619 --> 00:44:27.180
we have sad bombs so is I mean come on

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:28.770
in sad bombs dude like you got something

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:31.460
in sad bombs you got something against

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:34.410
America

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:36.300
we also could bomb our way through every

00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:38.370
room but the worst thing you could ever

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:41.040
say about the rerun challenge is that

00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:44.970
it's a little boring and that is not a

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:47.850
cardinal sin the it's the key challenge

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:51.120
was not boring it was extremely tense

00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:52.290
but still in my opinion sort of bad not

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:56.400
that I've been holding a grudge for it

00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:56.820
forever or anything as you can tell why

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.920
not

00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:00.060
poor Babylon didn't give us a static

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:01.590
break because we already had Whore of

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:03.570
Babylon the other thing taking a little

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:06.150
bit of a wind out of my sails right here

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:07.770
I guess you should not really have any

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:09.000
good excuse not to take a theme

00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:11.640
especially because we're getting hit all

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:15.020
the time kind of by design this rhyme is

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:15.020
what I designed to explain in due time

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:25.320
now this is important still take the

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:28.440
negative because even though permanent

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:31.230
polaroid invincibility is good it's also

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:32.940
irrelevant for us because every enemy is

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:34.470
going to die in like a single salvo of

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:36.000
these bombs so like don't worry about

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:38.430
that at all what what did I do to bleep

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.960
any it's been taken away from me I did

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:41.300
it to myself I'm sure but where did it

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:46.920
go

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:49.500
continuum seems horrible right now but

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:52.860
yeah i'm also i would take blank card

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:54.330
and maybe you can make a case for the

00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:56.820
shovel accomplishing something similar

00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:59.310
but oh my god there's blank card i was

00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:01.050
just talking about you and the reason

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:06.810
I'll take blank card is probably obvious

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:08.550
but it allows us to very very quickly go

00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:11.100
down floors especially with battery

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:14.960
charge is active here so we've got to be

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:17.730
careful about using it on areas that

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:19.260
have like differential bosses I guess we

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:20.640
could just walk out oh no way I don't

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:22.760
even know if that matters that I'll

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:26.670
disregard what I just said

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:29.280
scratch it from the books probably

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:31.230
should stop taking one damage per room

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:39.240
but

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:41.130
like a lot of potential HP game here and

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:43.800
please just anything that negates

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:45.750
explosive damage oh you know what we

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:50.490
drink it's melted bloody penny so

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:52.849
there's less to fear yeah it's you know

00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:55.260
been right inside of us the whole time

00:46:52.849 --> 00:47:00.930
just like a bad children's movie from

00:46:55.260 --> 00:47:02.640
the 1990s like the neverending story - I

00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:04.589
mean the neverending story one is great

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:07.200
and I love the neverending story - as a

00:47:04.589 --> 00:47:11.730
kid but it's just it's a little bit of a

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:14.910
rehash cool imagery but it's a little

00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:16.650
you know a little bit of a rehash I

00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:18.810
would look they didn't come here to talk

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:22.170
about neverending story though what we

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:24.900
got um nothing we really want and we no

00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:27.839
longer have rerolls however we might as

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:32.670
well take something so give me some

00:47:27.839 --> 00:47:33.990
juicy sack action go down the next floor

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:36.530
we might as well just pop the emperor

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:36.530
card right away

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:49.280
we sincerely are killing everything

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:51.110
immediately it's nice so void is

00:47:49.280 --> 00:48:02.570
something that we've more or less

00:47:51.110 --> 00:48:03.980
requested and it's kind of free but

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:06.140
we're also going to teleport with the

00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:07.520
Emperor every time we use it so as much

00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:11.600
as that makes me the world's ultimate

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:17.630
baby I understand that I stand by this

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:19.010
is our right decision here so we're just

00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:21.170
going to this is going to seem like a

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:22.910
bit of a weird call maybe but because

00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:23.930
there's a method to the madness I

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:25.490
promise well we don't want Wheel of

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:29.330
Fortune really so give me per throw

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:31.310
instead judge Emperor per throw that's

00:48:29.330 --> 00:48:34.580
what we wanted to want to get pop pop

00:48:31.310 --> 00:48:38.870
grab this nothing there blank art

00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:42.920
Emperor fight it lives go to Sheol very

00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:45.200
important to go to Sheol after this

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:49.880
point dude I'm just we still have dark

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:52.150
bomb could you just hook me up with we

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:55.900
can't quite oh we could why not

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:58.720
yeah empty vessel is actually great here

00:48:55.900 --> 00:49:00.890
other item not so much but go to show

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:03.050
you don't that's where we're going to

00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:05.200
break the chain if we can't remember to

00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:07.700
go to Sheol we're in trouble

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:14.380
literally we hurt ourselves once or go

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:17.570
to one room and we're good to go on the

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:18.830
teleportation front battery charges not

00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:20.840
to mention getting infinite battery

00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:24.650
charges suppose that's an important part

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:27.980
to mention we are taking damage now

00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:31.060
though I can't play it off any longer as

00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:31.060
if we're never getting hit

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:43.110
as much as I hate to admit it we have to

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:45.870
be careful it's not that easy when you

00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:47.820
shoot out a hundred shots every two

00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:50.550
seconds here that are extremely annoying

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:53.430
and also explode read to myself all we

00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:56.040
need is more heart space with Goffe

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:59.430
would also be fine

00:49:56.040 --> 00:50:02.910
and I don't mean like more hearts like

00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:05.460
we need HP we really just need spirit

00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:07.050
hearts to drop or otherwise be created

00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:09.570
which obviously we've got a high

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:10.740
percentage chance to happen yes I would

00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:12.480
like to do a victory lap so that's

00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:12.960
victory lap one complete we got to do

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.700
three

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:17.790
we're on victory lap two as you can see

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:21.230
by the flag there runs I mean still

00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:26.280
looks good we did lose blank card though

00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:28.920
which is not enormous that's really just

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:32.340
annoying I think we also lost mom's eye

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:37.920
which is honestly close to merciful

00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:40.800
because that was causing problems stick

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:42.690
with judgment Emperor I again you'll

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:44.700
forgive me but the run is good enough

00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:47.790
that I'm kind of like I'm not going to

00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:49.440
treat every run as if it's a lady slut

00:50:47.790 --> 00:50:53.060
mom sighing I'm not going to treat every

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:54.990
run as if it's a run you know like as if

00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:57.120
everything that we do on the run matters

00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:59.220
because at least as of right now that's

00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:02.460
disingenuous not everything we do on

00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:04.770
each run matters we're going to per

00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:05.940
throw this will take Poquette go even

00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:07.110
though we might already have it I'm

00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:11.910
assuming there's a chance for them to

00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:13.680
stack and we'll take sack of stacks we

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:14.760
still have restock okay and we'll take

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:17.430
more options which you might have

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:18.840
already had and we'll take the candle

00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:20.220
which we don't have an item that

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:22.470
replaces it right now and we'll take the

00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:25.680
Bible and we'll take a ladder and we'll

00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:28.020
take ventricle raiser and you got it

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:29.580
we're going to take the red candle deck

00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:32.790
of cards of course and there's Sackboy

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:35.370
again hello darkness my old friend I

00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:37.860
think we don't need the candle let's be

00:51:35.370 --> 00:51:39.930
real so as much as we probably are never

00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:42.360
going to use it appropriately to Emperor

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:44.940
cards that's what I like to see why not

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:46.560
take ventricle razor we also lost the

00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:47.370
mind clearly because we have no idea

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:49.200
where we're going

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:50.220
you're the one who's lost gobby gala

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:53.970
lost his mind

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:56.250
up in here up in here listo we lost BFF

00:51:53.970 --> 00:52:01.859
- but we do still have dark bums so

00:51:56.250 --> 00:52:07.500
that's solid so what's the point of

00:52:01.859 --> 00:52:09.299
ventricle raiser put quite simply look I

00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:11.430
don't even want these consumables like

00:52:09.299 --> 00:52:13.289
we've reached the point where the sacks

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:16.099
give me so many consumables I'm not

00:52:13.289 --> 00:52:16.099
interested in them anymore

00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:30.839
we're bomber boy no that was just a

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:37.530
weird pattern Ares actually fine I think

00:52:30.839 --> 00:52:39.869
the idea for me here is you know maybe

00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:41.700
the idea is just spawn the occasional

00:52:39.869 --> 00:52:43.680
spider now that I think about it because

00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:47.039
it seems like that's working out just

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:49.980
fine missing page - my shadow both of

00:52:47.039 --> 00:52:54.690
these are not particularly good however

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:56.309
neither of them is heinous and neither

00:52:54.690 --> 00:53:00.900
of them really cost us too much in the

00:52:56.309 --> 00:53:03.660
HP side of things now chaos it might

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:07.380
seem like it's like the fun item but it

00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:09.329
really just does not matter so I'm not

00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:10.770
actually like I know what we're

00:53:09.329 --> 00:53:12.690
approaching peak boredom here apparently

00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:14.849
like the longer a run gets on them the

00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:16.260
more boring I get but with 50 something

00:53:14.849 --> 00:53:18.750
damage unless there's a compelling

00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:20.430
reason not to do it on a room I think

00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:25.680
I'm just going to let tech X do the work

00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:28.160
for me like tech X is capable quite

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:30.660
easily of killing all these enemies

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:32.339
including the bosses and in doing so

00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:34.920
like very quickly as well

00:53:32.339 --> 00:53:37.380
there's guppy unless we've lost copy

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:41.309
items we have not so we're actually like

00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:45.599
out of control now up in here up in here

00:53:41.309 --> 00:53:50.309
I thinking right now as we keep going to

00:53:45.599 --> 00:53:51.770
shops and why not if the shops have

00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:55.529
blank cards

00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:58.289
amazing if they don't also completely

00:53:55.529 --> 00:54:01.859
fine we can we can still go floor to

00:53:58.289 --> 00:54:03.540
floor if we have to nothing about that

00:54:01.859 --> 00:54:06.480
really bothers me

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:10.200
and honestly with tech X there's like

00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:11.910
even more reason to only use tech X ie

00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:18.180
with guppy there's even more reason to

00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:20.940
use tech X because we really are only

00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:24.450
sad about tech X when it takes a while

00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:26.430
for tech X to shoot which is not the

00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:31.050
case right now you know what I went in

00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:34.040
the wrong direction pop our emperor card

00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:34.040
and get the heck out of Dodge here

00:54:34.850 --> 00:54:38.610
it never ends

00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:41.090
just like we pick up one consumable and

00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:44.910
we get a thousand consumables out of it

00:54:41.090 --> 00:54:47.160
don't let me don't let my demeanor I

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:49.050
should say lead you to believe that I'm

00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:50.280
not having fun with this run but I do

00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:54.980
think that this is a run that is more

00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:54.980
fun in concept than it is in actuality

00:54:55.640 --> 00:55:02.820
although I'm having fun we are going to

00:54:58.890 --> 00:55:07.440
win and that is like basically

00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:10.440
guaranteed at this point I kind of wish

00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:12.300
they would just give me the win at this

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:15.680
point will be again you run looks strong

00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:18.600
enough you're probably good to go here

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:20.520
but there's still one way for us to

00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:22.620
completely screw it up so it's not

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:26.790
really honest I guess to take that up

00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:32.160
why not dude we're going to commit to

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:34.440
the madness here there's one way we mess

00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:36.450
it up and that's by not going down to

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:40.760
the proper floor which as of right now

00:55:36.450 --> 00:55:48.690
is fine or easy to do but could change

00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:50.040
Emperor Empress Empress you do reach a

00:55:48.690 --> 00:55:52.849
point I wonder if this is what it's like

00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:54.780
to have like unlimited wealth

00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:58.589
there's nothing we can do with it at

00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:59.160
some point I mean it's a very cynical Oh

00:55:58.589 --> 00:56:01.410
got it

00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:04.440
give this back please the very cynical

00:56:01.410 --> 00:56:05.339
approach to take because there is stuff

00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:10.680
you can do with it you can give it to

00:56:05.339 --> 00:56:12.300
other people who need it you know but we

00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:14.670
can't give this run to other people who

00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:19.230
need it why don't we get holding tears

00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:23.339
there there is the occasional time where

00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:26.220
it seems to make sense to shoot your

00:56:23.339 --> 00:56:29.190
tears and I think that's pretty much 100

00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:33.540
percent just is this the right time for

00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:35.220
you to use what's it called mob the void

00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:36.990
is that the right situation for you

00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:41.400
right now cause like we've actually just

00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:43.890
got too much stuff yeah hey waz bacana

00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:45.240
I don't need Meccano get out of here I

00:56:43.890 --> 00:56:49.130
can't even see anything cuz if somebody

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:51.420
consumables on the dank ground dude

00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:54.770
judgment no I don't care it was as good

00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:54.770
though a was I'm okay with

00:56:56.750 --> 00:57:02.420
take this take this don't need that

00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:04.700
could be a waste anything extremely

00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:06.230
valuable crystal ball technology Steven

00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:08.119
really cool I mean I said the relic

00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:11.630
would be amazing and I think it would be

00:57:08.119 --> 00:57:15.230
but I'm starting to run out of patience

00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:20.319
on this run what floor do you want to

00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:23.420
skip why not this one just hear me out

00:57:20.319 --> 00:57:25.369
33 percent deal with the devil chance no

00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:26.750
real consequence to skipping it just

00:57:25.369 --> 00:57:30.560
make sure you go down to the right floor

00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:33.740
this time by the way if I want to

00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:34.190
preserve the streak I'm not sure about

00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:35.960
this

00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:38.180
but I think I will need to win the

00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:39.440
fourth run because it says you just have

00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:41.240
to start the fourth run to get the

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:44.270
achievement and I respect that

00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:47.270
but in order to win the fourth run I'm

00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:48.710
sure we got it all right in order to

00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:50.569
keep our Street going I'm sure we got to

00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:52.460
win the fourth run so we'll maybe

00:57:50.569 --> 00:57:55.369
endeavor to do that I'd rather just keep

00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:57.530
our Street going with an achievement

00:57:55.369 --> 00:57:59.569
thrown into the middle just for fun as

00:57:57.530 --> 00:58:01.010
opposed to trying to win you know

00:57:59.569 --> 00:58:03.260
another eight runs in a row that's going

00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:06.650
to take a little longer than what we've

00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:09.380
been working on right here so we've

00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:14.240
still got this run and then the next run

00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:17.060
and then the next run did you have to

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:18.980
take away blank card you know I'm giving

00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:20.480
you more than you asked for game and

00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:22.550
you're going to come here and take away

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:24.710
my blank card you know what we could do

00:58:22.550 --> 00:58:27.760
I hadn't even considered if we're really

00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:30.530
feeling frisky we could go for some

00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:32.270
sacrifice room plays it seems like a

00:58:30.530 --> 00:58:34.849
horrible idea which is why I think I

00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:36.410
kind of like it you got to deal with

00:58:34.849 --> 00:58:37.760
that we'll make sure you go down here we

00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:42.140
definitely want this we don't care about

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:44.089
the other item this run is going to be

00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:45.290
like less than 10 minutes long probably

00:58:44.089 --> 00:58:49.640
so we're getting to the point where it's

00:58:45.290 --> 00:58:53.349
pretty fast but we're also approaching

00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:53.349
the point of like complete absurdity

00:58:55.110 --> 00:59:01.090
you know that the run is so powerful I'm

00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:02.620
using like a fraction of my damage

00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:05.500
output because of the risk that it poses

00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:08.860
to me and it's just absolutely crapping

00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:11.980
on enemies like there's no recourse for

00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:18.520
them whatsoever they just die as soon as

00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:21.970
I enter the room I got to admit with our

00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:24.060
tech ex strategy one spirit heart lasts

00:59:21.970 --> 00:59:26.740
a long time

00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:29.890
things were looking like I wouldn't say

00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:33.790
bad things are looking a little weird

00:59:29.890 --> 00:59:36.850
for a while we're lucky to have pulled

00:59:33.790 --> 00:59:39.430
it back I'll be okay I don't care I

00:59:36.850 --> 00:59:43.870
don't care about the consumables too

00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:46.030
many consumables you know you know I'm

00:59:43.870 --> 00:59:48.400
consider myself an Isaac artist you know

00:59:46.030 --> 00:59:53.290
worse way to deal with an artist

00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:56.380
probably is you give them blank canvas

00:59:53.290 --> 01:00:03.100
and say paint anything you know you got

00:59:56.380 --> 01:00:05.620
a restrictions breed creativity we're

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:10.320
not in weird unlimited power you know

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:14.920
it's prequel means let me out of sholde

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:19.960
we can actually use Tami's head every

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:21.340
room without too much risk the trick is

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:23.080
you got to stand like in the center of

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:26.440
the room and do it and then everything

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:29.200
is going to die I don't know dude it's

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:32.590
like I actually get what's the opposite

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:34.300
of tunnel vision normal vision that's

01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:37.150
not really the term I'm looking for but

01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:39.040
I get normal vision when there's so many

01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:46.390
consumables on the screen like literally

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:47.660
just cannot focus on any of them please

01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:49.430
let me out

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:51.380
[Music]

01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:52.940
I don't want to do in this room I'd just

01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:54.320
so much stuff going on I didn't even

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:58.990
know this was a challenge room when I

01:00:54.320 --> 01:01:07.060
walked in you know we need is like a

01:00:58.990 --> 01:01:12.400
million de gAHS rooms some of our

01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:15.830
familiars like from Polk eggo are being

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:20.600
charms or like affected at least by

01:01:15.830 --> 01:01:23.260
broken modem I don't even know what the

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:29.600
consequences of that our long-term but

01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:31.490
probably nothing to be fair the dead

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:33.920
ends it seems like there's too many dead

01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:37.360
ends it's like is the floor constructed

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:37.360
properly there's too many dead ends

01:01:42.130 --> 01:01:47.750
every card I pick up

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:51.260
I'm foolishly thinking there's a small

01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:52.480
chance that it might be Emperor it

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:55.220
hasn't happened yet

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:59.230
at least not recently but I've also

01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:59.230
stopped picking up many of the cards so

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:05.300
what in the world happened there we also

01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:08.780
have some of the best Pokemon working

01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:11.720
out for us here like the brimstone

01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:14.270
Pokemon are first off the worst name for

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:16.040
a gang of all time but secondly doing

01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:17.450
good work for us like if any enemy gets

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:19.630
caught in their spell they're done for

01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:23.270
buddy

01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:25.010
okay curse of Darkness go go Oh another

01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:26.780
guppy items if they take a guppy item

01:02:25.010 --> 01:02:28.730
away from us we shouldn't lose our gobby

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:32.830
transformation we shouldn't lose it

01:02:28.730 --> 01:02:32.830
anyway but we might have

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:40.210
knowing that this is a dead end and why

01:02:35.859 --> 01:02:48.220
not do should maybe seek to move around

01:02:40.210 --> 01:02:53.650
here at this point I'm not joking with

01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:54.880
you you gave me a shovel I'm out of here

01:02:53.650 --> 01:02:58.359
as fast as I can go

01:02:54.880 --> 01:03:03.369
these are hunts there's something novel

01:02:58.359 --> 01:03:05.470
about beating you know the lam 0.2

01:03:03.369 --> 01:03:09.039
seconds or something like that but it

01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:10.690
loses a little bit of its luster when

01:03:09.039 --> 01:03:12.970
you got to do it so many times in a row

01:03:10.690 --> 01:03:17.529
I know you sure give me the Rosary who

01:03:12.970 --> 01:03:19.750
cares dude what did I even get there

01:03:17.529 --> 01:03:22.930
charmed one judgment card is that what I

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:23.980
picked up that made that sound it's also

01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:26.500
when curse of darkness

01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:27.549
I actually sometimes I'm like I'm not

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:29.380
even sure if we're done with the room

01:03:27.549 --> 01:03:40.240
because there's are you a friend or a

01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:42.309
foe that being said fun run and it in

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:45.490
that's true like it isn't a nun fun run

01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:47.109
if it ended it like a normal time and at

01:03:45.490 --> 01:03:50.890
least you only got to do it once unless

01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:52.480
you mess it up somehow tac-x okay how's

01:03:50.890 --> 01:03:54.190
this gonna work it's the first like

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:59.980
transformative item we've picked up in a

01:03:54.190 --> 01:04:02.440
hundred years I am assuming very good as

01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:05.289
always seems like it's doing great work

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:07.660
you know what it gives us a severe

01:04:05.289 --> 01:04:09.849
damage downgrade however it means we can

01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:11.589
actually shoot our tears so overall it's

01:04:09.849 --> 01:04:15.819
probably like substantially better for

01:04:11.589 --> 01:04:17.619
us yes I would like to do a victory lap

01:04:15.819 --> 01:04:18.940
okay what did we lose no Tammy so we

01:04:17.619 --> 01:04:21.180
didn't lose Tammy's head okay so that's

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:21.180
fine

01:04:54.380 --> 01:05:01.289
but what happened I did see that when we

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:02.730
came back we were the lost is that a

01:05:01.289 --> 01:05:05.220
mechanic I've never seen because I've

01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:07.770
never gone for the third reroll if so

01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:08.730
you got me straight up you going for the

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:11.670
troll you got me

01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:12.359
hundred percent I'm told uh just proves

01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:16.529
I'm trouble

01:05:12.359 --> 01:05:18.240
you got me at the same time I'm running

01:05:16.529 --> 01:05:19.109
it through my head did I click her

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:22.650
somehow

01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:25.470
into the lost without a holy man to look

01:05:22.650 --> 01:05:26.819
like I don't understand what happened
