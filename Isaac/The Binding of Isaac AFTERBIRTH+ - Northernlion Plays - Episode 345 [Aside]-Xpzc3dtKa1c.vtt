##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.319
everybody welcome back to her online

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.850
please abiding by scattereth plus a tome

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.970
all you got them yell for me buddy

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.630
oh you just realize that the office door

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.490
is closed no longer desires to be in

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.650
this place of residence anyway we're

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.970
doing well here today we've been having

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.779
some good runs we've been having some

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.789
fun runs I mean that's really for you to

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.740
decide as opposed sure we'll smell the

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.510
watch battery I'm not above that we got

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.740
good damage mmm

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.320
below average speed and rate of fire

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.320
mom's purse with trinkets melter it's

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.180
like synergistic because they both have

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.450
the word trinket in their descriptions

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.020
but beyond that I don't think mom's

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.320
person trinkets melter have any synergy

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:49.079
whatsoever however if one day we decided

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.520
to drop trinkets melter you know what

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.489
give it a shot

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.989
that was definitely a bad decision we

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.280
should have waited I mean this room even

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.960
would have been better but if we ever

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.820
decide to drop cranking smelter will be

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.230
happy to have mom's purse possibly

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.449
because mom's purse will allow us to

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.949
hold two trinkets but there's a lose any

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.340
advantage to smelting two trinkets in

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.890
the first place so Isaac's been fun

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.780
lately I've been playing a little looser

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.430
you know our streak has ended and I've

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.680
got no real tie to the rat-race

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.299
as far as Isaac goes we're a long way

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.460
away from getting the 200 streak so I'm

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.780
not really sweating performance lately

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.650
I'm just trying to have fun runs and I

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.759
hope that that's been manifesting itself

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:34.650
well in the commentary speaking of which

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.750
Josh brought up something very useful to

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.060
me today useful from a comedy standpoint

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.210
at least and the bit built itself very

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.100
easily it's called the curious case of

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.070
the trouble with having friends who are

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:51.720
actually smart Josh comes to me today

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.759
and he says hey why is it that bats get

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.490
their own name for bat feces

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:01.770
you know guano whereas like no other

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:04.799
animal gets its own animal specific name

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.390
for for poop and I said you know what

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.020
Josh that's a good bit what if we just

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.450
started calling you know other animals

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.410
droppings guano you think people would

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.610
be mad at us you think

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.230
they'd be like what's this guy putting

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.870
on airs for you know I'm sorry I had to

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.640
clean up some cat guano they'd be like

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.260
what did this guy go to Chile once in

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.210
his whole life and now he's calling

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.700
everything guano and one of our friends

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.540
who is like a freakin wastewater

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.050
treatment

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.910
engineer slash systems designer came in

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.620
and was like well in 100 has its own

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.660
name because actually phosphorus was not

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.570
highly biologically available during uh

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.640
the historical record and as a result it

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.720
was a very important part of agriculture

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.720
especially in African in South American

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.300
the shut up mic not Mike Fox if

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.560
different skill set specialization

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.880
although you know if you get him talking

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.420
about kilowatt hours you're getting the

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.690
same thing see Josh and I just want to

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.880
we just want a BS and then we have the

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.830
ultimate straight man comes in you know

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.360
who will actually uh bioavailable

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.790
kilocalories in the water only

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.710
previously became apparent to us because

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.110
they were stored in phytoplankton come

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:21.900
on dude I'm trying to construct a bit

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:24.330
here doesn't work it's cool though I'm

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.830
in a way I'm envious because well I'm

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.790
not envious necessarily because that's

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:32.790
the turbo the turbo nerd but um I'm

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.640
envious because of that passion for your

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.290
for your discipline you know it does

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.630
happen to me though like sometimes we'll

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.870
be in Austin's chat and someone will ask

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.480
me cool she's question about coding and

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.950
I'll be like I'll answer it honestly and

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.060
then they'll be like I had a nerd I was

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.530
just trying to prove that you're a nerd

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.090
and I'm like you know what the sticks

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.370
and stones may break my bones mister but

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.510
words will never hurt me unless of

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.100
course you try to dereference a null

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.980
pointer in which case you'll get a seg

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.720
faulted well not a null pointer but it'd

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.110
be initialize point see I'm doing it

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.090
right now

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.680
the point is it's actually really cool I

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.660
guess to be a passionate about what

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.480
you're into but it's comedy poison

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.049
unless you can spin it out and make it a

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.989
little bit more accessible I guess but

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.229
it's true I mean I don't understand why

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.520
guano specifically gets whale it's good

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.650
for ever since we had this guano

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.490
specific apparently guano is not just

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.990
for bats

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:35.280
it's also for seabirds which is my

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:41.789
favorite skin in song cuz I miss sea as

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:48.150
a bird babe then this bird lives in the

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:49.590
sea yeah what's better than being an

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.620
expert if you know what I mean

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.699
yeah that's right a guano bird yeah well

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.080
one day there's going to be a callback

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:59.430
punchline that actually works there but

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.039
I don't think today's the day you know

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.970
what take that we don't if you want it

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:08.130
let me tell you this straight up if you

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:13.820
want the most nitpicky thing to ever

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:17.250
nitpick me about technically we should

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:19.229
not use trinket smelter until we're

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.270
holding two trinkets and I'm being

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:24.780
sincere when I say that this is actually

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:28.650
the bar none the most pedantic thing you

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:31.110
could ever criticize my play for and

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.760
still be right because oh what if two

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.470
trinkets drop on the next room well we

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.479
got these battery charges yeah but what

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.659
if two trinkets fall on the room after

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:42.630
that you get your you're right and I

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:44.880
hate it it's it's absolutely not words

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.010
it's the kind of thing we're like you

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.050
know I don't know have you it's

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:52.680
needlessly protective because the odds

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.030
of it going bad are near zero but it's

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.130
still smart to do like I don't know how

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.009
many of you guys are in a country where

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.690
you had to take in class driving lessons

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:02.250
like the way that it worked in the in

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.770
the province that I grew up in in Canada

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.930
was you have three stages to your

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.130
license first you take a written test if

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.380
you get above a certain level on the

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.990
written test then you can be behind the

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.400
wheel of a car with a passenger who has

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.990
had their license for more than five

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.210
years so it's basically going to take

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.400
them both it's basically their way of

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.919
saying like okay you know the rules of

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.099
the road get the heck out of here you

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:29.130
can read the signs even if the sign said

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:30.110
long haired hippie people need not apply

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.670
anyway

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:37.700
that's another bit for another day

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:39.830
perhaps but uh and then so after a year

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.110
of having that I believe he was a year

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.180
at least you can get what's called you

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.510
don't I was a terrible dodge we got

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:50.660
lucky you can get what's called your g2

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:54.110
the g2 is your learner's permit well

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:56.840
it's like as intermediate driving

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.820
license that basically says hey you know

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.950
you have your driver's license you can

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.630
drive by yourself but like you can't

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:07.010
have more than three people in your car

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:08.330
you can't more than three people in your

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.250
car that don't have a full license

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.800
anyway or something like that you can't

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.810
have any alcohol in your system you know

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.700
some rules that are basically like

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.870
pretty generous but at the same time you

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.540
don't have your full license so then the

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.310
other thing that does is give you five

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.900
years to get your full license at which

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.100
point you know even if you're a hundred

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.450
and thirty years old you get to keep

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.920
that as long as you just don't forget to

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:31.490
renew it every five years which seems

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:33.860
like a really bizarre reason to have to

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:38.240
retest people but anyway I digress

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:41.770
so moving from your intermediate license

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:44.840
to your full license normally takes a

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:47.720
one year but if you take a provincially

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:50.360
accredited in class series of lessons it

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:53.630
takes eight months or at least you can

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:55.670
take your I think I've got this totally

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:58.040
confused right now seventeen year olds

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:59.570
in Ontario are going you are an idiot no

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.100
it's just it's been a while but the way

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:05.780
it actually works is if you take in car

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:07.490
driving lessons then you get you get to

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.320
take your full test after eight months

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.420
but anyway the point is with all these

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.070
in-class driving lessons at the time I

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.170
was like this is really helpful and I

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.300
think it is but they teach you stuff

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:19.370
that take it from somebody who drives in

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.460
you know a downtown city centre a few

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:24.230
times a week it's not applicable for

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:26.360
real life you know they have you narrate

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.470
what you're supposed to be doing so

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.910
they'll like play a video and then

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.650
they'll be like okay Ryan why don't you

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:33.950
narrate what you do in this situation oh

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:36.020
well I see a a black comma Civic

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:38.420
approaching from behind so I check my

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.860
mirror to gauge distance and then I put

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.420
my foot over the brake to get ready to

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.979
cover it in case he comes in too fast

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.340
and then it's been six seconds since I

00:08:42.979 --> 00:08:45.380
checked

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.910
a blind-spot so I'm going to going to

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:50.360
check the blind spot and then I go back

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:52.490
and I you know reexamine the black Honda

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.990
Civic and I memorize its license plate

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.880
number in case it commits a traffic

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:57.920
violation again it's actually really

00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:00.320
good I don't take the responsibility of

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:04.250
driving lightly you know I consider it

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:07.190
like it's very important to stay stay

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:09.050
alert and stay safe it's a pair of

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:11.960
phrase words from some great Canadian

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:14.330
idols but that's that's not realistic in

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.780
the moment you know it's the same thing

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:22.370
where you know when I always learned in

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:23.750
in in class driving lessons I think

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.520
we're going to wait for the shop in in

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:28.790
class driving lessons it was like you

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.980
should always stop where you can still

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:32.630
see the bottom of the car in front of

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:35.210
you that way you're not too close I'm

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:36.620
here to tell you if you do that at least

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.700
I'm not saying we're drive we're better

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.830
drivers here I think we're actually a

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:41.750
lot worse but if you do that in downtown

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:44.210
Vancouver you're going to get your

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:46.460
freaking windshield bashed in with a

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:49.340
tire iron or something like that they'll

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:52.430
be like because you're if everybody's

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:56.530
seeing the car in front of yous bottom

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:59.960
that means there's like 15 feet per lane

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:01.670
that is presently being unused one dude

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.080
you know two blocks behind you on Homer

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:05.030
Street thought he could make the

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.410
intersection but now you know traffic's

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:08.420
backed up and he's stuck in the middle

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:10.490
but it's like a honk situation and

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.570
you're saying oh yeah but that's his

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:14.060
fault he shouldn't ride to make the

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:16.820
intersection yeah but at the same time I

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:20.300
didn't even look in traffic's direction

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:21.800
when you pass the intersection we're

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:26.890
gonna pop amperes here because big horn

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:29.840
is a disaster anyway I'm not trying to

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:32.330
justify unsafe driving habits rather I'm

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.770
just saying that you got to know your

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.930
surroundings but that's that's what I

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:38.030
mean when I say that it's a very

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:40.910
belaboured metaphor that required a lot

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:42.200
of explanation however it's basically

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:45.680
what we've got going on with trinkets

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:50.240
melter here trinkets melter is you know

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:52.160
young drivers of Ontario telling you

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.930
like every 10 seconds you should

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.310
maintain a 1 kilometre ring of

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:58.850
visibility on a 400

00:10:55.310 --> 00:11:01.430
highway and I'm here to tell you a real

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:03.040
life sometimes fudge you I won't do what

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:05.840
you tell me

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:07.160
HP please dude I don't know about this

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.430
I'm a little scared actually

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:12.860
I'm like a lot scared I just can't I

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:18.950
wish I could but I just can't so we're

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:20.720
moving on if you are maybe you're

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:23.150
watching this and you you don't have

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:25.430
your driver's license you're you're

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:27.350
either too young and your driver's

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:29.210
license or you just haven't prioritize

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:31.430
it for whatever reason maybe you're

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:33.650
scared or anxious about driving I'm here

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:36.400
to tell you the most I don't like this

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:43.490
dude there's just there's just no

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:44.839
freaking hpe anywhere on this run this

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:46.760
has been happening so much lately

00:11:44.839 --> 00:11:48.440
I want to get 15 cents we're not going

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.320
to get 15 cents so just take this first

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:53.300
and we'll see how life proceeds let's go

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:56.570
we got a spirit heart out of that pretty

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:58.640
lucky um I'm here to tell you something

00:11:56.570 --> 00:12:02.000
very reassuring I hope which is that you

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:03.800
being anxious to drive is exactly the

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.890
reason I want you on the road I mean

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:09.620
this is I I want you to know that when I

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:10.790
was a when I was a kid without a kids

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.860
let's say when I was a teenager the

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:15.380
concept of self-driving cars did not

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:18.440
exist I don't think I heard the phrase

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:23.030
self-driving car until I was like you

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:25.070
know in my early 20s maybe we were we

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:27.260
were still stuck in that 1980s flying

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:31.370
cars well when is when is Chevrolet

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:32.720
gonna come out with a flying car but you

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.589
know maybe now these days you're like

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.050
I'm just going to wait for the

00:12:33.589 --> 00:12:38.330
self-driving cars it might be 25 years

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:41.000
until they it like the public zeitgeist

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:43.040
but that's not that much you know all

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.740
these I'll be 40 years old not me I'll

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:48.530
be long dead from climate change by then

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.760
but you guys hopefully we'll still be

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.440
trucking along keeping the human race

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.380
going at which point you know maybe

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:56.750
self-driving cars will become a thing no

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:58.640
I mean it'll probably actually be the

00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:00.770
big earthquake that eventually hits the

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:03.830
Pacific Northwest and wipes us out but I

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:05.600
don't know we'll see the point is you

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:07.790
become the stewards of the road at that

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.110
point but if you're anxious about

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:13.250
driving that's why

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:18.940
I want you on the road because too many

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:21.740
people are very cavalier dude I need HP

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:25.070
too many people in my opinion are far

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:26.420
too cavalier about driving you know I've

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:29.089
been driving

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:31.160
I mean I'm 28 now I got my license when

00:13:29.089 --> 00:13:32.720
I was first allowed to get my license so

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.910
I've been driving for 12 years with

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:39.860
admittedly I didn't touch a vehicle

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:42.140
throughout all of university or when I

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:44.329
lived in Korea so although I have had my

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:46.040
license for 12 years I haven't really

00:13:44.329 --> 00:13:50.570
driven for 12 years I probably driven

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:52.310
for like seven but I'm just here to tell

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:53.690
you if you're driving around downtown

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:55.690
Vancouver you haven't gotten a scratch

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:59.329
on the car you get to keep your license

00:13:55.690 --> 00:14:02.839
that is it's like a freaking crazy taxi

00:13:59.329 --> 00:14:05.810
video game every time but yeah you know

00:14:02.839 --> 00:14:11.959
one of those crazy taxi video games the

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:13.850
point is I have not lost my my I gotta

00:14:11.959 --> 00:14:16.420
check this I have not lost my anxiety

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:20.209
about driving I'd treat driving with

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:22.010
respect which is lame as heck I'll admit

00:14:20.209 --> 00:14:24.589
you know and even my wife makes fun of

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:26.990
me for it sometimes you know should be

00:14:24.589 --> 00:14:29.300
like you know if you drove faster we

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:30.829
could get there 15 seconds earlier and I

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:34.190
might well he should've just left 15

00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:36.140
seconds earlier and is the constant the

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:38.600
source of like men are from Mars Women

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:40.430
are from Venus sort of situation but I

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.930
digress about that we've already gone on

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:43.370
enough bits about you know the

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:46.250
differences between late people and

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:49.250
early people get dusted please extremely

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:52.130
and dude we got I couldn't get the

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:54.380
spirit hard in time there we go

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:59.149
now we may actually live a little longer

00:14:54.380 --> 00:15:01.209
this run is dicey man but I want more

00:14:59.149 --> 00:15:03.740
anxious drivers like me out on the road

00:15:01.209 --> 00:15:06.260
confident drivers will tell you that the

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:09.350
like anxious drivers are a real problem

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:11.510
I disagree with this unconfident drivers

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:14.959
are genuinely you know they're like

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:16.190
calls not even the best to be behind in

00:15:14.959 --> 00:15:18.940
every circumstance because you're like

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:21.940
Johnson they seize the gap seize the gap

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.940
but

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.370
we need less people that are like every

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:29.660
other driver is bad but I go 30 miles an

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:31.790
hour over the speed limit but that's

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:33.530
because I'm a good driver and I've never

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:35.240
been in an accident and I've assured

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:37.220
myself that I never will be in an

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:41.480
accident until I get in a horrific one

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:48.260
that you know is lead to terrible human

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:50.540
cost regardless I I couldn't be more

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.320
excited for self-driving cars and I own

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.690
a car

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:57.530
I own a car that is sort of new as well

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:59.540
I am people rephrase this as me being

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:02.030
anti science and I disagree I'm more

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:04.630
like I'm trying to think of a more

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:08.690
flattering way to describe it I'm more

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:11.720
skeptical of how quick people adopt

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:15.440
things yeah I'm going to be honest with

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:17.240
you I don't see mainstream adoption you

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.100
know over 50% of the cars being

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:21.470
self-driving until I'm in like my

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:22.790
middle-age years and it whenever I'd say

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:24.800
that to my friends who are more

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:27.950
forward-facing admittedly many of them

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.540
you know work in tech or engineering and

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.950
I guess have a vested interest in this

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.510
and they may be right I mean they're the

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:34.880
experts basically and I'm the layperson

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:36.050
but they always go what about the iPod

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:39.680
yeah okay

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:41.210
well they sold like 75 million iPods in

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:45.470
the first year those things are $200

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:48.020
each there are 300 dollars each maybe

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:50.330
the point is they're not like $30,000

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:53.210
each it's a little different not to

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:56.930
mention driving for whatever reason is

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:58.130
associated with like freedom you know

00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:00.020
the idea that you can drive your own

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:03.380
cards not just a means of transportation

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:05.270
it's also like it's an identity thing

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:09.620
you know nobody gets on the bus and goes

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:12.470
I'm a bus rider I like I'm pretty close

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:14.960
to that whenever I get on the on like

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:17.540
Vancouver's public transit I'm a little

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:20.750
proud if I'm not afraid for my life

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:24.770
based on the clientele I get on and I go

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:27.500
this is amazing I can't believe I'm on a

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:29.150
train takes me exactly where I want to

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:31.750
go it's like I'm in Europe or something

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:34.559
though we got a good item thank you

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:35.820
there's no way we're making boss

00:17:34.559 --> 00:17:39.269
unless something changes pretty

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:42.090
drastically here but for the most part

00:17:39.269 --> 00:17:46.169
most most people aren't as weird as I am

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:47.129
I guess in that department that's what

00:17:46.169 --> 00:17:48.840
happens when you grow up in a town that

00:17:47.129 --> 00:17:51.120
has like very little public transit I

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:52.710
guess anyway the point is I think it's

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.690
going to take a little while for for

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:59.879
mainstream adoption of that and that's

00:17:54.690 --> 00:18:02.370
okay but I don't think if you're waiting

00:17:59.879 --> 00:18:03.509
for it to hit the you know critical mass

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:05.789
so you're going to be waiting a while

00:18:03.509 --> 00:18:09.450
but I don't know anything is this is the

00:18:05.789 --> 00:18:12.299
secondary part of this I will buy my

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:14.460
hope is that you know we have a 2015

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:16.740
automobile my hope is that that's the

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:21.269
last non self-driving automobile I have

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:24.899
to buy but we'll see I take no pleasure

00:18:21.269 --> 00:18:26.549
I put 100% faith in the algorithm which

00:18:24.899 --> 00:18:30.830
sounds like the kind of thing that

00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:33.509
people say in like a dystopian film

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:35.639
before things go terribly wrong but I

00:18:33.509 --> 00:18:38.070
kind of feel like this I love dystopian

00:18:35.639 --> 00:18:41.429
sci-fi but it's also like in some ways

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:43.559
ruined our perception of human ingenuity

00:18:41.429 --> 00:18:46.200
because we there's never like a movie

00:18:43.559 --> 00:18:49.619
where tech has made things amazing and

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:51.090
then we go oh that new invention uh that

00:18:49.619 --> 00:18:52.830
looks like that thing that made

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:57.720
everything amazing you know we always go

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:59.940
from Skynet no Big Brother has never

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.110
been like hey there's a this machine

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.879
solves all diseases

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:05.899
I guess the auto doc from alien but of

00:19:02.879 --> 00:19:07.259
course they don't go hey look you solved

00:19:05.899 --> 00:19:08.909
you know

00:19:07.259 --> 00:19:10.470
you cured cancer with the auto doc

00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:12.419
instead they go use this auto dr.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:15.809
Griffith freaking alien outside of your

00:19:12.419 --> 00:19:18.659
body you were impregnated with against

00:19:15.809 --> 00:19:23.669
your will so there's always a dystopian

00:19:18.659 --> 00:19:26.669
been doing so it's all I'm saying this

00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:29.429
is like the perfect teleportation I am

00:19:26.669 --> 00:19:31.889
still genuinely very frightened about

00:19:29.429 --> 00:19:34.110
our chances to succeed on this run we

00:19:31.889 --> 00:19:36.720
have gotten a lot of utility items and

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:39.029
almost no items that actually like

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:41.580
directly improve our DPS in fact quad

00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:43.350
shot well on a literal level probably

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.299
does improve our DPS we did get it tears

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:46.870
down great after picking it up which is

00:19:45.299 --> 00:19:48.700
like a

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:54.520
incredible bummer because now our rate

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:56.260
of fire is just garbage good trinket

00:19:54.520 --> 00:20:02.820
please I mean I don't know what store

00:19:56.260 --> 00:20:06.070
credit does when you smelt it well uh

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:08.730
yeah we will only have to keep our

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:11.500
eternal heart as well that's crazy

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:12.880
might as well smelt it so our first item

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.950
should be free I think but I don't know

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.180
after that it could be a crapshoot the

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:17.440
Abaddonn pickup is really nice in our

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:20.890
rate of fire is actually much much

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:23.200
better now we might be able to make boss

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:26.200
rush but it would have to be like we'd

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:31.780
have to pick right right off the bed so

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:36.610
I'm mostly like I'm Pro human progress I

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:38.440
think but I'm also pretty naive for the

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:39.309
most part I think I'm just I'm going to

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.590
let the eggheads

00:20:39.309 --> 00:20:43.090
sort it out as I've said on the show

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:45.340
many times I don't want to be like one

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:48.370
of the first million people to buy a

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:50.380
self-driving car I want to be in like

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:53.500
that 1 million to 10 million range maybe

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:55.210
or even like 10 million to a hundred

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:59.230
million or even on a million to a

00:20:55.210 --> 00:21:02.100
billion that's fine by me let them work

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:04.840
the kinks out is the thing is like if

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:06.760
eventually it'll be good but it'll

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:10.000
always get better right like I'm really

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:12.160
happy that I live in an era and this is

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.090
a little not much but like a little

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:19.350
North American specific but I was

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:22.740
anxious about flying in an era where

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:26.730
since the first time that I've flown

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:30.820
till now there has not been a major

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:35.860
crash of a North American airline the

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:37.990
biggest one that I can think of at least

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:40.870
I mean of course there was a Malaysian

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:43.000
Airlines flight 370 but this mean like

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:45.520
within North America there has not been

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.640
an airline disaster on a major airline

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:51.640
in like infinity years which is ignorant

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:54.550
but mostly still true I think I'm going

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:59.020
to take toxic shock over moms knife just

00:21:54.550 --> 00:22:00.640
for just for s's and giggles so I I just

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.930
like sort of thought about

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.150
one day and I was like you've been

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:04.690
flying for like four or five years at

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:07.870
this point

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:10.120
fairly frequently barely have you ever

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:12.310
experienced turbulence never had an

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:15.730
emergency landing and then beyond this

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:18.040
there's almost never been a disaster in

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:19.450
your flying lifetime so you got to

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.940
choose if you're going to continue to be

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:25.150
irrationally afraid of this and I just

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:27.490
sort of I hate when people say this but

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:31.630
I just sort of got over it more or less

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:33.130
I took a pen to our shop yet the other

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:34.840
thing that I could have done and it was

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:36.220
probably 5050 for a while which one was

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:39.370
going to happen was I could have said

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:41.650
we're do and I'm not flying again until

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:43.750
a bird goes down because then that means

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:45.040
that we're probably not expected to have

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:48.850
another one for quite some time

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:50.260
no and I embrace the fact that when I

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:52.570
talk about you know like these things

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:55.660
never crash I'm opening myself up to

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:57.460
some Titanic style irony if I end up

00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:00.220
dying in a plane crash I'm flying in

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:03.580
like three days four days if I end up

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:04.660
going down in a plane crash mourn me if

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:08.440
you if you wish

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:10.600
it's like a king or something moan me if

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:13.420
you wish but recognize that I was aware

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:15.010
of the irony but I will go down I mean

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:16.180
screaming for my life and probably

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:19.180
throwing up from being in like a

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:20.920
negative eighty degree you know twelve

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:23.890
g-force loop or something like that but

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:27.610
also in my head be like even if I had

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:30.340
not said the stuff that welcomes the

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:31.690
ironic death uh this probably still

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:35.530
would have happened so I'm okay with it

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:41.200
you know so the life of being skeptical

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:46.120
I suppose I also don't think that irony

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:47.920
is a causal factor most of the time if

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.970
we did not go into this room we might as

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:51.760
well check it I'm just going to be

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:57.240
straight up with you this run is kind of

00:23:51.760 --> 00:24:00.100
garbage now that we've got Abaddon and

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:02.290
as well take it just stack them up now

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:05.170
that we got Abaddon packed it's actually

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:06.520
like pretty good relative to where it

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:10.450
used to be the tears upgrade from the

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:12.490
pact was like insanely important and by

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:15.580
that I mean the MFN

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:19.450
Act y'all which is actually the pack but

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:20.880
you get the idea maybe we have been to

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:24.130
our shop and I just forgot I don't know

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:26.950
but but the whole point of this is I

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:29.110
continuing to just idiocy on my own part

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:33.059
and I embrace it the only way out of

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:36.190
this idiocy is to finish the episode but

00:24:33.059 --> 00:24:38.800
you know I'm glad that I live in an era

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:40.900
before which aviation is quite safe

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:43.450
it'll probably continue to get safer but

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:48.450
I can't get much safer than zero crashes

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:50.830
you know zero crashes plus regulations

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:55.300
there were commercial airliners in like

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:58.570
the 1940s and it wasn't smart money that

00:24:55.300 --> 00:25:01.750
you were going down but you know

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:04.390
probably like Oh point zero one percent

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:06.309
of them well maybe even less like point

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:09.040
zero zero one percent of flights did

00:25:06.309 --> 00:25:12.250
crash that's a one in 10,000 shot you

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:16.450
feel pretty safe but at the same time it

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:18.190
happened all the time so that's where I

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:19.090
want to be with self-driving cars I want

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:21.700
to be at the part where we're at right

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:23.860
now where there's you know thirty

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:27.040
thousand flights a day in North America

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:31.300
and like maybe one incident and no

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:34.390
crashes and this is I got to be careful

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:36.900
with these Matt I got to be careful with

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:38.500
these episodes because I always go like

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.970
occasionally just through the law of

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.710
large numbers you talk about something

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:44.530
like that and then something terrible

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:45.790
happens and you go oh well that episodes

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:49.090
going to be awkward when it comes out

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:51.490
just know that that is not the it's not

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:53.800
my intention if there is an air disaster

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:56.080
this week I'm not recording this after

00:25:53.800 --> 00:26:00.130
the air disaster and going like this'll

00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:02.620
be funny I'm generally endeavor to

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:05.800
provide a pleasant environment for these

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:08.320
episodes although you know it they will

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:10.240
raise your blood pressure if you have

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.190
watched 3,000 episodes and expect

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:17.830
perfect play which is I think a fairly

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:20.410
reasonable concern or request I don't

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:21.970
believe that anybody feels the way I do

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:23.169
about you okay well they do something

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:26.370
sorry this guy who's going to be close

00:26:23.169 --> 00:26:30.030
this is the way it's got to go

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:32.470
see ya next Tuesday

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:33.520
Skype see you next to that's just an

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.810
expression I don't know if that's

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.160
actually an expression but I'm going to

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:36.670
say it's an expression see you next

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.860
Tuesday

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:41.170
there's definitely I'll plug it Tuesday

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:47.160
for a hamburger today but I don't even

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:49.750
know what that's from I need your keys I

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:53.890
need your charity anymore okay

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:56.350
I just want I can't believe that with a

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:59.380
deal with the devil guarantee on every

00:26:56.350 --> 00:27:01.960
single floor this is what we've managed

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:03.010
to create on this run now oh that mouse

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.350
point has probably been up there like

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:08.620
the whole time um well since you know

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:14.040
recently when I told Skype I'd see you

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:16.330
next Tuesday um it's a long-distance

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:22.440
situation here we had a shop on the womb

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:25.390
thanks to silver dollar oh good

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:28.240
either way still not bad

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:32.910
I can't believe that for all these deals

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:36.250
with the devil that we have gotten here

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:38.980
we still remain at seven point zero two

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:41.590
damage twenty-two rate of fire look

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:44.500
you're going to be like NL extremely

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:50.590
intellectual voice 22 divided by four is

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:52.300
like five point five so your damage or

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:54.190
your tear rate is actually like roughly

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:57.610
proportionally at the tear cap but it

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:59.440
isn't because not all of the we're not

00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:01.810
shooting four shots in a straight line

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:06.430
with quad shot we're shooting four shots

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:08.560
in like a spread which makes it less

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:11.290
valuable than having four shots in a

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:15.070
straight line it's still not bad I would

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:17.110
suggest but 22 rate of fire is fine but

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:18.520
it could be better is the long and

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:21.220
belabored point I'm trying to make here

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:23.020
dude we continue to just get like not

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:29.410
very good items here

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:31.300
I didn't know there were this many not

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:33.970
that amazing deal with devil items oh

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:38.220
there we go now they're worth 20 okay

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:39.570
now that's exactly where we want to be

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:43.700
of course I was super excited to have

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:43.700
this on sous room and then we have

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:47.490
gotten a curse that makes it uh

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:50.450
applicable you know we should have done

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:53.850
on the last floor is I use that for room

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:55.020
to reroll our deal with the devils into

00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:56.789
something that hopefully would have been

00:28:55.020 --> 00:29:00.750
a little bit more useful but I didn't

00:28:56.789 --> 00:29:04.020
even think about that is admittedly is

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:06.690
bad play I should pay more attention to

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:08.010
the interstitial stuff like that the

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:11.070
other problem is though that like

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:13.350
sometimes this run despite not being

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:16.669
great is is almost unusable

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:19.620
you know we're relatively tanky our

00:29:16.669 --> 00:29:21.210
damage is good enough and we've got

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:23.130
other like utility factors that are

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:25.110
working out well for us so the odds of

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:28.500
us losing this run are extremely low so

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:33.030
it's hard to get worried about the stuff

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:37.409
that is small like reroll in a deal with

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:40.020
the devil in in this one unique situated

00:29:37.409 --> 00:29:43.559
why I smelled the trinket double on Zeus

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:44.909
I will take and that's my own personal

00:29:43.559 --> 00:29:46.620
fault because you should take care of

00:29:44.909 --> 00:29:47.970
the pennies even though I think that

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.049
expression you know take care of the

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:50.909
pennies of the pan take care of

00:29:49.049 --> 00:29:58.409
themselves is idiotic

00:29:50.909 --> 00:29:59.520
it's also you the real expression should

00:29:58.409 --> 00:30:03.360
we take care of the pennies because why

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:07.559
the heck not give me the gods please the

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:09.419
gas please that's a wise no thank you

00:30:07.559 --> 00:30:10.830
take care of the pennies because their

00:30:09.419 --> 00:30:12.900
pennies they're worth something that's a

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:16.500
much better phrase I wanted to see tears

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:20.880
upgrades if they were here to tears down

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:24.720
grades not that interested so yeah we

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:26.250
should be taking care of our pennies but

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:28.020
sometimes you know there's got to be

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:29.700
another expression that's like hey mr.

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:31.830
Bill Gates if you got a million pennies

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:35.730
in your bank account ah let's leave a

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:39.210
one on the ground now we're getting into

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:42.210
dueling idioms they detained and and and

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:45.090
and and a home that that bit will never

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:48.140
work requires way too much mental

00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:48.140
processing power

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:53.890
pitch rhyming

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:58.030
thinking of idioms it's hard to think of

00:30:53.890 --> 00:31:01.830
idioms on the fly don't wanna be an

00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:04.690
American idiom dududu dudududududududu

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:07.030
you know what they say the 90s a kiss

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:10.180
before that on doo doo doo doo

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:12.310
not true by the way except on a very

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:14.440
broad level it actually gets

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:17.110
consistently brighter until dawn after

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:18.400
the darkest point in the night not

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:23.650
trying to like rain on your parade or

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:27.460
anything just the same just a patently

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:29.410
untrue statement there was a register

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:32.020
that saw recently it was like what what

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:33.340
expression do you hate and then there

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:35.140
were some that I wish I could remember

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:37.630
them which would make this anecdote not

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:39.910
worthless but like yeah you know you got

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:43.660
a good point there what doesn't kill you

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:44.800
makes you stronger I underwent the

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:47.490
message of what doesn't kill you makes

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:49.780
you stronger but it is actually stupid

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:52.210
many things that don't kill you make you

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:56.530
much weaker what if you know you're

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:57.400
freaking ACL gets torn what doesn't kill

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:59.530
you makes you stronger

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:03.250
hey keep a weight on your leg for like

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:03.940
you know three months I don't feel much

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:07.150
stronger

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:08.650
oh but NL it's some it makes you

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:10.090
stronger mentally because you've been

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:13.600
through it and know that you can survive

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:14.830
yeah but that's just give me a mental

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.480
strength test against someone who just

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:17.770
tore their ACL it what doesn't kill you

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:21.010
makes you stronger you should be able to

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:22.420
prove it but I guess in the end I'm

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:28.870
being pedantic it's just something to

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:30.580
make you feel better so maybe I'm maybe

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:31.960
I'm overthinking it maybe I'm under

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:35.310
thinking it maybe she's born with it

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:38.050
maybe it's mabeline that's how it goes I

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:39.700
still I look through that thread for

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:41.740
take care of the pennies and the pounds

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:44.110
take care of themselves and I that is

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:47.950
actually my least favorite idiom because

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:52.720
it promotes genuine financial stupidity

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:57.220
the idea being hey what's the subtext

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:59.140
being if I skip having a coffee a day it

00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:59.920
doesn't matter about my big purchases

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:02.650
but

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:04.150
like I used to get one coffee a day at

00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:05.350
the gas station but now that I'm saving

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:06.820
that $1 a day

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:08.320
I don't feel bad about the fact that I

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:12.490
just purchased you know a brand new

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:18.660
Mustang it's not the pounds do not take

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:21.910
care of themselves in any circumstance

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:27.670
there were people who go to school to

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:29.530
learn how to take care of the pounds sad

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:32.110
bombs is great with 49 bombs

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:36.340
euthanasia is a nice pick up here we

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:41.740
just got a coast to victory but it is

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:48.370
scarier than it had to be no doubt well

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:50.170
hello I've received a textual message do

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:51.790
we actually I mean we have seven luck so

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:57.340
I'm expecting some items to show up we

00:33:51.790 --> 00:34:02.320
could die on this run okay I hope that

00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:05.250
we will not which is quaint but

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.250
desirable

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:17.730
I can't read the message right now

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:20.190
you're torturing me again what if I told

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:22.530
you not only do I not like talking on a

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:24.300
telephone I don't like getting text

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:26.250
messages because text messages are how I

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:27.980
tell people that I love to contact me if

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:30.839
they need to reach me urgently because

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:32.190
I'm like if I get a phone call I look at

00:34:30.839 --> 00:34:35.909
the phone call and I go if that's not

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:38.879
from someone I know then I don't need to

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:43.770
pay attention to it which is a bad habit

00:34:38.879 --> 00:34:46.040
but honest at least for whatever that's

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:46.040
worth

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:56.460
help me so when I get a text message I'm

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:57.990
like dude I get mad sometimes when I

00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:01.800
look at my phone and I have a mess again

00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:02.400
this is like I think it's part of being

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.200
an adult

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:06.359
I don't well it's part of being an

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:09.839
anti-social adult to some extent I don't

00:35:06.359 --> 00:35:12.119
love being contacted in ways that seem

00:35:09.839 --> 00:35:13.589
to demand a response which is very

00:35:12.119 --> 00:35:15.150
selfish of me I'm not going to say that

00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:17.730
I'm in the right there I'm definitely

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:22.319
again I'm recognizing it as a bad habit

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:25.220
but I don't like to be demanded of

00:35:22.319 --> 00:35:27.900
responsive I guess is what I'm saying so

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:31.500
when I get a text message I'm like this

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:33.240
is a rarely is it you know my best

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:39.510
friend being like what's up girlfriend

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:42.270
it's always like a job which is okay you

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:44.339
know sometimes it's a good job like call

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:46.380
your mom she gave birth to you and you

00:35:44.339 --> 00:35:48.420
enjoy your comfort but sometimes it's a

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:50.430
message like hey you know bring home

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:52.859
bread get some brownie points with the

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:54.510
wife plus frictionless sandwiches that

00:35:52.859 --> 00:35:56.280
sounds like a euphemism for intercourse

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:58.260
but I really just mean you know a

00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:01.470
brand-new loaf of bread allows me to

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:04.440
make sandwiches very easily but

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:06.030
sometimes it's like hey we got a new

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:08.069
offer for you you can get anyway LG

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:10.260
smartphone for $0 down and I'm like I am

00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:11.520
going to leave this company because I

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.900
don't appreciate having a push

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:14.760
notification sent to me for an

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:16.470
advertisement and I recognize the irony

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:18.210
if someone who works in the industry to

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:19.859
survive is basically advertising it

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:20.760
anyway let's leave on that troubling

00:36:19.859 --> 00:36:21.119
note I digress

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.960
