##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.659
everybody welcome Eckener in lanta

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.850
combining Madagascar's plus I'm very

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.580
excited today I'm in a good mood we're

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.860
closing in on 10 wins and look at that

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.150
shielded tears not a great rate of fire

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.969
but our other stats are at least a

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:19.410
decent luck is better than zero and a

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:24.539
speed temp Ruka hold me three HP at

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.699
least VW n c9 sqw Sheila tears with a

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.220
bad rate of fire it's one of those

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.480
things where shielded tears is like

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:36.540
pretty sweet but having a bad rate of

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.820
fire but it's like you know it's been a

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.610
while since I was in like senior year

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.120
math class what is it called when a

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.280
function is like flat and then it has a

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.190
fairly sudden slope and then it gets

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.440
flat again not assam total but it's like

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.770
it's a cube function or something like

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.730
that anyway the point is there's like a

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.829
point there's there's a value of x where

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.239
x is our rate of fire we're shielded

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.510
tears are more trouble than they're

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.189
actually worth i'm not sure if 13 is bad

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.890
enough to warrant that and the truth is

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.170
you know things are oftentimes a little

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.400
bit more complicated than they seem some

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.530
enemies it's going to be better to have

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.240
them against than others like being able

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.680
to block shots from Boney's is really

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.240
useful being able to block shots from

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:28.710
you know these guys is worth almost

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:30.540
nothing that when a nelson house anyway

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.509
now they got all that nerd stuff out of

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.939
the way let's move along here we've been

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.159
playing well good momentum there is a

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:44.280
tinted rock available if we can find a

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:46.799
bomb I think the boomerang like this is

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.619
going to be like the nitpicky thing I've

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.549
ever said about Isaac they should

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.840
rebalance the boomerang so that wait a

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.829
minute was there consumable I could get

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.329
with the boomerang there's like one

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.469
penny back there right I didn't even

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.530
think about that

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.750
this should rebalance the boomerang so

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.640
that it doesn't cause you to stop

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.619
shooting for so long when you use it

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.780
okay well fine we'll shoot this like

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.940
it's just annoying that using the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.170
boomerang necessarily incurs a little

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.230
bit

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.099
damage downgrade you know what I mean I

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.550
don't know if we really want to shoot

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.870
all these but you'll see buying a spear

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.810
dart in the first floor tends to be

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.810
fairly useful like it sucks that the

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.450
cost for using the boomerang effectively

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.069
comes down to it causes you to not be

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.650
able to shoot for like half the duration

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.900
the enemy's frozen it's not bad like

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.580
there's still good purposes for it for

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.810
crowd control and all that you might say

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.340
well if you could do that and you can

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.290
spam it endlessly then what's the cost

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.959
to it well the cost to it is that it's

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.170
taken up your space bar slot the same

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:55.760
cost that is like oh this is bad

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.650
yeah the same cost of like every space

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.840
bar in this guy just endlessly summons

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:04.180
spiders we really might as well just

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.180
ghost him as quickly as we possibly can

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:15.290
because if you summon spiders there's no

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.640
real reason for us to kill them because

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.190
he'll just summon them again and we'll

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.959
spend like you know half of our time or

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.430
you know probably like 80% of our time

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.500
on this boss fight just trying to deal

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.019
with you know things that can be

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.910
resented basically endlessly which is

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.049
why I'm actually pretty stoked to be of

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.470
the boomerang we can interrupt his

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.609
attacks a little bit come on come on

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.620
come on come on just kill him before he

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.480
spas it freaking spider again there we

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.739
go we're gonna be fine HP got a little

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.480
dicey but it's not unexpected given the

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.870
champion Ragman fight this is probably

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.790
the hardest first floor boss fight some

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.200
of them can get pretty bad I'm going to

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.450
go back and explore to try to make sure

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.630
that we can get a spirit hour for the

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.269
next floor but like there's fistula on a

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.790
tiny room can also be really really

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.069
annoying especially because I think it's

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.989
like less of a risk than the Ragman

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.180
fight but because fistula does more

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:12.430
damage if you've got less HP it might be

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.430
a little bit worse overall

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.220
there's like actually so many ways for

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.400
us to get a spirit hog for the easiest

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:26.979
one is for you to just drop a bomb you

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:28.300
can also drop a nickel then that gives

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.820
us a pretty good shot of getting one

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.240
from the shop whether it's via you know

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:39.310
spirit heart or bomb into tinted rock

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:41.590
into spear and heart just getting a

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.889
little like okay you know what goodbye

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.860
boss rush wasn't interested in dealing

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.630
with you anyway every single one of our

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:54.070
boomerang charges is just hitting a

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.660
spider instead except for that one which

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:00.310
hit nothing at all be careful what you

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.840
wish for no matter how good you are at

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.919
Isaac you know in the end there is a

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.720
little bit of a of a stat determination

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.419
you know are your stats good enough to

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:14.470
make it and right now like we could not

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:16.830
win the run conceivably on the back of

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.870
our current stats we're not necessarily

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.979
super far away but you know five minutes

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.180
to get through the first floor is a

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.919
pretty good indication that we're in a

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:28.270
tough spot we're also not going to be

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:32.349
leaving here with a with the spirit

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:35.050
heart and let's get pretty lucky so

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:36.270
start this one of these two paying that

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.830
would be really nice

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.909
both of these are all four of these pay

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.759
now would be really nice

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:46.050
I got shielded tears don't step to me

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:46.050
orange fire you got no chance

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.580
well I resent doing this level of due

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:53.139
diligence and falling short it is still

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.449
the right decision and the results do

00:05:53.139 --> 00:06:00.310
not necessarily change that so we're

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:01.990
going to head down here enter through

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.449
the hole in the floor and see what we

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:08.440
can get she looked at man the big brown

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:12.120
eyes said we'll see what we can get up

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.349
above a baby we'll see what we can get I

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.620
want to rhyme it would settle in there

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:20.440
somewhere because I think that's you

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.300
know fitting for the lyrics of the song

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.580
but I can't fuse something you're never

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.310
gonna set to see it doesn't it's got a

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.700
finish on the

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:31.590
syllable in order to make the song work

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.570
right now this run is a freakin snooze

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.990
man you know I've come into the video

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:39.120
all excited oh we're going to possibly

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.670
get to a ten win streak soon let's all

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:46.380
go for a walk outside yeah and then the

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:48.600
game just goes Matt how about catch me

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.730
outside how about that but also at this

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:54.090
point you should know I only reference

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:56.670
that meme to make you angry

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.920
so congratulations have you cringed at

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:00.060
that you just got trolled son I spend

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:05.370
all day on the Internet you think I'm

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:13.500
not hip with the hottest means you can

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:16.130
just call me Rick rollin Stein and this

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.130
is my pawn shop

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:22.410
not nine lives I thought that was a live

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:23.850
bomb because it had to fuse but it was

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.560
actually just a particle effect in the

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.910
background

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.460
okay enough money to buy a spear at

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:31.020
heart and our first bomb it's a good

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:34.980
place to be

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:36.890
I'm gonna blow this up I'm going to take

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:40.800
matchstick we need more bombs

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:42.540
if we find attempted rock I'd be bummed

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.250
before we get a bomb at least because

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:46.110
that's probably a better use of our bomb

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:48.900
but I was banking on the fact that there

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:52.200
wouldn't necessarily be one in our

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.490
vicinity dogtooth good item this is

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.600
where you like having the boomerang in

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:58.520
particular because you can do crowd

00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:01.470
control and then take these guys out

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.780
this is secret room access plus like an

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:08.460
okay damage upgrade probably shouldn't

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:10.140
have taken that yet you lived a secret

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:12.810
room is adjacent here so we'll try this

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:15.660
place still no tinted rocks so I don't

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:17.790
feel like I'm wasting my spirit hearts

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:22.850
yet they're wasting me no potential

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:22.850
spirit hearts yet this stinks

00:08:24.799 --> 00:08:31.199
so I'm just trying to use the boomerang

00:08:29.069 --> 00:08:32.819
I'm hoping they get burned they are not

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:34.349
getting burned trying to use the

00:08:32.819 --> 00:08:39.509
boomerang productively like if we can

00:08:34.349 --> 00:08:41.039
keep one enemy frozen it's gonna cause

00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:43.589
problems for them because they're gonna

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:45.600
walk into it they're not gonna be able

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:46.980
to rush me down as easily and we could

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.709
have waited for mom's key but I think in

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:51.509
this case we really really need a deal

00:08:49.709 --> 00:08:53.100
with the devil if we you know messed it

00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:54.959
up and didn't get a deal with the devil

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:58.439
that could potentially compromise like

00:08:54.959 --> 00:09:01.800
the whole run because I mean are you

00:08:58.439 --> 00:09:03.509
looking at the stats that we have at the

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.149
present moment admittedly it's mostly

00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:08.899
rate of fire that's bad but it's bad

00:09:06.149 --> 00:09:12.420
enough that I'm genuinely genuinely

00:09:08.899 --> 00:09:14.699
genuinely a little concerned we just

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:18.120
want to make sure you're safe here and

00:09:14.699 --> 00:09:20.790
we'll use two bombs crack into this I'll

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:23.370
take basically anything that was

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:25.529
basically everything so that's so good

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.930
let me crank into our second secret room

00:09:25.529 --> 00:09:29.220
make sure we can go up there safely play

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.019
this to get some more money and that

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:33.269
should be mom's key at least a good

00:09:31.019 --> 00:09:35.430
chance of getting mom's key especially

00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:39.980
with two more bombs left over and we

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:44.339
definitely like IV bag more than we like

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:46.550
the boomerang although we're still

00:09:44.339 --> 00:09:50.519
waiting on the stats to really make

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:55.290
anything pop off here so will we have

00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:56.610
enough so we'll grab this and then we'll

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.620
go into our item room grab the red heart

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:01.949
it's taken us like a hundred years to

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:04.050
get to this point at least leaves like

00:10:01.949 --> 00:10:06.059
semi-functional now like this run it

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:07.769
seems like it could pop off I didn't

00:10:06.059 --> 00:10:09.059
even mention really there we got a speed

00:10:07.769 --> 00:10:12.199
upgrade on the last floor and that was

00:10:09.059 --> 00:10:15.149
super useful but alright so this was

00:10:12.199 --> 00:10:16.800
this was good as well we got back up to

00:10:15.149 --> 00:10:19.199
seven cents we could buy a three cent

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.459
read hard play IV bag twice I don't know

00:10:19.199 --> 00:10:23.779
what we'd be hoping to mill out of it

00:10:20.459 --> 00:10:25.829
but it could possibly be half decent I

00:10:23.779 --> 00:10:27.240
was like where did all these blues come

00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:31.550
from I forgot we took a relax pill in

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:31.550
there so extremely strange

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:37.670
assortment of poops you ever wonder that

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:40.700
about like archaeology you know most

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:43.000
from my understanding of history most of

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:47.050
what we know about ancient Greece is

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:50.600
from finding like clay fragments of pots

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:52.910
buried you know deep within the the

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.949
Greek landscape Grecian landscape I have

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:56.300
not it doesn't matter

00:10:53.949 --> 00:10:59.139
you ever wonder if there I go I wonder

00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:02.329
if it's got a it's got a portrait or

00:10:59.139 --> 00:11:04.100
it's got a frisk of grapes on it I

00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:05.540
wonder if this was a wine cask and we

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.820
could just go back in time and talk to

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.320
like someone who is actually from

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:12.260
ancient Greece they'd be like that's

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:15.139
actually my chamber pot maybe maybe

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:17.810
Nagano maybe I'm very much ignorant of

00:11:15.139 --> 00:11:19.490
the science that's behind that we ever

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:23.750
think that you'd be like you know if you

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:25.089
ever found like bathroom tile 500,000

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:28.750
years down the line

00:11:25.089 --> 00:11:32.870
aliens might be like oh there's like

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:34.519
sweet there's a bunch of fruit on this

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:36.440
tile it must have been from their

00:11:34.519 --> 00:11:38.870
kitchen nah sorry son for some reason

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.579
our wall tile in our bathroom has

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:42.290
pictures of pears on it look I don't

00:11:40.579 --> 00:11:45.680
know what's up with that it's just it is

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:47.750
what it is no a big cat did not live

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.339
here it just says hang in there and then

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:52.880
it's got a picture of a cat on a line

00:11:49.339 --> 00:11:54.140
because you know it's an encouraging

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:59.000
message that helps me get through the

00:11:54.140 --> 00:12:04.490
days so in case it's not abundantly

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:11.420
clear um this run is pretty poor right

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:13.279
now our damage is fine we really just

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.779
need piercing shots or a much better

00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:18.800
rate of fire and it'll start to feel

00:12:14.779 --> 00:12:24.260
like whole again there's no chance of

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:26.269
boss rush all right secret room there's

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:28.370
no chance of boss rush and that's

00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:29.810
completely okay and we should get better

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:33.579
oh that was so stupid

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:33.579
we should get better because we have

00:12:37.079 --> 00:12:42.279
and I don't know they're both semi

00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:44.019
useful it should get better because we

00:12:42.279 --> 00:12:45.339
have goat head but we got to live long

00:12:44.019 --> 00:12:47.889
enough for asking for it to get better

00:12:45.339 --> 00:12:53.199
which could take some time here Tammy's

00:12:47.889 --> 00:12:55.029
head okay it's one of my favorite items

00:12:53.199 --> 00:12:56.589
in the game and we haven't had it in a

00:12:55.029 --> 00:12:56.919
while so yeah I'm going to take Tammy's

00:12:56.589 --> 00:12:59.139
head

00:12:56.919 --> 00:13:00.369
the thing is it's still not that good

00:12:59.139 --> 00:13:02.619
because our base stats are not that

00:13:00.369 --> 00:13:05.499
impressive but we need anything that can

00:13:02.619 --> 00:13:07.689
give us offense so IV bag I will not

00:13:05.499 --> 00:13:09.399
accept the argument is valid that we

00:13:07.689 --> 00:13:11.679
take Tammy's head too often because the

00:13:09.399 --> 00:13:13.959
it's competition is IV bag which we also

00:13:11.679 --> 00:13:15.669
take all the time so I think we're in

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:18.759
the clear you know with respect to that

00:13:15.669 --> 00:13:20.829
but we need to again like in particular

00:13:18.759 --> 00:13:22.839
piercing shots shots that can hit an

00:13:20.829 --> 00:13:25.209
enemy shot destroy the enemy shot and

00:13:22.839 --> 00:13:33.489
then keep doing damage to the enemy are

00:13:25.209 --> 00:13:35.980
pretty valuable for us so there's plenty

00:13:33.489 --> 00:13:39.610
of items by the way that fit the bill we

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:41.019
barely got out of there and we didn't

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:43.749
get out of there there's plenty of items

00:13:41.019 --> 00:13:45.100
that fit the bill here from a deal with

00:13:43.749 --> 00:13:49.239
the devil specifically like for example

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:52.119
Belial tears I have a wild those would

00:13:49.239 --> 00:13:53.079
presumably not get destroyed when they

00:13:52.119 --> 00:13:54.699
hit an enemies here because they're

00:13:53.079 --> 00:13:56.110
piercing shops for some reason I always

00:13:54.699 --> 00:13:57.189
have to ask myself whether or not

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:58.869
they're piercing because they're like

00:13:57.189 --> 00:14:00.639
piercing with a conditional but they

00:13:58.869 --> 00:14:03.429
always pierce they just get better after

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:06.639
they pierce I'm you but stronger oh we

00:14:03.429 --> 00:14:09.970
got a mill this is an excel floor we got

00:14:06.639 --> 00:14:12.549
a mill rotten baby's good enough and

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:15.610
more importantly it doesn't require the

00:14:12.549 --> 00:14:18.220
use of tears to function which means

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:19.749
that it's actually like a static damage

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.639
dealer which is an enormous help for me

00:14:19.749 --> 00:14:23.139
right now we are taking some serious

00:14:21.639 --> 00:14:24.759
damage on this floor though and we

00:14:23.139 --> 00:14:26.709
actually okay like seriously

00:14:24.759 --> 00:14:29.860
we shouldn't be stoked about it being an

00:14:26.709 --> 00:14:32.639
XL floor Thank You gimpy for basically

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:36.609
enabling my idiocy here and poor play

00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:39.480
but it's basically taking a deal with

00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:39.480
the devil out of the economy

00:14:39.699 --> 00:14:52.579
which is fairly extremely bad for us at

00:14:51.259 --> 00:14:55.749
least you got both of them that's the

00:14:52.579 --> 00:14:59.089
big thing there these should be dusted

00:14:55.749 --> 00:15:06.339
equally dusted got enough money for

00:14:59.089 --> 00:15:10.519
certain to make our shop worthwhile help

00:15:06.339 --> 00:15:12.230
not very smart on my part okay I've lost

00:15:10.519 --> 00:15:14.480
focus I started thinking about

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:18.170
archaeology and it just she's got me so

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:20.149
hot and bothered that I got to sit down

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:26.779
and you know get my blood pressure back

00:15:20.149 --> 00:15:29.059
to normal I sort of did want to be a

00:15:26.779 --> 00:15:31.279
historian when I was younger but I also

00:15:29.059 --> 00:15:34.639
I was ignorant of what it actually means

00:15:31.279 --> 00:15:37.420
to be a historian I feel like there

00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:41.740
should be a class in like ninth grade

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:43.490
that just teaches you what jobs do

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:45.559
because I don't know about you guys but

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:48.529
I thought like what is a mathematician

00:15:45.559 --> 00:15:50.240
do I still sort of don't understand in

00:15:48.529 --> 00:15:52.459
this day and age what a mathematician

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:55.040
does and this is the exact opposite of

00:15:52.459 --> 00:15:56.779
me belittling the profession I actually

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:59.179
don't know what you do with a math

00:15:56.779 --> 00:16:01.429
degree except I don't know I guess you

00:15:59.179 --> 00:16:05.569
could be a math teacher for certain or

00:16:01.429 --> 00:16:06.920
you can work in like cryptography or

00:16:05.569 --> 00:16:09.019
something like that I don't know what

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:13.160
else you do what does a mathematician do

00:16:09.019 --> 00:16:15.499
I assume with my relative you know some

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.870
knowledge of academia you do math

00:16:15.499 --> 00:16:22.639
research what the heck is math research

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:24.920
like I'm so ignorant of what you do at a

00:16:22.639 --> 00:16:26.720
high level math that math reason the

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.499
concept of math research makes no sense

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.779
to me like you're trying to find

00:16:27.499 --> 00:16:32.540
relationships between things we haven't

00:16:29.779 --> 00:16:34.399
discovered all those you got to be an

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:36.559
actual like a genius on an unfathomable

00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:39.619
level but anyway similarly I was like

00:16:36.559 --> 00:16:40.939
what is a historian do they know a lot

00:16:39.619 --> 00:16:43.759
about history but you don't just get

00:16:40.939 --> 00:16:45.769
paid to know a lot about history I guess

00:16:43.759 --> 00:16:48.019
if you don't become a professor the jobs

00:16:45.769 --> 00:16:49.639
might be like a little or an author may

00:16:48.019 --> 00:16:51.850
be the jobs might be a little few and

00:16:49.639 --> 00:16:51.850
far between

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:59.839
but I just genuinely don't know like

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:02.029
when it comes to través you can be

00:16:59.839 --> 00:17:04.309
relatively aware of what's going on

00:17:02.029 --> 00:17:07.250
right like what is a plumber do you know

00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:09.470
they fix plumbing they assemble plumbing

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:11.959
etc etc I might not know the finer

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:13.490
points but I know a little bit enough to

00:17:11.959 --> 00:17:15.890
know you want to illegally searched my

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:17.600
you know we're going to we're going to

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:23.470
go hard on this one I want 35 cents

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:26.420
total and I think we're going to get it

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:28.100
what does an electrician do it work with

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:29.450
electricity that's good enough IME neg

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:31.429
what is a story to do they work with

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:32.780
history because you probably want to get

00:17:31.429 --> 00:17:33.590
a little more specific than that but you

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.809
get the idea

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:37.580
the idea is that I don't know I don't

00:17:35.809 --> 00:17:39.559
know what happened there but we got lump

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.030
of coal and it made me want to be sad

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:43.700
about it because of the sound that it

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:45.880
made but it was actually sweet so I'm

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:47.840
not sure where they're getting that

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.760
anyway a lump of coal is helpful if we

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:56.750
can ever get our tears not to explode

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:59.210
immediately like I basically took

00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:00.950
biology and university because I liked

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:02.660
biology in high school and I don't feel

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:04.720
that I was like lied to or anything like

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:09.590
that but it is a little bit of like an

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:10.940
ignorant concept basically you're like

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:12.080
hey we've taught you things in a

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.880
classroom what do you like learning

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.080
about the most all right that's what

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:18.170
you're going to do in college it's a

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:20.090
it's kind of a flawed system while both

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:23.170
of these are not great we'll take PJs

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:26.690
got a little bit more survivability on a

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:29.809
deal with the devil okay well yes quite

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:35.450
literally wouldn't mind an orbital here

00:18:29.809 --> 00:18:36.860
to be honest with you need of course it

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:38.420
teaches you like what jobs do we had a

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:41.240
careers class but we had kind of a weird

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:43.100
situation like it's a mandatory half

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:46.340
credit course so it's like a six or

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:47.900
twelve week thing in high school will

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:52.550
take years up for certain that's

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:54.740
extremely warranted and they introduced

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:56.870
it like relatively recently like within

00:18:54.740 --> 00:19:00.260
the past 20 years at the time it was

00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:01.880
relatively recent at least a second lump

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:04.130
of coal all right we left the key behind

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.970
that's right we also know I think we're

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:07.010
good to go

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:08.120
so that was supposed to be like this

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:10.730
guy's going to be like your career

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:12.650
counselor for like six weeks or 12 weeks

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:15.440
and then you know you'll learn about

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:17.090
what professions do and it's kind of a

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.730
joke course like everybody is going to

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:21.910
get like at least eighty in this course

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:23.780
probably but it gives you kind of a

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:24.740
foundation for figuring out what you're

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.150
going to do for the rest of your life

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:31.010
which is important when you're getting

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:32.570
to be that age you know and everyone

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:34.490
goes on that court that classes a joke

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:36.020
which is true from like a grade

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:38.150
standpoint but at the same time it's

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:39.740
also like one of the most universally

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:41.360
practical classes I took in high school

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:43.550
except for the fact that our teacher was

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:45.500
like 80 years old and this isn't to

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:49.070
insult him but he was like having health

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:51.470
problems so he literally like maybe a

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:53.810
month into the class got a detached

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:55.790
retina which is apparently a fairly

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:57.200
serious thing it sounds like I'll just

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:59.810
you know put it back on there but now he

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:01.760
was like out of commission for the rest

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:04.160
of the semester so we had the same

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.960
substitute teacher every day for almost

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:10.310
the rest of the semester so we just

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:14.390
watched like a lot of videos like a lot

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:16.250
of videos on an extreme amount of video

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:17.720
so in the end I would say we probably

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:18.950
didn't get quite as much out of that

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:23.750
course as I would have liked

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:24.230
it's another excel floor yo not cool

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:25.670
buddy

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:27.590
I want my deals with a devil this is one

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:29.120
of the few situations in which like I'm

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:33.760
weak enough that I won't even entertain

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:33.760
the thought of going to boss rush land

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:40.640
okay just you gotta roast them you gotta

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.900
roast him he's been roasted now get on

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:48.800
the other side of the map and roast them

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:52.900
again we do want the orbital did this

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:56.330
run is weird it is

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:57.800
well let's not insult it yet first off

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:59.510
it's got feelings just like the rest of

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.310
us secondly gimpy is keeping us alive

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:03.170
thirdly we haven't been playing that

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:04.880
well so it's kind of rich to be like oh

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:06.800
the runs screwing us but third there's

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:10.160
eight flee wherever we are in our

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:11.990
metaphor here we have to item rooms left

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.880
on this floor and maybe some more you

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:16.610
know random stuff that could be useful

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:18.160
as well but with with two item rooms

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.750
left on this floor there

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.070
a conceivable chance we could get

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:25.870
something that completely changes the

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:28.300
tone of the run for example literally

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:30.520
any form of piercing shot and to be fair

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:41.080
the orbital pickup is really really good

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:42.850
as well as long as we don't give up too

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:46.390
much damage in situations where it's not

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:51.520
warranted feel pretty good about this I

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:59.560
think it would be nice to get damage a

00:21:51.520 --> 00:22:04.210
little bit above 0.76 so we can help so

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:06.430
we can more reliably get a gimpy payout

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:07.780
or just get dark bump so that the red

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:09.940
hearts would get out of gimpy actually

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:12.910
like stand a chance to pay dividends I'm

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:15.610
not complaining you know again mere

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:16.870
seconds ago I said that give these one

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:20.620
of the things keeping us in the game

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:23.320
right now this guy is going to feel

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:25.300
jaunty diagonal move to them peepers aye

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:28.530
it's pretty bad

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:32.320
and might as well say that on the Box

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:33.340
peepers aye it's pretty bad now if you

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.050
look at this run and you look at the

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:36.760
time that it is 21 minutes you're like

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:38.230
you're not going that slowly you almost

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:43.240
had a chance to make it the boss rush

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:49.530
but you also do have to remember that

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:49.530
there was a excuse me that there was a

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:57.970
double XL setup here so we have two XL

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:59.260
floors in a row normally those provide

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:02.200
us there's a secret room here by the way

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:05.890
normally those provide us with a pretty

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:10.050
huge speed boost and a pace boost at

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:12.610
least a real ability to actually like

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:14.170
speed up the run the fact that we're

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:19.750
still buying schedule despite having two

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:21.040
of those is a pretty subpar sign the

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:23.850
sign that things are in a little bit of

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.850
a dangerous place

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:28.990
but we have improved a little bit on

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:33.570
this floor mostly due to the orbital

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:36.040
dude virgos again not horrible but

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:38.500
certainly not what I've been very

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:41.020
specifically asking for here's my

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:42.370
impression of NL I wanted a piercing

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:46.660
shot hmm

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:49.630
but I plain enough Isaac I feel like I

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:51.400
can be a little snobby about it I said

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:53.980
right even knowing that nobody's gonna

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:59.230
agree with me on that which is fair but

00:23:53.980 --> 00:24:01.150
like you know no secret room okay so the

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:04.300
secret room must be up in our other room

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:10.020
then like this one yeah it must be right

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:12.670
here oh that's pretty solid

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:14.980
but yeah basically what I'm getting at

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:20.950
is like we know what we like in this

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:22.510
game we don't have it yet but the

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:24.460
options are still there now we've

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:26.590
already paid our dues we've gotten the

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:28.060
goat head we paid for it we got deal

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:29.770
with the devil president we fought

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:31.690
Krampus so our future deals with the

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:39.280
devil should have a higher chance to

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:42.390
possibly be half decent for us or at

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:44.770
least we know they're not going to be

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:46.270
the Krampus fight for a second time

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:49.540
although we do have to lump of coals

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:52.630
which I think does nothing but is at

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:56.299
least a curiosity this should be the end

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:58.549
of this fight ooh very close

00:24:56.299 --> 00:25:01.369
we want permanent polar invincibility

00:24:58.549 --> 00:25:02.749
and then okay this is now where we start

00:25:01.369 --> 00:25:06.080
to pop off a little bit here missing

00:25:02.749 --> 00:25:07.519
page two is fine and then Avedon is the

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:10.070
reason that missing page two is fine

00:25:07.519 --> 00:25:11.389
because it allows us to be on spirit

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:14.619
hearts anyway so we effectively paid

00:25:11.389 --> 00:25:16.940
zero for it it cursed the unknown

00:25:14.619 --> 00:25:21.379
actually no interest whatsoever in the

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:25.269
hush fight but not going to turn down an

00:25:21.379 --> 00:25:25.269
opportunity to get a few extra keys here

00:25:25.959 --> 00:25:32.509
it's also I mean that was very dumb but

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:34.759
um it's also is like a huge increase in

00:25:32.509 --> 00:25:37.879
our HP like we went down to the last

00:25:34.759 --> 00:25:40.999
floor with maybe like four hearts from

00:25:37.879 --> 00:25:42.349
an absolute standpoint and now I mean we

00:25:40.999 --> 00:25:46.029
have eleven because I just threw one

00:25:42.349 --> 00:25:46.029
away like a ding dong but

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:06.540
the big thing here is just don't let it

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:09.150
slip away I have the ambition maybe look

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:13.590
in my eyes this week I'm mopping floors

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:15.120
next week it's the fries so I'm happy

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:18.630
with the run as it is right now but I

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:20.400
want more so I'm always going to be like

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:22.590
trying to use the orbital to amp up our

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:24.390
damage and it's probably a suboptimal

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:27.570
decision but it's a decision that I've

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:29.340
made time and time again we need to

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:31.260
quell that ambition of some extent

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:33.480
ambition is great except when it is and

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:36.450
then I think we might be in the when it

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:40.170
is in territory right now you know this

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:42.570
run could conceivably be piloted pretty

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:45.090
quickly to pretty easily to a win if we

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:47.220
just tighten up our place but if we

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:50.930
start using our orbital to deal damage

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:50.930
to literally everything we're going to

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:56.880
incur a greater element of risk than is

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:58.500
necessary I would argue okay rotten baby

00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:04.440
just hit him up oh ho that was close

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:06.240
okay a second that was pretty dumb but

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:10.260
at the same time will also enable us to

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:12.300
easily finish the boss fight and Virgo

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.710
gave us extra invincibility I guess we'd

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.060
rather have super bandage so we have

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:18.240
something to give away here and that

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:19.530
obviously did not work oh but no we

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:22.200
would have had one HP anyway but still

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:24.960
nine lives make sure we're grabbing

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.160
these bombs nothing else we'd expect to

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.900
get value out of here so we're just

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:29.940
going to bounce him now we're like to

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:31.650
guppy items on the next floor wouldn't

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:38.730
be wouldn't kick it out of bed for

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:40.740
eating crackers right I will say there's

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:42.480
one thing I know with certainty in Issac

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.920
I don't know much except a lot about

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.510
living in a little about love according

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:48.660
to Alan Jackson that's right that songs

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:50.280
about me you didn't know that not true I

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:51.810
was probably like negative for when a

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:54.260
lot about living and a little bout love

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:54.260
came out

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.510
the one thing I know is that if your

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:07.059
ninth win is hard your 10th wins got to

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:10.210
be easy it's written in the tones as far

00:28:07.059 --> 00:28:11.679
as I'm concerned flat penny at this

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:13.120
point of the game might as well be the

00:28:11.679 --> 00:28:15.760
exact same drink at his master of

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:17.230
unlocking so if we need one we're fine

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:18.120
with the other and if we don't need one

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:22.080
we don't need the other one either

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:24.190
there's no real concern for us here I

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:26.800
wonder about that sometimes you know

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:29.170
like when I was when I was like 15 16 I

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:32.050
was really really into the music scene

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:33.730
not necessarily really really into music

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:35.230
but really into the music scene you know

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:36.970
like oh the new Wolf Parade albums

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:38.650
coming out and blah blah pitchfork media

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:40.240
blah blah and I'm not even disparaging

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:42.850
my past self got into a lot of good

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:44.980
stuff as a result of that but I'd always

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:48.190
think like man it would have been what

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:50.230
if you were alive in like you know the

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:52.270
Madchester era when the Stone Roses were

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:56.380
popping off what was that like and then

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:59.830
I realized that like if my kids are like

00:28:56.380 --> 00:29:01.570
that they're going to be like what was

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:04.270
it like growing up in the Golden Age of

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:06.100
like Radiohead once every three or four

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:07.990
albums come in or once every three or

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:11.280
four years coming out with a sweet

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:13.570
classic album and you're like well

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:15.610
mostly I just listened to Snoop Dogg's

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:18.390
nothing but a G thang on YouTube and

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:20.920
other meme music because the legacy

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:26.860
hasn't been established yet right like

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:28.600
now you look back and you go it would be

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.830
amazing and like a time machine and be

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.420
like I'm going to be at that first

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:32.650
Beatles concert or something like that

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:35.580
and I'm going to heckle them and say

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:35.580
you're never going to do anything

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:41.440
they're all gonna laugh at you we're not

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:43.900
going to fight all dude we got piercing

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:46.360
shots is it worth getting other stuff

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:49.600
here oh yes because we have nine lives

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:52.030
I'll take the raw damage let's go and

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:56.440
like let's go though cuz we're not

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:57.730
fighting hush but that's because you

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.380
have the perspective of knowing what's

00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:02.500
going to happen as of right now it's

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:05.539
like you know oh another classic

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:08.270
Radiohead album surprise surprise

00:30:05.539 --> 00:30:10.470
but there will be people like that I

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:11.700
hope it's like that at least because

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:13.980
that would make me feel like we lived in

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:16.470
on an era that's good for our and

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:18.660
everyone's always I hate I mean I've

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:19.950
done this ran like ten times but you

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:21.690
know I've been listening to a lot of men

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:23.190
at work lately a band that I had

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:25.020
previously written off as a one-hit

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:26.730
wonder for Down Under and maybe a

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:28.320
two-hit wonder for who can it be now but

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:30.299
you know listening to the greatest hits

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:33.620
I'm like this band adds some jams

00:30:30.299 --> 00:30:36.660
overkill is like an actual cerebral

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:38.460
well-written song it's touching like

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:41.010
it's relatable there's great stuff going

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:45.179
on and I should know because of Colin

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:46.640
hey but still you know if you ever watch

00:30:45.179 --> 00:30:49.289
a men at work music video on YouTube

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:52.559
which I know firsthand cuz I've been

00:30:49.289 --> 00:30:55.380
doing so on occasion at least in between

00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:56.970
recording Miri and Isaac episodes people

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:59.190
are always like this is when music was

00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:00.720
great in 1983 and then you go back you

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:03.120
watch like a music video that came out

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:06.299
and you know 1981 this is when music was

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:09.090
good you go watch a recording of you

00:31:06.299 --> 00:31:11.429
know Robert Johnson from the 1930s this

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:14.580
is when music was at its peak like I'm

00:31:11.429 --> 00:31:17.240
not even convinced the people on YouTube

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:19.260
even enjoy music it just enjoyed the

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:21.750
concept of listening to something that

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:24.230
they feel is superior I'm obviously

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:26.250
being slightly facetious in this

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:28.770
situation but it's just so annoying

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:31.710
nobody goes like that the top comment is

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:33.570
never like wow what a great song and

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:33.840
wish my network was still around working

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:37.409
today

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:40.230
haha it's always what ever happened to

00:31:37.409 --> 00:31:43.980
the radio now it's just just in Cooper

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:46.049
on the radio and you like one know what

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:49.110
I leave Garret you guys had leave Garret

00:31:46.049 --> 00:31:51.390
to frickin Bay City Rollers you go to a

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:52.740
Bay City Rollers music video people will

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:56.429
be like this is when music was at its

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:57.419
peak I don't think that's true that's

00:31:56.429 --> 00:32:01.770
what it's going to be like if YouTube

00:31:57.419 --> 00:32:03.900
still around in like 30 years guaranteed

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:05.370
there will be some it's going to say

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:06.690
trash but that just makes me what I hate

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:09.270
there's going to be some trash on the

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:11.309
radio that was so good it's just going

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:12.299
to be like a series of bits and bleeps

00:32:11.309 --> 00:32:13.799
and the kids are going to be like you

00:32:12.299 --> 00:32:15.210
don't understand mom and you won't

00:32:13.799 --> 00:32:16.490
understand because that's what it means

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:20.180
to be a part of the you know

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:21.770
contemporary generation however there's

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:24.740
going to be like Justin Bieber's sorry

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:26.510
music video on YouTube and have 9

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:28.100
billion views and all the comments are

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:30.740
going to be like this is when music was

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:34.070
really music and they will not see the

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:35.810
irony and I will be you know long dead

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:37.520
but having uploaded my brain to the

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:42.310
cloud I will laugh at them and say don't

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:45.880
these fools realize take a look at the

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:47.240
comments leaving all the same words oh

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:51.380
man

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:57.470
wonder if they'll ever know they're in

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:59.420
the best selling show David Bowie's life

00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:03.260
on Mars credit given where credit is due

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:05.900
oh man ok so it's not a particularly

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:10.190
slow run take a look at this too slow

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:14.150
man take a look at the slow run beating

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:18.080
up the wrong guy all dan a wonder if

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:25.670
he'll ever know he is the Giza Linga

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:28.910
show but we're still like pretty below

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:31.490
average but we're making it up with our

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:33.650
piercing shots in a big way here it's

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:35.780
actually driving like a lot of the value

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:38.320
whereas our where's our is the second

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.320
secret room buddy

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:44.590
really

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:49.870
really I would have expected back here

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:58.480
somewhere but I mean we can make it work

00:33:49.870 --> 00:34:01.870
oh it's there not my finest work I can't

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:04.300
get a street I think about the train

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:06.460
wreck so you should train wrecks ation

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:09.610
new oh you haven't heard of the train

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:11.350
wreck station we are we are the train

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:13.330
wreck station should probably be the

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:15.820
last Isaac episode for today my brain is

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:20.440
rotting out of my skull video games they

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:22.679
were right what can I say please be dead

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.679
okay

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:30.100
second secret room second secret room

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:32.800
three black cards should be enough to

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:36.880
carry us no left hand we're good to go

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:39.280
we don't need the bomb should be and are

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:40.149
are two different phrases and they're do

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:43.480
different phrases for two different

00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:45.550
reasons however I think all we need is

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:47.110
like a little bit of help from these

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:48.669
chests and we're off to the races

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:51.460
I'm not sure if that's help or hindrance

00:34:48.669 --> 00:34:54.310
but probably take it either way

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:55.960
I'm not in much of a position to be in a

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:59.230
say oh never mind right the boss fight

00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:01.120
so we will not be taking that because we

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:07.480
got the world's greatest telefilms that

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:09.040
just took us directly to the box I mean

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.570
with 0.76 luck

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:14.340
probably not missing out on much from

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:17.380
like an opportunity cost standpoint and

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:19.120
I'm ready to go like pop this devil card

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:21.720
and put this around in the books man

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:24.250
this is the one where we proved you know

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:27.340
we can take a half-decent run and make

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:29.440
it work hopefully next run we just go

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:34.600
out of control you know crap on the

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:36.520
enemies honestly I welcome the

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:43.150
invincibility so

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:45.250
you cannot hurt me the easiest money

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:46.750
ever made I wanted to put myself right

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:48.280
under the chest so that even if the void

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:49.630
portal showed up it wouldn't do anything

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:51.400
