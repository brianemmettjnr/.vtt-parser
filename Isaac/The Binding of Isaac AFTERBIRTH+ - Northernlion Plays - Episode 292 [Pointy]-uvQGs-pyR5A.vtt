00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.660
let's go welcome back northernlion plays

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.059
of binding rise again thrill us we die

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.769
we must have died on the n LSS when we

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.559
did an Isaac run goes I thought we'd won

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.279
our last run but that's all right that

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.800
didn't is bothers me literally 0% w 8

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.330
and the 4 L a.m.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.830
with good damage good rate of fire good

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.990
luck and we're going to need some good

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.340
luck as our speed is a little low so is

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.550
our shot speed for that matter but

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.890
that's largely irrelevant most of the

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.860
time so we're hoping for maybe like an

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.730
early de gAHS rune it's an early a was

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.530
rune which is not really as useful but

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.030
we could use it to maybe get a

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.270
half-price curse room or something like

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.829
that

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.340
we've been playing better the dailies

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.960
have been strong lately and I feel like

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.820
I'm I mean how many times have I said it

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.420
but I'm out of the slump as far as I'm

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.100
concerned

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.469
monstro as long is a great item

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.629
especially with a good rate of fire

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.160
which we have right now okay don't let I

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.369
could get that close that's way too

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.049
risky but especially with a good rate of

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.549
fire we got very little to concern

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.840
ourselves with right now and apparently

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.390
like every fire is giving us a drop so

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.590
it's pretty lucky usually you'll come in

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.270
here and buy a spear at art and maybe

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.189
buy the other thing they got as well

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.119
rules card a dark market lives under

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.070
your feets irrelevant you know I've

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.860
actually been to a black market once in

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.170
my life and I say that as if I'm aware

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.540
that a black market is not necessarily a

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.689
place that exists always instead you

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.390
know it's a loose construct of shady

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.049
dealings and illicit goods but when I

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.369
lived in South Korea there is a market

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.079
and I'm if you know it's not a black

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.119
market like you can buy drugs there I'm

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.970
pretty sure it's a black market like we

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.399
don't pay import taxes here so I went

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.329
there and it was like you know you could

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.430
buy North American products that aren't

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.619
for sale in South Korea that they

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.040
brought them in it was really expensive

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.530
like if you wanted like American Cheetos

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.149
it was like $4 for like a little single

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.590
serving bag or something like that like

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.239
this is the worst black market ever

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.099
I thought you were supposed to be able

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.519
to buy like nuclear warheads here all I

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:22.000
got is overpriced Pringles but you will

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:25.180
if you live there long enough you would

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.209
start to consider paying $4 for some

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:33.549
american cheetos i think american

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:40.930
cheetos made with real cheese american

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:43.599
cheetos a frito-lay subsidiary don't you

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.930
forget about flamin had those are the

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:49.569
spiciest cheetos they got sometimes they

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.560
also sell the pause but i haven't seen

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:56.590
them for so long now cheetos okay that's

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.239
we've gone too far but i felt like i had

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.579
enough fuel to carry that for a little

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.099
while and seemed to work because there's

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:05.160
korean cheetos but they're like i'm not

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.620
saying they're worse there is not to my

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.549
sensibilities they're a little sweeter

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.390
regular cheetos that's not what I'm

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:15.910
looking for you know I did I'm ashamed

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.620
to admit one time I paid $7 the

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:22.810
equivalent of $7 when I lived in Korea

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:25.269
for a bag of goldfish crackers from

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.579
Pepperidge Farms and I ate the whole

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.700
thing in like 45 minutes it's like this

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:33.609
was so highly not worth it I have to eat

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.329
my shame as soon as possible but it was

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:39.280
a taste you know from from back home so

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.910
it was important morale wise at the time

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.579
I suppose

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.459
never again though that's I mean you can

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.500
get those like you know 2 for $3 at the

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.260
grocery store I'm talking $3 canadian

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.819
which in this day and age you know you

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:58.470
can't can't get anything for $3 canadian

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:02.169
except two cartons of goldfish crackers

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.599
either way this run is like you know you

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:07.470
always got a temper expectations a

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:10.750
little bit it's not a guaranteed win but

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:14.639
it's very very good we probably will not

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.289
need yeah okay so like it's very all but

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:18.579
no it works okay that's what I was I was

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.380
a little worried that maybe I'd ruined

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.300
the monstros lung synergy by taking moms

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.530
knife but I'm not sure we've made it

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.240
better like a lot of people will

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.789
probably be like monster as long as more

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.990
but monstros lung mom's knife is rare

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:31.349
enough that I want to see where this

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.020
energy goes like the next obvious

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:38.949
ridiculous pickup is brimstone if we can

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.360
get mom's knife just use a Waze right

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:41.860
now because like the strange card could

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.130
provide us with a decent amount of value

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:48.009
if you can get mom's knife brimstone

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.750
monstros long I'm very interested to see

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.729
how that world works out for us but now

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.330
I mean you could probably call it as CNN

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:56.909
projects this run will go in favor of

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.889
northern Lyon

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:06.750
it will be a streak of one get excited

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:09.580
America come down here okay stay away

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.430
get a secret room don't stay away come

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.930
sail away come sail away with me battery

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.699
charge gives us the Emperor's card

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:20.289
irrelevant this could be a quick one as

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:22.330
well and the irony I guess that you know

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.449
Cheetos story is that once I was back in

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.509
Canada you know if you wanted to get

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:30.490
legitimate South Korean instant ramen

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:32.320
you could do so absurdly cheap in South

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.539
Korea's like 20 sometimes you know wake

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.520
up on a Saturday morning got no food in

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:39.009
the apartment go down to the convenience

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:42.940
store buy like a 40 cent package of

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:45.610
ramen use their hot water to cook it and

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.550
then go to town right it was a decent

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.919
way to spend your morning mmm was I

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:56.530
hungover possibly happens on occasion

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:58.810
not proud of it nothing in there I head

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:02.229
down to the next floor in my younger

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:05.229
days at least in my younger days I used

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:07.960
to something something when I went to

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:10.330
school I carried lunch in a bag with an

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.509
apple for my teacher cuz I'd always get

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:19.240
a kiss always got mad when the class was

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:22.169
dismissed at some far sides 1993 magnum

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.169
opus passing me by

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:31.760
also known to the younger generation as

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:33.830
the beat that plays just before juicy by

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.040
Biggie Smalls mixed with Elton John's

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.970
tiny dancer appears on girl talks 2006

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.400
magnum opus

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.750
Night Moves or whatever the first album

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.590
was called I can't remember and it

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:47.150
doesn't matter and then when I came back

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:50.360
to Canada I would pay like you know I'd

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:53.840
go to the import grocery store downtown

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:57.070
and be like yes 2:54 the same ramen that

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:59.360
Eden Isis it's not worth it

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:03.110
Ashton Kutcher has punked me in a big

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.400
way here well it was a bit of a sloppy

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.820
play to not pick up the spirit hearts

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.380
before we came in here but again we

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:12.140
actually cannot be stopped this run is

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.900
so overwhelmingly amazing right now

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:17.480
that basically nothing could possibly

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:21.140
stand in our way except for my own

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:24.410
hubris admittedly but fairly unlikely

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:28.280
let's be honest so please we still got

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:30.230
our strength card now we have the Whore

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.450
of Babylon as well but I mean when you

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:35.060
have mom's nice pretty much everything

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.950
else is like inconsequential this is

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.240
just going to be it's actually great and

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.350
I'm gonna you know build the

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.790
meta-narrative here because I know

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.230
sometimes people get disappointed you

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:44.990
take Mama's knife they go a free win

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.220
sure but we've had a couple of runs you

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.940
know within the past couple of weeks

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:51.620
that have thrown and thrown free wins

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:54.380
into questions you know made me excited

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:56.840
to get free wins so we haven't always

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:59.300
made that an easy or made an easy time

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:02.540
of things I should say but this is like

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:04.670
I had a busy Friday planned you know we

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.020
had a stream that I was supposed to do

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.270
and then the stream sort of fell through

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:10.160
but will happen at a later date with

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:12.200
more details and then you're supposed to

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:15.080
do round table round table got cancelled

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:17.780
so I'm sitting here oh I made time today

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:22.310
I made so much time day and now all the

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:24.020
things that I had to do with that time

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:25.610
I've fallen by the wayside now you might

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.940
think that it's good opportunity to play

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:31.850
hooky but you know my job is playing

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:34.250
video games to begin with so what I'll

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:35.080
do instead is I got it like a day of

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.900
like 9

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:39.610
Isak episodes lined up for me here and

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.590
it's been a while since I've had the

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:43.180
opportunity to do that you know if I

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.560
knock out nine eyes again well this is

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:46.570
every night but you know somewhere in

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.880
the vicinity a lot of eyes Gibson's but

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:51.310
a lot knock out the Isaac episodes that

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.930
opens up the backlog hoes a little bit

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.940
allows me to spend some time recording

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:57.850
hallo night and get in that series like

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:59.350
back to actually existing so it's like

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:02.140
it's there's a little kink in the pipe

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:03.670
because I've been busy with a variety of

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.320
things as opposed to like singularly

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:08.380
making Isaac content which is normally

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:10.000
my focus but anyway the point is if I'm

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:12.490
going to spend the whole day recording

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.080
Isaac dude a moms knife super powered

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:16.480
run is like my second run of the day

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:20.140
after a daily that also went really well

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:22.120
is the dream come true it's time for the

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:27.280
opposite of a slump it's time for a

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:28.840
streak baby and then fast-forward of

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:33.160
like 13 minutes and 30 seconds later

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:34.930
boom I died in mom's womb killed by this

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.300
thing and I guarantee it's a freaking

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:40.180
vaginal silkworm it's up to us to not

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:43.840
let that become a reality by the way we

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:46.300
did start with poke a go on this run as

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:48.280
the poking bowl craves hit you're part

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.870
of the world yet if you're from Hawaii

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.820
feel free to just call me an idiot

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:53.740
because I believe it is the Hawaiian

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:57.340
food that started there it has like

00:09:53.740 --> 00:10:00.220
taken over Vancouver now like until

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:01.780
recently whatever people would like make

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.980
fun of Vancouver whenever Vancouver eyes

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.210
would make fun of Vancouver they'd be

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:06.820
like you know there's a spot downtown

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:08.710
where there's a Starbucks and then

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:10.210
literally you cross the street and on

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.920
the opposing corner there's another

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.570
Starbucks there's two Starbucks right

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.840
next to each other isn't that peak

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:20.140
Vancouver not now there are well there's

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:23.560
one place downtown

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:26.680
I believe it's in Yaletown

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:29.080
and there is a polka shop you know it's

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.970
a I'll talk about more what about polka

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.520
is or what polka is in a second year and

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:37.930
then right next to it is a shop that

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:40.090
sells polka Rito's which is just the

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:41.710
ingredients of polka in a burrito and it

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:43.770
might be even with sushi rice that speak

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:48.030
Vancouver as far as I'm concerned

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:50.670
polka is basically a raw fish

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:55.470
salad for lack of a better word you know

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:57.330
there's like chunks of raw ahi tuna

00:10:55.470 --> 00:11:00.120
usually sometimes salmon or you know

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:01.500
albacore on occasion and then it's you

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.400
know you mix it with either like mixed

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:07.470
greens or rice and you know some kind of

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:09.360
dressing or sauce and mangoes pineapples

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:15.440
etc you put it in a bowl and eat it I

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:19.320
got to admit delicious people I think

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:21.480
people issue the hipster dum and that's

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:24.360
fine you know I am the dude who

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:26.220
accidentally made my friend pay $21 for

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.050
three cups of coffee once that story

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.910
I've been roasted for and I brought it

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:31.050
up because I deserve to be roasted for

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.820
that story I don't think there's any

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:35.940
doubt about that give me a potato peeler

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:38.850
however there's parts of hipster culture

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:39.990
I embrace and I think it's important to

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:42.660
embrace them because otherwise I'd be

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:45.720
self-loathing good coffee cold brew

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:47.910
that's one of them and I'll admit more

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:52.410
than once I've had somebody deliver me a

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:54.030
raw fish salad on a bicycle I'm okay

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:55.770
with that if you haven't tried it I'd

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:59.760
recommend well I wouldn't recommend it

00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:02.370
it's like you got a you got to build up

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.140
to it if you've never had like sashimi

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:06.930
before you should have sashimi and then

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:08.700
be like okay now I'll go all in on this

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:11.520
whole cake because it's like sometimes

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:12.630
it's a it's a tall order to get somebody

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.550
to be like you should really try this

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:17.550
salad because that's that's sucking up

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:19.320
one lunch or dinner entree potentionally

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:20.700
or potentially you know you saying hey

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:24.450
go to my favorite restaurant order a

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:25.800
Waldorf salad what's up with that I'm

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.089
going to get the you know the blue

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.510
cheese burger and there's nothing wrong

00:12:27.089 --> 00:12:32.400
with that either but anyway be going for

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:34.980
a raw fish concoction make sure you

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:37.050
enjoy raw fish first it might be one of

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:40.400
my favorite archetypes don't let's

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:40.400
Invicta no he's going to lose his mind

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:48.960
they're like I can concoct like the most

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:52.890
anti sand victim food in existence it's

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:55.710
a cucumber roll sliced cucumber wrapped

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:58.050
in sushi rice wrapped in seaweed he

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:58.950
would lose his mind it's alright though

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:00.040
anyway I don't even know what I'm

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:03.640
talking about anymore

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:05.710
of course you know when I'm eating the

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:08.770
pokey am I thinking in my head I'd like

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:11.770
a pepperoni pizza no no I'm not except

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:15.010
for the fact that at a genuine baseline

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:17.410
level if you asked me at any point

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:19.060
during the day any day hey you want a

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:19.750
slice of pepperoni pizza the answers

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:25.240
gonna be yes

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:29.410
you know what check this out right he's

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:31.660
a god I got two free plays of the demon

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:33.430
judgement and the level one Meat Boy and

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:37.180
the potato peeler damage upgrade just by

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:39.670
using the strength card there I will

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:42.580
always say yes to one slice of pepperoni

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:44.800
pizza the only time I will not say yes

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:46.570
to one slice of pepperoni pizza and this

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.160
is actually literally true and I'm

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:51.640
thinking that it's highly relatable as

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:53.350
well is when I've very recently consumed

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:56.020
one too many slices of pizza doesn't

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:58.510
have to be pepperoni like straight up

00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:01.450
it's to 11 p.m. right now if you were

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:02.740
like hey if cake came into the room and

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:04.060
said there's four slices of pepperoni

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:07.450
pizza in the fridge you want something

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:10.870
I'd be like absolutely that's at any

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:14.230
time food I mean like it shouldn't be

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:17.440
but it is I call that the pizza mood the

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:20.380
pizza barometer it's really more of like

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:22.870
a litmus test it's a boolean value

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:25.810
you're either true on pepperoni pizza

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:27.580
you're not if you're vegetarian you know

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:30.070
there's I don't know what food it is for

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:34.330
vegetarians that's like the pepperoni

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:37.750
pizza conundrum I think about it

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:40.570
sometimes cuz like my wife gets food

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:42.760
cravings she's not pregnant everybody

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:46.260
every any time the media has conditioned

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:48.910
you incorrectly if a woman is ever

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:50.200
nauseous or has a food craving the

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.550
internet goes off she's pregnant

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.880
no it's just you watched one too many

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:56.500
sitcoms where you know somebody throws

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.440
up and then you're like oh she must be

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:00.910
sick no way there's a new Seinfeld on

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:03.850
the way they never did that inside cells

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:06.910
that you get the idea I don't understand

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:10.150
the concept of a food craving I can eat

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:12.010
almost anything at almost any time is

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:13.060
that is that a male singer is that a

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:15.589
meat thing

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:17.480
I'm not trying to be like you know Dae

00:15:15.589 --> 00:15:19.370
I'm just you know deserted booty old

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:22.459
smoking food craze but I actually just

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:24.470
cannot put myself in those shoes like

00:15:22.459 --> 00:15:26.110
when when my wife says you know what are

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:31.190
you feeling for dinner tonight I

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:35.180
actually usually have no preference I'm

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:37.730
like skillfully cooked matter of almost

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:39.829
any form sounds like it would really hit

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:41.449
the spot tonight this sounds like I'm

00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:45.949
making a caricature of myself but I'm

00:15:41.449 --> 00:15:47.180
really not you know sometimes she'll try

00:15:45.949 --> 00:15:49.579
to catch me she'll be like oh you want

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:50.329
to get like sushi tonight i'ma yeah that

00:15:49.579 --> 00:15:53.269
sounds great

00:15:50.329 --> 00:15:56.180
we would have pizza though also sounds

00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:57.319
good and then she's like haha gotcha and

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.949
I'm like no you didn't you don't

00:15:57.319 --> 00:16:00.709
understand

00:15:57.949 --> 00:16:03.980
it's the pepperoni pizza barometer can

00:16:00.709 --> 00:16:05.449
eat almost anything at any time do you

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:10.250
have a favorite food yes

00:16:05.449 --> 00:16:13.399
whichever food is in front of me at the

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:15.319
present time is in the lead it's a it's

00:16:13.399 --> 00:16:19.160
a shifting list it's a power rankings

00:16:15.319 --> 00:16:20.899
ESPN Pierre Lebrun style what are you

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.959
talking about NL fair question

00:16:20.899 --> 00:16:26.810
fair question straw man okay waiting in

00:16:23.959 --> 00:16:29.569
the sky he'd like to come and eat us but

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:31.399
he doesn't know what he's gonna order

00:16:29.569 --> 00:16:34.190
cuz he has no food preferences alright

00:16:31.399 --> 00:16:39.500
but like I'll get I'll get cravings I

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:41.660
find cravings are our context-based

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:44.089
like if I have a bag of Sun Chips in the

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:45.560
house I'm like I'm really craving Sun

00:16:44.089 --> 00:16:46.970
Chips I don't have any Sun Chips in the

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:52.370
house right now am I craving them yeah

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:54.860
now really but if I had Sun ships in the

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:57.860
houses boom I got a wow that's weird

00:16:54.860 --> 00:17:03.740
I've got a sneaking craving for these

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:08.809
Sun Chips right now basically I crave

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:09.919
whatever's around round round get around

00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:14.530
I crave around

00:17:09.919 --> 00:17:14.530
run-run crib around a crib Rueben

00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:22.700
that's my that's my treatise on food

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:25.250
consumption I don't understand it what's

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.450
the deal with blank how's the Isaac run

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:28.370
Goins been like ten minutes since we

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:30.260
commented on it honestly it could be

00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:31.580
another like we could go thirty minutes

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:34.910
without commenting on the size of grun

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:36.820
because it's so disgustingly one at the

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:43.070
present moment that there's like no

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:47.600
concerns here the only problem with it

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:50.420
is potentially HP but like to be

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:52.220
legitimate right now we should probably

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:54.620
never get hit for the rest of the game

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:56.300
we have a case to not get hit for the

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:57.650
rest of the game at the very least we

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.450
probably will because it's just

00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:02.600
unrealistic to expect that level of

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:03.950
perfection but we shouldn't get hit

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.150
probably so

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.410
we bought everything that there was to

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:08.600
buy more or less than we're going to

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:09.830
donate some money and so you might as

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.450
well throw down a bomb see if there's a

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:12.800
secret room it gets grounded totally

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:14.900
worked out we got some more money in the

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:19.370
process as well and we're on the Deb's -

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:24.050
so we're like good to go when it comes

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:25.370
to going to boss rush as well Nick

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:28.220
actually posed an interesting question

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:30.860
on Twitter the other day said at what

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:34.250
point is socially acceptable in the day

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:35.780
to order a pizza and there are many many

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:38.720
kind people out there watching this

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:40.460
video before saying if the pizza place

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:44.450
is open it's acceptable to order a pizza

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:47.030
I disagree with you I do think if you

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:51.410
hold a normal schedule like let's say

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:54.410
you you wake up in the morning you know

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:57.770
maybe like 7 8 9 a.m. somewhere in that

00:18:54.410 --> 00:19:01.190
window it's not acceptable to order a

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:02.990
pizza before 11:00 I'm just by not

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:05.210
acceptable I don't mean you can't do it

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:06.890
I just mean like if I did it I would

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:08.780
feel a slight bit of personal shame

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:12.590
sometimes I'm ok with that

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:15.680
sometimes I'm very much for that like I

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:18.560
think it's socially mildly unacceptable

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:20.540
to do that 11 is what I consider to be

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.700
the first acceptable Pizza ordering time

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:25.370
and I have a historical precedent for

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:27.590
that in elementary middle and high

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:29.120
school our lunch time was at 11 a.m.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:32.690
which seems ridiculous to me right

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:34.190
now because it was 11 a.m. Eastern Time

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:37.490
and now I live on the west coast I'm

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:39.650
like we were eating lunch at the

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:41.600
equivalent of our 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:43.160
oh sorry 8 a.m. Pacific time I know

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.700
that's not really meaningful without

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:47.809
time zones work it's like wow in Japan

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.480
they eat breakfast

00:19:47.809 --> 00:19:52.700
well we're asleep what a country you

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.200
know but no I just like it puts it in

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:56.120
perspective for me sometimes you know if

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.850
I'm ever awake at 8:00 a.m. I'm like why

00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:01.250
am I so tired this was lunchtime when I

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:02.990
was in high school by the way I know

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:06.650
just by bringing that out people gonna

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:09.070
be like that's stupid lunch times 12:30

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:11.330
you know everybody has their own

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:12.950
historical basis for when their lunch

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:15.190
time was I'm not trying to step on your

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:17.420
toes moldy bread is a potato peeler play

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:18.740
dark Prince's crown is garbage I think

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:21.110
we just go mystery sack because it's

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:23.780
free and then hope that we get some

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:26.150
half-decent junk out of this and I'll

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:27.230
say right now I think 11 a.m. is too

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:32.510
early for lunch

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:35.240
I like a noon lunch myself but anyway I

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:37.570
think 11 a.m. is like if you were having

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:40.610
a pizza party in like your middle school

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:42.830
you could order a pizza then and thus I

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:45.260
think it's acceptable for everybody on

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:47.990
earth to order a pizza then I actually

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:50.330
have lunchtime strats and I know that

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:53.929
some of you out there share this with me

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:55.340
because I can't be the only weirdo I one

00:20:53.929 --> 00:20:59.240
of my summer jobs that I worked with an

00:20:55.340 --> 00:21:02.300
office job where and this was like

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:04.460
incredibly freeing at the time you can

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.900
choose when to take your 50 minute lunch

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.400
break you know they trusted you to be an

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.900
adult they were like you know whatever

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:11.679
you feel like you want to take lunch

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:16.190
just take a 50 minute lunch break and

00:21:11.679 --> 00:21:19.520
you're good to go as long as you're back

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:21.590
you know this is pretty lakhs days of

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:23.420
GLAAD attunes people work hard but still

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:24.590
is like you can you can do what you want

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:26.929
as long as it's within the realms of

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:29.150
reason so I was like hey I'm a summer

00:21:26.929 --> 00:21:30.800
student let's be honest I'm just here so

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:32.450
I won't get fined I don't have a

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:34.700
long-term future this company in all

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:36.650
honesty probably but I'm going to work

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:40.910
hard but here's my strategy

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:42.480
I took lunch I worked at 8:30 a.m. to

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:44.280
4:30 p.m. I took

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.460
three you're going to think that that's

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:52.049
crazy but hear me out

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:54.330
8:32 three work hard three pm take your

00:21:52.049 --> 00:21:56.160
50 minute lunch break come back at 3:50

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:58.380
everybody else is basically shutting

00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:00.360
down for the day you know the last 15 20

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:02.190
minutes half hour 45 minutes one hour

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.870
two hours three hours in an office

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:06.809
everybody's just watching the clock

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:08.250
waiting to get home you know many of the

00:22:06.809 --> 00:22:09.690
days at the very least so I've come back

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:10.080
and I'd be like hey is there any work

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:13.620
for me

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:14.940
maybe like nah dawg it sort of days over

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.260
what are you talking about I'm like okay

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:18.750
cuz I just got back from lunch is there

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:20.010
anything to do in the day that just you

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:21.780
know don't just chill out but like

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:23.700
here's some busy work basically and I

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:26.130
thought I was a genius and I was the

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:29.010
genius because somebody complained to HR

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:30.840
and then like a week later I got an

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:32.610
email by the way these are like the best

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.410
working days of my life the time till

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:37.890
lunchtime stretched out in infinity

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:39.210
admittedly but after lunchtime it was

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:41.280
like a breeze it was like the day was

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:42.900
over at 3 p.m. I artificially shortened

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:45.960
my own workday without compromising my

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:49.440
productivity in the eyes of my in the

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:51.360
eyes of my supervisors there's a model

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.070
employees innovation that's why I'm

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:55.049
working in the hot field of new media

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:57.450
now it's forward-thinking ideas like

00:22:55.049 --> 00:22:59.760
that right but yeah someone complained

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:01.380
to HR in their leg lyonel see why he

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.510
should be able to take lunch at 3 p.m.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:05.100
because um you know sometimes we need

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:06.540
him there for the meetings in which we

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.549
talk about things that are way over his

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:10.350
pay grade and never ask for his feedback

00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:12.419
on anything because he's not going to

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:14.309
work here in three months so yeah there

00:23:12.419 --> 00:23:17.760
was there was a company-wide email that

00:23:14.309 --> 00:23:19.860
you know that our 20 person large

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:21.660
company it was pretty obvious it was

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:24.750
directed to but it was like just a

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:27.090
reminder to everyone the acceptable

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:29.190
lunch hour if you want to take it you

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:32.130
can take it at any time between 11:30

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:34.799
and 1:30 please do not take your lunch

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:37.049
break outside of these hours because it

00:23:34.799 --> 00:23:38.700
will result in not being able to be as

00:23:37.049 --> 00:23:42.690
productive as we'd like in meetings and

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:45.419
you know blah blah as I got it I mean in

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:49.260
a way I was like I've invested Moriarty

00:23:45.419 --> 00:23:53.040
you know he out stopped me you screwed

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:55.499
up my plan but I was also bummed because

00:23:53.040 --> 00:24:00.309
I was like

00:23:55.499 --> 00:24:02.859
you know I beat the system isn't that

00:24:00.309 --> 00:24:04.329
supposed to be rewarded I'm doing the

00:24:02.859 --> 00:24:09.129
same amount of work but it feels like

00:24:04.329 --> 00:24:10.839
it's 15% less that's I've just gotten

00:24:09.129 --> 00:24:15.609
another opiate of the masses to get me

00:24:10.839 --> 00:24:17.469
through the day and then you know that I

00:24:15.609 --> 00:24:19.179
mean that was that actually you're gonna

00:24:17.469 --> 00:24:21.849
think that I was a bad employee but I

00:24:19.179 --> 00:24:24.369
was actually like a good employee

00:24:21.849 --> 00:24:25.809
and this said I mean it's I have no way

00:24:24.369 --> 00:24:27.639
to prove that to you know do I really

00:24:25.809 --> 00:24:29.589
feel the compulsion except for the fact

00:24:27.639 --> 00:24:32.799
that despite being like a summer student

00:24:29.589 --> 00:24:34.239
who had a temporary tenure there when

00:24:32.799 --> 00:24:35.949
there was like six weeks left in my

00:24:34.239 --> 00:24:37.449
contract out of 12 they were like you

00:24:35.949 --> 00:24:38.559
know what because they called me into

00:24:37.449 --> 00:24:39.909
their office and I was like all getting

00:24:38.559 --> 00:24:41.859
fired for the lunch thing but no they

00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:43.599
gave me a little race and they didn't

00:24:41.859 --> 00:24:46.569
have to do that and I took that was very

00:24:43.599 --> 00:24:49.509
proud of that little race because the

00:24:46.569 --> 00:24:52.299
job was on a meta level completely

00:24:49.509 --> 00:24:56.949
meaningless but I gave it my all and I

00:24:52.299 --> 00:25:00.190
cared about it and I was rewarded but at

00:24:56.949 --> 00:25:03.659
the same time I was also like come on

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:05.709
the lunch thing pretty genius right

00:25:03.659 --> 00:25:07.469
you're gonna ask some questions you're

00:25:05.709 --> 00:25:11.649
going to be like hey were you hungry

00:25:07.469 --> 00:25:13.719
yeah man but you know you can you can

00:25:11.649 --> 00:25:15.849
always get up and go like you know eat

00:25:13.719 --> 00:25:17.440
an apple or something like that if you

00:25:15.849 --> 00:25:18.849
have you've never worked in an office I

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.799
mean I'm going to burst the bubble for

00:25:18.849 --> 00:25:22.779
you there's a lot most of the time and

00:25:20.799 --> 00:25:25.389
some people gonna comment on this and be

00:25:22.779 --> 00:25:27.190
like not in my office and you know what

00:25:25.389 --> 00:25:29.049
that's that's sweet but this was like a

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:32.169
shock for me when I entered the office

00:25:29.049 --> 00:25:33.969
working world and admittedly I know I'm

00:25:32.169 --> 00:25:35.440
getting off on a side tracked here we

00:25:33.969 --> 00:25:38.799
should definitely do an extra floor now

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:40.419
that we have a dark Prince's crown but

00:25:38.799 --> 00:25:42.819
as a trinket I forget what it's called

00:25:40.419 --> 00:25:45.459
in fact now we shouldn't use it just yet

00:25:42.819 --> 00:25:46.809
but anyway in fact this is very

00:25:45.459 --> 00:25:48.339
different when I was a teacher

00:25:46.809 --> 00:25:50.109
you know you anytime you spend in the

00:25:48.339 --> 00:25:51.489
office you're like thank god I'm not

00:25:50.109 --> 00:25:54.159
teaching right now I'm going to go you

00:25:51.489 --> 00:25:55.719
know look at my phone for 15 seconds and

00:25:54.159 --> 00:25:57.669
drink a bottle of water and then go back

00:25:55.719 --> 00:26:01.899
into the frickin animal kingdom of the

00:25:57.669 --> 00:26:04.779
classroom right but anyway when I my

00:26:01.899 --> 00:26:06.309
perception as a teenager of what offices

00:26:04.779 --> 00:26:07.850
were like is like work work work it's

00:26:06.309 --> 00:26:10.490
like the Rihanna song you know non

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:11.809
stop but there's depending on where you

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:13.640
work there's a lot of downtime there's

00:26:11.809 --> 00:26:15.559
sometimes you know slow days you're just

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:17.419
kind of sitting there waiting for things

00:26:15.559 --> 00:26:20.179
to manifest there's also days that are

00:26:17.419 --> 00:26:23.120
very busy but certainly not all of them

00:26:20.179 --> 00:26:28.039
so yeah it's spend a lot of time just

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:29.780
like listening to the radio wasn't a bad

00:26:28.039 --> 00:26:31.070
gig honestly I don't think we have an

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:32.919
item room on this floor which is why I'm

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:35.240
reroll in the floor right now basically

00:26:32.919 --> 00:26:37.090
because I think it only manifests the

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:39.770
item room once you pick up the trinket

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:42.169
it's like what it only manifest the item

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:45.980
room on floor load when you have the

00:26:42.169 --> 00:26:47.480
trinket I believe could be wrong but I

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:54.679
think that's how it goes we should check

00:26:47.480 --> 00:27:01.309
this anyway that's that's that that's

00:26:54.679 --> 00:27:04.909
that's my working anecdote pencil had

00:27:01.309 --> 00:27:10.130
some jobs believe it or not despite

00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:11.929
entering you know the YouTube scene at a

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:17.539
fairly young age I have had some real

00:27:11.929 --> 00:27:20.320
jobs I had a summer job well I know I

00:27:17.539 --> 00:27:23.240
had a job in my first year of college

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:26.510
phoning alumni to ask for money it's a

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:28.250
great time to do that gig because you're

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:30.320
like this is the best school on earth

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:31.580
and then you know as you get a little

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:34.159
older and a little bit more jaded like

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:37.730
it my school called me asking for money

00:27:34.159 --> 00:27:40.789
right now I feel like for what I'm 28

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:42.380
years old you guys barely got your claws

00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:46.100
out of me recently what do you want

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:48.200
money for you're publicly funded

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:51.590
universe I'm not dum-dum white man and

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:53.090
it seems I guess to some extent here and

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:55.159
you know donating your alma mater it

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:57.230
could be a great source of pride but you

00:27:55.159 --> 00:27:58.429
know I all admit that on a telephone get

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:59.809
a lot of people who are like why would I

00:27:58.429 --> 00:28:02.299
donate to the school and you just go

00:27:59.809 --> 00:28:03.740
hell you know toys should only cost

00:28:02.299 --> 00:28:05.419
one-third of what it takes to actually

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:08.210
send a child to school and blah blah oh

00:28:05.419 --> 00:28:11.840
yeah well the other two-thirds comes

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:14.210
from freaking like one highest tax rates

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:16.040
in the Western world anyway this is

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:17.929
irrelevant at this point so I had that

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.130
job that was good for perspective gives

00:28:17.929 --> 00:28:21.230
you a great tolerance for being yelled

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:21.660
at maybe one of the reasons I don't take

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:23.370
neck

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:24.690
of YouTube comments that seriously is

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:28.050
because you know I've already been

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:29.550
yelled at by enough like adults were

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:30.600
like you called me during the news and

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:31.950
I'm like well you know you could have

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:35.130
just not picked up the phone what are

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:38.040
you talking about you the phone rings

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:41.820
you have to pick it up that's the number

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:43.590
one rule of telephones not that I'm you

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:49.370
know defending basically the concept of

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:52.860
telemarketing all help me thank you I

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:55.080
worked as a donation processor goodwill

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:58.110
for a while so essentially people would

00:28:55.080 --> 00:29:00.480
drop garbage bags full of stuff in front

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:03.120
of the goodwill and you know you grab it

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:04.950
you sort through it and go hmm

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.930
this one doesn't smell like urine ah I

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:11.160
put a dollar-fifty price tag on and put

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:13.380
it out there that was largely largely

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:16.130
pretty terrible to be honest with you

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:18.120
they didn't work that for too long

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:22.380
temporarily worked as a database

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:25.170
administrator and then a teacher you

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:27.960
know it's a broad scope of knowledge

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:29.550
here for better for worse spirit hearts

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:32.880
please do the red hearts are actually

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:34.380
fine as well thank you but you know you

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:37.140
probably didn't ask her my life story we

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:38.610
smelted a good trinket there dude so we

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:40.620
have not seen our item room on this

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:42.270
floor let's go back and look for it I'm

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:45.360
going to crack into that fourth level

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:47.940
meat boy there and you know what I'm

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:51.360
spoiled I didn't get my first job until

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:53.190
I was 17 what she I mean that might seem

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.720
depending on who you are that might seem

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:57.210
ridiculously late or ridiculously early

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:59.130
but I had anxiety about it so I'm just

00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:01.830
I'm saying that to let you know you know

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:03.180
maybe you're 16 17 18 and you're like I

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:05.190
don't have a job yet you know I'm

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:06.390
screwed you're not screwed I mean if

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:08.880
you're screwed we're all screwed let's

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:11.040
put it that way I mean people are not

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:12.090
retiring anymore so that's the thing you

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.770
should be worried about you shouldn't be

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:16.200
like oh I don't have a good resume you

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:17.820
should be like everybody's working until

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:21.000
they die and people don't die until

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:22.800
they're 85 now so like that's all the

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.530
jobs are being done by robots I mean

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:27.450
that's the problem but you know don't

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:30.390
sweater is what I'm trying to say here's

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:32.740
a list of the song I wrote mmm trying

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:36.550
not to worry about your resume

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:38.050
Gong's wariness the resume but that mean

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:39.429
like maybe worried a little bit about it

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:41.890
like the long and short of it is that I

00:30:39.429 --> 00:30:43.150
have no idea where the heck we've

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:44.380
already been to our item room we just

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:47.580
went to a two seconds ago what are you

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:51.790
talking about here we got nothing

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:54.040
advisable anyway head down here's a very

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:58.080
long run for a run that's like moms

00:30:54.040 --> 00:31:03.460
knife heavy ooh is bad damage on my part

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:06.340
and we are light on HP like we haven't

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:08.140
gotten a ton of it but we've lost more

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:10.780
than we should have as well so I'm

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:12.160
looking for Kiera fonts here we don't

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:13.929
need anything else I'm probably not

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:16.750
going to fight us just because our HP is

00:31:13.929 --> 00:31:18.610
so low for what it's worth the other

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:20.770
reason that's so good Thank You mystery

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:23.320
sack you validated your existence the

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:26.200
other reason our HP is low is because

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:31.240
I've traded all of our red hearts away

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:33.429
to use potato peeler to get five levels

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:36.370
of meatboys so we end up losing this run

00:31:33.429 --> 00:31:38.080
you know it's potato peeler based hubris

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:38.800
there's no question about it gets all of

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.210
us in the end

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:42.520
since we have chaos I think we should

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:45.429
keep this let's go spirit art actually

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:47.530
like that's one floors worth of fuel so

00:31:45.429 --> 00:31:49.150
I'm happy okay well that dumb I just

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:51.760
want us the game coming into this room

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:54.120
James West came in the West so remember

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.120
the James

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:08.910
let's go

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:11.160
I don't want to do this room it's I've

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:12.480
noticed a trend rooms I hate well this

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:15.030
room is actually great if you have like

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:17.640
contagion but rooms I hate are usually

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:19.920
rooms where the enemies are just

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:22.410
numerous so it's annoying to kill them

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:23.700
you know what you need some annoying

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:26.220
rooms the suite just isn't as sweet

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:28.950
without the sour I swear to god I saw a

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:31.800
knife fly through one of these enemies

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:37.380
and not kill them do the monstros long

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:42.420
knives not do any damage on a scale of 1

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:46.220
to Halifax Explosion that would be like

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:48.770
a maybe a 4 on the bummer scale I mean

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:51.450
the Halifax Explosion you know a

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:56.690
catastrophic event many people died but

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:58.980
it was also like a hundred years ago so

00:32:56.690 --> 00:33:00.660
people outside of people outside of

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:02.250
Canada definitely learn about the

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:05.000
Halifax Explosion I'm just not sure to

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:07.680
what extent because I think it was

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.660
Austin broaden up on the NSF's the other

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:11.070
day I was like how many provinces in

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:12.600
Canada can you name and then he's like

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:14.520
well there's the one where the explosion

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:19.560
was and I was like I know about a

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:22.490
Halifax I'm not saying it said I've been

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:25.170
a Halifax lovely place if I had to live

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:26.850
east of Ontario this is kind of a

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:28.620
backhanded compliment necessarily

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:30.630
meaning like that if I had to live east

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:32.970
of Ontario Halifax would probably be

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:34.860
high on the list and I delivery used to

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:41.040
Quebec Halifax behind the list that

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:43.740
should be spun I sleep nicely spun you

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:48.210
know I like it it's a little small by my

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:51.300
takes but very friendly friendly people

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:54.930
great food there's an IMAX there I've

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:57.810
been there in like literally 18 years

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:59.390
but still so I'm not dude I've got mad

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:02.700
respect for the Maritimes

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:05.100
even if I think you know sometimes your

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:06.930
customs are a little funky like I mean

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:08.610
just go look up the mummer's from

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:10.920
Newfoundland that might even be like

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:11.609
something that Newfoundland inherited

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:18.720
from

00:34:11.609 --> 00:34:20.369
in Scotland Ireland I'm not sure but you

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:23.809
know they get into some wacky stuff up

00:34:20.369 --> 00:34:23.809
there but that's half the charm you know

00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:29.129
they're they're kissing con on occasion

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:32.819
drinking screeching I'm not talking

00:34:29.129 --> 00:34:36.499
about Saved by the Bell I would like to

00:34:32.819 --> 00:34:36.499
know how much HP we have left here

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:50.849
the answer is enough I think we should

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:52.529
potato peel like a second-level Meat Boy

00:34:50.849 --> 00:34:54.989
is not worth that much but if we're

00:34:52.529 --> 00:34:57.720
already committed to peeling like why

00:34:54.989 --> 00:35:00.539
not take it all the way right this is a

00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:02.670
nice like again this is a good run to

00:35:00.539 --> 00:35:03.960
set the tone for the rest of the day if

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:05.730
I'm going to be recording a bunch of

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:08.519
issac which is basically like my dream

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:11.549
workday at this point well that's not

00:35:08.519 --> 00:35:13.999
totally fair dead cells is also lovely

00:35:11.549 --> 00:35:16.319
to record the NL SS is a lot of fun

00:35:13.999 --> 00:35:19.470
player unknown battlegrounds has its

00:35:16.319 --> 00:35:22.410
hooks in me like today's is this month

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:25.589
or so is like an excellent time to be to

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:26.400
be me from a working satisfaction

00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:29.400
standpoint

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:32.640
however it's nice to have a run that

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:36.539
starts would like some some great

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:37.790
momentum here we did miss the hush fight

00:35:36.539 --> 00:35:39.680
but

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:42.140
we're going to get through this one very

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.640
easily I don't know Boyd who cares is

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:45.160
basically my perspective well we'll

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:47.329
cross that bridge when we come to it

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:49.730
curse of the unknown is always a little

00:35:47.329 --> 00:35:52.390
dicey spear of destiny is weird

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:55.069
lost fly takes us closer to Beelzebub

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:56.660
bookworm attempt at least I'm not taking

00:35:55.069 --> 00:35:58.910
curse of the tower it's just a little

00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:00.740
too dicey and fenced it's fine

00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:05.210
gulp is useless right now but good

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:08.349
otherwise bombs okey essentially second

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:08.349
verse same as the first you know

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:19.610
we don't guarantee ourselves item rooms

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:21.500
on the wait a minute

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:24.140
this bloody crown gives you item rooms

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:25.580
after wait does it give it give you item

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:28.340
rooms on the womb or does it give you

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:29.750
item rooms on the womb and beyond as if

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:32.630
it gives it to you on the womb and

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:34.100
beyond we should have been peeping a

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:35.510
little closer attention on the cathedral

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:38.840
I mean there's no shortage of items here

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:40.010
but on the cathedral it would have been

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:43.600
would have been nice

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:47.690
Oh another curse of the tower all right

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:49.580
that is that a foul portent for our next

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:51.800
episode of The Binding of Isaac after

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:56.270
birth plus only time will flip and tell

00:36:51.800 --> 00:37:01.760
buddy but for now this one like popped

00:36:56.270 --> 00:37:04.220
off ridiculously and I got today I had a

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:07.760
little like grandpa and elves Oh sit

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:10.160
down our let me tell you about the six

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:16.820
real jobs I had before I got this

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:18.260
incredible fake one I will say you know

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:21.950
there's there's good and bad things

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:24.280
about what I do now the bad thing is it

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:26.510
really does take like a mild

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:29.390
psychological toll on you to get yelled

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:31.070
at by adolescents on a regular basis not

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:33.590
everybody who yells at me as an

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:35.270
adolescent I'll admit and I'm not trying

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:37.460
to you know talk down to the people that

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:39.830
are fans but also yell at me because

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:42.700
that's biting the hand that feeds but is

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:45.500
something particularly the meaning about

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:48.340
being yelled at someone who has like a

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:51.260
Neopets logo that you're like ha man

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:54.830
this really what would I have aspired to

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:57.740
in like most jobs you don't get yelled

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:59.480
at very much by 12 year olds the

00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:01.520
difference well I mean sometimes

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:03.290
teaching but then you just go I'll call

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:06.730
your parents and they go please oh my

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:11.570
god that's like I'd rather go to prison

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:13.550
anyway the other the other side of it I

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:16.790
feel like a lot of youtubers miss out on

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:18.680
this there's also no other job that I

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:20.270
can possibly conceive of at least

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:22.160
outside of being like a you know another

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:24.380
entertainer like a singer or something

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:27.140
like that where people tweet you on a

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:29.660
regular basis and go like hey

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:32.539
you know I watch your stuff every day

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:34.519
and I love it and like I just I look at

00:38:32.539 --> 00:38:38.869
those tweets and I think I make I make

00:38:34.519 --> 00:38:40.700
garbage that's amazing what other job in

00:38:38.869 --> 00:38:42.920
the world you play video games crack

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:45.019
jokes over the top and have people you

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:46.789
know suddenly they even come up to you

00:38:45.019 --> 00:38:48.440
in person and go like hey I watch your

00:38:46.789 --> 00:38:52.460
videos every day that's incredible

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:56.450
that's that's like an inconceivable

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:57.920
level of flattery and I do feel like you

00:38:56.450 --> 00:39:00.980
know the longer I do this the more I

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:04.989
appreciate that and the more I i I just

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:07.339
slop off like comments that are

00:39:04.989 --> 00:39:08.989
undeservedly critical you know it's a

00:39:07.339 --> 00:39:10.700
matter of like self respect I still I

00:39:08.989 --> 00:39:12.769
still see other youtubers sometimes

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:15.559
youtubers that were you know they're

00:39:12.769 --> 00:39:18.230
there in the circle with us and they reg

00:39:15.559 --> 00:39:20.329
they like one or two really nasty

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:23.210
comments and they they stew about it all

00:39:20.329 --> 00:39:24.950
day and I think I'm in on a way or in a

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:27.200
way I'm lucky that I don't have that

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:29.450
psychological compulsion but I also used

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:31.009
to to some extent I just sort of grew

00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:33.589
out of it you know you got to focus on

00:39:31.009 --> 00:39:36.529
the positive and recognize it's like the

00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:38.210
greatest job in the world and so like so

00:39:36.529 --> 00:39:40.910
many of you watch these videos didn't

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:43.190
email me like hey you know you've really

00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:45.230
been like a therapeutic influence in my

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:46.789
life like that's that's flattering we

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:48.410
got gushy at the end of this episode but

00:39:46.789 --> 00:39:50.299
that's cool we didn't quite get Guffey

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:51.410
