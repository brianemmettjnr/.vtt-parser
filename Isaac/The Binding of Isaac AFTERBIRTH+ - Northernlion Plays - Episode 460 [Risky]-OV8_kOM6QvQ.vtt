00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.560
hey everybody welcome back to northern

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.720
lion place the binding of issac

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.099
afterbirth plus I was gonna say the

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.080
binding of issac after with plus two

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.360
that would not be correct it's a

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.160
nonsensical expression you know what we

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:20.430
could use lilith greedier why put myself

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.949
through this pa rt why because we got it

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:29.609
what do we start with your magic mush am

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:31.830
76 for Z D s absolutely zero percent

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.090
wrong with this hello Ken are you trying

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.430
to leave are you trying to jump on the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.320
computer you're trying to leave that's

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.879
fantastic news not because I don't want

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.829
to see you but because the computer is

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.610
something that should not be jumped upon

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.100
I thought about doing a keeper greedier

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.940
but we did just do the keeper greed run

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.140
to begin with so figured let's not

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.329
overload it here right off the bat ooh

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.890
Plan C I don't think so

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.890
the thing is Lilith

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:08.909
please be good

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:13.170
Lilith greed should we're greedy or I

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.240
should say should be strong especially

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.500
you know that bomb actually turned out

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.180
to be very useful but should be strong

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.470
we can use I mean that's not bad good

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.000
but I guess if it's ever gonna work for

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.509
any character it's the right character

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.430
to try here the idea is that by using

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.280
box of friends here we should be able to

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.200
fairly easily build up a strong you know

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.060
kind of pseudo army of familiars here

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.250
that can really help us along even

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.320
though robo-baby sucks if you get three

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.360
Robo babies or four Robo babies you know

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.439
now we're talking and by now we're

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.000
talking I mean now we're doing

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.880
marginally more damage than we otherwise

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.740
would be given the circumstances still

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.649
pretty bad is the way that that comes

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.399
down to but you know if that was so bad

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:59.520
if you know Lilith succeeds or at least

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.710
as is quite valuable to us on boss rush

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.390
the same holds true if not to a greater

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.009
extent actually for greed and greedier

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.680
modes so we should consider it a

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.600
privilege to get the opportunity to

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.700
handle a greedier mode run is Lilith

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.230
here hopefully we get a run that's

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.460
exciting that's what I'm open for we

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.980
don't need a run that's strong we just

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.580
had that as a zl-- run you know we won

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.200
is the keeper in greed recently we've

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.260
accomplished some good things is what

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.660
I'm trying to say so here's where the

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.870
danger comes in what's the right play

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.410
here try to beat the bosses without

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:38.310
taking damage well in the process losing

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.040
all your familiars or try to beat the or

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.950
go into the shop and buy HP for three

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.320
cents instead kind of a tough call I've

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.700
chosen to opt for the one that's a

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.270
little bit more performative and I'm

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.270
hoping for the best

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:02.070
but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:04.500
little frightened here excuse me sir

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:09.180
please pop up but not too close that's

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:11.850
too close we got him uh I think now I'm

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.370
gonna go check out this room and what do

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.630
I want I mean it's kind of tempting to

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.900
go for a blank card it's like a

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.570
superstar ingredient ago for moldy bread

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.820
and honestly I would love for you to

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.820
provide me with a single penny okay well

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.250
like the rate of fire increase is so

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.450
good here that I'm willing to spend a

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.030
bomb to try to get it

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.049
I don't think we have a choice then

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.400
there's no point of re-rolling

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.620
everything we might as well just wait

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.110
for a minute here maybe we'll be able to

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.390
get something and you know what I think

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.640
this is okay obviously I don't love the

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.540
idea of starting our next like three or

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.000
four waves without having any box of

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.160
friends support but double Ragman early

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.780
kind of an annoying fight I'm not so

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.640
much thinking like we're gonna die here

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.010
if we don't pop box of friends but I'm

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.720
more like if we don't pop box and

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.010
friends we might lose enough HP that we

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.540
could conceivably die if we fight

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.829
Krampus on our first deal with the devil

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.090
I don't know why I'm concerned with that

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.769
because our first deal with the net the

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.019
devil is inevitably just gonna be like a

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.380
red chest if green moat is anything to

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.370
go by well that's what I get for being

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:19.350
shall I say greedy

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.290
I think that's we should shoot for the

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.600
moon here

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.960
and it's something you would probably

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.490
never do in most situations if you were

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.990
a little bit more sensible than I am you

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.530
probably would still choose not to do it

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.930
I'm gonna take both the reason is one's

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:39.250
a familiar ones agape transformation I'd

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:41.020
like to have the effect of both well

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.960
save our money because we can use it to

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:47.110
possibly get into extra HP on the next

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.620
floor oh now you got to look at this and

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.540
go really I think the answer is I think

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.660
we look for an HP upgrade with with

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.980
benefits on the next floor basically

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.730
hopefully we get one from our you know

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.350
item room silver or gold here otherwise

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.640
God's flesh is fine placenta there we go

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.780
that's what we're looking for was a

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:09.700
little scared but we made it through and

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.290
screw is an amazing item I don't think

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.550
you can afford to d4 but Lilith I know

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.620
it seems like I'm coming up with a lot

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.410
of convenient excuses to not reroll my

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:20.440
whole run but Lilith oftentimes is just

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:23.730
the wrong choice normally I'd love a

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:29.640
seven cent item but I don't think that

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:33.970
the Steam sale is really worth it here

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:38.110
curved horn absolutely is alright I mean

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:39.640
we got nine damage so thankfully the

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.330
idea is that it shouldn't be too

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:46.120
difficult for us here to just survive I

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.790
mean the one more wave basically there

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.440
we go now we've got a little bit of

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.030
bonus love coming through here and we

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.460
should be fine for this floor so I think

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.080
we've got a very good run that's in a

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:00.190
fragile place right now so the real

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:03.910
problem is uh you know what happens to

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.620
us if we don't manage to get HP and

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.300
moreover the real problem is what

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.000
happens to us if my brain malfunctions

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.070
and I decide to take some stupid deal

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.080
with the devil items like sister Maggie

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.090
for example that kind of fit in

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.650
thematically too you know the Platonic

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.970
ideal of a good Lilith run without

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.280
actually providing us with very much

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.950
support at all but luckily what are the

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.450
odds of that happening right now it's no

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.280
surprise to me this is completely

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.950
original by the way it's no surprise to

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.660
me I am my

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.880
worst enemy because every now and then I

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.650
kick the living s out of me can't think

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:40.460
of what word would ever go there it's

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:46.220
not vulgar okay we're gonna do like

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:48.800
every wave right now well for now things

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:53.360
change but we're gonna try to do every

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:55.550
wave because I don't want to lose our

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.350
Mass Effect I don't know if that's the

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.840
right use of Mass Effect isn't a Mass

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:02.720
Effect like as something gets larger it

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:05.420
has an effect that's more than you would

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.130
expect as a result of its size something

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.330
like that it's like the larger something

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.460
gets it can have unintended consequences

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.320
like a tumor gives you a mass effect

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.090
when it comes large enough to affect

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.070
other tissues I think maybe I'm using it

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.870
correctly I don't know what am i a

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:22.100
doctor no I sit on my butt and play

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:26.900
video games on YouTube also a da e

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:28.280
programming the AE arrays start at zero

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.400
there's one of you out there it keeps

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:34.700
tweeting me anytime I mention anything

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.080
if I say that a Rea joke Nicole is the

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.900
only thing you know about programming

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.980
arrays and then I just respond to you

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.630
with your first name and I don't

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:45.500
remember what your first name is but you

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:46.490
know who you are I'm not giving you the

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:50.570
satisfaction

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:53.840
perthro ii-era oh you always go with a

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:59.300
yera on greed mode it's essentially like

00:07:53.840 --> 00:08:03.860
a 20 cent rune I think you probably go

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:05.750
binky and you know what this is a who

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.700
dares win situation I'm hoping five

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:10.850
cents crack this open

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:12.680
we got a nalgas rune uh you would

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.960
suggest this is probably not worth it

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.910
but we can at least like save half a

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.340
spirit are we get three bombs out of it

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:20.660
so now we got three bombs for five cents

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.040
and we got to think about you know

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.950
whether that deals good I don't know

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:26.300
seems okay normally be fifteen cents but

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.830
normally we also probably wouldn't do

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.140
too much with the bombs but there was a

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:32.360
text to a mushroom you fool that being

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:36.470
said we have magic much already so maybe

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:39.729
not as as bad as it looks but range

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.729
upgrade completely irrelevant

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.569
we can get five cents out of a single

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:47.699
bomb it looks like right there and then

00:08:45.569 --> 00:08:53.189
I'll start to be pretty pleased so let's

00:08:47.699 --> 00:08:56.129
take this do we want PhD yes oh that

00:08:53.189 --> 00:08:59.910
stinks it's not essential but we want it

00:08:56.129 --> 00:09:03.930
could be helpful glaucoma occasional

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:05.069
confusion tears no music apparently so

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.259
we're in it's gonna be a little bit of

00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:10.259
an a cappella run here there goes the

00:09:07.259 --> 00:09:11.519
girl that stole my huh I don't know why

00:09:10.259 --> 00:09:13.649
I'm singing the melody line at

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:14.910
barbershop quartet let's be honest we're

00:09:13.649 --> 00:09:17.100
in a barbershop quartet

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:19.889
first off I'd be flattered secondly I'm

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:24.839
definitely the guy who goes bow bow bow

00:09:19.889 --> 00:09:31.800
bow bow bow not using the yeah rough a

00:09:24.839 --> 00:09:34.379
pair goodly please pop this I'm not the

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.459
Frankie Valli I'm one of the force like

00:09:34.379 --> 00:09:37.829
doll Frankie Valli

00:09:35.459 --> 00:09:38.670
I'm not Frankie Valli I'm one of the

00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:43.379
four seasons

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:45.269
probably winter I'm mad I'm a little mad

00:09:43.379 --> 00:09:49.499
I got I got hemmed in there that was

00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:54.179
stupid of me also the title of my Thor

00:09:49.499 --> 00:09:57.059
related podcast Siva zhurba severe but

00:09:54.179 --> 00:10:00.179
in the club get tips so no your that's

00:09:57.059 --> 00:10:03.480
okay well yeah alright alright alright

00:10:00.179 --> 00:10:07.699
back to the drawing board it's a shame

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:09.660
because that was a good run but you know

00:10:07.699 --> 00:10:11.759
gotta do what you gotta do

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.139
we're not starting this run in a bad

00:10:11.759 --> 00:10:14.730
place necessarily I think I got

00:10:13.139 --> 00:10:20.610
distracted there but my barbershop

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:22.949
quartet miss everdene and you know I

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:27.509
ended up screwing myself a little bit as

00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:30.199
a result this is a much worse start than

00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:33.509
our last run but still okay I mean a a

00:10:30.199 --> 00:10:36.059
tears upgrade not quite doubling your

00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:37.740
damage but you know you can't get magic

00:10:36.059 --> 00:10:39.389
much early on every run you can get it

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.439
on every run is my dream at least that's

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:42.660
what I gonna keep telling myself the

00:10:40.439 --> 00:10:44.459
power of positive thinking got magic

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.170
mush up on my vision board so it's only

00:10:44.459 --> 00:10:48.179
a matter of time until it wills itself

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:50.310
into existence like that Ferrari at 50

00:10:48.179 --> 00:10:52.200
that's up there as well

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.500
I don't have a vision board I have a

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:58.560
white board you know what it says on it

00:10:54.500 --> 00:11:00.330
record a video on humble seed and that's

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.279
not from the release of tumble seed

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:04.770
that's from the first time that I saw it

00:11:02.279 --> 00:11:12.300
at PAX West 2016 the white board just

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:14.100
kind of stagnates it's not because I'm

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:19.020
an unproductive person I'm just not I'm

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:21.300
not organized well I need the agile

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:24.089
framework and methodology does to come

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:27.839
to my my home life do a daily stand-up

00:11:24.089 --> 00:11:30.240
what am I gonna work on you know do

00:11:27.839 --> 00:11:31.980
requirements gathering I don't know what

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:37.020
I'm talking about I did take one agile

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:38.610
course though anyway the point is I'm

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.440
just gonna keep things going here

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:41.910
weirdly enough for some reason I

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.020
actually feel like this is better than

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.940
our last run I don't know if it's just

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:47.760
because I only have the one kind of

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:49.710
familiar so all of the Incubus are

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.270
actually staying like close together

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.980
after being doubled which makes them

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:55.320
much more likely to hit that's a

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:57.810
strategy I had never considered maybe

00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:00.360
it's not the more familiars the merrier

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:04.200
when you play as Lilith maybe it's

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:07.460
actually the more familiars the worse

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:09.570
things are that was extremely dumb

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.710
unless the familiars are really good

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:13.380
like I'm not gonna turn down a little

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:15.600
brain or something like that but I I i

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:17.010
thought i was being ballsy when I picked

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.350
up sister Maggie but I might have just

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:21.990
been stupid because for every sister

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:23.310
Maggie it pushes an incubus like more

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:25.440
out of line with where the enemy is

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:27.180
actually gonna be yeah okay you know

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.860
what it's the most revolutionary

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:32.180
thinking I personally have had about

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:34.410
Lilith in about a million years so I'm

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:36.360
interested to see how this works whore

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:38.339
Babylon it fits the bill for us right

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:41.910
now a fairly nice statistical

00:12:38.339 --> 00:12:43.800
improvement I will definitely buy a key

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:48.959
and then see what we do from this point

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:50.490
on what a nickel is essentially trash we

00:12:48.959 --> 00:12:51.510
might it I mean if we get a nickel out

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:53.580
of it I'll be happy

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:57.209
we got a penny so there's only a four

00:12:53.580 --> 00:13:00.780
cent loss but I think I'll also buy this

00:12:57.209 --> 00:13:03.060
and PJ's is not a great item but it does

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.840
allow us to survive potentially so we

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.460
can get a great

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.980
so I'm feeling a lot better about this

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:10.580
and also about my revolutionary new

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:15.810
breakthrough and how to play as Lilith

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:20.430
there's so much cat hair in the air dude

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:23.400
cat shedding is like allergies yeah I've

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:29.390
done the allergies bit before but every

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:31.980
year oh and look who's here welcome Tomo

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:33.720
every year I find this new allergy so

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.190
used to just be a spring allergies now

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.930
there's like spring and summer outage

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:39.120
then like a year later spring summer

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:40.770
winter and fall allergies now it's like

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.020
all I got the yeah you know the ragweed

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:45.050
that the equinox of the two new moons

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:47.370
Twilight and otherwise and of it like

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:50.850
just keeps being more and more allergies

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:51.330
I'm not saying I disbelieve them wink

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.400
wink

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:57.870
but yeah I'm just saying it's hard to

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:59.310
keep up with cats shedding is like that

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.960
when I was younger when two cats shed

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:02.640
once in the winter to get the winter

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.990
coat once in the fall maybe to get the

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.660
winter coat once in the spring cuz the

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:08.220
summer coats coming in now that I'm a

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:11.430
cat owner it feels like cats shed

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:13.710
literally 100% of the time mind you we

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:15.060
do have long-haired cats we got to take

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:18.120
him to get groomed like everyone thinks

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:19.560
it's being bougie to get your cat's

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.870
grooms we're not getting freakin

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:23.970
pigtails cut into them for so we can

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:28.640
show them off at the Kensington cat show

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:28.640
or whatever it's hair everywhere dude

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:32.640
rather let the groomer give them a

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.620
little flow be action and you know I

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.030
have to pick the hairs out of my nose

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.470
one by one after they've already

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:44.460
embedded themselves in my mucus

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:45.900
membranes please stop making creep that

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.580
would make it a lot easier for me to

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.290
stop stepping in it anyway of course

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:51.180
we're gonna finish all the waves off

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:54.420
you're actually like really really well

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:55.650
set up unfortunately can't really afford

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.330
to take too many deals with the devil

00:14:55.650 --> 00:15:00.120
but there's some like God combinations

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:04.920
for us Nine Lives plus an item would be

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:06.300
really positive we can stay on spirit

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:08.010
hearts while also getting the value of

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:10.740
potentially becoming Gumpy in the future

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:11.850
and of course there's a lot of deal with

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.680
the devil items that are just good

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.840
enough to make us not worry too much

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:21.080
about Whore of Babylon

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:22.760
in with here what on earth is this well

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:25.610
what it is is actually the easiest wave

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:27.320
of all time but also an outrageously

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:33.790
large version of the hollow excuse me

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:33.790
sir you're not done

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:44.759
or we could just get two black hearts

00:15:38.759 --> 00:15:48.430
three spirit hearts three spirit hearts

00:15:44.759 --> 00:15:50.379
that is not a good deal with the okay

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:53.350
that doesn't even work we're not gonna

00:15:50.379 --> 00:15:55.029
buy anything here technically maybe the

00:15:53.350 --> 00:16:00.310
syringe is okay we could use the speed

00:15:55.029 --> 00:16:01.149
but strong it's like really good but not

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:03.519
as good

00:16:01.149 --> 00:16:06.370
specifically Lilith and greed mode set

00:16:03.519 --> 00:16:07.990
up here I think but it's is I'm starting

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:11.470
to feel the burn of not getting many

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:14.259
passive items hey glitch n/a for thanks

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:16.180
for the subscription how convenient

00:16:14.259 --> 00:16:17.829
now I kind of wish we bought the speed

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:19.689
upgrade but either way since oil is good

00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:21.670
by itself or you know in conjunction

00:16:19.689 --> 00:16:23.829
with something else so we'll take this

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:25.810
now do you want anything here we might

00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:29.019
want HP for the deal with the devil but

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:32.800
it's kind of a bit of an ask moms wig is

00:16:29.019 --> 00:16:35.949
also like the first good full item room

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:38.560
item we've had one sent for a spirit

00:16:35.949 --> 00:16:39.670
heart is a horrible deal either way

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.060
though especially because I got to fight

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:44.740
these guys like the old fashioned way I

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:51.399
think in greed mode there's like an

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:53.709
axiom you know an axiom an axiom why pay

00:16:51.399 --> 00:16:55.389
for vanilla HP unless you have to like

00:16:53.709 --> 00:16:56.649
if you if you buy an HP you should get

00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:58.389
something else out of it at the same

00:16:56.649 --> 00:17:00.759
time and we're not getting that right

00:16:58.389 --> 00:17:05.280
now so I'm gonna try to do something

00:17:00.759 --> 00:17:08.380
like that and yeah I think I mean PhD

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:10.870
not great right off the bat but I love

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:13.150
these half-price items if you reroll you

00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:14.829
run the risk of losing them so it is I

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:17.860
mean it's a risk either way cuz you know

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:20.199
we don't really want to buy Plan C to

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:22.299
get another item sight on scene but you

00:17:20.199 --> 00:17:24.069
know if the item is good we could buy

00:17:22.299 --> 00:17:26.890
Plan C and the night and we would have

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:28.659
paid 15 cents for for 14 cents and it'll

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:32.679
pop another seven cent item back onto

00:17:28.659 --> 00:17:34.090
the stack for us there so I don't even

00:17:32.679 --> 00:17:35.230
mean like a programming stack I'm

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:39.299
talking more about like a stack of

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:41.559
pancakes bet you can't eat just one

00:17:39.299 --> 00:17:45.520
actually that's the Lay's potato chip

00:17:41.559 --> 00:17:48.070
recipe that's true not recipe my I've

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:50.260
done a joke before as well like

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:53.320
not that I'm doing the greatest hits

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:57.340
tour here but but my neck is sore so

00:17:53.320 --> 00:18:00.790
please have mercy and the gist of that

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:02.800
bit was like yo you ever wonder like why

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:05.200
there's a recipe on the back of a box of

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:08.050
crackers like we're acting like I'm not

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.370
just gonna eat this alone in my

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:11.050
underwear in one sitting

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:13.660
you got like a recipe for how to use

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:14.140
Ritz crackers to make canapes not gonna

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.480
happen

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:18.100
but real talk I just bought a brand of

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.390
hot sauce it's a popular brand it's

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:22.660
called Louisiana Hot Sauce

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:24.430
I think the hot sauce is delicious maybe

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.470
not my favorite I've ever consumed but

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:29.710
but definitely like a totally

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:31.420
serviceable hot sauce but it has a

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:35.860
recipe on it that is actually even

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:40.720
sadder it says and I tweeted about it

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:43.870
but it says fiery ranch sauce what are

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:46.030
the ingredients 1 cup of ranch

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:50.770
one-and-a-half tablespoons of hot sauce

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:54.070
what's the recipe mix and stir look at

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:55.540
him like this is actually like I'm not

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:57.070
even sure it I guess I never thought

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.750
about that you can make your range spicy

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:59.110
by putting hot sauce in it how would we

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.700
do that

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:03.490
I don't know science hasn't invented

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:06.070
away yet here's the Louisiana brand hot

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:12.850
sauce corporation to save you from

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:14.440
yourself that was just like man just put

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:16.900
a picture of some buffalo wings on the

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:18.910
back or something you don't need to dam

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.290
the audience with faint praise you know

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:21.700
I was worried we were gonna get any

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:22.960
value out of that battery charge but

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:26.080
actually the Krampus fight here is

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.760
positive please be lump of coal okay and

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.380
then we're rolling like 50/50 in terms

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.600
of getting stuff we want for some stuff

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:34.150
we don't so I'm gonna try my gamble here

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:38.410
and we have pH D plus starter deck not a

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:41.170
great combination honestly should we be

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:44.560
maximum idiots sure why not let's get a

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:46.600
little baggie and then taro cloth what

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:49.960
is happening little baggie doesn't

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:53.200
override starter deck all cards are now

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.800
cards I don't know I mean it kind of did

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:58.450
it to myself

00:19:53.800 --> 00:20:00.640
dad's key is not good here but we might

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:01.940
have actually never seen it before so as

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:06.139
ridiculous as this my

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:09.769
scene the time is right for us to go

00:20:06.139 --> 00:20:10.970
pick this up it doesn't do anything for

00:20:09.769 --> 00:20:14.870
us we could use it to maybe find a

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:18.470
secret room but hmm should have probably

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:21.950
just bought the pacifier starring Vin

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:25.759
Diesel so we're gonna get out of here

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:26.990
it's a shame cuz there's oh well like

00:20:25.759 --> 00:20:29.990
it's super lucky

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:31.820
not quite super lucky we could have done

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:33.830
a lot more with our money than nothing

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:36.200
essentially but it is what it is

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:40.250
we went for a gamble and and we lost

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:43.059
life lesson in there sure okay

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:49.120
the other really really good syringe

00:20:43.059 --> 00:20:51.100
it's never one away one away from baby

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:54.169
one away

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:56.899
one away from spawn baby we don't want

00:20:54.169 --> 00:20:59.809
any of this other junk probably we did

00:20:56.899 --> 00:21:01.399
get a freaky so and that gave us cursed

00:20:59.809 --> 00:21:03.289
I I take back what I said about us

00:21:01.399 --> 00:21:07.279
batting 50 that's got to be at least 50

00:21:03.289 --> 00:21:15.590
149 now um let's check for another card

00:21:07.279 --> 00:21:19.639
the lovers garbage tears normally by

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:21.080
this point in a greedy or run you kind

00:21:19.639 --> 00:21:23.360
of got a feel for things right like you

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:25.190
you found your seam or you found where

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:27.379
your seam could be in the future I don't

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:29.090
think we're there yet I don't know that

00:21:27.379 --> 00:21:31.190
we're far off we're getting a lot of

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:33.379
battery charges I don't know where

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:34.490
they're coming from we didn't get

00:21:33.379 --> 00:21:37.129
battery baby

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:42.350
and yet the batteries just keep showing

00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:43.429
up the problem is not the waves by the

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:45.679
way like I don't think we're doing

00:21:43.429 --> 00:21:47.690
amazingly on the waves but they're not

00:21:45.679 --> 00:21:49.129
the principal concern the principal

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:51.950
concern is how the heck we're ever gonna

00:21:49.129 --> 00:21:54.080
be ultra agreed with this present setup

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:56.389
knowing that you know unless we get an

00:21:54.080 --> 00:22:00.919
extremely high influx of batteries

00:21:56.389 --> 00:22:03.769
through some unseen like benefactor like

00:22:00.919 --> 00:22:06.070
is it is it spider mod that's dropping

00:22:03.769 --> 00:22:09.420
batteries

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:09.420
I don't understand

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:17.510
you know what let's pop it I think we

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:20.370
can probably expect another charge

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:22.440
so when batteries show up you know we're

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:27.390
lucky but I think they only show up at

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:31.740
the end of a wave so love our chance is

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:35.880
necessarily she went up these enemies

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:37.410
pretty quickly though we got good stats

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.390
I wouldn't even say visa we got good

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:44.550
stats except for our HP but our HP also

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:46.280
is kind of buoying us you know because

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:51.000
it does give us the Whore of Babylon

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:54.360
payout as well also love that we have

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.070
Spider mod that was dumb I love that we

00:22:54.360 --> 00:23:01.130
got spider mods just like running around

00:22:56.070 --> 00:23:03.690
here Oh No let me out let me out please

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:06.840
doing damage where damage is to be done

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:08.700
we need a good deal here we got little

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:11.520
brim out of candy and conception so

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:14.880
that's also like a high tier familiar

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:17.040
here we don't want any of this other

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.690
junk so this is unfortunately just kind

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:22.260
of like a trip straight down to the next

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:27.330
floor where we are really really hoping

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:30.500
for good stuff because otherwise we're

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:36.630
on a tight time er safety pin pretty bad

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:40.440
but it is some HP gonna think about this

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:41.910
one umm no bombs is a bummer so let's

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:45.630
start with the obvious we probably want

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:49.950
to spend five cents to open this yeah

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:52.850
okay still I think worth it even though

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:52.850
it looks ridiculous

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:56.760
we don't care about increasing our rate

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:59.160
of fire any more then we're kind of just

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:01.290
looking for lights-out items and I don't

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.880
think that's it really wanted that to be

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:05.280
a two of diamonds we're gonna take a

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:09.480
little bit of another gamble against my

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:11.610
better judgment probably and Wow man one

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:13.980
in the same more or less we get four

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:17.640
cards out of this for seven cents ones

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:23.580
the Empress a death card the chariot The

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:25.049
Fool hmm okay to a spades pretty much

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:27.240
worthless right now and a two of

00:24:25.049 --> 00:24:29.100
diamonds extremely worth something so

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:35.490
we'll leave the death card behind save

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:37.380
half a spirit heart chariot Empress the

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:39.299
Empress is the big one here I don't

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:42.140
think we want to use it yet then we want

00:24:39.299 --> 00:24:45.690
to save that for the ultra greed fight

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:48.179
so the big damage dealer is gonna be

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:51.419
mom's knife when it hits the consistent

00:24:48.179 --> 00:24:54.240
damage dealer is gonna be a little brim

00:24:51.419 --> 00:24:56.580
we got almost like a little uh Patrick

00:24:54.240 --> 00:25:00.720
Kane Jonathan tabes dynamic going on

00:24:56.580 --> 00:25:02.280
here who's a better player you know I'd

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:05.250
love to give us some support to captain

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:06.750
Canada but it's it's Patrick Kane if you

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:11.580
could only pick one in your fantasy

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:13.770
draft you got to go with Kane however if

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:15.330
you're looking for intangibles passing

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:17.730
the eye test and leadership you might

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:19.230
consider yourself at Abe's boy I got

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:21.510
nothing against Johnny the tapes is he

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:22.260
you know maybe a little overrated Who am

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:23.940
I to say

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:26.549
he's got more Stanley Cups than I've

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:28.790
ever seen if that look this extended

00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:31.650
hockey metaphor was intended to convey

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:32.540
that mom's knife is our best damage

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:35.160
dealer

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:36.780
that being said little brim is an

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:40.220
important compliment maybe

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:40.220
almost as essential

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:44.490
[Music]

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:46.890
should have popped that earlier but so

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:50.820
be it and when we can line it up just

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:52.760
right the enemies are gonna eat it we

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:54.180
still have one more floor of

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:57.120
self-improvement here and that's

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:59.760
actually like unbelievably important

00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:01.170
right now because that means we could

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:04.260
wait two two of diamonds until next

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:06.870
floor if we want we don't want to become

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:11.460
dark Judas because we need to unlock

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:13.740
Lilith stuff unfortunately and so as

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:15.000
much as I would like like to get some of

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:18.120
this stuff like what's that two hours

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.650
not relevant Empress and then I them

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:23.010
assume any other cards are bad I'm just

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:24.360
gonna wait I'm gonna wait to spend any

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:25.650
money until we have as much money as

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:28.950
possible because it could give us three

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:30.450
or four more items as much as this

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:35.070
situation scares me a little bit

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:38.540
haha I will check this against my better

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:38.540
judgment okay

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:46.350
there's almost like a demon judgment

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.970
play $0.15 grab that but we shouldn't do

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:49.830
it yet we might want to buy this for

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:53.730
three cents but we still probably should

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:55.740
not do it yet there we go okay get the

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:58.910
first enemies popped it only gets easier

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:58.910
after the first couple of waves

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:13.140
he said willing that reality into

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:16.380
existence so the central problem is how

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:20.310
on earth are we gonna get past the floor

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:23.790
after this one this floor is fine you

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:26.340
know ones that we got twelve Incubus all

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:28.080
shooting high damage mom's knife and you

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:33.630
know several Patrick Kane's several

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:35.580
Jonathan Davis's we should leave the

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:39.330
battery charged we don't need to have

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:42.920
you know we don't need to have one extra

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:42.920
wave is what I'm trying to get at here

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:49.170
on top of everything else instead that

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:51.750
we should just ensure that we have one

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:53.760
wave to take down to the next floor and

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:55.410
if we can get something that allows us

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:58.140
to store two charges that's even better

00:27:55.410 --> 00:28:03.030
so I am very concerned about getting hit

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:06.780
here especially because a lot of these

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:10.260
enemies will do like one contact damage

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:17.270
so not to mention if we get hit by

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:17.270
anything then anything will kill us

00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:28.980
we needed that escape route no no we

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:31.169
live we died I panicked I was like we

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:33.870
lived that was bad

00:28:31.169 --> 00:28:37.529
I apologize Lilith is like my own

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:39.380
