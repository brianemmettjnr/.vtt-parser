00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.929
everybody welcome Eckener on the land

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.660
please binding my Xanterra plus we're

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.070
unstoppable unbreakable a living legend

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.809
- send me an angel and I thank you ooh

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.890
spoon bender bad damage bad rate of fire

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:20.490
bad speed bad space bar item J bmed zcj

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.600
and are you a wizard huh so this is like

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.970
hey screw it

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.070
I'm gonna stand in the room I have a

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.019
stand in the room Isaac that's how

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.970
you're going to start me I'm just going

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.350
to stand in the room patience is a

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:38.730
virtue how does this run look well it's

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.800
actually I mean spoon bender is sweet we

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.050
never should have to use spoon bender

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.800
because of the fact that we're firing so

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.020
freaking slowly that you know if we

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.579
can't aim we need to get our own spoon

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.199
Vince I don't know what that means but

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.270
there's plenty of if it's a good

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:59.609
baseline for future synergies is what

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:03.660
I'm getting at I had to test it but that

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.640
was idiotic I thought it only did a half

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.890
heart but at this point in my eyes a

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:15.630
career I should probably be aware of how

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:21.030
much image blood Rights does so the real

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:25.680
like terrible part of this run is the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.380
fact that we have awful DPS and awful

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.240
well awful damage and awful rate of fire

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.880
which means that we have awful DPS and

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.829
then our HP is not quite good enough to

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.880
compensate in case that's not abundantly

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.290
clear so really like any champion

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.850
showing up could kill us pretty quickly

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.159
and these spiders like generate

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.810
problematic situations for us but then

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.610
of course they also could just kill us

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.460
in one hit right now so we really need

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.719
to get our red heart back rooms like

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:02.310
that are just a nightmare man to be fair

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:05.820
I like absolutely 100% never should have

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.680
popped blood rights early but is this

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.690
the is this the price you pay for

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.680
experimentation is this how Liberty dies

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.200
with thunderous applause

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.700
so to be fair this is the first well as

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.230
the second Isaac run of a quarter today

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.120
were the first one after the daily and

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.800
the daily was just like unstoppably good

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.970
so it's in a way and I say this without

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.819
a hint of bravado

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.930
is nice to have and this is not very

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:36.180
good but it's nice to have a daily or a

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.980
non daily that's kind of testing our

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.890
skill because I'd recorded something

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.230
like six non daily episodes yesterday

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.940
and they were all lights out they were

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.010
so good that I almost started to feel

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.569
bad by the end of them now I feel bad

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.640
but it's for different reasons mostly

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:55.260
because my damage is 2.5 and my rate of

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:58.769
fire is 16 if you'll excuse me I'm going

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.160
to go to Skype yeah that's what I

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.440
figured

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.910
syn Victor has this one daily of the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.510
week where he scored higher than me so

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.450
he's rubbing it in on skype what a guy

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.430
class acts Invicta class sack okay this

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.930
is like this is the end of our lives

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.489
potentially whole did you see I'm not

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.980
actually bitter it's Invicta I'm just in

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.920
a my mood is down because of the fact

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.780
that I got 2.51 damage in a 16 rate of

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.870
fire my score was actually good on

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.470
today's daily you know can't complain

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:35.220
rather get 5 like top 1% finishes in a

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.410
row then old my display driver crashed

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.959
during yesterday's daily and my score

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.139
didn't go up yeah ok

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.670
I bet buddy we can you know you call me

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.470
a lot of things don't call me late for

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.000
dinner also I was born at night but it

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.040
wasn't last night also you've got to

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.120
wake up pretty early in the morning it

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:57.180
gets that one by me mister so we're

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.459
really actually in a good spot now not

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.430
long term but short term our survival is

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.569
if not guaranteed at least likely as a

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.690
result of the fact that we have

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:09.870
attempted rock all we need is a bomb or

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.690
a red heart I would accept either and

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:16.049
now three cents own it's an excel floor

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.810
so we I guess we're lucky that blood

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.690
rights didn't ruin our deal with the

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.550
devil chance it's kind of relatively

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.720
minor right now because I don't know if

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.540
we're ever going to get a chance to take

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.120
advantage of that

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.630
even if we do get it our HP is low

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.400
enough to make this pretty dicey I was

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.950
just about to say I don't really want to

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.270
fight the devil or fight the bosses

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.550
right now to try to get that deal with

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.140
the devil because if we fight a champion

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:46.840
version of Ragman we might as well just

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:48.850
you know alt f4 we will we will die it's

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.070
almost impossible to kill them and in

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:54.160
that amount of time now that we have one

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.440
spirit heart kind of feel like we should

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.000
explore a little bit more still if it

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.080
had been small rock I mean I would add

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.880
to think about it cuz it's always a

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.620
speed downgrade I've been misinformed

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.090
and people have told me oh it's not

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.470
always a speed downgrades just a speed

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:10.150
downgrade if your speeds been modified

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:12.490
apparently that's incorrect that is

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.680
helpful and now we can use a key to

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.100
maybe get to the shop and the shop could

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.830
provide us with another spear at hard

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.530
leach is actually okay first off it

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.120
fuels up blood Rights a little bit

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.800
secondly it's another source of damage

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.880
which at least is like it's something I

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.040
don't really want to use a bomb to get

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.170
to sense we can do better than that on

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.270
our if we just blow up our donation

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:40.720
machine I'd rather just blow this up for

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:43.330
ya more ROG P is probably just about the

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.830
best we could get right now so I mean I

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:49.180
think we've done pretty well on this

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:51.040
floor honestly this would be a great

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.910
time for the deal with the devil to

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:57.370
provide us with something amazing and I

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:02.200
say that not to be bitter or you know

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:05.830
entitled but look at the run the stats

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:08.110
are there's like a matrix you know and

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.680
I'm not talking about the Wachowski 's

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:14.590
film from 1999 saying you know from a

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:18.520
linear algebra standpoint it's like a

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:21.340
three three by two matrix on the the the

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.660
one side of the matrix is acceptable or

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:27.940
terrible and on the other side of the

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:32.920
matrix of the three stats that matter HP

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:35.920
tears and damage we have basically

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.050
gotten four of those matrix positions to

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.150
look like garbage

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.800
sad tears I don't know anything about

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.600
linear algebra well I know something

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.580
about it but it's been a while we got

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.720
bad tears we got bad damage our HP is

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.340
not great and then you know there's a

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.340
little addendum to the matrix it's like

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:52.380
the Animatrix and it's our speed and our

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.730
speeds now look at that hot either taken

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.360
us this long to kill monstro is a

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:59.550
terrible sign just a terrible sign so if

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.870
you could give me like really the only

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.760
thing that's transformative here is

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:07.400
magic much but I'll take any any

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:12.900
conceivable DP DPS upgrade these like

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:13.500
water to a dying man in the desert hook

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.960
me up

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.760
alright HP which we might not have even

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:23.070
wanted to take at least we're fighting

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:26.430
Larry jr. how we didn't get hit there is

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:27.390
like a miracle beyond human

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.940
comprehension

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.830
okay that's we deserved that one and the

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:34.680
leech is going to town it's like Brian

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:36.360
Leetch number two you know former right

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.030
defenseman for the New York Rangers and

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:43.650
then also Toronto Maple Leafs more HP

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:45.390
and book of sin Wow what what a world

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:46.980
well you know what I in a stick with

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:50.150
blood rides at least we got Lucky Penny

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:53.010
but I'm going to stick with blood rights

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:56.190
because I desperately need the damage

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:59.790
does blood rights take red hearts or

00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:04.110
does it take spirit hearts because if it

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:09.720
takes red hearts we actually can use

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:11.610
this now I'm not suggesting by any

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:14.190
stretch of the imagination that this is

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:18.540
going to be a worthwhile endeavor for us

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:20.730
however you got to admit it's kind of

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:23.640
making me a believer right now you know

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:25.470
being able to use this once on rooms

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.060
that are pretty bad come on come on

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:30.410
leach yeah I want leach to get the hit

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.410
so that we can use blood rights later

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:38.120
he's got he's got it what did I tell you

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:42.180
he's got it um this could actually like

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:45.410
work for us it's just stupid enough to

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.410
work leech you got it buddy

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:58.180
thanks to the unlimited HP he's done it

00:08:55.020 --> 00:09:00.430
this is actually great is this the run

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:04.030
where I I wonder if I'm living in some

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:08.980
kind of fantasy world because I'm

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:11.320
actually like pro blood rights I'm not

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:16.000
suggesting necessarily that this is long

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:18.970
term but this is a strategy that's

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.640
viable in the long term for certain I

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:23.560
would have to be oh thanks putting that

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:27.220
stuff over there I was worried that I

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:30.970
was going to be able to get it I don't

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:36.340
think that my survival is to likely in

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:41.950
the long term however blood rice is

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:42.760
doing great stuff for us right now how

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.520
long do you think it's going to take

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:50.500
leech to kill that mushroom our shot

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:52.620
speed is also bad like I it's not a stat

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.970
that matters at all

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:57.070
this one goes out to everybody who is

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:59.260
probably being like wow this runs like

00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:05.950
overpowered look at how much damage he's

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:10.200
doing leech you got this buddy I'll help

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:10.200
out but you got to get the kill let's go

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:21.520
what a strange run like this is actually

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:25.590
the strangest run taro only seeded up a

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:29.470
crappy run whoa the strangest run

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:33.940
despite its bad stats it's kind of fun

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:37.660
whoa the strangest run then I've got

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:43.330
that damaged you hemming and his tears

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:43.750
are also bad minutes a stranger's cat

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:47.500
ever

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:51.940
Oh the strangest run okay we don't want

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:55.120
I mean we I'm I use the devil card when

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:57.880
I meant to just hit WASD so I think here

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.980
we want this to

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:05.830
love the boss's life and hey man there's

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:13.540
a little chariot so straight up

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:19.780
give me the placenta item leech get in

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:23.410
your body want the placenta item because

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:24.640
it gives us some life steel we also

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.560
earned a deal with the devil

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:28.570
no cranberry nose please I almost

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.590
cringed in myself just saying that but

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:33.010
it kind of you know I'm a little

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:34.870
distracted on this run right now by its

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:36.580
badness so we're going to head down to

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:38.790
the next floor yeah there's a curse room

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:41.650
what about it what we're going to do is

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:44.050
use our orbital to deal all of our

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:45.580
damage that bloody loss doesn't do to

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:47.440
begin with not bloody less blood right

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.150
bloody lusts will be like something that

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.770
could help us get more than 2.5 damage

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:53.830
at this point that's ridiculous what do

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:56.320
we need that for it well you need your

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:58.720
handheld you need more than a 16 rate of

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.130
fire what's wrong with you

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:08.560
leach this is your time to shine these

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:10.150
guys are not that strong but also like

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.070
there's only so much time in a day you

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:18.040
know I don't really want to use red

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:20.770
hearts to play the blood bank because I

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:24.550
need those red hearts for later you know

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:27.190
what I love about this though is at some

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:29.290
point we might if we play our cards

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:31.180
right hit a breaking point that's

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:34.450
actually good I know breaking points are

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:35.680
usually bad but we might hit a breaking

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:38.110
point that's actually good and all I

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.970
mean by that is use blood rights to put

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:42.580
yourself at a half heart interval then

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:44.140
you get HP back well 9 HP back so you

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:47.500
get invincibility then you use your

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:49.150
invincibility to use the orbital to deal

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.590
damage to enemies and then a hopefully

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:52.240
leech gets in there it gives you some HP

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:56.250
back to repeat the process in the

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:59.200
meantime no guarantees obviously but I

00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:00.450
mean have you seen this run I'll take

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.950
what I can get at this point

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:07.100
leech leech okay well you know

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:11.899
again a man's got to know his

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:13.850
limitations with one bomb we can't

00:13:11.899 --> 00:13:14.329
really justify that unfortunately all

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:16.550
right

00:13:14.329 --> 00:13:20.889
fourth time's a charm an item room that

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:25.160
improves our stats we've had glaucoma

00:13:20.889 --> 00:13:26.630
strange attractor I don't even remember

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.220
did we go to the item room on the last

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:29.000
floor I'd have been sold mine flooded I

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:33.589
just gave up

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.680
so dr. fetus is is a help helpful item

00:13:33.589 --> 00:13:39.730
here admittedly we will probably be able

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:44.290
to destroy enemies now and if you are

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:48.350
displeased by this revelation like

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:51.170
basically screw you I earned it on this

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:54.860
run the fact that we not only lived but

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:57.560
almost thrive on those first three

00:13:54.860 --> 00:14:07.399
floors is incredible not like you know

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:09.680
it's a miracle but it's miraculous most

00:14:07.399 --> 00:14:11.420
of you've got like leech and blood

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.740
rights to think I'm still happy to have

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:15.250
blood rights by the way if we can get a

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:16.940
more consistent way to regenerate HP I'm

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:20.690
all for it

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:23.959
dr. fetus is no longer like an easy 100

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:26.269
percent game-winning item dude this is

00:14:23.959 --> 00:14:30.860
it this is actually how we use blood

00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:32.690
rights consistently I'm kind of jazz so

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:36.170
jazzed I'm using terminology that hasn't

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:38.660
been popular since like the 1940s but

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:41.510
I'm kind of jazzed because we should be

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:43.940
able to turn this into a pretty amazing

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:47.290
blood right showcase here an

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:47.290
extravaganza if you will

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:56.050
luckily we have like a great backup

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:59.800
means of dealing damage right now as

00:14:56.050 --> 00:15:04.780
well which is uh didn't always look that

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:07.630
way so somehow we're also probably going

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:13.120
to have a chance oh come on we're going

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:15.540
to have a chance to make the boss rush

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.540
here

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:20.110
I'm not going to prioritize it because

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.430
that would by you know what let's per

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:25.660
throat see if we get something better

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:27.820
and I like having blood rides right now

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:31.270
I think that this is a novel enough

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:32.740
concept despite the fact that it's been

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:36.100
in the game for twenty five million

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:39.100
years I have never really deigned to use

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:41.290
blood rights effectively I always just

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:43.420
get it and then go as kind of garbage

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:47.320
this is the situation in which blood

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:49.750
rights is actually like meaningful for

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:52.840
me right now and I'm excited as a result

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:56.070
of it it doesn't happen to too frequent

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.070
let's go

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.590
several runes that's a great blood

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:02.020
rights opportunity and even think about

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:03.430
it might as well to of heart says we're

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.470
going to take something else here so we

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:07.510
got pacano

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:10.240
got Yarra you got algae's we got perthro

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:12.790
we got algae's so we take yera but it's

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:16.810
kind of close so we are definitely not

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:18.070
going to go to boss rush I know like ten

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:20.140
seconds ago I was like that's a

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:21.880
guarantee or not a guarantee but the

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.650
possibility it's not going to happen

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:25.420
here

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:26.860
we got three hearts just keep an eye on

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.360
your hearts and you should be fine we

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:31.720
might have two and a half now I don't

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:33.190
know so don't use this anymore you've

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:36.180
done your part curse of the unknown

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:36.180
pretty much screws us

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:44.290
Stars wheel of fortune I think we're

00:16:41.499 --> 00:16:47.980
just gonna I mean yes I like having a

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:50.439
yellow room this run is thrown my normal

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:51.999
you know valuations into into a tizzy

00:16:50.439 --> 00:16:55.120
though how low does our shots we get if

00:16:51.999 --> 00:16:57.720
we take lazy were in danger of actually

00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:01.899
hitting ourselves with our own bombs

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:03.550
from a standing position it's pretty

00:17:01.899 --> 00:17:05.589
horrible speaking of pretty horrible

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:11.500
robo-baby 2.0 just knocking it out of

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:16.059
the park with the item rooms here oh man

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:18.819
this is uh it's amazing to me and I

00:17:16.059 --> 00:17:20.500
really should not complain and instead

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:23.709
should just be grateful but it is

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:25.900
amazing to me that we're on the Deaf's

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:28.000
one we have two point five damage the

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:30.340
forty two rate of fire is misleading but

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.659
you know if you want to if you want to

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:35.230
include that in the narrative to

00:17:31.659 --> 00:17:38.110
strengthen it that's fine to be at forty

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:41.770
two rate of fire and two point five

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:46.419
damage this late in the game is is not

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:51.750
common that is that's an extreme example

00:17:46.419 --> 00:17:51.750
of the game giving you a bad seed

00:17:52.799 --> 00:17:58.929
however we're at full HP we're

00:17:56.230 --> 00:18:00.880
persevering here and again I would love

00:17:58.929 --> 00:18:03.340
to be like oh it's just my singular good

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:06.340
play that's keeping us afloat here I'm

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:10.419
not saying we played badly I don't think

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:12.210
we have however it's largely and by

00:18:10.419 --> 00:18:15.820
largely I mean like a hundred percent

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:21.039
blood rights that has that's kept the

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:23.799
dream alive here yeah we're not leaving

00:18:21.039 --> 00:18:25.409
this this place on schedule so don't

00:18:23.799 --> 00:18:29.200
even sweat it

00:18:25.409 --> 00:18:33.190
karma devil era let's see what we got

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:34.690
for our boss fight the two blinded opens

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:39.250
or is it like blighted ovum plus

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:41.049
something else kind of amazed we managed

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:43.320
to make it out of there without getting

00:18:41.049 --> 00:18:43.320
tagged

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:52.870
you got this you got this you got I need

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:57.760
that HP buddy

00:18:52.870 --> 00:19:03.080
well careful what you wish for oh I

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:03.790
don't really want to explore can you

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:07.880
blame me

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:09.500
we got 0.01 speed negative 15 damage

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.830
it's not that I want to get through the

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:14.800
game particularly quickly it's just like

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:22.130
backtracking the run like this is like

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:25.850
more than mildly tedious but if nothing

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:31.610
else we have definitely and all steals

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:32.720
graver we've definitely by the way I

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:35.000
mean I know I'm interrupting myself

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:38.120
constantly here but if you really wanted

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.160
to be the greatest pedantic min/max er

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:43.280
of all time I guess you take balls of

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:45.020
steel out of the room drop it then go

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.670
back in for the era rune and then you

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:49.190
lose like a spirit hour and a half in

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:52.190
the process but gain two spirit arts Wow

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:54.830
the man's ingenuity knows no bounds but

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:56.780
I mean that is the right play but I just

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:59.390
can't bring myself to to care that much

00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:03.370
about minutiae on that level but again

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:03.370
more power to you it is the right play

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.940
I'm going to leave this run one way or

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:15.890
the other with a newfound appreciation

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:19.280
sincerely for for blood rights this is

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:21.740
an item that perhaps unfairly I have

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:24.110
criticized as being largely useless and

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:26.390
I think it's highly situational but I

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:28.250
have never really respected or at least

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:31.310
seen firsthand the situation in which it

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:34.460
makes itself useful Judas's tongue may

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:38.150
actually be better for us what a

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:41.450
topsy-turvy run i genuinely think that a

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:43.580
v reduction in tier delay means less

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:45.500
than Judas's tongue here we've hit a run

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:47.930
in which the cancer trinket is not as

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:50.000
good as Judas's tongue just in case you

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:53.750
were wondering what kind of upside-down

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.980
world you woke up in this morning the

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:56.360
other problem with blood rides is it's

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:58.860
not I don't know if it scales with our

00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:01.110
damage but it's not killing enemies

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:03.420
as consistently as it used to we will

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:04.830
take poke a comb it's nothing no wrong

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.420
with that donate a little bit of money

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:10.170
we are on the last floor with the shop

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:13.710
so we can eke out some cosmic karma it's

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:15.960
good tower justice card ace of clubs

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:23.010
we don't need bombs necessarily because

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:26.400
we have well infinity of them so there

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:27.840
is a star's card back in the back in the

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:35.430
rotation somewhere so I guess we'll just

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:36.780
go to the boss fight and then we'll walk

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:39.480
back because if we're going to walk back

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:45.120
anyway then who cares if you walk back

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:48.540
now we're a little later right on tanky

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:54.600
enemies my favorite Toni Braxton's song

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:59.880
still dying relatively easily I don't

00:21:54.600 --> 00:22:02.190
want round cap come on now look little

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.570
ridiculous why did Toni Braxton and Eric

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:05.940
Clapton never do a collaboration

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:09.930
together they couldn't call it tun Eric

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:11.450
Braxton would have worked gangbusters

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:17.790
what's their problem

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:19.470
pop stars card still like pretty bad but

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:21.000
you know this is a run in which we're

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:23.040
learning a bit about some items that

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.480
otherwise I've considered not that

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:28.940
amazing sure let's uh let's go for broke

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:32.070
man

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:34.200
never well I am prospective punching bag

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:36.990
on occasion but most of the time I don't

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:38.520
like that it draws aggro because I want

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:40.530
my enemies to be predictable and this

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:42.780
doesn't always happen with punching bag

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:44.480
we already have yerin you can tiara Yara

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:48.780
so we're pretty much good to go here

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:49.740
this is sin I will not like if there's a

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.840
deal with the devil that gives us

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:53.010
something amazing I'm taking it it's not

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.980
like I'm going to be like let's commit

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:57.240
to this stupid no damage run and not

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.650
take brimstone or something like that

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:01.160
not that brimstone the damage up to

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:05.880
begin with this you get the idea but

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:08.580
right now this could conceivably be like

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.309
the actual lowest damage I've ever had

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:14.830
on a run

00:23:09.309 --> 00:23:19.029
Wynn's that's frightening and kind of

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:22.210
hilarious like even so we're building it

00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:25.690
just goes to show you like how good the

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:28.559
design of Isaac is because we're going

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:35.200
to build a run that actually benefits

00:23:28.559 --> 00:23:36.879
from our stupid scenario right now it

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.950
takes one full heart does that mean it

00:23:36.879 --> 00:23:40.149
takes two hearts now we should maybe try

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:44.009
to find out that good

00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:44.009
I could put a monkey wrench into things

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:50.230
because camión conception gives us more

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:54.800
didn't get killed by one bomb that's a

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:58.220
problem but can being conception gives

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:59.900
us more familiars after we could hit X

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.610
number of times well it's an awkward way

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:04.670
to explain it basically it gives us free

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:06.080
familiars that only become active once

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:08.450
we get hit a certain number of times so

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.070
we are at two and a half parts that's

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:11.180
where we want to be shouldn't take those

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:12.770
because the health downgrade could be

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:15.550
like catastrophic let's see one heart

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:19.420
please it only takes one heart so we can

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:22.700
make candy and conception happen here

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:24.590
probably a lot and came being conception

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.660
could give us succubus it could give us

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:27.860
Incubus it could give us a lot of ways I

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:29.030
mean it could obviously give us the

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.320
songs that remind us of the good times

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:33.830
and the songs that remind us are the

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:35.930
best times but mostly it can give us

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:37.780
things that allow us to kill enemies

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:40.790
without dealing more damage which is

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:47.020
idiotic and hilarious and like exactly

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:47.020
what this run needs to reach peak idiocy

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:52.720
felt like a secret room was a secret

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:56.140
room

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:57.940
of course we are in potential permanent

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:59.410
Polaroid invincibility territory as well

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:03.190
which is what I'm trying to take

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:04.270
advantage of here on occasion trying to

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:06.370
keep an eye out I wish gave me

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:08.710
conception when like glare when you got

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:09.610
a familiar but it doesn't so we have to

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:14.890
pay attention to that

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:16.420
ou have to pay attention to my job this

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:23.380
is my impression of a baby boomers

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:27.400
impression of Millennials see it's a

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:30.670
little meta magician on Seuss might as

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:34.440
well hold the era there is a naive hope

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:40.810
that at some point we'll be able to get

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:43.150
you know a damage upgrade if I'm being a

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:45.130
hundred percent honest I think we

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:47.310
probably would be in a good position on

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:50.620
this run even if we didn't get dr. fetus

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:52.570
dr. fetus is and don't get me wrong I'm

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:54.610
a huge fan of it right now it's helping

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:58.990
out a great deal it's making my life

00:25:54.610 --> 00:26:02.880
easier however I think we totally still

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:05.800
would have been okay just by cleverly

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:10.710
quote-on-quote at least trying to use

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:10.710
blood rights here it's it's working

00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:19.779
especially considering we you know we

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:24.429
have the leech and little Chad helping

00:26:19.779 --> 00:26:26.440
us out as well in my headcanon little

00:26:24.429 --> 00:26:28.679
Chad by the way is Chad Kensington from

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:33.480
the Friday the 13th video games so you

00:26:28.679 --> 00:26:33.480
know just draw your fan fictions of that

00:26:36.539 --> 00:26:41.830
okay little little risky little risky

00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:44.049
this should do it we're good

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:48.759
we did get it the old devil we got more

00:26:44.049 --> 00:26:51.250
HP that's extremely important what

00:26:48.759 --> 00:26:53.950
happens if you take mom's knife with the

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:55.389
bombs you just have a knife and then

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:56.710
also every time you press the button

00:26:55.389 --> 00:26:59.440
your knife moves out a little bit and

00:26:56.710 --> 00:27:01.419
then you shoot some bombs is exactly

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:03.490
what happens this isn't even that useful

00:27:01.419 --> 00:27:05.289
but at least when we get invincibility

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:10.600
we can poke enemies with the pointy end

00:27:05.289 --> 00:27:13.210
and mess them up pretty good right all

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:14.710
right I actually like this is the

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:16.690
strangest mom's knife but you might be

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:18.519
like Oh mom's knives like this run's

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:21.000
foregone conclusion you're going to win

00:27:18.519 --> 00:27:23.649
now it is but for different reasons I

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:27.490
feel so weird complaining about this run

00:27:23.649 --> 00:27:30.610
because it's actually not impossible for

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:35.440
us to lose but like pretty unlikely that

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:39.429
we lose the real reason for that is not

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:42.669
mom's knife it's not dr. fetus it's

00:27:39.429 --> 00:27:47.080
blood rice and little Chad Kay I don't

00:27:42.669 --> 00:27:55.330
know how it's working out this way I

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:57.460
never asked for this but I think I was I

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:59.919
was the proper steward for this run

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:08.620
because I will embrace the absurdity of

00:27:59.919 --> 00:28:10.860
a womb 22.5 damage run I was forged in

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:13.090
the fire so I'm not gonna act like

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:15.100
typically my runs are bad you know

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:21.129
there's a concept of northernlion luck

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:22.570
for a reason but 2.5 damage oh that's

00:28:21.129 --> 00:28:24.250
not bad you must have a soy milk or

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:25.960
something right 2.5 damage is really

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:26.770
good for soymilk actually my rate of

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:31.420
fire is 40

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:32.890
to who well you must have mom's knife in

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:34.630
dr. fetus and two of the items that

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:36.550
don't really require that much damage

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:38.320
from a statistical standpoint to really

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:40.570
do good things for you well you do have

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.860
me there admittedly I mean I have me

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:43.390
there because I came up with them but

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:47.640
you get the idea okay

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:50.230
I don't think we've gotten anything yet

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:51.640
from Kane being conception you know what

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:54.460
would be the big came being conception

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:56.350
drop first off this is actually

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:58.570
incredible because now with

00:28:56.350 --> 00:29:06.390
invincibility we can also generate black

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:08.530
hearts how many'd our cards dude but

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:11.230
what I was going to say that dark bomb

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:12.670
is like a really really good well maybe

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:14.320
not actually because we want to take all

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:15.700
of our red hearts disregard that dark

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:17.260
bombs terrible you know we're in the

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:19.720
topsy-turvy world where Judas is tongue

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:25.540
is the most valuable of all possible

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:29.560
trinkets yeah we want both of those we

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:32.740
want invincibility and we want to walk

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:35.820
into mom right away should have thrown

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:35.820
some more bombs down there

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:48.330
our speed is so bad dude no we're not

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:49.740
don't don't be an idiot

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:53.910
I'm not going that way we don't need

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:55.470
Guppies frickin hairball we're going up

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:58.470
to the Cathedral but I needed the black

00:29:55.470 --> 00:30:03.330
heart in the process what the heck is

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:04.970
this run i oh we got Incubus by the way

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:08.640
now I just noticed

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:10.350
luckily Incubus does not shoot out bombs

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.520
or we would be in a rough spot but

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:12.870
unfortunately doesn't really shoot out

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:15.390
much of anything except for a knife that

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:16.800
doesn't go anywhere so maybe for

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:18.270
invincibility purposes there's help

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.800
there by the way I hope that you know if

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:23.340
you've watched enough episodes of mine

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:27.510
you know I'm not the person that is you

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:28.950
know tempted to exaggerate for comedic

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:30.570
effect well that's not true i

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:36.059
exaggerated but I don't go you know like

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:39.450
whoa this run is crazy when it's like

00:30:36.059 --> 00:30:41.850
you know spinning mom's nice what ten

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:43.410
out of ten best run ever

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:49.260
you know I at least I don't do that

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:51.480
anymore people like my mind our sense of

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:57.240
jaded miss who's the certain proportion

00:30:51.480 --> 00:31:02.250
of them so if I'm acting like the run is

00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:03.179
a wild time it's because I truly okay

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:06.390
stop

00:31:03.179 --> 00:31:09.780
it's because I truly believe it and I

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:13.530
think this is okay okay okay

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:15.750
I think this run is genuinely in

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:18.650
contention for like one of the strangest

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:18.650
runs I've ever had

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:30.210
we're almost in like a RI p territory

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:33.450
here so we got to just ease up play a

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:36.030
little better like this could be a huge

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:38.130
boon or or could kill you dead good

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:39.600
could actually kill you dead as well the

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:41.010
other thing I suppose we're on the

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.850
cathedral so that's a free deal with the

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:47.850
angel item lockdown not really

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:50.429
interested full red heart very

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:52.420
interested and we want to use it outside

00:31:50.429 --> 00:31:56.500
just to make sure it's an angel item and

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:58.300
scapula and scapular is potentially

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:59.980
really really valuable to always

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.330
generate a spirit heart for us but we

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:04.350
got to be at a half heart interval to

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:07.480
make it happen so it's lockdown lockdown

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:11.920
pheromones hold the era obviously we

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:17.200
want blood rights I think you just fight

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:24.610
it with with dr. fetus this should take

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:27.400
approximately ten human lifetimes use

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:30.010
blood rights once the reason there is so

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:33.670
we can get lifesteal out of Leach if it

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:35.800
ever finds enemies so I'm trying to like

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:38.820
I can't really get close because I can't

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.820
back away quickly

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:50.650
those are spirit heart if we can just

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:53.920
get Leach to to understand that there is

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:57.840
an enemy here in the form of our boss we

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:57.840
got no problems or less problems

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:06.990
I just want to get a half heart a half

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:12.970
heart allows us to have invincibility

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:14.830
which allows us to use our knife which

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:22.300
allows me to have a chance to get the

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:31.480
kill here which enemy are you aggro to

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:34.800
buddy Oh little dicey my favorite

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.800
Yahtzee based rapper

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:47.039
this run is actually I mean it's no joke

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:51.450
two floors ago I was likely just press

00:33:47.039 --> 00:33:54.809
the spacebar only win strange run has

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:58.230
gotten stranger you're bundled up now

00:33:54.809 --> 00:34:02.130
watching The Lone Ranger starring Johnny

00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:05.779
Depp and Armie Hammer dude mom named

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:09.089
them after baking soda okay grab this

00:34:05.779 --> 00:34:12.079
let's head down here we got the arrow

00:34:09.089 --> 00:34:23.899
rune and we this is our chance to get

00:34:12.079 --> 00:34:29.010
one damage upgrade lemon mishap okay

00:34:23.899 --> 00:34:31.169
crickets body we really got to be

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:34.169
careful of that but it's not necessarily

00:34:31.169 --> 00:34:37.429
bad ecoli with invincibility has great

00:34:34.169 --> 00:34:39.869
chances for success speed up is so huge

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:43.020
Celtic Cross occasional invincibility

00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:50.119
juices sack mom's bottle of pills given

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:52.760
us a Tears downgrade and teleporter so

00:34:50.119 --> 00:34:59.030
this is how Liberty dies

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:59.030
thunderous applause let's go

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:12.200
what do you do I think you just shoot

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:12.200
bombs and hope for the best

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:24.960
oh oh I don't know I think that was like

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:28.339
Incubus mom's knife did like all the

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.339
work for us there this is going to hurt

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:33.810
I'm amazed we only got hit once I think

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:35.460
that's a huge get for us to a hearts

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:38.000
please chaos

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:38.000
card

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:49.440
I don't care you till last this is

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:52.290
probably for the best but it's not like

00:35:49.440 --> 00:36:02.660
we need a second virus the pill can save

00:35:52.290 --> 00:36:05.550
us cool chaos cards what in the world

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:07.770
now I recognize I'm not using blood

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:09.630
rides much anymore our red hearts are

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:12.450
just too valuable what is this guy give

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:15.089
us wisdom bombs at this point Bob's

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:17.460
curse plus five poison bumps a waz rune

00:36:15.089 --> 00:36:19.050
wheel of fortune that's a free item dude

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:21.000
we should have played it to try to get a

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:22.890
spirit heart that we got chemical peel

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.550
it's a damage upgrade but it didn't give

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:30.930
us a damage upgrade until this is

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:32.760
Christmas what is I mean how many times

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:36.980
you say the same expression but like

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.980
seriously what a strange run

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:47.290
crickets body was definitely like the

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:54.450
biggest coup that we got on this whole

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:56.590
run and even then I'm not completely

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:57.670
convinced that it's exclusively done

00:36:56.590 --> 00:37:01.560
good stuff for us

00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:04.120
we could always chaos one of these guys

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:06.430
doesn't seem like the right play what we

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:08.350
do is we wait until well we have the

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:11.500
luxury at least we wait until they get

00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:16.630
to payouts from little Chad Kensington

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:17.890
and then we pick up both of them or we

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:24.730
just take a full heart if it drops

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:27.390
that's also fine a third chaos card you

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:27.390
got to be kidding me

00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:35.140
the thing is I recognize this the virus

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:41.190
is actually sweet for us potentially

00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:41.190
giving us black hearts we could use that

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:47.830
like Matthew McConaughey tells Christian

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:55.870
Bale at the climax of the 2002 film rain

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:57.430
of fire Quinn use it when an enemy runs

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:59.110
through Incubus and just gives it blown

00:37:57.430 --> 00:38:01.720
out by the little tiny knife it's a

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:06.370
dream come true however I don't want to

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:09.640
give it the chance to fail because like

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:12.420
one heart is worth the entire planet of

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:12.420
Earth to us

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:25.220
I also have to point out were it not for

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:28.760
dr. fetus this run would have taken us

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:32.720
98 years one year for every degree of 98

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:34.520
degrees to defeat we would not be here

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:43.010
at 35 minutes you might be here at 35

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:45.110
hours I can't say no to Book of Shadows

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:49.610
but I can't leave this room without

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:50.690
having bloody blood rights bloody blood

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:53.630
rights you're familiar with that of

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:55.790
course so what I'm doing is using Book

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:57.830
of Shadows like once to get through a

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:59.510
room I'm not a huge fan of in the hopes

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:01.520
that it pays out with the demon heart

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:02.690
which it didn't pay doubt mr. mega and

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.680
you know what we can do it again I you

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:05.540
don't even need to tell me it's another

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:08.860
chaos card I'm aware that's a chaos card

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:08.860
it's always a chaos card now

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:26.349
it never ends dude mr. Megan it's the

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:28.000
saving grace we're going to win it's

00:39:26.349 --> 00:39:29.470
probably looked like that the writing's

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.030
been on the wall for a while but we're

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:34.510
like actually going to win

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:40.000
what does stupid run this is hilarious

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:42.220
all right well we made it out with

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.720
starting damage and a rate of fire four

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:45.609
times worse than our starting damage a

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:49.299
little misleading there all admit I'm

00:39:45.609 --> 00:39:51.069
sorry of blood rights but goodbye this

00:39:49.299 --> 00:39:53.230
was your you still get the star of the

00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:55.210
show here there's no question but my god

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:56.230

now thanks for watching if you enjoyed
