00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.040
hey everybody welcome back northernlion

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.140
The Binding of - contra Plus last round

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.190
was good nothing wrong with it

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.719
beat mega Satan had an overall good time

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.790
good play I mean I'm saying good a lot

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:20.100
here but this is like the most average

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:23.640
run ever TW gq7 a VF good speed good

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.939
rate of fire good damage good luck good

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.910
HP this is like the most I don't want to

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:34.130
say average necessarily because that uh

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:38.430
dude daddy-longlegs is a great get from

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.469
this even payout here but anyway the the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.270
main problem with this is that it's just

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.379
highly unremarkable at the present

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.030
moment and the shade our little hush

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.250
sorry two different items that are both

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.020
about the same level of uselessness oh

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.829
it's an excel floor through so it got to

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.670
be a little cautious although we did

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.940
just get our spirit hard so we we don't

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.960
really have big plays yet on this room

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.790
we don't have anything that really takes

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.979
us to the limit here but we should go

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.770
zero to sixty pretty quickly I'm due for

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.299
a good angel right it's not a good angel

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.299
run sorry a good devil run because we

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.310
just had that run where we tried to make

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.630
angel deals pop and largely it

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.689
disappointed me as you would expect

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:27.450
probably we could get the wafer we did

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.369
get blinding light or Holy Light guiding

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.960
light by television great song great

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.460
album greatest the cereal probably

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.619
frosted flakes couldn't see that one

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.960
coming okay stand over here please thank

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:45.840
you I'm just messing around with little

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.790
hoshi at this point well we did get it

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.000
fully charged okay so let's see first

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.689
boss is Larry Jay Larry Jay sorta gets

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.049
crapped on I think we should just use

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.369
little hush whenever possible and treat

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.560
that as if it's piercing shots or

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.740
something he just got dusted to the nth

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.740
degree

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.129
we're being like way too fiddly with

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.450
Anatomy we fought a million times before

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.300
and we're going to take damage as a

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.560
result again probably but let's go we're

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:24.140
done now we'll just pop this against him

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.849
wait what did he kill my enemies already

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.370
no that was a 12 room charge dude that's

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.540
not cool it's like I had Larry juniors

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.739
and now they're gone they're just

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.580
sitting up here at the top of the room

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.370
doing nothing

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:40.170
the Emperor's card is at least a good

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:45.120
get for us but I am I'm eager to if

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:47.970
possible pick up a big W here and by W I

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.090
mean wide brimstone laser that's what it

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.879
stands for in my world I'm ready for

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.340
massive DPS we never quite got that on

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.920
the last run pentagram is lovely thanks

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.739
for the nice damage boost sac dagger is

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.390
actually very very acceptable I quite

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.739
like this item and you know if you hate

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.750
watching me use orbitals to deal damage

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.519
you are going to just be in your own

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.970
personal hell for the next little bit

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:15.260
because we slightly above average damage

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.660
although I'm very thankful for it and

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:22.380
average rate of fire I just hit my hand

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.970
on the desk surprisingly painful but

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.430
with with our stands being as they are

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.440
I'm going to be using my orbital

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.299
probably to my own detriment but also

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.950
because if I don't you know I'm going to

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:37.440
lose my mind up in here up in here I'm

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:42.209
almost tempted to take thirty touch and

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:45.630
I mean that sincerely I really feel like

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.609
I don't know what to call the item

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.989
because there's already like a little

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:53.340
delirium well it's almost nicer to not

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.910
have a choice so I don't feel the need

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:02.730
to re-roll but on our present space bar

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:05.549
item kind of annoys me by being a really

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.900
large charge I feel like you could do

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.880
this with six rooms and it wouldn't be

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.150
that big of a deal like I mean I don't

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.799
want to burst your bubble but one spirit

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.859
heart or demon heart every six rooms is

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.989
way more valuable than having a boss

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.000
spawn now the boss spawning

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.479
cooler which is why I want to see it

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.340
more often but as you can see from our

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.530
monstro fight sometimes it's just going

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.780
to do nothing apparently

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.699
puberty still scares me when the dude is

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.349
like you know he flinches when you take

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.410
the pill we're lucky they don't have

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:40.199
contact damage but then you know puberty

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.240
is actually quite a good pill 1/3 of an

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.220
HP upgrade and it identifies a pill in

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.889
the rotation as a not bad pill which is

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:50.630
worth something so we're gonna go back

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.630
and try to get a reroll out of this

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.840
because I really feel if you get a

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:58.259
reroll machine you might only get one or

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:02.639
two per run on on item rooms you should

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:04.710
go for broke and not worth it I would

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.569
replace our existing space bar item with

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.940
a better space bar bloody lust is what

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:13.590
you think though that's no-brainer

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:15.360
okay plus we look like actually straight

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.360
out of an 80s aerobic commercial I don't

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.159
know about the bandana oh you are an

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.710
actual idiot I don't know about the

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:24.630
bandana over top of the you know I Dream

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.659
of Jeannie ponytail going on right there

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:30.570
but you know I'm not big into the

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:32.370
quaffed arts so I can't tell you whether

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:38.370
or not that's a sensible choice all I do

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:44.070
is you know I know what I know probably

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:45.930
a little overkill here but I what am I

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.729
taking damage oh that was that was creep

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.280
I can accept that I was in the wrong on

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:54.060
that one I don't like that we got all

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.949
these friendly explode E's here man it

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.050
scares me actually so I'm going to go

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:01.699
for the the easy way out I'm going to go

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:04.080
for the extra damage right off the bat

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:05.580
they actually worked out very nicely for

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.630
me we took the damage but we also went

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.639
into our curse room I was hoping to get

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.620
a spirit heart but you know getting some

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:12.319
bloody lust bonus out of that is fine by

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.569
itself

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:18.630
just be careful um you should have

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:20.280
relatively no concern about making it

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.009
out of this floor without taking damage

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.320
we have a 72% deal with the devil chance

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:29.590
so we shouldn't squander that's very

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:33.340
we shouldn't squander our our deal with

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:36.130
the devil chance because it's

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:39.310
unexpectedly valuable I always forget

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:41.500
that after after an Excel floor you get

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.280
disproportionately less of a devil deal

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.800
hangover

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.570
so the squander it would just be I mean

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.470
downright on grateful positively on

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:52.990
Canadian of me now don't tell Kelly

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:56.949
leach you now see these are jokes that

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:58.300
are relevant to like less than 1% of the

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:00.310
people watching these videos that's okay

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.780
not I ain't about the lifestyle is the

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:09.270
thing so we're not taking the dunce cap

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:11.979
I will take chocolate milk because

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.169
chocolate milk plus high damage tears

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:15.310
kind of allows us to like load explode

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:17.620
now I don't know what that means but I

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.470
keep hearing about it from Ultima Online

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.240
I don't play Ultima Online but there's

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.880
this video dan always like to show me

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.949
where an obnoxious shot-caller in that

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.560
game keeps going on to one load explode

00:07:26.949 --> 00:07:32.380
on Gullu load explode on Edward

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.360
Hawthorne and as a result I'm now

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.340
familiar with the term load explode I

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.139
imagine it means like you know you're

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:42.430
getting a spell ready to just dump it on

00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:45.340
someone so much of language is just

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:47.830
context space that wouldn't surprise me

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:51.310
that's the correct example here I could

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:53.050
be incorrect though a lot of MMO terms I

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.030
don't understand people use them as if

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.590
I'm going to tell you a secret everybody

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:59.080
that's on YouTube is played Wow

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:02.110
for like 12 years and I'm the odd one

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.430
out and they all go I hate wow and then

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:05.620
the new expansion comes out and they go

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:07.510
this expansion it saves Wow and then

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.729
like six weeks later nobody plays Wow

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:11.020
anymore okay so like I'm familiar with

00:08:09.729 --> 00:08:13.030
the cycle don't think I don't see you

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:15.340
there they always use these terms

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:18.250
sure tank DPS hundred percent familiar

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:20.710
no problem then they say I'm peeling and

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:22.030
I go I don't know what that means you're

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.310
peeling we're playing we're playing a

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:27.039
PvP game apparently peeling is when you

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:29.680
take aggro I don't understand how you

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:31.060
peel in a MOBA but people keep telling

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.520
me to peel they're like you're the tank

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:35.229
peel I don't have peeling abilities I

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.490
have abilities that let me soak up

00:08:35.229 --> 00:08:38.169
damage but I don't know how to force

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.930
these other human beings who know that

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:40.760
I'm trying to

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:42.620
so cup damage to attack means that have

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:45.290
attacking you the the squishy dude with

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:47.089
the you know he's got antlers of course

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:49.790
are going to attack antler man over you

00:08:47.089 --> 00:08:51.040
know man that looks like he weighs 4.2

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.870
metric tons

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:57.500
it's like video game 101 you always

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:58.850
killed a antler man first it's probably

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.860
throwing out some dirty heels or

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.839
something like that I don't know that's

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.880
what I call a sack lunch none none that

00:09:02.839 --> 00:09:08.330
nothing I'm okay so wedding crashers

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:13.520
2004 as opposed to the wedding crashers

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:15.140
2001 a Space Odyssey we had no money on

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:19.660
the last floor that almost never happens

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:19.660
a whole floor without money

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:26.380
you know what we do want that it's a

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.910
hundred percent deal with the devil

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:30.990
chance right now we got the HP to make

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:33.820
that knowledge get us into college so

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:36.880
the the game plan right now is is

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:38.920
actually very very simple we're just

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.630
going to live until this deal with the

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.760
devil which should be pretty easy and

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:44.440
then from that deal with the devil weed

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.330
that was really dumb but thank God we

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.890
had the spirit heart we'd expect maybe

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.720
not great things but at least a chance

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:52.960
at some great things I'm a little bummed

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:54.460
that we didn't have a blood bank on this

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.320
floor but that's that's why I originally

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.760
brought up how strange it is that we

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.220
have zero money from the last floor

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.570
usually you know every floor is good for

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:05.050
dropping a couple of pennies on the

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:06.730
ground but not this time and we used all

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:08.620
our previous money like re-rolling into

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:16.920
bloody lost which is a decision that I

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:16.920
don't regret but does have consequences

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:27.730
we have an ends of the present moment

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:31.290
really made uh bloody lost pop gave us a

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.290
little bit of help on the last floor but

00:10:33.089 --> 00:10:38.620
didn't really uh you know I hasn't

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.030
gotten us a twenty damage yet obviously

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.220
I don't think you can get us over over

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:44.500
twelve anyway to begin with but right

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.940
now it maximum is double I think I

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.290
always forget there's a lot of items in

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.600
the game too to remember specific

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:51.610
knowledge about I mean that's kind of my

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.010
job but mostly my job is more

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:57.100
remembering that you know baby turn

00:10:54.010 --> 00:11:00.430
advances you can see that sexy body go

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:02.650
pump pump pump is a song by b2k the

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:05.620
winners of the original making the band

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:09.490
from MTV and like the year maybe 2001 I

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:10.930
want to say 2001 on that one do I

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:13.570
remember any of the other lyrics I don't

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:16.839
know it's the one guy goes hey that's

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:18.490
all I want to see please just show it to

00:11:16.839 --> 00:11:23.110
me there's a lot of songs in that era

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:25.900
about ladies butts I'm not saying like

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:27.880
I'm against it well red blood or North

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:32.200
American male would be right but at the

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:38.980
same time like the Beatles never wrote

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:41.550
an ass song I think I guess they

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:44.950
couldn't back things they're still like

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:46.420
like decency laws like people some

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:47.709
people didn't like the Beatles cuz they

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:51.459
thought their songs were too lewd I

00:11:47.709 --> 00:11:54.130
wanna hold ya hey I mean we all knew

00:11:51.459 --> 00:11:55.420
what he meant he's not just there for

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:59.850
the hand-holding I'll tell you that

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.850
straight up but you know it's a pretty

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:11.350
tame song careful careful careful

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:13.360
nicely done cool I guess they couldn't

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:14.440
have done a song in 1960 that was like

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.720
well I mean they could have but it would

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:18.310
have perhaps compromised their their

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:21.430
popularity to some extent if there's

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:23.050
just a song about like I don't even want

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:25.079
to go as lewd as I want to go with it

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:27.910
but I want to go I don't know we'll see

00:12:25.079 --> 00:12:29.170
they certainly couldn't make anaconda so

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:32.950
it's all I'm trying to get this deal

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:34.959
with the devil is straight-up garbage we

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:36.339
should have gone to the curse room once

00:12:34.959 --> 00:12:37.300
we finish the boss fight but you know

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:40.570
what there's worse things than having

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:42.460
another half spirit heart backing us up

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.780
even if we are going to get another one

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:51.760
here it's always nice to have a little

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:58.360
extra oh that's the moneymaker so we're

00:12:51.760 --> 00:13:01.900
I do please let me get IV bag you are a

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:03.640
god I'm so happy because IV bag is going

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:08.460
to solve all of our damage related

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:11.440
problems we're basically Sampson so to

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:12.010
get IV bag is pretty much like a ten out

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.940
of ten

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:17.560
Sampson item I'm super stoked we now not

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.660
only will be able to have some extra

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.220
damage but like I don't want to get your

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:24.430
hopes up too high we might actually be

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:26.860
able to have some money as well and I

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:28.780
know that seems unfathomable I recognize

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:32.110
by the way that it's a new item like the

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:34.360
little delirium or whatever delirious is

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:38.110
a new item but it's just not it's just

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:40.480
not good enough to really pop I think so

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:42.640
you definitely I think we should get

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.200
bookworm and the question is when you

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:48.340
get bookworm with and the answer is it

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:49.390
really does not matter none of these can

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.710
help us get to the other ones without

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:53.650
spending a key and none of the other

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:55.630
ones are really good for us long term so

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:57.280
we're at the maximum damage bonus and we

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:59.670
got enough money to make our shop work

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:04.120
now we should just move along here

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:10.950
goodbye library it's been nice thanks

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:10.950
for the books they were out so nice

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:17.770
gotta work on the run time songwriting a

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:20.320
little bit more okay you might think

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:22.450
that like I'm mad because I'm bad on

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:25.690
this run right now it's not the case be

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:27.880
honest with you I am content believe it

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:30.640
or not to take terrible damage in some

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:33.310
situations here just to speed I treat it

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:37.300
as like a cost to doing business and I

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:38.590
want to I want to kill enemies most

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:41.140
efficient way to kill them quickly in a

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:44.500
lot of situations here is to use a sac

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:48.250
dagger which in weren't the case all the

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:51.370
time but sort of is so I'm going to run

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:52.660
into enemies and again if I get hit its

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:53.220
collateral damage as far as I'm

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.530
concerned

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:57.660
now if we start to run low on HP I will

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:58.950
rethink that strategy that point it

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:06.750
might be too late and if it is you get

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:09.240
to say you freaking at Otis over it as

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:11.160
of right now you know say my first rodeo

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:15.630
it is playing a little fast and loose

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:17.760
but everybody wants to see LeBron

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:19.710
stunned on the court I don't know what

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.840
that means but I'm sure it's probably

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:24.150
true but then you know when he misses

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.950
the hookshot everyone goes I wish he

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:32.610
just played the stronger fundamental

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:33.870
basketball we got our half Hart there

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:37.230
that's important because I want to go to

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:39.960
the curse room without spending luck

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:45.210
please it's all worth if we get a little

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:46.800
luck of course now that we have money

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:49.410
our shop is apparently worthless but I

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:51.750
digress I'm not trying to be mad I'm

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:56.850
actually again beyond thrilled that

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:58.530
we've actually managed to get a IV bag

00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:01.350
on this floor which completely turns

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:04.200
around like the Tambor of this rum this

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:05.760
run for my opinion I'm just going to let

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.260
that go by the wayside we're going to

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:08.550
save temperance because temperance maybe

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.020
on the next floor could be worth even

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:11.940
more than it is right now if we can get

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:14.790
an arcade and we would like to get a

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:18.120
blood bag like the IV bag is mission

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:19.680
critical but to be able to get one or

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.490
two blood bags you know crank up our

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.890
speed a little bit

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:26.040
pump pump the jam pump it up while your

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:32.460
feet are stumping also completely cool

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:34.410
in my eyes good one also like to get out

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:37.080
thought to that extreme degree by one of

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:38.730
the best to ever play the game I don't

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.589
know I'll ask an enemy that's been

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:42.690
killed by cobalt streak that hurts

00:16:40.589 --> 00:16:44.070
strawman argument even though cobalt is

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:49.290
a great player and it feels good to be

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:51.839
compared to him give me duality not

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:53.910
crushing it on deals with the devil so

00:16:51.839 --> 00:16:56.760
far but dude thank you lump of coal

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:59.220
obviously a lovely item thank you for

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:03.050
that didn't get it last time so to get

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:05.490
it this time feels good we could use the

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:06.280
Hermit card to get out of boss rush but

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:08.500
I'm

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:11.980
more eager to try to cement this run as

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:19.870
like very doable and the way that's

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:21.790
easiest to do that is strange is via

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:25.210
this temperance card sign of stars

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:28.750
you see we get luck that's fine you're

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:31.660
this temperance card back there now

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:34.060
which is a bummer but we did save a key

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:42.580
and we probably never would have

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:45.220
backtracked was it worth getting the

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:47.050
luck upgrade fast honestly that's the

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:49.540
part that rubs me because it probably

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:52.540
was not really that big of a deal to get

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:54.280
the luck upgrade quickly but what I'm

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:57.570
what I'm trying to do here is hopefully

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.570
pick up some red hearts along the way

00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:05.440
and then go perhaps for good gravy right

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.880
there thank you and then we're coming

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.880
back here and we're trying to get mad

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:15.160
money basically and also if I could get

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:18.910
I could get the blood bag it would feel

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:21.790
very nice of the present moment we can't

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:25.570
afford to get too intense with our

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:28.060
straps here so that's why we're coming

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:31.480
back doing some exploratory surgery here

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:33.550
I didn't want to have the chance to get

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:37.600
a bad trip instead because it locks down

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:42.640
and paralysis okay so we are living on

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:45.010
the edge like an Aerosmith song but you

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:47.320
guys okay always going to take an extra

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:51.790
chance to play the blood bank back here

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:54.160
I do believe that in the future we got

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:55.660
every chance of planet Earth to get a

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.970
blood bag out of that and I do believe

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:59.590
that to some extent a blood bag is kind

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:02.080
of transformative on this run

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:03.850
I think the runs already great it's

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:06.220
probably like a seven-point eight out of

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:07.990
ten if we wanted to hit that like eight

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:10.090
point two out of ten level the blood

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:12.820
bags an easy an abler for making that

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:15.130
dream come true

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:17.110
I know we got other keys back there I'm

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:18.850
tempted we got nothing to worry about

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:20.559
when it comes to boss rush we can either

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:23.139
choose to go to boss rush or we can stay

00:19:20.559 --> 00:19:27.610
the F away forever do have a sulfuric

00:19:23.139 --> 00:19:35.409
tears so can play it a little fast and

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:38.710
loose here if we so desire secret room

00:19:35.409 --> 00:19:40.269
I still think it's the secret room I'm

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:43.059
starting to doubt that that might be the

00:19:40.269 --> 00:19:44.919
secret room the stages of finding a room

00:19:43.059 --> 00:19:47.789
that's not a secret room definitely the

00:19:44.919 --> 00:19:49.990
secret room might not be a secret room I

00:19:47.789 --> 00:19:52.929
can't believe it's not a secret dude

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:54.549
ever since we've had money non-stop I

00:19:52.929 --> 00:19:56.259
just want to point out deals with the

00:19:54.549 --> 00:20:01.960
devil had been garbage since I've gotten

00:19:56.259 --> 00:20:04.600
the deals and shops have been garbage

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:06.460
ever since I've had money not super

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:09.519
bitter about it again IV bag does a lot

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:11.320
of great work for us I'm just surprised

00:20:09.519 --> 00:20:15.909
that you know you treat your customers

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:18.120
like this game do you have any you know

00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:22.720
how many hours I spend at this business

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:25.049
you have the audacity to give me

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:29.769
terrible shops and deals with the devil

00:20:25.049 --> 00:20:33.190
don't you know who I am now that's even

00:20:29.769 --> 00:20:36.210
more insulting that one might genuinely

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:36.210
be an insult here

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:44.770
give me some red hearts I'm not going to

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:46.570
take him for granted use those put those

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:48.010
good work on the next floor tears up is

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:49.780
lovely thank you very much even with

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:53.070
chocolate milk you know get to a

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:56.080
stronger charge faster or tap shoot with

00:20:53.070 --> 00:21:01.510
with more style I think we're just going

00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:09.370
to go fight mom I'm very concerned about

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:14.290
our HP situation no deal with the devil

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:16.090
Polaroid's a no-brainer here none of

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:20.130
it's good enough we're just being honest

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:20.130
none of it's good enough so I'm going to

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:27.280
and he used this once the game plan was

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.780
basically to put us in permanent

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:36.970
polaroid invincibility stayed right off

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:38.440
the bat but it's scary Oh Mike the cats

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:45.850
they've almost made it through the door

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:47.140
I do want to do damage with my tears I

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:50.590
understand we're like two hits away from

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:52.810
that I don't think we can be one hit

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:54.670
away from death I want the half Harvey

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:59.200
can't necessarily use it properly right

00:21:54.670 --> 00:22:02.200
now punching bag is actually doing a

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:04.780
great job of diverting aggro which I

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:07.000
never give it any props for but in our

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:10.030
present situation is doing great work

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:15.850
for us basically just giving us longer

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:19.710
to hit more enemies to a clubs totally

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:22.600
fine I do I mean the strength card is

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:26.740
embarrassingly like kind of mission

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:32.710
critical as well certainly I wish it

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:38.260
were not got a 72% deal with the devil

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:41.350
chance nine lives is a win not quite

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:45.400
done dropping a couple red hearts is a

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:48.730
win I almost press the spacebar right

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:51.310
there would have been ill-advised okay

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:51.940
dude I mean what can I say I almost blew

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:56.769
myself up

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:58.330
right there pop strength I would have

00:22:56.769 --> 00:23:01.090
rather not popped it here but I didn't

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:05.230
trust myself not to die pop on to see

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:11.289
that secret room access pacano algae's

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:13.870
that's the money maker okay so first

00:23:11.289 --> 00:23:15.549
things first oh we got extra HP back

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:17.440
like permanently with the strength card

00:23:15.549 --> 00:23:22.659
we've still got this deal with the devil

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:23.950
chance of they're kind of surprising to

00:23:22.659 --> 00:23:27.700
me we found a way to get so close to

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:28.990
death without actually losing our deal

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:31.419
with the devil precedent but here we are

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:32.740
okay I don't blame the IV bag for this

00:23:31.419 --> 00:23:35.980
by the way we've kind of we've been

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:37.539
starved of good stuff recently so

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:39.519
algae's as far as I'm concerned is that

00:23:37.539 --> 00:23:42.009
easy is no-brainer in Earth's history

00:23:39.519 --> 00:23:44.019
right now you just pop it take your

00:23:42.009 --> 00:23:51.700
probable free deal with the devil

00:23:44.019 --> 00:23:54.909
no you wouldn't I am again the reason

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:58.000
that this is so deleterious for me is

00:23:54.909 --> 00:24:00.909
that it appears as if the games being

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.019
very nice so nice Angie's room we're

00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:07.570
going to find a way to take damage

00:24:02.019 --> 00:24:13.450
through that like I'm catching flack but

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:17.139
the game has slowly starved me tons of

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:19.269
money no shops HP no deals with the

00:24:17.139 --> 00:24:25.629
devil and then on this floor we do have

00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:29.230
a crack at a deal with the devil we got

00:24:25.629 --> 00:24:32.559
to play pretty darn good so I can say it

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:38.740
myself to make that happen though secret

00:24:32.559 --> 00:24:41.740
room to a diamonds probably not going to

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:43.929
fight hush full heart is very useful

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:48.309
another justice card with a full heart

00:24:43.929 --> 00:24:50.350
so we're back like this is actually some

00:24:48.309 --> 00:24:51.220
of the strongest drop we've gotten

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:53.880
recently I don't know if that

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:56.280
conjugation makes sense but

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:57.690
that that changed the game to some

00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:01.370
extent right there and I don't want to

00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:01.370
use IV bag anymore

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:06.300
we got 1.59 luck the thing is like I

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:08.010
don't really want to play this thing

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:10.140
because it's like boring but at the same

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:18.120
time this is like far and away the most

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:20.250
sensible option for us crystal ball is

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:23.810
good spirit arts are good a better

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:27.600
trinket is good cards are good like

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:29.130
there's there's many viable options here

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:32.840
we could get a lot of bombs but I don't

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:32.840
know if I want to use IV bagged entrance

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:38.550
you know what normally you would all I

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:40.470
mean that's tempting now but normally

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:43.290
you would probably save your wheel of

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:45.060
fortune to use it later I'm not going to

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:47.250
do this I'm going to use it now to like

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:48.600
maximize the speed at which we go

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:50.880
through all of our money and pick up

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:58.890
some great stuff algae's please a was

00:25:50.880 --> 00:26:01.760
okay that's a good trinket okay so we

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:04.920
got blind rage what we want to do here

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:07.410
that was handled exactly the opposite of

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:09.270
how you normally like to do that we can

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:17.610
get two plays out of it I'm going to go

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:20.550
a little for broke here so we actually

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:24.450
want cracked crown long-term I don't

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:26.220
care about our bomb setup I also don't

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:29.360
care about eihwaz at all let's just use

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:33.470
that up here so we got crystal ball

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:36.330
crystal ball gives us a spear at hard

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:41.040
money money is not that relevant I think

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:43.830
we're almost ready to go here it's ok

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:46.080
Ruka I will I will appear momentarily

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:52.440
when this run is finished for better and

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:55.770
for worse ok I'm out I'm out I'm very

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:59.160
out now what we want card wise I guess

00:26:55.770 --> 00:27:00.600
empress is pretty solid here so I'm

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.460
pretty sure the boss fight was like

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:04.880
three rooms down that was two rooms down

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.880
here

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:10.860
relative all that hurts walking right

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.360
into that thing that I wouldn't even

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.170
blame the game for that one that's on me

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.580
a hundred percent

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:18.240
speaking of which 100% deal with the

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:21.090
devil chance can we buck the trend of

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.690
garbage deals or can we actually let's

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:25.710
try that again

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:27.930
garbage deals can we get something I'm

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:30.480
stoked about we got a go angel deal and

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:33.600
you know what it's actually not that bad

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:36.930
you know give me the raw HP in this

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:38.760
situation and I'm a happy camper it's

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:46.800
like one of the few times the body has

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:48.180
actually been worth the pickup here like

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.620
just getting that arrived P is going to

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.640
be very useful for me and this is going

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:54.840
to be very fast

00:27:50.640 --> 00:28:02.040
hello Rika would you like to enter the

00:27:54.840 --> 00:28:05.190
room murukku takes the morning train he

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:09.180
mails from 9:00 to 5:00 and then he

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:15.380
sometimes meals longer than that until I

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:15.380
hit his forehead all that damage hurts I

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:21.200
keep trying to beat the system here like

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:24.180
after I get hit I pop IV bag and go

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:26.190
jealous but that's actually just double

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:32.900
damage I mean the red heart damage is

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:35.700
not that meaningful because we want or

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:38.100
we want to get the damage bonus so it's

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:39.210
like completely acceptable to you know

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:43.230
you got to you got to spend money to

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:45.390
make money you know please that was not

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:48.600
good play on my part I'll be the first

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:52.460
to admit we found our boss fight already

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:56.310
though so what's the game plan well

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:59.420
second secret room that goes in no okay

00:28:56.310 --> 00:29:02.340
so what I'm actually going to do is like

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:04.760
exploit the fact that we have a blind

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.760
rage

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:13.600
to get as much damage safely out of IV

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:17.320
bag plus sac dagger as we can but I

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:20.049
really like I'm rushing not out of

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:22.210
impatience but out of fear at the at the

00:29:20.049 --> 00:29:23.559
present moment first off there's nothing

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:25.179
else on these floors that's liable to

00:29:23.559 --> 00:29:29.470
give us you know greatness to begin with

00:29:25.179 --> 00:29:31.510
however beyond that like the obvious

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:34.380
situation that's very scary for me here

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:36.580
is we got to hurt ourselves to get HP

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:37.720
but we don't have that much HP Tagore's

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.710
I heard ourselves to get damaged I

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:40.419
should say but we don't have that much

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:41.919
damage to go around we don't have that

00:29:40.419 --> 00:29:44.350
much HP to go around alright last I

00:29:41.919 --> 00:29:47.230
video today I think brains starting to

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:50.830
melt in fast it is fine Dead Sea Scrolls

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:53.620
I don't know what it gave me seems like

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:55.659
it gave me a paralysis pill so we

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:57.730
probably oh no I give me a must have

00:29:55.659 --> 00:30:00.159
been the cards wait what no just

00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:03.010
Butterbean must've been deck of cards so

00:30:00.159 --> 00:30:08.850
you get Loki's horns IV bag it's a

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:13.330
pretty bad hull I will suggest that

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:15.520
Jacob's Ladder is great and again the

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:17.500
more damage upgrades we can get I'm sure

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:20.080
that Jacob's Ladder becomes even better

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:23.169
I'm assuming Jacob's Ladder gets us you

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:25.630
know it scales with our damage but we

00:30:23.169 --> 00:30:33.039
shouldn't be willy-nilly throwing HP

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:35.679
away the Empress has a decent potential

00:30:33.039 --> 00:30:38.110
to be very good for us it has the

00:30:35.679 --> 00:30:39.640
potential to become nearly essential for

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:46.390
us dude I am not messing with you

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:49.059
brownie the worst the actual worse might

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:52.020
rather have blue baby than brownie in a

00:30:49.059 --> 00:30:52.020
room at this point but

00:30:55.509 --> 00:31:04.639
regardless we've made it out a few rooms

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:06.409
down basically no drops yet and now dude

00:31:04.639 --> 00:31:10.340
what was I thinking trinket wise we do

00:31:06.409 --> 00:31:12.169
not have blind rage we have brown cap I

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:17.360
got a blasting cap I can't even remember

00:31:12.169 --> 00:31:23.450
what this is that's not what we want in

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:24.499
case that's not abundantly clear child's

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:27.049
heart would have been way better but

00:31:24.499 --> 00:31:28.720
like blind rage is what we thought we

00:31:27.049 --> 00:31:31.549
had just wasn't paying attention

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:33.259
experimental treatment was good we're

00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:34.609
never going to use that seventh HP

00:31:33.259 --> 00:31:35.149
container so the fact that we got

00:31:34.609 --> 00:31:37.309
something

00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:39.289
that gave us a stat bonus for every

00:31:37.309 --> 00:31:43.359
other category at the cost of HP is

00:31:39.289 --> 00:31:43.359
actually a no-lose situation right now

00:31:44.109 --> 00:31:50.179
we should take the pill there's no doubt

00:31:48.049 --> 00:31:55.330
about that I'll be done in like two

00:31:50.179 --> 00:32:02.529
minutes yeah we could probably swing it

00:31:55.330 --> 00:32:02.529
okay okay okay

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:11.030
keep self awake here now not on earth

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:13.789
that's that's that edit that had added

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:17.900
us I'm not throwing for sushi I promise

00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:19.220
you this this is genuine badness also

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:21.080
this room was kind of a nightmare to

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.880
begin with but no no we get we got the

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:26.179
dream we got the dream that's one HP

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:27.190
protection right there hopefully just

00:32:26.179 --> 00:32:32.270
stay back

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:34.700
wow it was one HP protection what do you

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:35.860
do what do you do not beams thank you

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:38.120
okay

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:42.880
squandered this with some poor play no

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:45.679
doubt thank you one more full red heart

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:48.110
now are we getting carried that depends

00:32:45.679 --> 00:32:49.880
are you so brainwashes to think having

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:51.530
three point six luck in getting a red

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.000
hard drop occasionally means you're

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:55.370
getting carried well then I guess the

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.530
game has truly won because they've

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:59.900
already got you on their side think back

00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:04.130
to all the times we got not screwed

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:08.840
overtly but like starved by the RNG of

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:15.250
the game stopped by the RNG I was

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:18.559
stopped by the RNG I was stunned by the

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:20.690
RNG dude that's the win right there

00:33:18.559 --> 00:33:23.090
basically I knew if we killed him last

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:25.669
it was almost impossible for us not to

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:26.900
steal a win so we are going to take W

00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:28.190
here I don't think we played

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:32.750
particularly well but I think we played

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:34.280
a dynamic game and I do think if you go

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:35.919
back you watch the tape you can

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:38.120
highlight a lot of situations in which

00:33:35.919 --> 00:33:40.820
we probably should've bawled and the

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:44.330
game screwed us a little bit or at least

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:46.460
again starved us and instead here we are

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:47.419
coming out with a dub probably I say

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:50.990
probably because now I'm going to go

00:33:47.419 --> 00:33:53.270
fight mega satan as penance for being

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:54.559
bad in the first place so I mean we

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:55.850
don't we don't need IV bag for this

00:33:54.559 --> 00:33:58.059
fight we don't need anything for this

00:33:55.850 --> 00:34:01.520
fight from the space bar collection but

00:33:58.059 --> 00:34:06.230
might as well take Butterbean because it

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:10.450
can be used multiple times should pop

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:10.450
empress for sure now we got 20 damage

00:34:11.599 --> 00:34:17.129
good good good

00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:23.250
okay word basically said this run ended

00:34:17.129 --> 00:34:25.139
up being actually quite fun it was fast

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:27.300
and it might not seem like it cuz we

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:28.740
were you know in heck for a while there

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:34.349
we were totally eighty double hockey

00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:38.329
sticks but reaction to actually we're

00:34:34.349 --> 00:34:41.490
actually relatively well off on this run

00:34:38.329 --> 00:34:43.589
by the end but it did take some clutch

00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:46.230
HP we think we had to get a little bit

00:34:43.589 --> 00:34:47.369
lucky to swing it but you know what you

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:48.720
either get lucky

00:34:47.369 --> 00:34:51.149
you know what the drops the game gives

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:53.399
you or you get lucky with like the items

00:34:51.149 --> 00:34:54.839
the game gives you so we just got lucky

00:34:53.399 --> 00:34:56.460
and drops this time instead of getting

00:34:54.839 --> 00:35:01.619
carried by items I'm not going to

00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:03.240
apologize for it despite the fact that

00:35:01.619 --> 00:35:07.020
we've taken a couple hits here we're

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:09.260
still pretty much 100% unkillable I

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:09.260
think

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:17.730
this guy's going to go down like a

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:21.059
second you're dusted and then the final

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:25.289
phase should be real easy to take care

00:35:21.059 --> 00:35:27.420
of all we got to do is not get it it

00:35:25.289 --> 00:35:29.400
ain't about how hard you can hit it's

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:33.869
about how hard you can get hit and keep

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:37.130
coming where's my little house yet I

00:35:33.869 --> 00:35:37.130
need you to block some of these shots

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:52.769
okay I was saved by the RNG I was mana

00:35:47.569 --> 00:35:55.049
RNG I was sitting by the RNG all we've

00:35:52.769 --> 00:35:57.720
done it wasn't even close skip farted on

00:35:55.049 --> 00:36:00.930
son mega satan died we take another W

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:01.500
easy mol K didn't even see it until it

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:03.690
was too late

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.680
