00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.060
everybody welcome back to doin lane

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.600
please the binding of issac afterbirth

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.290
plus where we lost still freakin head

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.429
trauma

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:16.020
God nonsense I hate it we got know damn

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:18.240
well we got one damaged upgrade let's do

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.289
darkness falls I was thinking like gee

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.900
we bounce back and forth between

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.279
challenges and normal runs we could or

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.570
we could not it doesn't really matter I

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.279
think you know we're going to do it all

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.029
eventually so let's strike while the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:34.559
iron's hot our 84g FPC for darkness

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.110
falls gives you you're like unbelievably

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.370
stacked right off the bat we have

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.910
literally quadruple the damage we

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.390
started our last run with although not

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.969
quite as great of an ability to fire

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.820
tears although we can actually aim our

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.739
tears so it's really like it's kind of a

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.140
toss-up in fact I would say our last run

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.719
was definitely better and that's not any

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.210
joking at all involved there so if you

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.120
laughed at it that's harassment and go

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.170
screw yourself I was being extremely

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.960
very serious ok just by virtue of having

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.040
sac dagger we are the cop who can't be

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.290
stopped right now we will I mean I

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.700
actually forgot that this is a challenge

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.560
that existed I sort of don't understand

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.390
the unifying theme behind these items

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.909
except I mean they are all deal with the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.610
devil items they're all like a little

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.540
evil they're all maybe these are all the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.619
evil upgrades in the game but that

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.259
doesn't seem right

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:42.210
where Babylon is that an evil upgrade is

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.560
dead bird and evil upgrade I don't know

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.780
why they're all items that have a

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.030
certain McCobb nature associated with

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.070
them I suppose is that the easy way to

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.509
think about them now in many ways we

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.909
have to be careful because this is kind

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.979
of similar to our last run where we are

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.320
a little incentivized to like

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.259
deliberately lose all of our HP and if

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.450
we well all of our HP up to a certain

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.189
maximum and if we do that it's obviously

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.610
going to be very hard for us to win but

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.220
at the same time

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.900
this run is so much stronger than the

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.370
last run that it's almost comical and

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.650
you know I'll say the same thing that I

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.700
always said when I messed up challenges

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.580
in earlier videos I can't see what car

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.500
did was because gassy mexican has signed

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.280
on to play move or die I got to turn off

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.450
those steam notifications dude

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.180
but hey move or die now that's an

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.730
interesting game I would that game has

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.560
stood the test of time I think it's got

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.320
something netcode that's not perfect but

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.330
I dunno probably the best Mario Party

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.070
style game on PC that I can think of so

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.410
kudos to you I don't know if I ever told

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:50.840
this story but the mover died guys at

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:54.260
PAX East 2015 apparently they were fans

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.730
of the NSS or Savi and knew who we were

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.320
and were like hey maybe they'll play the

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.820
game on the show if we butter them up a

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.440
little bit I don't know which one's the

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.030
case but they had us record like a video

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.520
testimonial that I don't know if it ever

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.200
saw the light of day which is fair

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.130
because I was like jet-lagged and

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.750
sleep-deprived and we had spent the

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.730
night in the emergency room that night

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.799
it was like it couldn't have been a

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.840
glowing endorsement but anyway what's

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:27.530
the Paley bad gas don't you dare and we

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.910
ever had lump of coal on this save file

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.459
there's re no lump of coal we ever had

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.830
Krampus is head on the save file I'd say

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:37.640
that just because I fought Krampus like

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.410
once per video today and this is like

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.690
the third actually the fourth Isaac I'm

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.150
recording today I think he's given us a

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.060
lump of coal every single time so far

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.660
which is great like I'm 0% complaining

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.739
but but yes I mean this run is comically

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.209
stronger than our last one but I was

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.549
going to say that I'll say what I say on

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.260
every challenge run where I lose I like

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.820
losing on challenges because it means

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.209
that it's not just a themed run the you

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.430
steamroll it's actually a challenge I'm

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.200
not saying that it should fit the name

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.150
you know I'm just saying it's more

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.959
enjoyable when it's kind of when there's

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.959
stakes at play

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.130
speaking of which what's your favorite

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.209
kind of steak

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.150
otherwise said that is if I was like

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.100
Vsauce that's my favorite kind of steak

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.130
actually is a Vsauce anything in a

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.830
demi-glace Vsauce is fine by me

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:32.870
demi-glace free stuff made of

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:35.330
chanterelle mushrooms anyway I'm going

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.919
to be honest with you for a while I

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.990
didn't know I probably would have said

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.240
oh you know New York strip loin because

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.860
when you go to like a fast casual

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.570
restaurant that's like the most

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.160
expensive thing on the menu so it's got

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.160
to be good then you realize you get

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.070
older there's a whole world of steaks

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.980
out there and I think even up to like

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.260
relatively recently I probably would

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:01.870
have said rib eye because rib eye I

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:04.070
don't have any bombs rib eye a delicious

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.060
let's let's go down the pros and cons

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.290
mistakes here

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.820
rib eye delicious also trendy the Rin I

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.380
don't mean that to be like oh it's a hip

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:17.510
sters eat it but the rib eye is I think

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:19.760
the trendiest cut of steak so what all

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.200
the Millennials like yours truly are

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.120
eaten in this day and age that's how you

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.590
use yours truly right yours truly is

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:29.720
like me I thought so they always at the

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.760
end of the the letters in the olden days

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.820
they always wrote yours truly my name

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.630
not my name that you know their name you

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.690
get the idea

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:41.270
I'm assuming you get the idea coms rib

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:44.630
eyes man expensive also tends to be

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:47.470
fatty so if you're not into the beef fat

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:51.050
first off who are you

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:53.539
secondly maybe not a cut for you then

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.080
you got to think about you know the food

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:56.330
bone

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.669
I think the t-bone is where I actually

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:02.030
land as I get older and older t-bone

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:05.030
steaks cons expensive still a little

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.510
expensive for certain and it's the

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.710
t-bone steak is like it's been forever

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.720
ruined for people because it's what the

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.190
bus driver ate in the Adventures of Pete

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.979
and Pete the old show on the Nickelodeon

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.040
and he's not only a t-bone steaks but he

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:18.870
bought them cooked out

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.250
banning machine it was the show that was

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.720
a little off-kilter and that's why

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.960
people love him you know yours truly

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:27.570
included but I grew up thinking t-bone

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.300
steaks were kind of like a gross food

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:32.430
because Stu the bus driver bought it out

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.780
of a vending machine but maybe it was

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.960
like a Japanese vending machine in which

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:39.750
case is all hunky-dory right either way

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:44.820
what's the pros to the t-point the tea

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:48.450
boy longest pee boy never no you get the

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:51.240
best of both worlds with a t-bone you

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:53.460
get a little bit of fat you also get

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.080
that delicious cut a tenderloin but not

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:59.100
too much of it so that you feel guilty

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:01.560
about consuming it and then you know you

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.150
get a little bit of the of the like very

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.420
fleshy part of the steak as well but I

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:08.220
got it I'm a I'm a beef fat sort of man

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:13.860
I don't want a plate full of beef fat

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:16.590
but I know that my ancestors were into

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:20.190
some savage stuff because when I like

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:23.130
put rendered animal fat of almost any

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:24.990
variety into my mouth it's like my genes

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.220
are activated for the first time ever

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.470
they're like oh you just killed your

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:31.890
competition and ate them and I say no

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:36.540
genes we don't do that anymore okay

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:38.670
that's too far you're being savage on a

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.950
literal level not a metaphorical like

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:44.670
you can't say that on Twitter sort of

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:48.600
level but yeah there's there's some

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:51.000
carnivorous backstory I mean we probably

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.940
all have carnivores in our ancestral

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.270
history it is you know the norm makes

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:58.470
sense it's not like I'm a vegetarian

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.420
leave it leave it to me

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:04.170
I bought chickpeas instead of chicken

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:06.030
breasts this week for my lunches because

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.530
there was a lot cheaper and I was trying

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:09.240
to make a stand and all of a sudden I'm

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:10.980
like what my palate has really been

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.720
awakened I don't can't remember if I

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.940
told the story in Isaac videos yet but

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.200
this is a long story short was in a

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.580
grocery store renowned for being a

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.920
little bit pricier you can probably

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.510
guess the name of it but I've been

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.510
eating healthier so I meant to buy some

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:28.680
chicken breasts and you know I baked

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:30.440
them in the oven and then I like shred

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.180
the meat and I use the meat as

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.220
for salads but anyway there was six

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:35.450
chicken breasts $48 I was like ah I'm

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.400
not paying that and honestly I think

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:39.530
nobody should went over to the camp food

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.510
section by two cans of chickpeas instead

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.770
fried them up with some spices and you

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:46.370
know they've been a delicious snack

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:48.350
slash salad ingredient this week but all

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:50.480
of a sudden I'm pretending I'm

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:52.310
vegetarian despite the fact that I had a

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.820
ham smoothie for breakfast that's not

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:56.270
true

00:08:52.820 --> 00:09:03.020
but for a second so a brief picosecond I

00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:06.350
bet you believed I'm going to avoid

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:08.240
talking about animal fats oh I think we

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:10.100
need to go a whole episode into what is

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.540
the best animal fat because I mean

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:15.800
mostly we already know the answer the

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:19.600
best animal fat is duck fat once this is

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:22.460
sincere I this is a story I got told but

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.620
my girlfriend in college one year I won

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:27.310
like 18 month period in college I got

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:29.900
really into cooking you know I would

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:30.860
watch like America's Test Kitchen and be

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.840
like I'm going to high roast a chicken

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.070
this weekend and I roast a chicken I

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.350
would be like oh that looks like a great

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:38.780
rack of lamb less recipe even though a

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:40.880
rack of lamb is like you know wicked

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.740
expensive let's get a rack of lamb and

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.660
then you know roast that this weekend a

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:48.440
little bit unusual for a college student

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:50.210
I'll admit but either way she got me a

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:55.250
very thoughtful birthday gift which was

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:56.960
like exotic meats from the from a local

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.440
butcher and I was like that's a great

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.870
gift

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.340
it's an unusual gift no doubt but it's a

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:05.180
gift that fit for the occasion

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:07.670
I still think like if I got exotic ish

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:10.190
meats as a gift to this day I would be

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:13.250
like relatively pleased with that that'd

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:16.339
like coffee is more than my thing now

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:17.930
but still and one of the exotic meats

00:10:16.339 --> 00:10:19.370
and it's not that exotic depending where

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:22.400
you live but it was for my relatively

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:24.589
pedestrian town was a duck breast so I

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.920
cooked the duck breast recipe I found

00:10:24.589 --> 00:10:27.410
online

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.580
I ate it it was okay I clearly you know

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:32.360
I need more experience in that

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:34.550
department to the handle a fatty sort of

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.650
like gamey red meat like duck but either

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:38.660
way I saved the fat because it was

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:41.850
recommended I cooked some potatoes in

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:44.649
that the next day and it's like

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:47.199
the caps lock is cruise control for cool

00:10:44.649 --> 00:10:50.440
duck fat is cruise control for delicious

00:10:47.199 --> 00:10:54.160
like I did nothing different but I cubed

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:55.990
potatoes put them into a skillet use

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:59.379
duck fat instead of olive oil and I was

00:10:55.990 --> 00:11:01.689
like this is the best potato based meal

00:10:59.379 --> 00:11:03.220
I've ever can well not really a meal but

00:11:01.689 --> 00:11:04.629
you get the idea of is the best potatoes

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:07.410
I've ever eaten in my entire life

00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:11.889
I would recommend it at like

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:13.480
outrageously now I've since that time

00:11:11.889 --> 00:11:16.149
how many times have I've rendered my own

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:18.250
duck fat zero it's not it don't think

00:11:16.149 --> 00:11:20.079
it's really advisable as like an

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:22.240
everyday sort of thing I'm just saying

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:23.829
you know if you ever get the chance if

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.879
someone ever says I've got some duck fat

00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:28.990
fried potatoes don't go ooh that's weird

00:11:26.879 --> 00:11:30.970
trust me give him a shot if the

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:33.040
opportunity presents itself you'll be I

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:36.610
think you'll be pleased unless they

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:42.339
botched it in which case you know tough

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:43.899
break kid I guess but I digress it was a

00:11:42.339 --> 00:11:46.540
good gift the results actually like a

00:11:43.899 --> 00:11:48.790
lot of it turned out badly because of

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:52.329
user error but I got like a Cornish game

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:55.689
hen I cooked it and I was like this

00:11:52.329 --> 00:11:57.639
stinks I said whatever I did at this

00:11:55.689 --> 00:12:00.370
Cornish game hen I should apologize to

00:11:57.639 --> 00:12:01.839
the bird for it but there and the other

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:04.329
one that was a hit was the rack of lamb

00:12:01.839 --> 00:12:07.660
the aforementioned rack of lamb was like

00:12:04.329 --> 00:12:12.730
I don't like making that noise but it

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:15.490
deserved it in this situation jumper

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:18.519
cables not relevant

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:20.500
taro cloth always relevant although I'm

00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:22.240
always bummed out that it actually does

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:25.779
not work with a question mark card but

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:28.769
you know that's for a later day like TJ

00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:28.769
from the weekenders

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:35.070
he says later days right on that I'm

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:35.070
misremembering that has been a while

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:41.380
the weekenders came out just as I was

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:44.610
getting a little bit too old to be

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:46.750
watching one Saturday morning on ABC so

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:49.240
you know that that's about where like my

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:51.460
childhood ends it's like the last modern

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:54.630
cards do that in rocket power last

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:57.850
modern cartoons I watched as a child

00:12:54.630 --> 00:13:00.310
what a sad story so we lost our last

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:02.770
episode because we went too fast I stand

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:05.230
by that as the long-term cause of why we

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:07.060
lost our last episode so let's be

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:09.460
smarter and slow it down a little bit

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:11.740
and start to play better Isaac what I

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:13.360
want to do this challenge again mind you

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.940
we will never have to do this challenge

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:18.100
again because the odds of us losing are

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.660
very very small at this point and this

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.490
challenge is easy so it's almost like

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:24.310
not even a chore to do it again but it's

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:27.100
still if there's no reason to lose then

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:30.130
let's you know try something wild and

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:31.930
try not to lose I know I'm probably

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:33.550
using sack bag or too much it's a bad

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:37.600
habit but it's also like a beautiful

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:39.580
item my speed is so high that I should

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.370
probably take a cue from you know not

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:44.980
being an idiot and just run circles

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:48.640
around the enemies in order to get like

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:50.920
black powder to just crush them but what

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:54.690
can I say you know no surprise to me

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:54.690
sometimes I am my own worst enemy

00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:01.800
I recognize by the way many people have

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:03.180
pointed this out one achievement that

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:09.710
I'm not sure if I'm looking forward to

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:12.060
or not looking forward to is 31 Daly's I

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:13.710
mean we got we got bigger fish to fry

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:17.040
before that becomes a generally a

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:19.890
genuine issue but 31 Daly's there's no

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:22.410
way to accomplish each other runs you

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:24.600
could accomplish faster than you'd

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:25.830
expect like one I've run a day it's

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:29.010
going to take us a while to do some of

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:30.840
these 31 dailies for 30 dailies you got

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:32.820
no choice is going to take you 31 days

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:36.180
it doesn't get me unless you've got a

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:40.770
time machine it's going to take you that

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:42.270
long so at some point probably well down

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:44.820
the line we probably will have like a

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:47.700
month of dailies or maybe we'll have a

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:49.350
month of you know one daily and one

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.600
regular as video a day we'll see how the

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:56.640
other chips fall right I'm going to be a

00:14:51.600 --> 00:15:04.290
little risky little risky Lewton risky

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:05.250
new risky secret room probably I already

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.480
checked there I might have already

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:07.830
checked there and we could have done

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.140
that and noticed that it never would

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:12.740
have worked but I okay okay we don't

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:16.500
want battery baby

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:19.440
we probably and by probably I mean

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:21.570
definitely one this and then why not

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:25.010
take compost like we're not getting

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:25.010
anything out of the razorblade

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:30.000
compost I don't expect to be incredible

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:37.320
but at least it can accomplish something

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:39.150
for us you might be asking why you you

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.710
know shopping at Whole Foods whoops did

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:42.990
I accidentally name the grocery we all

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:47.000
know that if you see six chicken breasts

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:50.220
for 48 bucks it's at Whole Foods the

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.110
answer is

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:56.110
that it was the closest grocery store at

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:58.480
the time I'm not proud of it but it's

00:15:56.110 --> 00:16:02.500
honest-to-god truth I needed chicken

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:06.040
breasts it was open to ten or open until

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:07.750
ten and it seemed like the appropriate

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.220
course of actually you know what had it

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:11.889
not been for that decision

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:13.630
I might not have discovered that it's

00:16:11.889 --> 00:16:15.639
very easy to fry your own chickpeas and

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:17.380
make them delicious nice substitute for

00:16:15.639 --> 00:16:19.510
you know something that might be too

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:23.730
expensive or you know relatively

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:23.730
unhealthy to put in your in your meals

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:32.440
and I just really feel like chickpeas

00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:34.209
also known as garbanzo beans which I

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.730
caught a lot of flack for saying

00:16:34.209 --> 00:16:39.339
garbanzo beans a silly name apparently

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:42.490
they're just called garbanzo in Spanish

00:16:39.339 --> 00:16:44.820
I respect that it makes sense right

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:47.250
there I'm assuming Bonzo means bean

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:50.620
something like that on a gar means

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:53.440
garbanzos garbanzo beans like I wasn't

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:55.060
trying to be accidentally racist towards

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.949
the Spanish language but we call them

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:59.050
chickpeas all right garbanzo beans is

00:16:56.949 --> 00:17:00.550
like what you're 88 year old grandmother

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:02.230
calls them and that's fine she's stuck

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:03.040
in her ways but we're in chicopee world

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:05.309
now okay

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:09.640
I think it's an underappreciated

00:17:05.309 --> 00:17:12.750
vegetable they're basically like little

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:15.189
potatoes but you know they're used in

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:16.480
nobody's even mashed chickpeas actually

00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:19.030
a lot of people are eating mashed

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:20.980
chickpeas it's called hummus but let's

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:24.160
try this on for size sure that's

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:27.939
acceptable if you've never end I

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:30.610
probably did not eat a chickpea and I

00:17:27.939 --> 00:17:33.340
know that we're bordering on accidental

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:35.950
double entendre territory I probably did

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:39.940
not eat a chickpea until the age of like

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:42.400
20 just never came up again I was in a

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:44.620
town where duck was a an exotic meat

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.630
apparently dude thank you hero font for

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:49.120
allowing me to play badly without being

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:51.340
punished like there's really no excuse

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:53.169
to be using sack daggers exclusively at

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:55.900
this point it's getting a little on the

00:17:53.169 --> 00:17:57.130
silly side but anyway thank you for that

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:59.140
as well

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:01.500
come on the Deaf's to this ones are like

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:09.540
cruising and

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:11.650
it was love at first bite hummus falafel

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:16.060
fantastic and the chickpea introduced me

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:19.750
to the lentil and it's been a you know a

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:22.300
love love relationship ever since I've

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:24.400
got the items Queens but if you've never

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:27.520
found yourself having a chickpea you I'm

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:29.620
telling you can of chickpeas drain the

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.420
water put a little olive oil in a

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:34.360
skillet getting nice and hot we don't

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:36.880
want that we don't want that we don't

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:41.380
want that that much we do want property

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:44.530
you know what let's do it dude so what

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:47.590
some +14 damage on this one and yet

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:50.050
still somehow sack dagger seems like the

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:52.750
faster option to get the kills weird

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:54.490
anyway fry it up with some salt and

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:56.140
pepper given enough time until it's

00:18:54.490 --> 00:19:01.840
crispy and delicious you'll love it's

00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:03.760
like a spherical potato chip chickpea

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:05.950
doesn't get enough respect man huge

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:12.100
growth also crushes rocks so we should

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:13.420
actually be careful this video I should

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.100
just point out is sponsored by the

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:18.940
United States chickpea Association

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:20.260
centered in Almeida California did I not

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:25.240
put that disclosure in the title that's

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:26.410
my bed again probably about 0.25 percent

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:29.980
of the people watching this are going to

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:32.560
think that that's serious and be mad so

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:34.540
it's really up to the remainder of you

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.950
to laugh at that joke and make me feel

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:39.580
like it was worth doing it in the first

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:41.680
place thank you thank you thought I hear

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:44.320
your laughter resonating throughout the

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:46.180
weave of time and I either from the

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.150
movie wanted style and I appreciate that

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:51.150
thank you so much really appreciate it

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:51.150
okay

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:58.210
there's again no reason for us to do

00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:03.070
this but I'm hopeful that this is almost

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:05.350
like a band-aid style solution to me

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:07.420
using Sachs dagger and I said that

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:09.340
without even realizing that as I was

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:10.690
saying it I was using Sachs dagger which

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.860
should tell you that it's probably not

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:14.950
going to fit the bill we should have

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:16.960
picked up that spirit arm but the idea

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:18.900
is now that our tears are doing so much

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:21.040
damage because they have proptosis we

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.690
don't have as much of an incentive to

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.550
get in there with SAC dagger right off

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:27.520
the bat you know we're a little bit more

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:29.590
incentivized to preserve our HP but I'm

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.090
still like jumping in there with SAC

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:32.680
dagger at every available opportunity I

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:34.120
can't be helped I'm beyond help at this

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.800
point it's like Mickey Rourke and the

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.270
wrestler you know we all know what the

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.070
final scene of this run is going to be

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:40.840
it's just the you know we're futile e

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:51.180
raging against that good night hoping it

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:51.180
doesn't come to pass camera

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:55.730
losing a lot of red hearts too but less

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:57.530
relevant than it's ever been that might

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.940
be the final wave this might be the

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:00.800
final I know we're getting close I just

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:03.410
have like I have been in this game a

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.910
long time you know where I've got a

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:09.770
sense of the fact that we're coming

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:11.060
close to the end of boss rush here it's

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:16.670
like you ever watch a good movie in the

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:18.290
theater probably right try to you have

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:20.450
like a scene that you really like and

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:21.890
then you think you checked like your own

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:24.230
internal clock and you're like could

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:26.840
this be the climax of the movie no I

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:29.120
hope not I know this makes me like a

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:32.630
little bit of a shield but I kind of

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:35.510
felt that was like one scene in in

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:37.760
spider-man homecoming and I was like if

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:39.500
this is the central action set piece of

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.820
the movie I'm going to leave being a

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.620
little disappointed because I feel like

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:44.510
this movie's got more to show me that

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:46.340
was like another hour after that my

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:52.330
internal clock was all sorts of jacked

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:54.680
up ended up working out completely fine

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:57.740
all right well we're ballin on this run

00:21:54.680 --> 00:22:00.980
clearly we also turned our own bomb into

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:02.750
a spider know you can do that

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:04.940
I thought live bombs are kind of immune

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:07.930
to that effect but not salty it's

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:10.130
actually kind of an interesting effect I

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:18.680
would like another bomb though it's

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:22.610
possible like not really too useful all

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:24.890
we gotta do is beat Sheol we got kind of

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:28.190
what seems to be a reusable fly army

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:29.950
here so I'm pretty sure that we're gonna

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:32.930
we're going to finish this run being

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:38.420
completely said now that is our first

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:41.480
tiers upgrade I'm so happy because dude

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:43.610
thank you this low tiers is I think even

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:46.070
more so than low damage if I've got a

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:48.590
great orbital and a low rate of fire my

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:52.790
brain is like hardwired to only use the

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:54.530
orbital if I'm shooting real quick it's

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:56.420
so much easier for me to just back the

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:59.180
eff up and then immediately take damage

00:22:56.420 --> 00:23:01.210
despite being behind the play for some

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:03.860
reason

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:05.390
whirring I'm kind of like breeding my

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:08.059
own bad habits here but you know what

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:09.830
there's never been a better time then

00:23:08.059 --> 00:23:11.390
while the best time to plant a tree is

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:13.400
twenty years ago the second best time to

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:17.720
stop having a bad habit is right now so

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:20.390
let's work our way through that start

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:24.500
playing well we're doing 17 damage if

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:26.240
you can't be content doing 17 damage you

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:28.630
got a problem it's as simple as that you

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:32.059
know you're not being reasonable

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:34.250
17 Damon's damages outrageously good

00:23:32.059 --> 00:23:38.289
give me one bomb and turn the rest of

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:41.929
these into flies thank you

00:23:38.289 --> 00:23:44.870
do you Bertie Cooper to speed down not

00:23:41.929 --> 00:23:48.049
that bad we can absorb that there's like

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:52.510
a certain element of psychology going on

00:23:48.049 --> 00:23:54.890
in an Isaac run like this like I know

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:57.679
maybe see what's inside of it before you

00:23:54.890 --> 00:24:02.539
free roll the entire chest um I know

00:23:57.679 --> 00:24:05.750
that deep in your heart I still I know

00:24:02.539 --> 00:24:10.429
that if I didn't have sack dagger I

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:11.049
would be like this runs incredible I'll

00:24:10.429 --> 00:24:13.340
do it

00:24:11.049 --> 00:24:16.250
just let me beat mom's heart then I'll

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:20.539
do it I got to hedge my bets on a

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:22.429
challenge you know why because I would

00:24:20.539 --> 00:24:24.440
do the opposite if we if we had a

00:24:22.429 --> 00:24:25.909
challenge like head trauma for example

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:28.370
and we came across a reroll room

00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:30.110
I'm reroll in it no doubt that's part of

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:36.500
the thrill of the kill my man so we got

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:38.990
to pay the RNG troll whenever we can and

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:41.539
I'll take it because I want to reroll as

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:44.990
many items as possible it's probably a

00:24:41.539 --> 00:24:49.539
very silly decision but let's go got

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:51.860
Leviathan we got a charge bar and

00:24:49.539 --> 00:24:54.350
regular brimstone that's incredible

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:56.090
magic mush or damn it we got magic mush

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:58.130
and yet our damage is that you know

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:59.240
diminished I'm not going to fight the

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:05.590
hush on this one that seems a little

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:09.159
ridiculous but I will fight down here

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:12.159
I will say you know 4.96 damage is way

00:25:09.159 --> 00:25:15.270
worse than 17 damage but 4.96 damage

00:25:12.159 --> 00:25:17.559
with brimstone is still really good

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:18.490
we still have sack daggers so that

00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:19.840
didn't go anywhere

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:23.350
we have shielded tears so like

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:25.390
defensively we're in a great spot what

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:27.100
did we lose I guess we lost proptosis so

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:28.539
that costs us a lot of damage but what

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:32.919
else could we have lost that that could

00:25:28.539 --> 00:25:34.390
have had such an impact you know this is

00:25:32.919 --> 00:25:37.270
just one of those edge cases you learn

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:40.870
when you play Isaac marked is always bad

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:43.029
always bad unless you have a charged

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:44.710
item and if you got a charged item then

00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:46.870
marks is like actually one of the best

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:48.850
cures upgrades in the game it's like

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:50.529
some I before E except after C sort of

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:52.360
nonsense except it's actually true most

00:25:50.529 --> 00:25:58.179
of the time unlike that old song and

00:25:52.360 --> 00:26:02.679
dance speed down you know what ah now we

00:25:58.179 --> 00:26:07.690
do not get my money right NL you ever

00:26:02.679 --> 00:26:12.539
going to come up with a song from like

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:16.630
the last 10 years for stuff like that

00:26:12.539 --> 00:26:19.809
no I'm always going to use Kanye West's

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:22.330
magnum opus 2007 can't tell me nothing

00:26:19.809 --> 00:26:27.850
excuse me was you saying something

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:30.250
uh-uh you can't tell me nothing one of

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:31.600
my friends back in 2007 we're still

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:34.059
friends to this day but we were friends

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:37.870
back then too - I feel like a little

00:26:34.059 --> 00:26:41.049
Mitch Hedberg ISM you know this is Kanye

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:44.409
West's third album graduation where yes

00:26:41.049 --> 00:26:45.399
or 8:08 and heartbreak that's another

00:26:44.409 --> 00:26:49.570
story altogether

00:26:45.399 --> 00:26:51.640
but celebration graduation I can't

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:55.270
remember it doesn't matter anyway the

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:57.850
the first single came out can't tell me

00:26:55.270 --> 00:27:00.039
nothing and my friend message me and

00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:01.960
he's like I don't know dude and this

00:27:00.039 --> 00:27:03.640
might be the end for Kanye West I don't

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.740
that can't tell me nothing single is I

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:07.210
mean it's alright but it's no like you

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:09.850
know Jesus walks

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:13.000
I was like you know agree to disagree I

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:14.530
think time has proven that he was

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.670
absolutely right I mean you never hear

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:20.830
anything about Kanye

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:27.460
anymore my beautiful doctor said what no

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:30.750
I don't understand there's no like

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:33.040
that's the end of that anecdote anyway

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:34.720
throw this bomb down I realized by the

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:37.870
way why are damage is not good it is

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:41.410
because we have tech - so tech - is

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:43.930
always a damage multiplier but in the

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:45.820
less than one proportion you know it's

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:48.310
it's a damage multiplier but it lowers

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:49.690
your damage you can still multiply

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:51.550
things and make them smaller you just

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:57.700
multiply them by something that's less

00:27:51.550 --> 00:28:00.490
than one my free alright we've one easy

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:01.870
run but a little bit on the longer side

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:03.250
because we went further so that's going

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:05.710
