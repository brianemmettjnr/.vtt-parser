00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.680
hey everybody welcome back to northern

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.420
lion plays the binding of issac

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.330
afterbirth plus we got Oh Nance Street

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.490
today this is one of the I think I would

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.880
say fan favorites at least to watch when

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.710
you miss you take damage is that I

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.580
believe that's correct oh we got charge

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.960
bars and this one as well so we

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.519
officially as of right now can miss once

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.279
chocolate milk is a huge get on this one

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.550
I actually forgot that it was was part

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.590
of the loadout

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.290
basically we need HP it's a Judas run

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.020
and if you you don't have to hit an

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.860
enemy I guess but you have to hit

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:46.760
something or you run the risk of dying

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:50.670
so an early game spirit heart would

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.469
pardon me I must have tapped by accident

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.789
an early game spirit art or something

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.010
like I'm not even counting that one

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.800
that's BS an early game spirit heart or

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.859
something like that would be meaningful

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.610
barring that hey you miss 100% of the

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:11.280
shots you don't take so as long as we

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:12.659
know no no how though you're gonna tell

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.450
me that if I miss with the creep shot

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.070
hits a wall I'm gonna take damage or

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.229
what the creep shot killed the enemy so

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.990
our chocolate milk shot missed okay sure

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.900
whatever you say range down fairly

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.030
irrelevant honestly an early game range

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:33.360
down doesn't mean a whole heck of a lot

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:36.299
all we need to do damage is quite good

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.939
right now all we need to do get an HP

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.220
upgrade preferably some means of which

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.009
to replenish our HP in the future and

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.229
then the world's our oyster oh my god

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.939
dude creep shot is actually horrible for

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.770
this I have no idea but it turns out

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.600
that it's actually complete garbage

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.170
because if it kills an enemy and then

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.000
you shoot you're just done so yeah we'll

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.799
I mean we're not gonna have really any

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
choice in the matter here but because of

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.979
course of the blind but we're gonna try

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.610
to avoid falling victim to that in the

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.610
future here

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.520
kind of maybe just take an extra second

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.010
in every item room where we can see the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.330
item and just go is there a bed part of

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.000
this like is there something about this

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.790
that might be particularly bad on a an

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.190
ona on street challenge to be fair I

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.260
don't think I even remembered that creep

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.330
shot actually causes you to sometimes

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.080
shoot a you know a tear of its own

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.160
independence we should look for a spirit

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.200
heart because this could also give us

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.510
deal with the devil chances which could

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.920
be valuable we might as well check - a

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.660
diamonds is good in fact as of right now

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.470
two of diamonds that has made us one

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.330
cent so you know don't don't be looking

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.050
down on that right now it's pretty huge

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.150
this was a good first floor we also got

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.810
an HP upgrade we're gonna head down to

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.220
the next floor maybe like two or three

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.200
more HP upgrades that start to feel

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.620
pretty confident about this but I like

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.420
that the the terms of this run are very

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.400
obvious you know it's very easy to

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.800
figure out what we're doing here little

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.650
gurdy by the way is not a ten out of ten

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.190
in my opinion reason is it could kill

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.739
enemies I'm gonna give it like a little

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.030
more love here but it could kill enemies

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.890
and we don't want it to kill enemies

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.360
because that means that our shot that

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.579
comes right after it might actually miss

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.100
it's kind of a situation I would prefer

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:38.459
not to find myself in enemies rushing us

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:43.769
down from all sides fourteen cents but

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:45.600
half a spirit heart remaining just be

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:50.459
very careful as well not to like

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.230
DoubleTap accidentally ooh so now I

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.859
really think that that eternal heart

00:03:52.230 --> 00:04:00.720
might represent a game win we just need

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:03.720
to actually all that was bad I need to

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.060
give it a chance to manifest itself into

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.530
existence now I'm not the contrary to

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.260
what you might think I'm I I'm not

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.810
really looking for something to beat the

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.579
system converters obviously no good here

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.010
I think we will take starter deck that's

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.570
pretty solid High Priestesses

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:23.060
potentially great ace of clubs is

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.060
irrelevant I'll buy a three cent key is

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:30.509
and then we'll go to our item room or we

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:35.789
get proptosis which I don't think is

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:36.690
gonna ruin the run I know you might be

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.130
worried because you're like oh your

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.419
shots will I go through enemies now

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.669
maybe maybe not

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:44.849
mostly I'm happy to have 17 damaged so

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.780
let's get a high priestess out here lay

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.569
the SmackDown

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.919
I don't necessarily need brimstone here

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.990
is what I'm getting at if they gave it

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.020
to me sure I would be stoked I am a

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.759
human being you know I can't tell a lie

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.340
we would probably have almost guaranteed

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:00.690
win however I'm content to do the

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.970
challenge the way they want me to do the

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:07.800
challenge we've kind of got a nearly

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:10.440
ideal way of doing that right now at

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.050
least I think I mean we got 17 damage

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.000
and I'm not sure that's 17 damage per

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:20.729
shot fully charged with chocolate milk

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.319
or 17 damage per shot not charged at all

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:26.900
with chocolate milk which is its own

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:29.909
kind of unique little mess there but

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:33.930
suffice to say our existing damage is

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:36.750
very good got a couple of things on the

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.150
go like it would be wise to keep our uh

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:42.330
our spirit hearts as strong as possible

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:46.620
it would be wise to rush a little bit uh

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:51.650
I can't imagine rubber cement being bad

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:54.780
here as long as our shot hits an enemy

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:57.659
before it starts bouncing anything it

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.180
catches after the bounce is like gravy

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:02.190
as far as I'm aware at least now this is

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.159
I and again I like that afterbirth did

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:07.830
this but the hard challenges go longer

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:10.409
for whatever reason like this is much

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:13.650
much harder than Pride Day but it's also

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:18.810
much more interesting in my opinion at

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:21.960
least so let's try a at our card got one

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.449
cent out of it hoping maybe we got a

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.900
little bit more but not too perturbed

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:29.120
either way oh and it's a doubled item

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.030
room that's right

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.030
if anything I actually think that we

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:38.930
might get a second crack when we miss

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:41.300
what that hit though on that that's not

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.729
me saying oh but that should've hit

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.340
that's me saying I saw that shot hit an

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:48.169
enemy unless I'm losing it here

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.610
speed and range upgrade is fine the

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:51.610
spirit arts probably more valuable

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:00.440
we got like above this just being a fun

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.330
challenge sometimes see that bothers me

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.419
above this just being a fun challenge

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:08.510
sometimes or right now this is also like

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:13.669
a really cool run in its in its present

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:15.410
state please be a tinted rock no but I

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:18.500
think we'll explore a little we already

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:20.120
found our secret room my bed I think

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.800
we'll do a little bit more exploring to

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:25.400
try to get a key if we can't buy one on

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.180
the shop which we can't but I'll take

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.770
buddy in a box

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.570
assuming buddy in a box the shots don't

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:33.289
count as a miss if they do I will be

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:36.310
very very displeased I think we should

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:41.020
prepare ourselves for the possibility of

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:43.580
randomly taking damage I think we may

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:47.180
find ourselves taking a little bit of

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:50.539
phantom damage sometimes that as of

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:52.840
right now I can't really figure out a

00:07:50.539 --> 00:07:52.840
cause for

00:07:55.390 --> 00:08:00.170
kind of on edge that like every time we

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.220
do it we're gonna get popped but every

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.750
time we shoot that is we're gonna get

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:05.000
popular so far it's actually been

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:06.440
relatively okay I think I'm gonna try

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.360
just to get like a magic mushroom

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.460
something like that or a a good pill

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:13.250
that's gonna hurt yeah that we deserve

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:16.100
that one alone up to that one this is

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:19.790
just a random room so I wanted to check

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:21.980
it out it is gonna give us bookworm and

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:23.360
I think you also might want to look it

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.730
we got a lot of things that oh you know

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:34.180
what dice shard you might want to look

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:34.180
at maybe taking I was gonna say taking

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:42.860
how to jump there but Boca Belial is

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:44.990
probably fine to keep sneeze - okay you

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.760
know what it is it's somebody in a box

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:48.140
occasionally killing enemies especially

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:53.180
like buddy in a box

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:54.860
shooting through thank you buddy in a

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.960
box shooting through multi-dimensional

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:59.660
baby and amping up like the value of

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:02.420
that amping up the value of that tier

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:04.820
and causing us to take damage as a

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:07.180
result so it's actually like quite bad I

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:11.210
should not have taken buddy in a box

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:12.890
maybe that's the the real danger on this

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:15.170
run is accidentally taking items that

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:18.230
make things that are your tears too good

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:19.010
but reserving judgment on that cuz we're

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:22.490
still killing it

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:25.160
I think shoopdawhoop actually an amazing

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:26.570
choice now the reason shoopdawhoop is so

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.460
good is cuz we might be able to skirt

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:31.520
let's do that again we might be able to

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:35.750
skirt around the requirements for a onan

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:39.530
streak might be able to just walk into a

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:41.090
room if you don't hit an enemy with

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.320
shoopdawhoop you take damage or did I

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:44.900
kill it with the loop and take damage

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:47.780
because my dear miss like don't charge a

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:52.070
shot walk in here smack em didn't take

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:56.500
damage so all we need to almost almost

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:56.500
guarantee ourselves a win is

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:04.190
the ability to use that more than once

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:06.960
per room all right sorry once per room

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:09.780
the way that we would do that is by

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.220
getting like none sad well not a nun's

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:14.940
habit I suppose but nine-volt for

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:17.100
example so what we should do is not

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.480
charge up a shot rate when we're about

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:22.590
to use it it's gonna be a hard habit to

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:26.130
break but I think it's worth it yeah I'm

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:28.500
I find myself compelled we could also

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:29.910
and I know you're in your brains you're

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:33.330
trying to work this one out and say is

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:36.720
this a good idea I probably should have

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:40.860
been hit there could we use IV bag to

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:43.560
avoid the damage that we were gonna step

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:47.610
on the creep that time I'm a little mad

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:53.700
could I use IV bag to dodge the damage

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:57.630
that I'm taking from missing an ona and

00:10:53.700 --> 00:11:00.960
street shot I'm assuming the answer is

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:05.160
no but I'm also leaving it open that the

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:07.080
answer could be yes if you timed it like

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:09.120
perfectly which I don't trust us to do

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:15.710
we've started to take more damage than

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:15.710
I'm happy with to be honest

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:25.600
honestly buddy in a box might be able to

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:25.600
win this run by itself at this point

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:34.459
want that we definitely want the spirit

00:11:29.029 --> 00:11:36.410
heart as well who I mean we don't need

00:11:34.459 --> 00:11:37.790
the damage so I'm just gonna I'm gonna

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.440
speed this one up a little bit by taking

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:40.820
the ability to fly but I'll admit that

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.320
the less read hearts we have the more

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.870
dangerous this run becomes there's no

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:50.360
question but at least now we can do

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:51.860
stuff like this I'm a little worried

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.589
that what's happening is like I'm

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:57.589
creating so many shots by a bookworm and

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:59.329
you know multi-dimensional baby and then

00:11:57.589 --> 00:12:00.800
rubber cement causes them to like bounce

00:11:59.329 --> 00:12:03.139
around and the hitbox is enormous

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:05.750
because of proptosis and like sometimes

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:07.730
the tears will I don't know maybe like

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:09.800
the multi-dimensional baby or bookworm

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:11.810
tear is killing an enemy but my tear is

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:14.870
not hitting them and as a result I'm

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:16.910
taking damage for that but like I've

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:19.790
confused myself and the game pretty

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:25.930
thoroughly right here I don't want to

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:29.720
leave without going to the item room and

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:33.260
I don't I mean I sort of do want to do

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:35.540
boss rush but see that irritates me

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:41.449
because like those shots are hitting

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:45.740
that one didn't really but like where's

00:12:41.449 --> 00:12:51.139
the line where's the line what is the

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:56.510
line okay we got a spear in our back I'm

00:12:51.139 --> 00:12:58.610
like a little less mad magic mush is

00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:00.019
huge I guess this one kind of irritates

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:03.139
me about these challenges to begin with

00:13:00.019 --> 00:13:05.750
like I I still appreciate them being in

00:13:03.139 --> 00:13:08.240
the game and and definitely like when

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:11.449
they came out I was most looking forward

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.649
to like multiple expansions to play the

00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:14.000
challenges because that's kind of like

00:13:12.649 --> 00:13:15.680
oh they're probably gonna introduce me

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.300
to the new stuff from the from the set

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:20.269
without me having to find it naturally

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:21.680
which is nice but sometimes the game it

00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:24.110
feels like it doesn't necessarily play

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:26.870
by its own rules now as always I'll

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:29.270
leave open the possibility that I'm

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:31.860
making like a big mistake here we need

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:33.780
then I'm making a big mistake here and I

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.980
just don't know why I'm not taking

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:39.900
damage but I think I have it like

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:43.080
reasonably diagnosed I think it's my

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:44.850
bookworm shot killing an enemy and my

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.320
normal shot not touching an enemy

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:51.410
because the bookworm shot killed it

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:55.740
now I would argue and you may disagree I

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:58.200
would argue personally that the bookworm

00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:00.920
shot is mightier and as a result should

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.920
count as an enemy

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:05.090
we got a try

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:20.010
Tammi said huh there's something here

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:25.410
shoopdawhoop is also great but hear me

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:31.380
out I'm also trying to run before like

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:36.810
my tears Dee instance in the hopes that

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:38.580
that would be enough what maybe I

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:43.500
actually touched an enemy that time

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:46.860
because otherwise I don't see it no okay

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:49.650
well I guess we're running running out

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:54.720
the clock here because Tammy's head

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:56.820
apparently it certainly should not be if

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.110
every shot does not touch an enemy you

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.450
take damage if that's the way it is

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:02.250
we'll stop using it ASAP but I refuse to

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:08.610
believe that they'd flub that to that

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:10.850
extent that's like that's too much no

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:10.850
keys

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:17.910
yeah okay so that didn't hurt me so I

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:21.150
don't know it's possible every shot did

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:23.040
touch an enemy in there just stay

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:25.080
vigilant you know we could always if we

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:30.900
have to we could use bombs for like a

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:32.910
whole floor I'm not sure if leaving sure

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:35.910
just gone in I'm not sure if leaving a

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:38.040
floor causes us to no longer have a

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:39.210
chance to get hit by the enemies there

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.500
but that's kind of the Assumption I'm

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:44.370
operating under right now it's why I'm

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:46.590
leaving ASAP ah we got the Sun the Sun

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:51.180
is definitely full health at this point

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:54.350
that was just dumb but okay not as dumb

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.350
as that was apparently

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:05.880
like I don't want to make it seem like

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:08.170
it's a huge deal but I'm a little mad

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:10.660
we're almost dead so I guess we'll just

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:11.980
pop that I I guess we're not gonna use

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.660
Tammy's head any longer

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.250
blow you up for a better deal with the

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.240
devil chance in a secret room the secret

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:18.130
rooms not what I wanted

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.750
oh you know what give me more HP then we

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:23.550
got a chance to bail ourselves out here

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:26.170
on the second-to-last floor already so

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:27.880
let's not throw ourselves like throw our

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:29.230
whole life away for just because we're a

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:33.610
little mad that Tammy's head isn't

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:39.850
working here be a little a little

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:42.550
unreasonable so I think you might as

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:47.110
well at least like give this guy a

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:48.600
little love and I'll take it cuz I'm not

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:51.850
a baby

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:53.590
we got a health downgrade everything

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:55.600
else mostly went up except for speed

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:56.650
yeah we could fail this one if we fail

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.940
this one we'll just do it over again

00:16:56.650 --> 00:17:00.100
because it's been a pretty short one

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:01.240
here in fact one way or the other we'll

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.740
probably throw something else at the end

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:05.709
of this video maybe a second crack of

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:10.000
the speed challenge for example but yeah

00:17:05.709 --> 00:17:12.459
my my game plan right now is get this BS

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.060
challenge done forever because I'm

00:17:12.459 --> 00:17:23.319
hidden enemies and yet I'm taking damage

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:25.120
from what we're I request like an audit

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:28.240
of where this damage is coming from cuz

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:29.770
it's it's not fair right now I'm not

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:33.070
like trying to be a baby about it I'm

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:35.670
just saying you know we've we've done

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:35.670
our part

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:41.820
two hearts that's relatively big right

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:43.140
now so we don't need the magician we

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.460
don't need a sick loved so we don't need

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.980
credit card let's see is there another

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:49.040
card up here there's not probably at all

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:51.390
those I guess we'll take the magician

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:53.550
it's not like we need much help hitting

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:57.600
enemies but might as well get a fool

00:17:53.550 --> 00:18:01.170
card another moon card and a Huggle Oz

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:05.790
room used hoggle oz moon is like a

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:08.040
teleport fools like a teleport don't

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:16.200
think it really matters where we

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:18.030
teleport I gotta tell you I'll be happy

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.980
just to see this one done I went into

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:26.550
this one with high hopes and I think

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:29.670
it's been entertaining but also like my

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:37.010
bad I guess also like very scary on the

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:39.780
bright side we did two cheese's me off

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:41.760
I'm not I'm not gonna shoot as the thing

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:43.320
I'm not gonna shoot until we have to

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:47.850
buddy in a box you can do it

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:49.410
bombs you can do it why would I waste my

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.970
time shooting when there's like a 40%

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:53.300
chance I take damage even if the enemy

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:53.300
gets hit

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:10.929
be cool be cool that was like the

00:19:08.799 --> 00:19:13.649
opposite of being cool you almost walked

00:19:10.929 --> 00:19:13.649
right into the shot

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:31.700
one of these days that'll work this is

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:36.580
the safest option I wish it weren't we

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:36.580
could also blow up the door I suppose

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:42.010
but nah why risk it dude

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:50.300
supposed to risk it for the biscuit I'm

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.690
not getting any biscuit or Triscuit even

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.970
here

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:55.160
you're the serving size of Triscuits is

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:57.170
for crackers I get that they're thicker

00:19:55.160 --> 00:20:01.480
than your average cracker but like come

00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:06.350
on that's unreasonable for crackers

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:08.360
that's not enough that's not not even

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:12.220
enough to think about it being a snack

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:16.640
much less like achieve snack we essence

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:20.290
please pretty good I mean we probably

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.290
should have just used it on the bot I

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:32.990
actually like put full responsibility

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:37.180
for that loss on the developers should I

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:37.180
have done what I did there probably not

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:42.590
turns out if you fire a shot which by

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:46.310
the way I want to point out I did not

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:48.950
fire a shot the shot fired

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:52.430
when I walked or when I use the chariot

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:55.250
card the shot fired but how much of that

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:56.660
damage was from stuff that at least from

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:58.490
the player perspective felt like it

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.930
never should have hit us right I'm not

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:05.030
talking about enemy's walking into us

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:07.850
I'm talking about you know shots looking

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:08.840
like they hit but counting is misses for

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:11.210
one reason or another

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:12.740
I'm not mad because I'm you know it

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:15.140
might surprise you giving me the

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:18.020
character that I play on the ISS more or

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:19.310
less but I'm an easygoing guy I'm happy

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.390
to do the challenge again I like playing

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:21.620
The Binding of Isaac I think it's a

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:24.170
great video game one of the best video

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:26.750
games ever made that was my bad on that

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:31.360
shot I actually slipped off the thing

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:31.360
there but that was BS

00:21:31.539 --> 00:21:37.669
even if that last bit of damage we took

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:39.080
was in BS if that was deserved and I

00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:42.500
could I could see you making a case for

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:44.830
that the all the damage that we took

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:47.659
leading up to it was BS like super BS

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:54.980
teleport 2.0 alright instead of book a

00:21:47.659 --> 00:22:01.159
Belial bold decision but I do think it's

00:21:54.980 --> 00:22:04.250
an interesting challenge I just think it

00:22:01.159 --> 00:22:07.460
sort of doesn't work Lisa doesn't work

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:13.429
with the with some of the items that the

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:19.309
game has added it's a shame too because

00:22:13.429 --> 00:22:22.330
that was like a really cool run we were

00:22:19.309 --> 00:22:24.409
doing a ton of damage having a good time

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:26.330
and now it's gone

00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:30.019
rate of fire is like wait worse damage

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:38.750
is quite good no HP so we're still

00:22:30.019 --> 00:22:40.399
knocking on heaven's door here I got

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:42.110
faith I don't want to leave this episode

00:22:40.399 --> 00:22:46.309
with this one intact I'm I'm kind of

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:47.840
like almost missed I'm kind of like I'm

00:22:46.309 --> 00:22:49.610
a little disappointed by the number of

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.019
challenges I've I failed it hasn't been

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:52.970
that many but it's been enough to kind

00:22:51.019 --> 00:22:56.059
of only-begotten that slightly earlier

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:58.009
but um it's been kind of I was hoping to

00:22:56.059 --> 00:22:59.389
you know a sight read all of them even

00:22:58.009 --> 00:23:00.830
if it wasn't in the first attempt at

00:22:59.389 --> 00:23:03.860
least over the course of the first video

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:06.220
that hasn't been the case this time and

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:09.019
that's okay well you know life goes on I

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:12.169
think we have gotten kind of unduly

00:23:09.019 --> 00:23:14.269
screwed on a couple of them this one

00:23:12.169 --> 00:23:17.870
might take the cake for being like the

00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:21.200
biggest screw job bomber boys great it's

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:24.370
dicey and it costs us our only bomb but

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:34.299
you know what let's do it now I'm aware

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:36.919
if we find our secret rooms we can use

00:23:34.299 --> 00:23:40.340
teleport 2.0 to give us a deal with the

00:23:36.919 --> 00:23:41.970
devil regardless so you might want to

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:44.250
consider that

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:46.470
might even be able to get a narrow room

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:50.880
out of it whether we want that is I

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:53.010
guess the secondary question a narrow

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:55.530
room that is I guess we why wouldn't we

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:56.580
so we should go to the shop probably

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:57.870
shouldn't have spent the key but you

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:59.580
know what this is actually pretty good

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:02.880
so we'll get that we'll get a spirit

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:04.170
heart for three cents and then now every

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.890
shop for the rest of the game will be

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:14.460
cheaper and then this is probably our

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:16.980
second secret room inside of which we

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:19.410
get good pills range ups okay

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:23.360
lockup is good explosive diarrhea is

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:24.780
very dangerous speed up is great

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.300
hematemesis

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:33.660
not good right now but certainly good

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:37.170
overall just like land over here thank

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:39.540
you you should be dead this part okay we

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:42.350
wasted two bombs doing that actually

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.350
pretty stupid of me

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:50.040
so because we got a deal this should

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:51.540
give us a narrow room copy you okay

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:54.660
we're like absolutely extraordinarily

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:56.520
well worth it then teleport out get a

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:59.760
narrow room the air room is a bunch of

00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:00.960
judgments and blood banks I don't think

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.850
there's anything to be done here like we

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:07.530
could blow them up and we'd stand to

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:08.970
maybe get more than we spent especially

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:14.160
we can get a blood bag on one of these

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:17.190
early plays but for the most part I'm

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:22.500
pretty happy with the with the payout we

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:25.440
got there but not huge gets but still

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:27.210
pretty good pretty good pretty good now

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.920
I don't really want to take that

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:31.800
approach with every floor that we come

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:33.390
across to be honest with you I don't

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:37.860
know you might want to drop Isaac's head

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:39.750
even we know there's decent pills so

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:42.300
let's take acid baby Isaac's head

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:45.440
shouldn't make a big deal there might

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:48.510
come a time where it kills an enemy and

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:51.740
and we miss as a result but hopefully

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:51.740
it's they're few and far between

00:25:52.430 --> 00:26:00.720
so that's pretty much the reason that

00:25:56.750 --> 00:26:04.110
acid baby got taken it's the the chance

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:09.180
of their plausibly being a balls of

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:10.200
steel pill in the rotation means a lot

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:12.420
to me thank you

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:14.400
we're keys I would love to hit the shop

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:16.080
on this floor but mostly I'm trying to

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:21.030
minimize the number of rooms that we go

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:23.250
to you know what I actually think

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:26.040
remote detonator and the key is a

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:28.380
totally okay purchase maybe a card as

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:31.560
well strength card basically free deal

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:36.900
with the devil yeah okay I'm not against

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:39.420
this I we still have basically uh shops

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:43.070
worth of items left in our in our wallet

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:43.070
right now that's a nasty bit of damage

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:52.650
so I'm fairly for it we don't need to

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:58.050
use teleport 2.0 always as a deal with

00:26:52.650 --> 00:27:01.890
the devil machine might be advisable in

00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:04.790
in most circumstances it's not

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:04.790
compulsory

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:14.049
to yourself very good okay down to the

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:15.760
next floor this is not me rushing

00:27:14.049 --> 00:27:17.230
because I want to finish the run quickly

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:19.389
this is me rushing because the less

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:21.549
rooms we do the better it is for us just

00:27:19.389 --> 00:27:24.639
like scientifically speaking

00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:26.110
so the Empress is not I mean it's about

00:27:24.639 --> 00:27:28.539
as good as the strength card except for

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:31.000
the lack of HP the Empress is more like

00:27:28.539 --> 00:27:33.549
devil card analog we're just using

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.429
teleport 2.0 as if it were teleport 1.0

00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:37.809
right now I think that might be balls of

00:27:36.429 --> 00:27:39.820
my it's either balls of steel or

00:27:37.809 --> 00:27:44.980
addicted kind of a big difference

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:46.590
between the two addicted that's much

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:51.760
worse

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:54.519
we're not unstoppable in case that's not

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:57.340
blended lee clear we're not unstoppable

00:27:54.519 --> 00:28:02.799
when it comes to our HP right now so got

00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:05.380
a Christ just die please we got to make

00:28:02.799 --> 00:28:06.610
a real effort not to not to take dumb

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:11.320
damage so we've never seen this before

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:21.220
or is it it makes you larger still a

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:23.169
highly loser bull run unfortunately oh I

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:25.330
almost missed with that one I almost

00:28:23.169 --> 00:28:28.029
walked into the enemy right after bomb

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:32.139
bag is good bomber boy is extremely

00:28:28.029 --> 00:28:34.179
positive for us so you know the more

00:28:32.139 --> 00:28:35.610
bombs we can get the merrier the money

00:28:34.179 --> 00:28:39.519
is out of control

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:44.620
Lebowski be very careful about those

00:28:39.519 --> 00:28:47.590
bomber boy bombs like that was also too

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:49.120
close for comfort in my opinion we're

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:50.919
very lucky that like one-hit kills an

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:55.960
enemy so we don't have to overly you

00:28:50.919 --> 00:28:59.380
know belabor the point here but nah I

00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:00.250
mean it's decent but now we're looking

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:02.169
for

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:05.320
speaking of which we also did not get

00:29:02.169 --> 00:29:08.380
any guppy items from the cursor room

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:11.760
there so well we're on the subject of

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:11.760
not war looking for

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:22.610
we'd be very careful here these are the

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:24.410
rooms that can screw you it's not so

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:26.450
much rooms with like tough enemies it's

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:32.360
more rooms with a lot of enemies that

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:35.120
find themselves being the toughest dull

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:38.840
razor we don't get any benefit from

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:41.840
being hit right now okay

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:43.280
well by the three Sankey again there's

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.720
there's a chance you know if he got like

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.580
a theme on this floor we got a pretty

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:48.110
good chance at a deal with the devil or

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:58.790
angel not that the angel can give us a

00:29:48.110 --> 00:30:02.170
theme but Jesus me up might want to take

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:08.960
a crack at that to be honest with you

00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:12.410
well see how things go first Wow linger

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:16.580
beaner sorry depression nuked an enemy

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:19.880
with the the Lord of Light the enemy no

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:22.430
longer existed as a result I took damage

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:24.580
when I took a shot at it that's a new

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:24.580
one

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:31.500
yeah I deserve that one that was

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:35.160
impatience we have moldy bread we didn't

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:37.140
get any sort of deal did we not go to

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:38.640
our curse room there not spend enough

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.560
time in the curse room to count is being

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:43.130
in the curse room it's gotta be honest

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:45.210
game kind of on thin ice right now

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:48.630
choosing me off a little bit with these

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:51.120
BS runs multiple one makes you larger

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:54.030
pills do manifest in it in a way that is

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:57.510
kind of cool but we definitely went in

00:30:54.030 --> 00:31:02.490
here but unfortunately I feel like we

00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:06.960
have to go back in because we need to

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:09.000
check off the room so that our pill

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.320
actually or sorry our teleport actually

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.550
works for us so the first one is gonna

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.410
take us to a deal with the devil and

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:15.030
there's a battery charge we can use that

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:17.030
to get to an air room I think that both

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:23.080
of those are like worth quite a lot

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:25.360
potentially so waiting for blood bag

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:29.050
[Music]

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:31.600
normally normally you don't have to

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:33.880
complete a run or complete a room for it

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:36.430
to count but apparently this time you

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:38.050
black powder black powder I'm going to

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:40.120
take and I'll explain why very

00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:43.090
succinctly it's a way that we can kill

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:46.750
enemies that does not require us to

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:49.990
shoot which could be an important

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:50.970
difference maker long term here maybe

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:52.660
maybe not

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:53.950
we're gonna have a hundred percent

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:55.960
chance of a deal on the next floor

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:58.210
should we survive at least so the

00:31:55.960 --> 00:32:02.400
strength card still has value breath of

00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:02.400
life doesn't but we just got HP back

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:08.560
take the range upgrade obviously take

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:10.810
dad we get a son card which is extremely

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:12.130
valuable probably more valuable than a

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:16.060
strength card if I'm being honest

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:17.890
strength strength empress nothing to

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:25.420
re-roll unfortunately balls of steel

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:27.580
lovely item where's the Sun Empress Sun

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:30.630
there we go okay pop down to the next

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.630
floor sure to blow that guy up

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:39.490
we're on necropolis 1 how he didn't die

00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:43.000
in one hit

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:45.160
Wow what's the value of the Sun full

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:49.450
health it means pretty much what it all

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:52.350
comes down to I'm gonna be

00:32:49.450 --> 00:33:00.100
extraordinarily tempted to use it before

00:32:52.350 --> 00:33:02.350
we need it IV bags still stinky there's

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:04.750
a cheeky play with it hear that I hate I

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:09.490
don't I don't like it it's too risky for

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:14.770
no benefit I know there's there's bombs

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:18.790
and whatnot back there oh that was such

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:25.210
like just instinctual shot instinctive

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:28.570
instinct you'll just stood there and

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:30.040
watch that one come in got me

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:31.960
second-guessing myself pretty fly is

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:33.580
good probably some people out there

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:36.220
going you know why aren't you taking the

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:40.630
pills into the room it's a valid concern

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:42.610
I think I don't want to forget about the

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:44.290
Sun card but we would be getting some

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:46.750
damage from using the pills it's like a

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:49.480
mass poison I think it's a smart idea to

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:52.179
use the pills as a mask poison despite

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:53.740
the fact that occasionally we might kill

00:33:52.179 --> 00:33:55.929
an enemy that we were shooting at and

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:58.210
cause ourselves some problems but for

00:33:55.929 --> 00:34:02.650
now I'm just doing it to be essentially

00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:06.450
overly cautious make sure that we keep

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:06.450
the the dream of this Sun card alive

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:19.320
you know what that's a thank you and

00:34:12.410 --> 00:34:22.080
thank you again very very nice pickup

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:23.490
there I think we probably have it at

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:26.550
this point but I thought we were lights

00:34:23.490 --> 00:34:28.590
out on the last run - and as far as I'm

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:30.570
concerned we still were lights out on

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:33.240
the last run the run itself decided to

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:35.430
screw us I'm not at all going to worry

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:39.810
about a shop here and the reason for

00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:42.240
that is very simple I really thought

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:45.900
this was the Deaf sex out for the Deaf

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:49.350
side - rather it's a tough situation

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:53.340
here you gotta just throw a bomb down

00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:56.459
and get out it'll do it'll do

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:56.459
[Music]

00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:01.590
got our deal we got damaged balls of

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:08.160
steel perks fairly good with the sun's

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:12.300
way better oh I think this is like a

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:17.400
test and are the way we win this test is

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:19.320
by not taking anything we need these red

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:21.480
hearts so the sun card provides the

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:24.960
value that it was destined to do as was

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:27.660
written sure we could have upped our

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:32.310
damage but is the crux of this run

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:33.840
damage nah we don't need 17 damage to we

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:36.060
have 17 damage I should say we don't

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:38.220
need any more than 17 damage surely to

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:39.930
accomplish what we set out for on this

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:42.450
run that's gonna hurt yeah I mean they

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:48.810
pushed the bomb they pushed the bomb

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:53.340
into me but I also sort of sat there so

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:55.140
we got Stompie but we didn't get our we

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:56.430
didn't get an HP upgrade which for some

00:35:55.140 --> 00:36:04.260
reason I thought we were entitled to

00:35:56.430 --> 00:36:05.760
after after 3-1 makes you larger I would

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:11.550
like to preserve the deal with the devil

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:12.840
chance as much as this regard I'd still

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:17.310
like to preserve the deal with the devil

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:20.160
chance as much as possible it's just not

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:22.410
too likely right now getting lots of HP

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:24.150
do the luck is at 5 that should lead to

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:26.250
a lot of red hearts getting dropped and

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:31.050
a floor full of golden bombs is a dream

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:33.090
come true this floor is more like I

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:35.190
would really like to hit the shop on

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:36.510
this one you're gonna say oh you idiot

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:38.280
then what are you doing you just split

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:44.940
it well we got unlimited teleports so

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:46.950
I'm not too worried about not getting to

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:49.830
the shop before the boss fight we might

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:53.220
as well teleport out take something from

00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:55.890
boss rush lord knows it was bad

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:57.660
lord knows we're basically more than

00:36:55.890 --> 00:37:00.060
entitled to whatever the game wants to

00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:05.380
give us here please be dead that was

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:09.070
very close polaroid could be big

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:11.650
ish I guess these six versus teleporting

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:16.600
so these six are a tack fly and I think

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:19.660
you go d6 here we roll that little brim

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:21.880
use the Sun get full HP now we can't

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:25.800
teleport out okay so I am actually the

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:27.790
world's dumbest moron I got rid of my

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:30.040
teleporting ability which was the whole

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:33.070
reason I was in here to begin with now

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:38.860
we actually have to fight with own and

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:40.930
streak on boss rush I might be one of

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:44.560
the dumbest people that's ever lived on

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:46.000
planet earth sure I mean straight up

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:51.520
thanks for the spirit hearts I really

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:52.720
appreciate it at the same time not

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:57.600
making me feel too good about myself

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:59.950
right now that one's on me

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.310
so if you'll allow me don't shoot don't

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:02.770
shoot

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:08.980
if you'll allow me I'd like to deflect

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:10.890
and yell at the game again for forcing

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:13.150
me to be in this position to begin with

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:14.980
when we should have just won on the last

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:16.750
run now you might say I know that's

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:18.640
deflecting personal responsibility

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:22.180
you're exactly correct that's why I'm

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:25.510
doing it so we got golden bombs

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:30.460
we're always not lost yet use said

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:36.460
golden bombs most enemies will die but

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:40.750
beyond most enemies dying when they when

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:45.340
they face a golden bomb you also just

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:48.600
like can't take damage that was bad

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:48.600
can't take damage from using them

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:58.190
I accept when you hit yourself what

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:58.190
you've done 20 times but

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:14.790
are you like you've been reprogrammed

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:21.990
with google deepmind when did you become

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:27.360
so resistant to bombs we're allowed to

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:31.100
miss a little bit I am a little bit

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:31.100
salty I lost the Sun card

00:39:36.949 --> 00:39:41.759
what we have to do now is actually beat

00:39:39.479 --> 00:39:44.130
this challenge with boss rush that way

00:39:41.759 --> 00:39:45.839
we can make fun of everybody else who

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:47.939
didn't we could be like wow you guys

00:39:45.839 --> 00:39:49.559
really oh you did own an Street but did

00:39:47.939 --> 00:39:51.420
you do it with boss rush hey did you

00:39:49.559 --> 00:39:53.309
needlessly do it with boss rush after

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:56.930
the game stole your rightful victory

00:39:53.309 --> 00:39:56.930
because of reasons

00:39:59.059 --> 00:40:02.219
now I also cannot teleport and get to

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:05.999
the shop

00:40:02.219 --> 00:40:08.160
so essentially rest assured no one is

00:40:05.999 --> 00:40:12.509
madder at me than me right now that

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:14.039
we're here I could be starting my

00:40:12.509 --> 00:40:16.680
weekend 15 minutes early

00:40:14.039 --> 00:40:21.719
instead of making a decision that there

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:25.579
was like literally no reason to human

00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:25.579
Tamizh this is great by the way we just

00:40:28.459 --> 00:40:34.099
just need to hold that until it becomes

00:40:30.959 --> 00:40:34.099
more relevant

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:43.170
you just get one tat

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:56.880
well.alright black powder

00:40:54.329 --> 00:40:59.069
there's other pills that we respect as

00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:04.619
well we don't have them right now but

00:40:59.069 --> 00:41:09.799
they exist tears upgrade pretty chief

00:41:04.619 --> 00:41:09.799
amongst them stay away please

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:21.840
I will feel fully redeemed if we get

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:24.480
something good for doing boss rush I

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:27.720
mean a speed upgrade is is not worth the

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:32.150
effort we're going to right now but it's

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:32.150
good especially with black powder

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:41.520
why am i taking one makes you larger

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:43.680
pills like bravado combined with idiocy

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:48.359
like take your pick there's there's many

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:59.520
different reasons I'm doing a lot of

00:41:48.359 --> 00:42:01.440
what I'm doing right now grey pale grey

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:05.930
pale orange peeled balls of steel keep

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:05.930
that in mind that's a big one

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:12.120
it's been a while since we had like a

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:14.220
classic NL facepalm like this though I

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:16.320
think this is you know it's good it's

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:19.220
good for me it's good for you good for

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.220
the goose good for the gander

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:30.020
that hit you're very lucky

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:30.020
please just be done

00:42:32.859 --> 00:42:42.400
ah I I was so confused I was walking

00:42:38.319 --> 00:42:44.289
backwards but it's cuz I was getting

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.739
pushed by war who was just too small to

00:42:44.289 --> 00:42:46.869
see

00:42:44.739 --> 00:42:54.849
we got camel Underpants four-year-old

00:42:46.869 --> 00:43:03.450
and a robo baby 2.0 thank God well seven

00:42:54.849 --> 00:43:05.890
luck good luck you'll need it I'm not

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:08.440
I'm not mad at the game anymore

00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:15.400
maybe that's the the ultimate blessing

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:19.869
here a mad at myself instead and we're

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:21.549
in a very strange spot because I I can't

00:43:19.869 --> 00:43:24.579
little brim without shooting and I can't

00:43:21.549 --> 00:43:26.980
shoot with that little brimming so I'm

00:43:24.579 --> 00:43:29.769
almost trying to screw around the

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:31.029
concerns here of killing an enemy with

00:43:29.769 --> 00:43:33.910
little brim and thus having our shot

00:43:31.029 --> 00:43:36.390
missed by just shooting kind of

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:36.390
rapid-fire

00:43:37.769 --> 00:43:44.099
head of the keeper strikes me as like

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:47.940
concentrated uselessness right now I

00:43:44.099 --> 00:43:53.289
think that's like our 18th pretty fly

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:54.970
wow what a whiff I don't want to fight

00:43:53.289 --> 00:43:59.559
this enemy on every room at this whole

00:43:54.970 --> 00:44:01.779
freaking game okay there's one of the

00:43:59.559 --> 00:44:09.999
greatest needle threadings I've ever

00:44:01.779 --> 00:44:11.200
seen I'm demoralized and he had not yet

00:44:09.999 --> 00:44:12.099
broken thanks for watching hope you guys

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:13.329
have enjoyed the episode if you think

00:44:12.099 --> 00:44:14.109
alike but upside great deal of course

00:44:13.329 --> 00:44:15.789
subscribe be honest more in the future

00:44:14.109 --> 00:44:20.130
but for now thanks for watching and I

00:44:15.789 --> 00:44:20.130
will see you next time I am a moron
