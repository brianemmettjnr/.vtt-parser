##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.780
everybody welcome acting on land please

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.420
binding of issac after earth plus we

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.960
didn't win in kind of a lot lately

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.630
feels good dude let's do some apollyon

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.170
boss rush we posted some Lilith runs

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.020
well a Lilith run maybe like a week ago

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:22.230
why 370 0 h9 w so I was thinking about

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.850
doing Lilith and my Lilith I people have

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.369
tweeted me and I think they're correct I

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.590
got like a mental block with Lilith it's

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.939
then here's what it is it's a

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.260
combination of the fact that the shot

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.790
doesn't come directly out of your body

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.829
even if it is just slightly askew

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.750
combined with the fact that because of

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.629
the knock back it's like harder to

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.620
adjust that second shot once I can get

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.730
over that little hump

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.230
we got nothing else to worry about well

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.850
that combined with the fact that the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.160
starting item is kind of garbage I am

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.199
gonna go for this you know you give me a

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.180
regular chest that cost me half a heart

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.719
to open if I got half a heart I'm

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.120
probably opening it cuz the odds are

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.550
well maybe not the odds are the odds are

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.840
not bad that you're getting a half

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.200
harder a full heart out of it regardless

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:12.659
so oftentimes you will pay for yourself

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.280
there instead we ended up getting bombs

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.689
and keys which could be you know more

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.770
than pay for themselves if we're able to

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.439
live long enough to bring them to

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.630
fruition so excited oh you know what you

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.580
got to suck up a double item room that's

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.439
plus two damage a little bit of speeding

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.729
a little bit of luck sure we there might

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.810
have been proptosis in there for all we

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.970
know there might have been some amazing

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.470
items but as far as I'm concerned that's

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.329
the closest you get to like a no-brainer

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.950
especially because I can't remember it

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.240
coming back no I might be wrong I was

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.130
gonna say on the doubled item rooms you

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.780
pick one but I think I'm incorrect I

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.700
think on the doubled item rooms you get

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.619
both because they're like quite rare so

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.619
that ended up being excellent we

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.180
probably well it's ugh it's a boss item

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.220
that we don't know unless it's a boss

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.750
that only gives us one kind of item so

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.200
if we fight like famine which we didn't

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.840
who is it's a hard boss to it's pretty

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.159
bad I'll use my other bomb and just

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.200
clear that guy out and I think that

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.610
probably paid for more than half of a

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.810
heart by itself right there just by

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.229
killing this guy before he could do

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.910
anything so lucky me we could suck up

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.500
the item if we wanted to we can buy a

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.650
battery charge and suck up the item but

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.860
I'm

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.480
gonna first off could be good it was

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.220
okay

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.480
secondly it would take too much money

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.980
away so we wouldn't have a chance to get

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.360
our arcade on the next floor which I'd

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.980
like to do if possible and we ended up

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.480
getting a spirit heart anyway and the

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.060
spirit art is gonna be what we want to

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.700
protect us from the deal with the devil

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.290
you know loss mitigation patrols so we

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.849
do have a goal on this mission by the

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.700
way let me check the post-it note we

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.709
want to well as long as we beat the run

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.810
we could do anything have you ever had a

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:50.549
dream that you wanted it to do you so

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.340
badly you can do anything but I got to

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.389
think about that for a second perthro

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.319
not worth using here because we have a

00:02:54.389 --> 00:03:00.959
reroll machine I think but we could we

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:04.049
could do Sheol we could do Cathedral

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.069
probably it's smarter to do Sheol just

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.409
because we haven't accomplished anything

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.000
on that track with apollyon yet so we

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.920
can kill like three birds with one stone

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.420
which at this point I got it what do we

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.099
have some kind of magic stone that

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.260
ricochets what is this divinity original

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.870
sin - an early candidate well actually

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.730
its September a candidate for northern

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.730
Lions game of the year against all odds

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:32.000
drop it a lot of bombs here but there's

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.599
value I think in here plus we got enough

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.560
nothing to worry about

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.790
um no but I got to think about that item

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.069
rumors you probably want to go for the

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.139
reroll and then if the reroll machine

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.609
breaks there's a couple of different

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.739
places where the flowchart ends we got a

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:49.370
good item we take it flowchart breaks

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.629
and we get a bad item flowchart breaks

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.970
re-roll machine breaks and we get a bad

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:57.780
item then we we think about it a little

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.590
bit more I think we could we could suck

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.590
it up at that point

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:10.120
it's a tough call because it's not bad

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.410
all that was stupid it's not bad to get

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.599
the ability to fly here but brother

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.540
Bobby's not really worth it so instead I

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:20.060
think we'll go for like a bit of a an

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:24.710
interesting reroll set up here and then

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:27.470
blow this guy up so we got Whore of

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.150
Babylon already active we can just snag

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.639
this HP we won't have Whore of Babylon

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.310
active after that but this is still very

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.979
good because it gives us and we'll just

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.450
suck that bad boy up right there it's

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.090
still very good for us because it gives

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.430
us the ability to get it in the future

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.620
plus we got humbling bundles so I think

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.419
this is a pretty solid pickup so let's

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.440
drop a bomb in here it's plunker sad not

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:53.750
bad but not good enough

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:58.940
what is this eyeball tears I have no

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:02.570
idea but we're kind of we're fully

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:07.700
committed now shot speed is like way

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:09.229
slower I'm excited fantastic one makes

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.520
you small what can we do with these

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:19.340
tears dude maybe like think they're

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:20.990
damaged up it's weird but much less

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.970
likely to get there because of a lack of

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.400
shot speed like damage up shot speed way

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.770
down but is it even damage up or they

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.430
just cosmetic like the tears are

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.680
eyeballs

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:36.950
doesn't seem like I can collect them or

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:38.810
anything so I don't know dude wonder if

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.280
we sucked up an active effect the last

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.710
time but I just haven't learned it yet

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.620
because it doesn't give you an

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:48.520
indication I don't think so I think we

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.520
got two stats ups

00:05:50.560 --> 00:06:00.740
the tears can ricochet off of one

00:05:53.120 --> 00:06:03.410
another is this any good okay we did not

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.670
get hit cuz I gonna be 100% honest with

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.670
you right now kind of seems like trash

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.930
ten cents

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.860
I mean we could buy a spirit out there

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.540
was one for sale I think I'm just not

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.960
fully convinced that this isn't garbage

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:24.610
yet I want to try something yeah so we

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.610
definitely got two passes last time

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.640
let's see if there's a secret room get

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:35.470
enough money potential we just got a

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.470
spirit ID directly which is also fine

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.070
eleven cents okay no no we still have a

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.930
great play here I mean we could also

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.250
shoot all that stuff but we do want to

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.470
make sure we're making it the boss rush

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:48.860
even though these eyeball tears I really

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:50.930
don't know if I'm missing what the value

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.610
of them is or if I'm seeing what the

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.550
value of them is and that's the scary

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.530
part I would prefer not to blow up our

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.840
reroll machine just because it slows us

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:02.450
down oh that's the moneymaker okay so we

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:07.220
grabbed that was there a reroll machine

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:11.750
on the shop no you could probably make a

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:14.240
case for just buying compass honestly so

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.830
let's do that okay let's leave then

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.630
we're actually fine as a result of

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.070
getting that spirit heart it's not like

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.920
our battery charge does anything else

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:24.080
like void just does not work for the

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.400
situation in the shop that is like it

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.650
doesn't allow you to steal the items so

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.720
I think we've made some okay decisions

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.920
here the worst decision as I see it

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.360
right now and I don't want to you know

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.220
there's been enough situations where

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.380
I've like disparaged an item and then it

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.940
turns out that it's actually good I just

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.680
didn't understand why it was good until

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:43.220
it was a little bit further along in the

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:46.030
game plan but I sort of don't understand

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:48.440
the value of these yet they they linger

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:51.170
so maybe if you have like a tear effect

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:55.160
or something they got they got some

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:56.569
inherent value there but somewhat

00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:00.469
skeptical

00:07:56.569 --> 00:08:03.319
they feel lady er can't deny that box of

00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:05.209
spiders get sucked up okay so there's

00:08:03.319 --> 00:08:06.619
not very good to suck up box of spiders

00:08:05.209 --> 00:08:09.860
just because we're never gonna get as

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:11.809
much of a use out of it as we might like

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:16.059
you know once every six rooms getting a

00:08:11.809 --> 00:08:16.059
couple of spiders not really that strong

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:23.119
it is very tempting to go for that but

00:08:19.819 --> 00:08:25.610
we are on pace still for boss rush that

00:08:23.119 --> 00:08:30.319
first like double item room void play

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:32.149
has been 10 out of 10 for us being able

00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:33.649
to get a damage upgrade it turns out was

00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:35.569
way more important than I had ever

00:08:33.649 --> 00:08:39.190
anticipated cuz even our first deal with

00:08:35.569 --> 00:08:41.630
the devil it was good but it wasn't a

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:43.990
wasn't a big coup for us from a damage

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:46.100
standpoint we gotta try this I think

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:48.649
even just getting some spirit out so

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:56.060
cool I will say if nothing else it looks

00:08:48.649 --> 00:09:02.269
cool see now you got a doing like a Mass

00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:03.829
Effect in my head are we better off like

00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:06.319
each one of these items has its own

00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:08.779
percentage chance and it's the same to

00:09:06.319 --> 00:09:11.110
become a good passive so I think with

00:09:08.779 --> 00:09:13.250
Seven Keys we want to take Guppies tail

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:14.449
obviously we're gonna re-roll because I

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:17.209
don't even know what the effect of these

00:09:14.449 --> 00:09:20.990
shots would be we're gonna re-roll or

00:09:17.209 --> 00:09:22.339
rather suck up curse die because it's

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:24.769
just not what we're looking for but

00:09:22.339 --> 00:09:26.600
Guppies tail a is a guppy item B we got

00:09:24.769 --> 00:09:29.360
a ton of keys so I think it's a sensible

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:31.699
approach for us here yeah yeah yeah

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:35.839
that's the moneymaker okay

00:09:31.699 --> 00:09:38.649
and it's I love the booster packs they

00:09:35.839 --> 00:09:41.540
always give me something to talk about I

00:09:38.649 --> 00:09:45.019
think maybe if you can get like piercing

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:47.180
eyes if the shots stay in the air for a

00:09:45.019 --> 00:09:49.850
long time after they hit an enemy then

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:52.040
that's really really good because you

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:53.779
could hit you know a Larry jr. once and

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.360
he'll just get roasted over and over

00:09:53.779 --> 00:09:58.790
potentially so we got extra luck I'm not

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:02.529
against it the extra shot speed is

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.529
actually pretty positive as well if we

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:08.359
we take that as something that's

00:10:05.179 --> 00:10:11.029
important for us in order to land these

00:10:08.359 --> 00:10:12.230
eyeball shots to begin with such awful

00:10:11.029 --> 00:10:20.059
damage there just hold it together

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:27.470
you're doing okay more bombs could

00:10:20.059 --> 00:10:29.359
really use a rock tinted pretty much no

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:34.549
matter what it offers it's a positive

00:10:29.359 --> 00:10:36.199
right now cause otherwise I'm starting

00:10:34.549 --> 00:10:38.179
to have a little trouble seeing us make

00:10:36.199 --> 00:10:40.189
boss rush starting to have a little

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:42.259
trouble seeing us make this into a wind

00:10:40.189 --> 00:10:45.429
one way or the other to be real with you

00:10:42.259 --> 00:10:45.429
oh that was very close

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:54.980
got lucky there I think especially now

00:10:52.609 --> 00:10:57.709
and especially with there being like

00:10:54.980 --> 00:11:00.049
some champions on this floor on this

00:10:57.709 --> 00:11:02.239
room specifically the little frightens

00:11:00.049 --> 00:11:07.220
you should go down pretty quickly here

00:11:02.239 --> 00:11:11.569
come on come on you got hit with a bomb

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:15.319
to the face I've taken some dumb damage

00:11:11.569 --> 00:11:16.730
here but I've also taken a dumb deal

00:11:15.319 --> 00:11:18.079
with the devil if I'm being honest in

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.720
hindsight that might not have been the

00:11:18.079 --> 00:11:23.480
best approach but okay we got our second

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.919
secret room it has a charges up void

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:28.790
whenever we go into the boss fight

00:11:24.919 --> 00:11:31.309
that's really useful so just don't fear

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:35.299
it's the universal law of Isaac if

00:11:31.309 --> 00:11:37.519
you're going up against a boss and your

00:11:35.299 --> 00:11:39.889
HP stinks it's probably gonna be Bighorn

00:11:37.519 --> 00:11:42.439
that's just the the rule of law in these

00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:44.989
parts things are delicate prepare to

00:11:42.439 --> 00:11:49.910
fight a boss who's a little bit more on

00:11:44.989 --> 00:11:51.949
the annoying side always try to dump a

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:54.139
bomb you know when things are tight here

00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:57.439
I always try to make sure he's even

00:11:54.139 --> 00:12:00.889
bombs but rarely doesn't seem to work

00:11:57.439 --> 00:12:02.859
out if you can get him to eat one though

00:12:00.889 --> 00:12:06.980
it takes off like almost all of his HP

00:12:02.859 --> 00:12:08.660
all of what remains at least wasn't

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:11.160
gonna land it with that one the fuse was

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:15.490
gonna be too short

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:19.540
good fight okay behind schedule but we

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:21.339
should suck that up you gonna be behind

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.570
schedule for boss rush I'm heading down

00:12:21.339 --> 00:12:24.100
the next floor despite the fact that

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.660
there was a shop could've maybe bought

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.950
something I can't remember if there was

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.200
a spirit Hardin there we've also found

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:35.529
an arcade right off the bat the arcade

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:37.690
is Isaac's room and an infested infested

00:12:35.529 --> 00:12:39.990
pill Isaac's room could be better later

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:42.420
it's got nothing really for us now and

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:44.800
we're up against it man this is a

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:48.820
tighter run than I would have expected

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:50.440
to be plausible I can't help but feel

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:52.529
there's gotta be something about eyeball

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:57.130
tears I'm missing cuz as is it's cool

00:12:52.529 --> 00:12:59.529
I'm hip I'm with it I like the idea that

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:01.240
the tears are you know they're physical

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:03.880
they ricochet off of one another instead

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.200
of you know you could spam like 20 of

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:09.100
them and they'd all just go in a

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.459
straight line however that's like a bad

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.370
thing

00:13:09.459 --> 00:13:16.180
it almost removes it your effect a tear

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:18.970
of fact I didn't even know we had the

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.540
minimized shot speed is also pretty not

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.190
good

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:23.620
the only benefit that I see and it's

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:28.560
pretty like you think I'm gonna believe

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:31.060
this but it's pretty suspect is that

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:34.390
conceivably you know maybe you miss with

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:37.300
the shot you might hit that shot no

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:39.339
greed please you might hit that shot as

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:43.270
a result of the eye lingering a little

00:13:39.339 --> 00:13:45.070
longer but I don't know if I fully buy

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:50.650
it

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:51.880
I don't even know and your don't don't

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:53.890
hate me because I'm right in this

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:59.050
situation but I don't know if it's worth

00:13:53.890 --> 00:14:01.150
sucking up Bob's rotten head there's

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:04.780
almost I consider it kind of a false

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:06.520
idea at least that if you just get

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.200
enough good space bar items then the

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:11.890
void all of a sudden becomes like worth

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:13.270
it I sort of disagree I think the real

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:15.600
power the void is in sucking out

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:20.920
passives now mind you we will get an

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:24.070
instantly we fight the boss so there's a

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:30.250
case to be made there I was kind of

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:31.600
hoping we would get we'd get something

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.700
to suck up I was also hoping to get a

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.340
shop well we haven't been to shopping I

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:39.070
was hoping to get an arcade that maybe

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:41.770
allowed us to play a fortune teller for

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:45.670
example and pick up a little extra HP

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:52.150
that way that bomb getting nobody was

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:53.890
like a catastrophe okay at least he's

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:56.910
done I don't know if we're gonna be able

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:56.910
to make boss rush

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.220
all that was very close we still have

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:05.540
amazingly kind of amazingly to me at

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:08.440
least we've preserved our deal with the

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.440
devil chance here

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:15.790
we got three luck you know what we need

00:15:14.529 --> 00:15:17.310
is like a gimpy pickup

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:20.560
give me a spirit heart from the shop

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:21.250
followed by a gimpy pickup from the deal

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.829
with the devil

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:25.450
80% odds I like I take that shot in XCOM

00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:33.370
and not lose any sleep over the results

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:35.380
so nothing there please nothing here

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:37.870
that's way more than nothing

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:39.010
this is decidedly something one bomb I

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.750
don't know if we've ever gotten more

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:43.360
mileage out of a single bomb than that

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:49.449
though nothing here so we could suck up

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:51.279
the boomerang no thank you a little bit

00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:54.940
a little bit of trash there if I'm

00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:58.329
leveling with you so we really should go

00:15:54.940 --> 00:16:00.790
back and suck up Bob's rotten head and

00:15:58.329 --> 00:16:02.380
it is the wrong decision to do what I'm

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:03.579
about to do but let me explain to you

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.959
why I'm gonna do it because you might

00:16:03.579 --> 00:16:07.959
think that I'm just lazy it's not

00:16:04.959 --> 00:16:11.860
laziness every extra second we waste

00:16:07.959 --> 00:16:13.089
going back there is a chance to to get

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:17.380
to boss rush that we're throwing away

00:16:13.089 --> 00:16:19.660
but beyond that and I mean this very

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:21.370
very clearly and unambiguously we're

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:23.079
never going to use Bob's right and head

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:24.850
to fight a boss if we have to use Bob's

00:16:23.079 --> 00:16:26.079
rotten head to fight a boss we're gonna

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:27.880
die anyway

00:16:26.079 --> 00:16:30.430
even though we get a chargeback before

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:32.800
the boss fight we're always going to use

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:35.860
that charge to possibly pick up whatever

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:38.529
item the boss has given us but turn it

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:40.329
into a different stamp because Bob's

00:16:38.529 --> 00:16:43.060
rotten head is just not good enough to

00:16:40.329 --> 00:16:45.490
justify its own existence like as a

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:48.000
spacebar item in our in our pantheon

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:48.000
right here

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:56.970
I blew myself up dude I'll level with

00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:00.110
you

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:04.620
I played kind of badly Abed points their

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:07.050
isse Evan are y7l 8y but the eyeball

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:10.140
item if we suck that up I think we're

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:11.370
living life I'm happy we saw it now

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.810
maybe we never have to see it again

00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:14.970
until we have other tear effects that

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:16.949
enable it but unless I'm that you know

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:18.270
somebody's like hey press the e key when

00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:20.730
your eyeballs are on the screen and they

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:22.440
explode like bombs then maybe now we're

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:25.410
talking but apart from that cool

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:27.120
cosmetic effect in terms of mechanics

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:29.970
get that trash out of here I don't want

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:34.760
to see it I don't want to see it anymore

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:37.980
okay give me more stats ups in the pool

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:44.640
I'm the boring guy always ask for more

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:46.710
stats nice a Guppies head now that's an

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.180
item worth picking up and then sucking

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:49.680
up instead we just sucked it up look

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:52.320
okay I'm it's my mistake

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.270
no question big big Mis play there

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.850
should have picked it up and then sucked

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:58.800
it up you might be saying NL after two

00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:00.600
thousand hours twenty three hundred and

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.920
seventeen to be exact you should know

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.180
better and you know what you're right

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.480
there's no way I can shirk

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:08.160
responsibility there except to say that

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:09.480
I'm a little out of apollyon practice

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.980
specifically and that's why you do these

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.590
runs you know you got to get back in

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:15.180
game shape this is a preseason game it

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:16.710
doesn't matter if you lose to for

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:20.460
example the Vegas Golden Knights nine to

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:23.550
four you got to get in game shape we're

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:27.630
just gonna keep ourselves breasts of

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:29.040
available situations here who knows

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:30.270
there could still be a double item room

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:35.280
available for us in fact I'm actually

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:36.750
gonna go fight Larry jr. didn't know it

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.700
was Larry jr. until that moment but you

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:41.460
get the idea

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:43.050
because I want to get a charge before we

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.610
go to our item room which we are still

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.900
gonna do cuz we would be idiots not to

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:47.370
although I do want to get the boss rush

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.780
this is not like the speed challenge we

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:50.250
got plenty of time to get the boss rush

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:52.860
all we need to do is get like an early

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:54.660
damage or tears upgrade or something

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.980
along those lines we probably shouldn't

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.510
have lost the last run and in fact we

00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:00.890
probably shouldn't lose any Isaac run

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:00.890
ever within reason

00:19:01.169 --> 00:19:06.899
but that one if the wheels came off real

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:06.899
fast

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:11.740
turns out that our half-decent item was

00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:13.090
actually garbage so I will almost always

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:17.470
take experimental treatment at this

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:20.649
point in my life it's worth the risk in

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:22.179
my opinion really lowered our luck

00:19:20.649 --> 00:19:25.269
raised our rate of fire raised our

00:19:22.179 --> 00:19:28.750
damage obviously the big concern here is

00:19:25.269 --> 00:19:36.610
the fact that we have zero HP or one HP

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:38.380
rather it's not good I'm going to sit

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:40.419
here and tell you that that's a

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:42.639
fantastic position to be in because it's

00:19:40.419 --> 00:19:46.419
just it's an indefensible position

00:19:42.639 --> 00:19:48.279
however we're still alive so anything

00:19:46.419 --> 00:19:53.440
could happen as I see it we suck up

00:19:48.279 --> 00:19:55.240
butter bean which is not even wait what

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:57.220
so it's pretty bad mostly an excuse for

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:59.679
me to use Guppies paw there now I would

00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:01.450
love to be able to get a bomb and okay I

00:19:59.679 --> 00:20:02.799
would I was gonna say a bomb and a spear

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:05.169
and are from the shop now we only need

00:20:02.799 --> 00:20:07.059
to get a bomb there's one bomb give us

00:20:05.169 --> 00:20:08.740
enough to actually get over to that

00:20:07.059 --> 00:20:10.450
sweet section over there because I think

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:20.470
we might need to and if we need to were

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:22.750
kind of screwed one bomb will not do it

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:24.700
for us so I think we'll just move along

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:26.710
we got enough HP to spawn an arcade on

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:29.110
the next floor enough money to spawn an

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:30.730
arcade on the next floor we would

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:33.460
benefit from spawning an arcade on the

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:36.100
next floor we got six cents yeah let's

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:38.500
move it cuz I like to move it move it I

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:41.380
like to move and move it I like to move

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:43.389
it move it we like to that's where you

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.980
say move it now as I go down to the next

00:20:43.389 --> 00:20:47.289
floor yeah I'm gonna turn up Mike okay

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:49.980
see a little bit it's getting wicked hot

00:20:47.289 --> 00:20:49.980
in this office

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:57.890
it's getting cooler outside but

00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:00.950
unfortunately then oftentimes has

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:04.190
negative connotations for for me in this

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:06.289
office because I don't know the the

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:07.309
thermostat like doesn't recognize the

00:21:06.289 --> 00:21:09.530
temperature in my room with the door

00:21:07.309 --> 00:21:12.320
closed I got this thermometer here's 28

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:13.760
degrees Celsius it's too hot you're

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:16.100
gonna be real stinky by the end of the

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.660
day if we continue to live like that

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:26.780
you're gonna drink like 8 liters of

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:29.809
water I actually think that like the

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:31.400
single tier upgrade now makes our damage

00:21:29.809 --> 00:21:32.090
on this run better than our damage on

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:37.370
the last run

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:38.990
DPS rather we should probably do other

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:40.610
stuff before we go for this deal with

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:41.750
the devil I'm committed to this run

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:44.600
though it might seem like oh you know

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:46.549
it's the second run he's just gonna you

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.350
know throw it once they did it's 25

00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:49.789
minutes it's not a kind of guy I am I'm

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:51.650
offended that you'd even suggested me

00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:54.799
you know what I think that says a lot

00:21:51.650 --> 00:22:00.320
about your view of the world if you

00:21:54.799 --> 00:22:01.760
think that you know I would relatively

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.559
grift you like that that's not my

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:09.919
intention it's not the kind of person I

00:22:03.559 --> 00:22:11.240
am I'm in it to win it on this one we

00:22:09.919 --> 00:22:15.320
got to think about this like Tammy's

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:17.990
head I I'm I'm an int character when it

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:19.549
comes to Isaac which I know sounds

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:19.970
ridiculous given some of the decisions

00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:21.830
I've made

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:24.230
but I'm what I mean by that is I'm not

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:26.809
interested in sucking up Tammy's head

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:29.240
and then using a Pollyanna

00:22:26.809 --> 00:22:30.710
to just do like a lot of damage to

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:32.480
enemies when we enter a room so do we

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:33.650
really want to suck up Tammy's head in

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:36.890
spite of what I just said I think the

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:39.679
answer is probably yes however we're

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:42.820
probably so dumb probably only gonna

00:22:39.679 --> 00:22:48.220
have one charge available so we should

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:50.659
think about it mighty closely before we

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:53.950
mighty carefully I should say before we

00:22:50.659 --> 00:22:53.950
go through with it

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.430
got item room we're about to get a

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:02.110
charge so we're gonna have a lot of

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:04.420
different options here I think if we get

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:06.520
a bad passive or a great active we

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:07.960
probably suck it up here instead and

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.340
we're looking for the kind of actives

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:11.320
that normally would only be used like

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:12.990
once every six rooms anyway oh I think

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:18.580
you gotta suck that up it's just

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:21.820
substantially garbage so we managed to

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:27.250
make that work kind of surprisingly we

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:29.140
have no this is an ideal arcade we have

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:32.950
no luck but we're gonna try to get some

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:35.650
wins here regardless this is a spirit

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:41.710
art is big but I to be honest with you I

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:42.010
want red hearts there we go that's a big

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:43.690
one

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:50.020
why is the red heart important because

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:51.760
we can play these guys two times don't

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:54.550
necessarily expect the odds to work out

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:59.500
in our favor that much but we

00:23:54.550 --> 00:24:01.180
essentially paid 16 cents for a red or a

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:03.070
spirit heart so I'm gonna throw away a

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:04.690
little bit of that money here let me

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:07.380
save the rest for a potential shop

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:10.870
situation I think we suck up GB bug

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:15.760
give us another damage upgrade which I'm

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:17.710
quite happy with so I mean we should

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:21.750
theoretically go to the curse room

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:26.680
because I'm a little bit of an idiot and

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:29.320
ruin my guppy chances earlier hmm an

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:31.060
empress card no battery charge I kind of

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:33.670
want to finesse a battery charge into

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:35.620
existence there we go it's got a spirit

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:38.110
art out of it dude buy up as far as I'm

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:40.210
concerned this now allows it to us to

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:42.220
suck up Guppies head sorry Tammy's head

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:45.780
if we want we're so far behind schedule

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:45.780
boss let's get a move on here or

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:51.100
we can suck up whatever's from this boss

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.840
or the deal with the devil and again I'm

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:54.730
trying to stack up stats ideally I think

00:24:52.840 --> 00:25:00.130
that's the true power of void is sucking

00:24:54.730 --> 00:25:03.580
up stats if you can get great high value

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:05.770
actives that's cool too that's worth it

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:06.400
no questions so creative fires in a very

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:07.930
good spot

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.340
you know what Congrats it's a deal with

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:12.880
the angel run let's get ready to fight

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:14.320
mega Satan I'm ready admittedly the

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.760
horsemen of the apocalypse are little

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:19.780
harbingers or whatever it's called is

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:24.070
actually quite good but it's not for us

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:26.170
on this one and look at that we also

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:27.520
just got another damage upgrade so our

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:28.750
stats are kind of trucking out of

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:31.630
control here all we got to do is make

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:33.640
sure our HP holds strong and we could

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:35.380
have taken mr. mega mr. mega great item

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:37.840
but is it as good as getting a damage

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:39.670
upgrade no but it's probably better than

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:41.380
getting a shot speed upgrade which is

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:42.490
the other alternative that we you know

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.680
could have gotten by pressing the

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:49.150
spacebar there so we took a chance and

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:51.550
we got lucky I think but now our our

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:53.140
damage is our DPS rather is out of

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:55.330
control I mean our damage is really good

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:57.340
as well so it's all paying dividends we

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:59.620
started out really slowly here but the

00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:02.410
idea is that maybe by the time we get to

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:04.420
you know the dents boss rush we'll have

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:07.990
power for us and dude if we can get the

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:09.850
virus lucky us why is this so big well

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:11.380
the speed downgrain is garbage but this

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:12.550
is big because we took the experimental

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.230
treatment and it gave us some positive

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:16.630
some negative but kind of simmering

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:19.600
under the surface we got that the chance

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:21.040
to get the spun transformation so the

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.390
fact that we picked up the virus puts us

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:25.570
a little closer to making that dream

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:28.480
come true you might be saying NL what

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:30.220
you doing buddy no curse rooms not yet I

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.900
just don't feel just don't feel

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:35.980
comfortable with the curse room value

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:38.890
proposition given our HP or lack thereof

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:41.620
you know so I'm hopeful we get a deal

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:43.720
with the angel and you know there there

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:45.790
are like three room or three item deal

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:50.170
with the Angels as of a couple booster

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:53.560
packs ago maybe even four item angel

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:54.880
deals you can only choose one but you

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.270
don't have to choose one when you got

00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:00.290
void that's the that's

00:26:56.270 --> 00:27:02.030
part of the magic of that item so we're

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:06.130
just gonna keep trucking along here

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:06.130
we've made up almost all the lost time

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:11.270
one more floor that goes in like roughly

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.280
this pace and we're good let's try it

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:21.110
what makes you larger thinking about 8:1

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:22.760
makes you smaller so fair trade would

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:24.470
have been really nice if he had poison

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:26.030
himself but we're gonna get through this

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:27.470
fight I think even faster than we got

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:29.660
through the last one despite not using

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:32.780
any bombs unless he summons little horn

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:35.770
which I always forget about although if

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:42.440
little horn would be so nice as to

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:45.650
injure his owner here or his ancestor I

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:47.059
don't know his older brother I would be

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:49.190
fine with that we killed little horn

00:27:47.059 --> 00:27:52.240
accidentally which is good indication of

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:55.070
our strength here and dude we also

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:57.950
managed to get a black heart picked up

00:27:55.070 --> 00:28:03.679
another tears upgrade I really should

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:05.330
not leave I want to but the item room is

00:28:03.679 --> 00:28:07.700
still valuable and we're not far enough

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:10.160
behind schedule to make this like do or

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:15.440
die so we're probably at the tear cap

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:17.030
unless unless using the void and getting

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.800
it's your upgrade could actually give

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:24.410
you not just into your upgrade but also

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:27.710
like a tear delay like a producer I sort

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:33.040
of doubt that but I would love to see it

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:33.040
to prove me wrong here

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:44.550
acid baby is pretty good we don't love

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:47.640
our pill rotation so far and I got to

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:50.070
admit the temptation to suck up acid

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:53.100
babies is high especially given the fact

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:54.720
that if we get a speed upgrade we would

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:58.320
get we would consider that like a 10 out

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:59.820
of 10 right now so but the thing is

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.170
unless we get a battery charge here I

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:04.530
just don't think we're gonna be able to

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:06.390
so you know what acid baby you're pretty

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:07.680
lucky you have that battery charge in

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:11.270
the room but I don't think we can get to

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:11.270
it so welcome to the show

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:16.860
why was a Liberty Cap disregard I was

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.810
like my stats went down and that doesn't

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:21.210
feel right so we're still behind

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:22.800
schedule but I have high hopes that this

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:24.360
will change especially cuz next floor we

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.800
got that deal with the angel chance you

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.210
know it's it's not a great lottery

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:30.810
ticket but there's always a chance you

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:32.190
win the Powerball despite that and I'm

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:33.750
you know I would never encourage you to

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:35.340
buy lottery tickets but once you already

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:36.810
own the lottery ticket which is

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.670
essentially the situation that we're in

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:44.580
you'd be a fool not to at least check

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:46.470
the numbers that's my surprisingly apt

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:49.590
metaphor in my own head at least for

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:53.190
today let's continue moving I think we

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:55.470
are at the point where we want to just

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:57.150
make sure that we're going as fast as we

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:59.460
can you know if there's an Aaron's

00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:04.710
consumable on the ground it worries me

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:08.610
not rangedown is in a similar boat I do

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:11.160
want to use a void to summon some flies

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:12.600
whenever we can mostly to atone for the

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:14.190
fact that I sucked up Guppies hairball

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:17.400
for almost no reason there we go

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:20.040
piercing shop plus an enormous speed up

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:21.480
and we got damage down but I'm pretty

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:24.780
sure that was just some Liberty Cap

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:28.170
runoff so this is now in like not quite

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:29.940
ten out of ten but like potential ten

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:32.700
out of ten territory like we're a

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:36.920
prospect with a with an a-minus ranking

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:36.920
in EA Sports NHL 18 right now

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:44.060
and a range down can't really do too

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:47.690
much to us I know by the way we can use

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:49.040
our we can use acid baby to poison

00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:53.120
enemies across the scope of the whole

00:30:49.040 --> 00:31:03.020
room adds a genuine positive to using

00:30:53.120 --> 00:31:06.050
any pills god I hate these spiders since

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:07.610
when are you so tank I am an idiot but

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:09.620
we got a spirit art out of it anyway so

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:16.850
maybe you know who's the idiot it's

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:18.350
still me but less so we shouldn't even

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:23.450
be on this room to begin with this is

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:28.190
kind of the problem simply as a result

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:30.230
of the fact that the enemies are too

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:34.280
strong for me traveler they have too

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:36.530
much HP hit our item room we've ignored

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:39.950
our shop financially you know we have a

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:42.950
fiduciary responsibility to our run in

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:45.530
order to not miss merchants character in

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:46.730
yada yada yada what makes you large dude

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:48.170
if we can just keep trading one makes

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:52.760
you larger one makes you smaller pills

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:56.020
that's a that's free poison as far as

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:56.020
I'm concerned ooh la la

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:08.350
might as well okay we got 16 cents and

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:12.920
we probably should not go to the shop

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:14.990
simply because of it was our speed so

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:20.200
low now we didn't get a speed down - oh

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:24.050
I got it tears down - but everything's

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:30.200
coming up roses is it really just like a

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:34.820
bad safety or mushroom cap Liberty Kent

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:36.710
I think so I gotta ask why are you

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:39.020
messing with me right now like all we

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:42.110
need to do is have we already have the

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:46.340
run just stop giving me this garbage

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:47.960
that slows me down for no reason maybe

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:49.670
we were only at one point for speed

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:56.890
originally because of the we had a buff

00:32:49.670 --> 00:33:02.060
safety cap at that moment do it rolling

00:32:56.890 --> 00:33:03.560
turns out that's actually trash we might

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:07.840
not be able to make boss rush it's

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:07.840
getting it's getting mighty close here

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:16.000
shouldn't have taken that I thought

00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:19.030
there was gonna be combat my mistake

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.500
okay big plays are in order right here

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:22.179
especially considering we got this great

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:24.429
deal chance we don't even need to use

00:33:22.179 --> 00:33:28.570
our unlimited bombs here it's an easy

00:33:24.429 --> 00:33:30.640
fight regardless we get meats suck it up

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:31.929
we got a tier upgrade probably shouldn't

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:34.150
have sucked it up maybe we can use the

00:33:31.929 --> 00:33:36.610
HP but dude I can't believe we're we're

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:38.049
hidden like what's the opposite of

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:40.169
triple sevens on the slot machine

00:33:38.049 --> 00:33:42.250
we're hidden like cherry plum orange on

00:33:40.169 --> 00:33:44.650
these deals with the devil we got our

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:46.120
100% chance on this floor I never want

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:48.400
to see that unless we have goat head I

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:49.419
always want to see 33% chance cuz that

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:57.850
means we got to deal with the devil on

00:33:49.419 --> 00:33:59.799
the last floor it is tempting like

00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:03.450
Liberty cabs not doing a whole lot it's

00:33:59.799 --> 00:34:06.940
not bad but take left hand instead

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:08.260
pretty fly lovely pale we're supposed to

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:10.230
be out of this floor if we want to make

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:14.859
it the boss rush within like the next

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:16.240
you know no time flat so it's clear

00:34:14.859 --> 00:34:17.109
we're gonna be behind schedule there

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:19.570
we've got to start to think about

00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:24.220
Gamble's here's a gamble let's go to our

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:30.220
shop and potentially by an emperor card

00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:34.540
I know there's a spot here we can the

00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:36.040
magic pengal it's kind of we get a

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:37.270
teleportation to a deal with the devil

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:39.190
which in hindsight is not that

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:40.780
irrelevant tears down you know would

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:42.820
also be great and this is like

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:47.580
everyone's gonna be like no kidding but

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:47.580
PhD guilt-free poison

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:57.390
you know what else would be great not

00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:58.619
walking into every enemy that appears

00:34:57.390 --> 00:35:05.400
this is kind of what we were looking for

00:34:58.619 --> 00:35:08.580
though balls of steel pill how did we

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:09.810
not get hit being awesome you that

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:14.880
cursed room is like extraordinarily

00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:16.050
tempting probably save the battery

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.580
charges in case we're trying to make a

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:20.520
big play instead of just summoning the

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:22.950
occasional fly here I'll lock up and

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:26.100
balls of steel so it you know it gets

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:28.800
better and this is where the game starts

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:30.480
to give you this luck just so that when

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:32.250
you don't make boss rush everyone goes

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.510
oh I mean it's your fault I mean look at

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:37.550
all the balls of steel pills you got

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:40.080
well it's you know forgive quoting the

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:41.310
Barenaked Ladies far from the height of

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.600
their career but it's a little too

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:45.510
little too late you know what I mean

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:47.790
like genuinely giving it the college try

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:50.190
here but gonna be about two minutes

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:51.780
behind schedule with maybe a minute to

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:53.730
make it the boss rush and this is

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:56.790
skipping item rooms but we're on this

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:58.440
run to make this happen so obviously

00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:01.440
we're gonna give it a shot I can't

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:07.100
believe he survived the onslaught that

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:07.100
we provided he should be dead

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:15.670
it's a bit of a bold play there maybe

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.420
just a little bit less than two minutes

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:20.619
behind schedule

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:24.490
no Krampus I'm begging you torn photo

00:36:20.619 --> 00:36:28.780
lovely item in many situations we got a

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:31.690
try I think copies tailed hilarious dude

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:33.940
let's do it I'm all-in

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:36.250
that was a terrible idea on my part we

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:38.770
probably doomed the run but the run is

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:40.540
probably semi doomed as is and I think

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:42.400
we're primed for some you know the high

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:43.600
tier Zain by the way I know what do you

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.310
do you got to get out of your boss rush

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:49.690
is coming no no I need to open these

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:51.340
because we need HP one of these got to

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:57.430
give me a spirit heart word in a

00:36:51.340 --> 00:37:05.859
nightmare zone that's just horrible

00:36:57.430 --> 00:37:09.130
thank God don't use that Phil it's not

00:37:05.859 --> 00:37:13.150
worth it no I thought I was still

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:19.210
holding no I've squandered the gup-e

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:20.830
place well I would say like get rid of

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:22.390
the notion that we're ever gonna have a

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:27.760
chance to do boss rush on this run but

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:29.710
we can still live unless that also paid

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:33.430
out okay I mean we're like we're in

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:36.690
tight here emperor card please screw it

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:36.690
go for it Emperor card please

00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:43.850
that Emperor cards guppy dreams we got

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:45.350
to check for God I know it seems like

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:46.880
it's idiotic

00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:48.470
we had to at least look because if it

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:51.410
was a guppy item if it was nine lives

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:52.580
especially we just win we got to take

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:54.350
those low percentage plays in that

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:56.720
situation as stupid as it seems this is

00:37:54.350 --> 00:38:01.480
an HP Apple promise I promise you this

00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:01.480
is an HP upgrade told you

00:38:05.759 --> 00:38:15.879
time is like sincerely very mean it's

00:38:09.999 --> 00:38:25.289
it's out it's not running out or is it

00:38:15.879 --> 00:38:25.289
or is it gets bloated

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:35.180
it is time ISM is up it's not of the

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:39.140
essence it's already been essence of the

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:41.180
Evan variety yeah there goes well dude

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:44.119
we can still make something happen here

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:47.420
but I left it all out on the field there

00:38:44.119 --> 00:38:48.020
okay I wanted to go for the the big

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:50.450
plays

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:52.610
we ended up being 10 seconds too slow it

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:53.990
hurts me deep in my soul we're gonna try

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:56.840
to do the Scholl path I mean we got to

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:59.180
live so we got like bigger issues okay

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:06.050
