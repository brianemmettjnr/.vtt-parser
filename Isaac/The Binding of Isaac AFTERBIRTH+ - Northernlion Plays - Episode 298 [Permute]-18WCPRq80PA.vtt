00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.380
everybody loves a magnet on the line

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.150
please money wise again to earth plus

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.160
crushing it go that's that's how you

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:15.049
enter receive that's now you start a

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:19.410
daily the tab key nun's habit all Jesus

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:24.119
to HP nun's habit monstros to ten rate

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:28.199
of fire and marks so straight up a thank

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.090
you to his then moldy bread or is it

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.279
halitosis because if it's moldy bread

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.809
thanks for not leaving us at one HP

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.610
thanks to evens blessing that would have

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.469
been a nightmare if it's halitosis I

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.879
guess it just does not work with mark

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.079
for whatever reason not that that's a

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:51.870
major loss but this is the worst start

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.500
of the day without a doubt damage stat

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.840
is bad

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.190
HP is not great and we actually have

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.629
what I would consider to be one of the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.090
worst items of the game in the form of

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.629
mark but I guess the if I'm going to say

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.909
something positive about marked we did

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.070
just get proptosis I'm going to say

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.810
something positive about marked it is a

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.750
tears up so we would have been in a

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.860
worse spot from a tear if we didn't have

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.799
it but think marked is basically garbage

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.240
like you can use mouse controls with it

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:26.040
maybe but I don't know this is an item I

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.259
don't feel bad about not liking mark

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.270
because it's one of those items cool

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.740
that was real close it always comes up

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.840
in reddit threads that are like hey

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.880
what's the worst item in Isaac or what's

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.170
your least favorite item what's your

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.329
least favorite item that isn't

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.189
necessarily bad but you just hate using

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.740
it's always like marked chocolate milk

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.680
mark chocolate milk mark chocolate milk

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.040
was also my rap name in middle school I

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.960
had a only a cursory knowledge of what

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.770
may rap music what it was and I thought

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:01.340
it was dairy products in being named

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:05.600
mark you know like Mark Ecko who is a

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:09.569
fashion designer I don't remember really

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.959
but I'm not a rapper so prompt ptosis is

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.980
incredible and in a way it's nice you

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.950
know I have

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:25.409
Marx I'm forced into using Marx which is

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:29.670
there I use it it's novel I kind of hate

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:30.750
it there are ways to get around it I got

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.629
to admit the spirit eyes are very

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.190
important as well though I can use the

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.980
attributional increase as well as we get

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.299
anything along those lines but there's

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:47.209
ways of getting around and I'm trying to

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:50.220
remember what you got to take succubus I

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.140
think you avoid dark Prince's crown even

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.910
though like if it was almost any other

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.069
item we would have been all over it

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.730
because it's a too hard item for one

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.690
heart but there's just the worst to hard

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.480
item I don't think there's any way

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.180
around it but I will say I will say

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.239
straight up succubus proptosis great

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.129
combo I believe that we get maximum

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.900
damage out of the succubus because

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.310
normally your damage is a product of how

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.530
long your tear is spent in the air

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:22.349
basically but I think for succubus is

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:24.450
just a flat maximum from from proptosis

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:28.889
so that's a big positive for us but I'm

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:31.470
thinking of those items like like for

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:35.790
brimstone I believe marked is just a

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:40.340
tears upgrade of course I've missed a

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.340
chance for an obvious like oh hi mocked

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.299
knowing that on average we're going to

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.370
get avid fan on mushroom is a speed

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:56.859
downgrade I got a I got a go-for-broke

00:03:51.370 --> 00:04:02.590
here no not on we're going a little

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:05.709
further it's all worth it for the reroll

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.810
honestly I came into this world there's

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.450
a rear oh look into these eyes then

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.549
you'll see oh yeah that's how you know

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:17.199
it's like v Isaac video of the day right

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.590
vi maybe this might be six okay okay

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.660
okay

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.630
actually these guys very much warrant

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.580
the use of that which we have not

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:30.430
touched despite of being like a totally

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:32.979
decent acceptable choice I think fat odd

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:37.150
mushroom is a little overrated by by me

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:39.130
personally so we can afford to re-roll

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.570
into something better even these like I

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:45.520
can get down with big fan brother

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.099
Bobby's not the worst item on planet

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.470
Earth fat on mushroom might be better

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:53.139
than either but I don't think we're

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.659
don't think we're losing big time by

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:57.220
saying no to them or by picking them up

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:58.960
which means that probably we should

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.849
reroll if I don't feel strongly about it

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.680
we might as well go for a reroll but

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:06.630
with one penny it's just sort of

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:10.300
unlikely now our shop could be a viable

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.270
option for us if it's the amazing shop

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.229
that almost never shows up but we'll

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.090
cross this bridge and we come but you

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.639
can use monstros tooth against monstro

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.610
that's like I have allowed this urban

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:24.039
myth to prevail and pervade for far too

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.169
long I think once I used it against

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.909
monstro and it fell on me and I just

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.949
built this conspiracy theory in my head

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:31.599
that oh if you use it against monstro

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:33.490
then it's like you've added another

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:36.909
monstro to the battlefield which is not

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:40.270
the case to the best of my knowledge at

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:43.020
least I mean of course we could have

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.020
cracked into one of these

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.490
I guess if we get we're not going to get

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:51.139
a bomb so don't even sweat that but if

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.699
we got a bomb we should have used it to

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:58.969
maybe go to the shop and get more money

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:59.740
ah I'll take oh we can take a boat still

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:04.969
not great

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:06.590
but decent it's probably a better

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:08.569
permutation we could have had at some

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.509
point by oh well this is still fine the

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:13.430
problem is mark sucks but I can't really

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:15.439
complain about our stats now so I mean

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:19.279
there is that plus we have deal with the

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:21.289
devil president I know I said that like

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:25.310
like I was Alicia Silverstone in

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:27.319
clueless or something like that whatever

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.330
happened to Alicia Silverstone it's like

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:32.560
this part the full house theme song

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:36.909
whatever happened to Alicia Silverstone

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:41.029
the milk man the paper board news on TV

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:43.639
well the milkman great signed by apex

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:46.430
swing but was pushed out by grocery

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:48.650
chains that offered milk you know on

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.500
demand instead of on a set basis I

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:54.080
imagine that dairy consumption or at

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:57.500
least milk consumption in North America

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.089
has probably gone down over the course

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.250
of the past 40 years and compromised

00:06:59.089 --> 00:07:04.759
demand somewhat as well I have to guess

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:07.129
I mean our household does purchase milk

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:09.770
but I don't drink it so we don't

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:12.800
purchase milk very often The Paperboy

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:14.900
paperboy still delivers papers I don't

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.819
know where you live but you can still

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.379
you know there's still paper routes now

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:20.210
it's a paper person because it's an

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:24.379
equal-opportunity job and why shouldn't

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:26.000
it be you sexist and the news on TV have

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:31.669
you turned on the television recently

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.199
it's all news I'm starting to think that

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:36.090
the full house theme song doesn't know

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:39.240
what is talking about

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:43.639
I will go right you know what the left

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:46.740
hand is good in most cases however I

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:48.180
kind of like the idea of using the

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.440
silver dollar here which is not actually

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.760
the silver dollar but it kind of looks

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:55.860
like silver dollar I think it's called

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:57.990
pay to play that way we can make sure

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.910
that our item rooms always have a reroll

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:01.139
machine in them which is pretty useful

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:03.000
now that we actually have a little bit

00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:04.830
of money and some bombs leftover if we

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.690
ever get doubled item rooms as you saw

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:09.479
in the last floor even though it took me

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:11.940
way too long to realize it they can pop

00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:22.020
off pretty quickly as well so good deal

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:25.950
with the devil opportunity please no

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:28.490
such luck it's actually like almost a

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:32.580
completely worthless pick up quick

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:35.490
mr. positivity northernlion yeah this

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:38.640
item is uh doesn't even have any purpose

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:40.409
to be in the game just remove it no but

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.020
like it really doesn't especially when

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:45.920
I'm looking for anything to get around

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:48.330
marked or alternatively a little speed

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.800
because so many good items also come

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:53.339
with speed downgrades for reasons that

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:56.550
you know boggle my mind but 0.95 speed

00:08:53.339 --> 00:08:58.380
is not enough and it's was it often

00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.120
times not enough and it's not enough for

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.620
us to be like hey small rock we can take

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.260
it like guilt-free you know we got to

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:06.420
worry about it a little bit either way

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.910
the run is still fine though

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.200
I'm not going to I'm going to complain

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:13.650
too hard I wouldn't kick it out of bed

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:15.870
for eating crackers still got 15 cents

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.700
then we don't really want to buy box of

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:20.370
well actually now that I think about it

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:23.640
I mean monstros tooth is fine the box of

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:25.200
friends might be better despite having a

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:28.529
longer charge just because we do have

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:32.010
succubus we take Cupid's arrow I think

00:09:28.529 --> 00:09:33.750
for the piercing shots not a very bold

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.550
move but a worthwhile move nonetheless

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:38.970
let's grab this it's a luck upgrade

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:41.520
guaranteed toldja and

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:42.390
now we're good alright let's get out of

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.000
here I'm going to advance to pose

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:46.410
monsterous truth because we have it

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.960
monstros toots I don't use that often

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:50.250
and it's not one of those items where I

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.650
don't use it because it's bad it's just

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:57.770
rarely does the situation present itself

00:09:52.650 --> 00:10:00.060
where it's a sensible choice probably

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:02.130
box of friends is the more sensible

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:05.450
choice but this one's not it might be

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.450
the right time to make it happen

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.540
plus it's been in the game for a hundred

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:12.230
years so isn't it like the first item

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:14.340
you unlock when you play rebirth

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:15.600
you know you beat Monster when it goes

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:18.840
monstros tooth disappeared in the

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.610
basement and then when the achievements

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.990
bug out you get that on your next 35

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:25.310
runs regardless of the fact that you've

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:27.600
already had it I know how the game works

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:31.280
don't be a lame you know the game and

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:33.050
how it goes we trying to get Chum

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:37.200
[Music]

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:39.660
sorry anyway um yeah piercing proptosis

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:42.450
great name for a speed metal band and a

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:44.370
pretty good item combination for us as

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:46.650
well almost making me forget about the

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:48.360
fact that we have marked that's

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:49.940
beelzebub potential but it's not quite

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:54.870
good enough if we have a real machine

00:10:49.940 --> 00:11:00.300
compound fracture I'm like I'm 8020 on

00:10:54.870 --> 00:11:06.120
compound fracture I like it a lot I just

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:10.170
wish it always works I wish it was more

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:13.440
like Ashanti you know she's not always

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:17.520
there when I called that she's always on

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:20.250
time which honestly talked about the

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:22.770
song on occasion on this on this podcast

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:24.390
that has you know used to be about video

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:26.220
game but now we've you know that train

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:28.920
is long since sailed it's professional

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:32.010
background noise now it's something that

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:33.600
I call the Ashanti continuum if you're

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:35.280
looking for a significant other would

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.200
you rather have somebody who's always

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:40.290
there when you call or somebody who's

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:44.339
always there is always on time I should

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:48.060
say I think if I if I had a certainty I

00:11:44.339 --> 00:11:49.770
would rather have someone who's always

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:52.759
on time because then if you made like

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:55.949
plans even if you're like

00:11:52.759 --> 00:11:57.929
go into the restaurant you called her

00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:59.879
and she doesn't pick up when you got to

00:11:57.929 --> 00:12:01.829
the restaurant you'd be like there she

00:11:59.879 --> 00:12:05.459
is she's always on time she said it

00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:08.519
herself always there when you call I

00:12:05.459 --> 00:12:10.529
mean I suppose that would be nice but I

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:13.049
think that's kind of unrealistic as well

00:12:10.529 --> 00:12:15.720
like I'm not even always there when I

00:12:13.049 --> 00:12:17.279
call so to suggest that you know she

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.169
should always be there when I call is

00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:22.709
not I don't want people calling me that

00:12:19.169 --> 00:12:25.439
often it's the thing oh don't forget

00:12:22.709 --> 00:12:32.039
about this you fell on the nub of all

00:12:25.439 --> 00:12:34.679
possibilities I also don't know the

00:12:32.039 --> 00:12:37.259
meaning of that song and I think that

00:12:34.679 --> 00:12:41.189
says a lot about me what does that mean

00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:46.949
when she says BAE BAE I'm not always

00:12:41.189 --> 00:12:50.850
there when you call oh I think it means

00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:55.259
like she's maybe she's got other side

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:59.249
pieces too ja Rule so she's like you

00:12:55.259 --> 00:13:01.319
know I'm not on call your girlfriend but

00:12:59.249 --> 00:13:02.789
like if you tell me to be somewhere I'll

00:13:01.319 --> 00:13:08.399
be there is that what that song is about

00:13:02.789 --> 00:13:10.619
I need to go to rap genius but you can't

00:13:08.399 --> 00:13:16.859
just like go to rap genius and then read

00:13:10.619 --> 00:13:18.689
it because you know there's a it's

00:13:16.859 --> 00:13:20.879
exhaustive it's like it might actually

00:13:18.689 --> 00:13:23.189
be it's just genius now I've rebranded

00:13:20.879 --> 00:13:26.089
but might actually be like the best saw

00:13:23.189 --> 00:13:28.529
best website on the Internet

00:13:26.089 --> 00:13:30.269
if you ever listened to a rap song and

00:13:28.529 --> 00:13:33.839
you're like what does it mean when Kanye

00:13:30.269 --> 00:13:36.689
West said you know skrt skrt skrt like a

00:13:33.839 --> 00:13:38.819
private school for women when I finally

00:13:36.689 --> 00:13:41.519
show up all the Popeyes is finished you

00:13:38.819 --> 00:13:42.689
go what does that mean that doesn't make

00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:45.299
sense then you look it up and you go

00:13:42.689 --> 00:13:46.949
skrt skrt skrt like a private school for

00:13:45.299 --> 00:13:49.949
women okay because the private school

00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:51.449
for women only has skirts in it and skrt

00:13:49.949 --> 00:13:53.339
skrt skrt also means he's driving

00:13:51.449 --> 00:13:55.079
quickly but then when he shows up all

00:13:53.339 --> 00:13:56.789
the Popeyes is finished this is an

00:13:55.079 --> 00:13:59.309
allusion to the fact that before he was

00:13:56.789 --> 00:14:01.379
wealthy Kanye West as he said on touch

00:13:59.309 --> 00:14:04.169
the sky' track 3 on 2005 late

00:14:01.379 --> 00:14:05.170
registration you know before anybody

00:14:04.169 --> 00:14:06.790
wanted K West

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:13.269
beats me and my girl hit the buffet at

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:16.329
KFC he has a he has a propensity in the

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:20.829
kanye west extended universe for

00:14:16.329 --> 00:14:23.560
fast-food chicken it's building up the

00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:25.060
extended universe and rap genius is the

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.829
only site that can tell you that why

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:30.790
didn't I take anything there I don't

00:14:26.829 --> 00:14:31.800
know man I started to start to think

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:34.510
about it

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:36.850
one bomb gives us six cents and possibly

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:39.490
a secret room and we probably should why

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:41.889
not take Judas's shadow there I guess I

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:43.810
just got a little mine flooded with the

00:14:41.889 --> 00:14:47.860
rap genius it's the only way I can make

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:50.769
any sense out of you know any camp low

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:53.320
song you know when Sonny Chiba goes yeah

00:14:50.769 --> 00:14:55.269
trade shots in life but all night you

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:57.220
dig it you're like what three shots of

00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:59.079
life and then you well here's an

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.910
interview from 1996 where he's like yeah

00:14:59.079 --> 00:15:02.470
that means that came in my girlfriend

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:05.139
three times and you're like oh okay

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:07.240
I get it three shots of life gross but

00:15:05.139 --> 00:15:09.990
like still the Sonny Chiba he'd be

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:16.329
sipping on Loretta I can't dispute that

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:17.170
this is r-rated video now our for Ryan

00:15:16.329 --> 00:15:21.250
please stop

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:26.019
anyway rap genius I gotta do so many

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:27.490
songs from my youth that I only started

00:15:26.019 --> 00:15:28.899
to think about you know as I've gotten

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:32.019
older and you real you hear them on the

00:15:28.899 --> 00:15:34.329
radio and you're like you know son zone

00:15:32.019 --> 00:15:38.500
you requested with dancing lack when

00:15:34.329 --> 00:15:42.220
they kid it's almost like with sex in

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:45.190
and you're like they change the lyrics

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:48.339
recently because it was like my favorite

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:50.709
song out of ten about dancing next to

00:15:48.339 --> 00:15:54.660
somebody with a big old boner poking

00:15:50.709 --> 00:15:57.660
them in the back what are you doing next

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.660
anyway

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:01.170
let's move along here we got golden

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:03.210
chest we should do that we're getting a

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:06.570
little light on HP it would be the

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:09.180
ultimate like nastiness if I died on

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:11.580
this run because of my own idiocy and

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:14.340
not picking up Judas's shadow because it

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:16.080
really is like it's a good item to pick

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:18.450
up in most situations to begin with oh

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:25.170
by the way we totally screwed mark dude

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:30.330
we're fine now that we have like an

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:33.120
unbelievably strong setup here as long

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:49.080
as we don't die so this will be a great

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:53.280
floor to not encounter grieve if we get

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:54.630
lucky had to build up the tension but it

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.040
took me too long to kill the last room

00:16:54.630 --> 00:17:01.860
so some of the tension was lost but

00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:03.600
still you know in a way I think the

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.790
meaning behind lyrics is why I've been

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:08.190
liking the men at work stuff so much

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:11.190
recently and you know men at work very

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:13.589
famous for anything they're a band from

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:16.980
the 80s you may not know lead singer

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:18.300
Colin Hay you know famous as well for

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:20.190
not only a solo work but also

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:22.650
collaborations with very Zach Braff

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:26.120
forms of media like scrubs in the

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:28.230
soundtrack to the film Garden State but

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.640
men at work I'm not going to say that

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:32.390
the best band of the 80s you got great

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:35.190
competition there you know Talking Heads

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:39.620
blondie so many good bands for the

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:41.850
Smiths Pixies etc etc however I

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:44.430
appreciate that a lot of the songs are

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:45.630
straightforward not dumb but simple like

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.730
who can it be now you're like well

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:51.270
what's that song about who could it be

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:53.970
knock at door go away don't come around

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:57.750
here no more you know you know it's

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:59.100
about people knocking on his door before

00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:01.680
he got famous you know he's getting

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:03.950
hounded by bill collectors made him

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:07.860
anxious to open the door for anybody so

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:09.350
he's like telling people to go away you

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:11.040
know the song Down Under is about

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:16.230
Australia

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:17.790
and Benjamite sandwiches they've run a

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.799
straightforward game and I can respect

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:21.900
that cos there's a lot of songs I think

00:18:19.799 --> 00:18:24.720
that you know we're conditioned to

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:28.260
believe that a smart song is steeped in

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:30.390
metaphor you'll be like oh space older

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.370
to using about going to space man I

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:34.559
don't know what this ex-ante is it's

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:40.290
luckily a New Zealand David Bowie

00:18:34.559 --> 00:18:42.809
impersonator it's not very good the

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.320
space order to using about I can't do it

00:18:42.809 --> 00:18:49.740
okay

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:52.049
it's not about spice man it's about drug

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:56.610
abuse and I'll marry from Flight of the

00:18:52.049 --> 00:18:58.740
Conchords for some reason and that's

00:18:56.610 --> 00:19:02.220
cool I'm not insulting Space Oddity at

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:04.760
all I've got a lot of respect to David

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:07.650
Bowie favorite David Bowie album

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:10.140
probably not the one with space ideas

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:12.780
probably Ziggy Stardust and the spiders

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:16.049
from Mars but low also marked you know a

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:23.510
pretty important artistic turning point

00:19:16.049 --> 00:19:26.460
wouldn't disagree with that however I

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:28.620
know some simple songs I don't mind like

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:30.240
it's a bad example because Space Oddity

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:33.120
is a better song than the thong song

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:34.559
well with Cisco he wears his heart on

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.990
his sleeve or in this case he wears his

00:19:34.559 --> 00:19:39.780
boner on his sleeve whoo that dress

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:41.040
looks scandalous and you know and then

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.330
he says a bad word but you wouldn't

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.990
expect it because he's Cisco he's

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:46.679
family-friendly you can handle it

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:48.419
shaking that thing like a

00:19:46.679 --> 00:19:51.570
something-something and it look in her

00:19:48.419 --> 00:19:54.150
eyes like yeah yeah yeah her mefferd you

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:55.770
know but the chorus nobody ever goes

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:58.410
what's the thong song about dude should

00:19:55.770 --> 00:20:00.720
do what we got it because the in in the

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:05.100
chorus for the thong song he lays out

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:09.540
the central premise of his thesis let me

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:12.360
see that song baby that wait let me see

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:15.510
that song let me see that song baby that

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:17.160
tongs the Tong Tong Tong I like it when

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:19.980
your booty go and then in the background

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:23.070
go dad at that baby like your booty goes

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:26.340
dah dah dah that song - Tong Tong Tong

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:31.679
he really you know took a simple idea

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:33.029
and extrapolated it out he put like you

00:20:31.679 --> 00:20:34.649
know what it's like it's like the

00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:36.690
difference between like a french blue a

00:20:34.649 --> 00:20:40.380
bass and a beautiful piece of sashimi

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:43.799
the song song is a piece of sashimi it

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:45.389
has a central purpose and it's all about

00:20:43.799 --> 00:20:47.370
that it's not complicated it's not

00:20:45.389 --> 00:20:51.389
complex it just is what it is yeah it's

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:52.590
a good piece of albacore tuna and then

00:20:51.389 --> 00:20:53.610
you got like on the other side you got

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:56.429
you know a day-in-the-life

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:59.639
by the Beatles where you're like first

00:20:56.429 --> 00:21:04.200
off trash song I'm joking but you know

00:20:59.639 --> 00:21:05.820
it's complex it's complicated you know

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.720
symphonies have been written about that

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:13.259
song it's probably not true I mean I

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:14.610
gotta know what happens this is a pretty

00:21:13.259 --> 00:21:16.590
good selection for one but I gotta know

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:20.460
what happens if you have technology zero

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:21.809
and tech X and the sad answer is nothing

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:26.970
but I was really hoping that there would

00:21:21.809 --> 00:21:30.029
be electricity between these two sadly

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:34.440
no such luck but I mean we got a great

00:21:30.029 --> 00:21:37.379
combo for boss rush nonetheless I know

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:41.429
you could be sick of tech X shows up all

00:21:37.379 --> 00:21:45.000
the time that being said it's the

00:21:41.429 --> 00:21:47.129
greatest item in Isaac's history it's

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.509
like really really good and I like it a

00:21:47.129 --> 00:21:56.580
lot so we're basically going to snag a

00:21:51.509 --> 00:21:59.830
free item that's useless here which is a

00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:01.990
mild bummer

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:03.160
and we'll probably take a little damage

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:05.170
in the process but that's you know

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:07.720
you're going to learning being an

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:08.890
explorer being a visionary in the world

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.120
of the binding of issac you know

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:12.190
sometimes it has a little costs

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:13.600
associated with it like losing a couple

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:16.030
of spirit hearts that's just what it

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:19.360
costs to be at the vanguard of issac

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:23.470
related sciences okay Galileo was

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:27.280
persecuted for his beliefs Johannes

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:28.960
Kepler was so polite that it wait was it

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:32.410
it might not have been Kepler I can't

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:35.530
remember but he held in his urine at a

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:40.660
public function until he died from a

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:42.460
ruptured kidney I'm not saying I'm in

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:49.000
the same level as those guys like don't

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:50.890
insult me but I'm just saying you know

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.480
true visionaries oftentimes are not

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:53.650
appreciated at the time of their

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.630
existence I actually had this

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:58.390
conversation with it with a co-worker of

00:22:55.630 --> 00:23:01.960
mine one time and I even qualities at

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:03.970
top lad okay so I'm not insulting him

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:05.290
he's got way better things to do than

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:07.990
watch these videos though so we can

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:10.540
definitely speak freely but after one

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:12.820
too many adult beverages he went off for

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:15.910
like 45 minutes about how like the

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:18.010
black-eyed peas are so underappreciated

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:20.530
and that all the backlash against the

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:23.920
black-eyed peas is because oh this is so

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:25.960
good is because they're contemporary and

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.630
in like 50 years we'll look back on the

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:35.460
black-eyed peas the same way we look

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:39.540
back on the Beatles I've got a feeling

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:44.140
that tonight's gonna be a good night

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:46.240
it's like you know it's tough that's why

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:49.750
I had made an app for you can download

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:53.920
on the Google Play Store it's called the

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:55.960
Beatles or the BEP 'ls the black eyed

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:58.600
peas not what their name is but it's

00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:00.250
good for SEO purposes and then it

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.420
presents a lyric and it asks you was

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:05.650
that will.i.am

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:08.200
or was that the powerhouse songwriting

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:11.550
combination of Lennon McCartney says hey

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:15.630
once said ago well should I say

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:21.080
she once had me black-eyed peas or the

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:24.780
Beatles well ok there's nothing for you

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:28.770
champagne up in the skies and gonna

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:32.370
stamp Fastlane live in the life because

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:34.050
I'm glamorous the flour sift flour see I

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:35.640
guess if you singing in a voice I mean

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:38.240
that's neither the Beatles nor the Black

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:41.010
Eyed Peas that's Fergie Stacey Ferguson

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:44.250
very famous I mean we should really just

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:46.800
do McCartney vs. Ferguson in that case

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:48.900
how come every time you come around my

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:51.480
London London Bridge want to come down

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:55.200
like London London Bridge want to go

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:57.510
down like you get the idea I'm not

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.040
insulting Stacey Ferguson necessarily I

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:59.730
have got nothing against her or the

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.450
Black Eyed Peas

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:04.740
I just think that it's fairly unlikely

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:06.390
they'll be held in the same regard as

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:09.450
fields but there might be some artists

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:12.950
today who are underappreciated and may

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:12.950
well be regarded like that

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:21.120
Who am I to judge you know I'm nobody to

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:22.530
judge this the right answer alright

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.300
let's head down with you this runs going

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:31.110
well to them so well I've barely had

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:33.390
time to drink this coffee here it looks

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:35.940
like we're going to be extending the

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:38.370
relative streak here and this is like

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:40.050
the first run in 10 years where I

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:42.690
haven't talked about the fact that I

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:44.940
have recently gotten over a slump in

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:46.860
Isaac so that's how you know the streaks

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:48.600
been going on decently is that we've

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:53.790
officially made it to the post slump

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:56.910
discourse era also g-funk step to this

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:59.070
side area funk on a whole new level and

00:25:56.910 --> 00:26:00.120
so as long as we're talking about songs

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:02.190
where I didn't understand the lyrics

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:05.790
until I get got older I really thought

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:08.100
that regulate was just about unwieldy

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:11.070
legislation designed to protect the

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:13.350
industry you know when Warren G said it

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:16.410
was a clear black night a clear white

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:18.870
moon Warren G was on the streets trying

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:20.850
to consume some skirts for the eve so I

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:23.100
could get some phones rolling him a ride

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:28.020
chillin all alone I was like oh that's

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:30.030
about how you know we I think this is

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:31.920
going nowhere all but give me that

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:38.490
spirit heart and then get hit

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:40.530
immediately and lose it let's go when

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:42.720
Nate Dogg said just hit the east side of

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:46.050
the LBC on a mission trying to find mr.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:49.440
Warren G seen a car full of girls ain't

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:53.370
no need to tweak all you skirts no

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:55.410
what's up with two one three he's just

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:57.510
saying I'm hoping to come to an amicable

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:59.310
arrangement with you that fits the laws

00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:04.010
of the country in which we are doing the

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:06.900
business like when Nate Dogg said that

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:08.520
you know 18 in the clip and one in the

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:11.190
hole Nate Dogg is about to make some

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:15.000
bodies turn cold that's a reference to

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:17.790
the great power strike of 1925 when the

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.650
power company to dispute legislation

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:21.660
from big government turned off all of

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:23.910
the boilers in the city he made some

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:26.970
bodies turned cold and put a lot of

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:28.860
pressure on the Union to relax there to

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:29.309
relax their demands it was a landmark

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:36.840
moment

00:27:29.309 --> 00:27:39.200
labor history please thank you let allow

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:45.990
me to get off of this extremely hit like

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:49.139
heavy-handed metaphor let's go

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:54.120
I think Tech X doesn't do damage like

00:27:49.139 --> 00:27:57.029
within the epicenter so we're actually

00:27:54.120 --> 00:28:00.360
like our rate of fire is so fast it's

00:27:57.029 --> 00:28:02.700
actually kind of annoying whoa what the

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.869
I thought we popped and I'm excited pill

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:06.570
halfway through that or something like

00:28:03.869 --> 00:28:09.509
that to last longer than three hours

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:11.820
please consult a physician so we've gone

00:28:09.509 --> 00:28:13.080
very very low on HP we're definitely not

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:15.090
going to go through the hush fight

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:18.299
unless we have shielded tears and I've

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:24.360
forgotten what we do have though is a

00:28:18.299 --> 00:28:27.179
high-octane Incubus tech X run so

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:34.440
effectively we can spam shots like

00:28:27.179 --> 00:28:36.809
nobody's beeswax oh that was not a safe

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:40.679
place to stand and I'm actually finding

00:28:36.809 --> 00:28:42.629
myself quite under the gun so the only

00:28:40.679 --> 00:28:44.340
damage I mean that was preventable

00:28:42.629 --> 00:28:50.340
admittedly but the only damage I'm

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:52.200
really salty about is algae's Blanc

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:55.529
runes fabric and I would have been a

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:56.629
great de gAHS because II era that's two

00:28:55.529 --> 00:28:59.309
full cards

00:28:56.629 --> 00:29:01.200
I'm salty about the damage that I took

00:28:59.309 --> 00:29:05.369
immediately after getting that spirit

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:07.320
heart like a flora go black heart let's

00:29:05.369 --> 00:29:09.299
go three black cards we just won the run

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:11.869
there but for the grace of Tyrone Thank

00:29:09.299 --> 00:29:11.869
You Tyrone

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:16.950
but yeah that's that's preventable

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:18.780
damage apart from that we've been a

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:20.429
little light on spirit arts maybe we

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:25.350
shouldn't have given up it's like I have

00:29:20.429 --> 00:29:26.940
a bad habit of like I take every deal

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:29.220
with the devil that shows up and then if

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:30.929
I don't get any HP I go well this room

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.670
is a little light on HP wasn't it and

00:29:30.929 --> 00:29:34.679
everybody watching just collectively

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:36.059
mashes their hand against their forehead

00:29:34.679 --> 00:29:39.929
and goes with this guy's an idiot

00:29:36.059 --> 00:29:41.610
but in my defense you have to take every

00:29:39.929 --> 00:29:46.080
deal with the devil this shows up they

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:48.720
are not optional they literally are but

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:52.440
you know you gotta take them because

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:53.910
they improve your run who cares if

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.950
you're on one HP we actually did skip

00:29:53.910 --> 00:30:00.270
Judas the shadow which was the wrong

00:29:55.950 --> 00:30:03.600
item to skip but you know I will skip an

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:05.669
item on occasion turns out that a

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:10.260
respawn would have actually been like

00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:11.400
extremely nice to have on this run just

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:13.410
for peace of mind but it looks like

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.850
we'll probably live regardless I mean

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:18.960
there's no real reason for us to take

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:21.120
any damage at all but you know what they

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.700
say the less the merrier

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:28.290
keep the devil card it doesn't really

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:30.150
make much of a difference I hope cherry

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:32.190
it could be good but our damage output

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:33.840
is high enough then if we make it to the

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:36.870
boss rush with the ability to get hit

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:39.240
once and live and by does a boss rush

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:45.169
boss fight we should be able to should

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:48.270
be able to survive very easily get

00:30:45.169 --> 00:30:50.150
absolutely dusted okay don't stand there

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:54.809
you can't live your life like that

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:58.230
sure you know what I will do it we lost

00:30:54.809 --> 00:31:02.299
eight damage in the process and gained

00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:02.299
holy mantle and dead tooth

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:11.120
but we dude that must have been

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:14.510
halitosis that we started this run with

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:19.700
cuz halitosis looks exactly like the

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:26.140
identifiers from the might as well from

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:28.730
the my item screen what is going we have

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:30.080
Ludovico but it sort of doesn't work

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:31.790
like you're going to think that I can

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:33.470
tame it but the actual truth of the

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:37.040
matter is that I'm trying it just does

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:44.750
him it's a little unwieldy and I keep

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:46.130
losing it it's kind of garbage like hear

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:48.170
me out here this is actually a little

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:49.730
dicey the icier than I should do but I

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:54.230
don't want to win the run with this

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:55.730
garbage run I mean I do want to win if I

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:57.110
if I have no other option than to win

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:59.030
but this garbage run along with the

00:31:57.110 --> 00:32:01.400
garbage run we may be we have conjoined

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:06.530
and that's why our ludo tear is like so

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:10.430
bad but I'm going to try to earn a

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:13.940
reroll it's kind of counterintuitive if

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:15.860
you hate this run why would you want to

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:17.030
play more of it just so you can not have

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:18.920
it on the boss fight well it's about

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:20.390
ceremony you know I'm going to be

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:23.180
immortalized in the annals of the

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:24.680
binding of issac Hall of Fame I don't

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:28.880
want this run to be the Jersey I'm

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:30.860
wearing you know it's like Martin Martin

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:34.220
Brodeur going into the hot NHL Hall of

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:35.570
Fame we're in a st. Louis Blues Jersey

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:37.730
sure you know he's part of the

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:39.860
organization he was on the team but he's

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:44.320
a New Jersey Devil I'm not a Devils fan

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:47.830
necessarily but you got to admit that's

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.830
that's his team

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:55.870
so we got to give something better here

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:57.730
and we're closing in on it it's taken

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:59.110
forever our damage is bad this is me

00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:00.820
hitting left this is me getting right

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:03.310
this is me hitting up this is me hitting

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:10.900
down so as you can see we're like on the

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:15.480
angles for whatever reason I gotta admit

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:20.590
rubber cement is like sort of doing work

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:23.770
very eager for this reroll because my

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:25.510
god I'm going to miss holy mantle it's

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:28.480
conceivable although somewhat unlikely

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:31.210
we could reroll this run into a worse

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:33.990
run that doesn't have wholly mantle as

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:42.700
well but I'd say the odds are bad

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:47.260
hopefully let's go Beelzebub our damage

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:51.100
got worse her speed is bad again we have

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:52.690
Beelzebub and I don't know it seems like

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:54.820
we got a squatter this at the end but

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:56.620
we're going to win regardless so no harm

00:33:54.820 --> 00:34:04.170
no foul apparently we also have Midas

00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:07.330
touch let's work ourselves into a friend

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:10.060
grab this grab this Papa Devil card

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:12.820
seven damage with a decent rate of fire

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:14.890
could be worse holy life great touch

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:17.560
here all right we have a bloody lust as

00:34:14.890 --> 00:34:23.110
well and apparently the wafer so

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:25.270
honestly hit me more see if I care not

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:28.570
the most impressive finish but at least

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:30.760
functional and no delirium fights so

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:32.649
