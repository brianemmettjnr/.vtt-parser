00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.020
everybody welcome back to northern land

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.990
please divining-rod contra plus it's the

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.590
first ode I lost in the last episode I

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.230
lost what was me from a week ago

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.120
thinking my god this is the first

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.830
episode I've recorded since I've been

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.960
back is the first episode of anything

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.160
I've recorded since I've been back we're

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.480
going to be a polygon which is good

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.010
because I was like you know it'd be nice

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.590
there's an episode where we could just

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.750
focus on the commentary focus on you

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.369
know playing at a base subsistence level

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.560
and not have to worry about inane

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.420
nonsense like trying to suck up all the

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.579
items in the optimal way and oh well if

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.590
you suck this shot speed up it's a shot

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.660
speed upgrade the worst case scenario

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.890
want a void play is you get a sharp shot

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.010
speed upgrade of a slightly lower

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.899
magnitude y4w my4 89 this strikes me and

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:54.140
I'm talking out of my butt basically so

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:56.579
you know any Pesa Listerine please I

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.039
feel like this is a seed we've had

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.180
before and I might again like I don't

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.680
claim to know that I've had this seed

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.270
before it's a little ridiculous you know

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.430
I can't even remember what happens in

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.409
every episode because I mean quite

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.960
frankly I would I would make a joke at

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.970
my own expense but the reality of the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.240
situation is I spend a lot of every

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.009
single day more or less like recording

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.299
videos and streaming so if you ever ask

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.110
me like hey what were you thinking in

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:28.439
episode you know 496 at this time I'd be

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:32.400
like honestly I enter a sort of Walter

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:35.340
White ask fugue state and just sort of

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.130
go with it as if I'm oh what's the name

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.930
of that actress who was in just go with

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.450
it I'm not talking about Jennifer

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.500
Aniston she was a Brooklyn Decker is

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.470
that it from tim heidecker's show of the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.240
same name Brooklyn nine-nine anyway okay

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.430
this is it's become a multi-layered joke

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.530
that's not funny so much as just

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.869
referential anyway here we are playing

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.689
some Isaac again I always like to start

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.570
these ol episodes where I've come back

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.860
from being away by saying it's probably

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.190
there's a chance it's going to be

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.890
garbage for like yeah like I actually

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.430
lucked out there getting hit by an enemy

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.959
that couldn't

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.280
kill me in one hit instead of getting

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.230
hit by the one that could hit me and won

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.140
it and thus granting me the

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.280
invincibility that allowed me to survive

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.379
but there's like a chance

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.459
I wouldn't say even a good chance yet

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:32.340
but there's definitely a chance that I

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:35.609
that I squander this and lose once twice

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.250
three times the loser will find out

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:40.079
because I have not been not only if I

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.760
now been playing Isaac I had to be

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.329
honest I haven't been playing anything

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.439
that's a half-truth

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.609
for those of you who are unaware I was

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:52.139
away for the last week I went to my

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:54.599
parents house basically because I liked

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:57.659
them and were peers at this point in my

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:00.510
life and also it's like I know that they

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:02.909
missed me and I miss them so it's a good

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.969
situation plus I only see them like you

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:07.409
know one similar once every eight months

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:09.810
or something like sometimes a little bit

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.700
more sometimes a little bit less but I

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.040
went and I was like I'm tired of video

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.450
games I don't want to hang out just play

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.950
video games anymore I'm just going to

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.659
like I don't know sit down don't watch

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.609
TV or something like that in hindsight

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:26.760
but um I went out there and was like I'm

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.560
not going to play anything no my god why

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.269
am i suffering so much here this is

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.720
normal base stats it's not like it's a

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:36.120
bad eden role or something and then

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.739
after like three days I was like I could

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.530
just play like a little heroes of the

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.769
storm but I only brought my laptop with

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.259
me which is basically like a potato and

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.729
then I didn't even have a mouse so I

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:49.019
just had a trackpad and that wasn't

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:50.009
working out too well so I was like hey

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.900
dad do you mind if I borrow your

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:54.269
wireless mouse and I'm pretty sure that

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.919
he bought this oh this is bad I'm pretty

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:00.060
sure that he bought the wireless mouse

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:03.959
in like you know the year 2008 so it was

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.819
getting a little long in the tooth long

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.009
in the latency those years of the storm

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.680
games did not go well and my teammates

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:12.419
were very very angry at me although my

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.769
Korean is a little rusty so I wasn't

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.030
totally sure what they were saying but

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:18.090
there was a lot of stuff that I won't

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.650
repeat out of you know the standard

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.609
decorum that I like to bring during

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.609
these episodes so

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.370
please I hate that we got curse of the

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.139
blind to start with because it means

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.970
that I'm going to pick up everything I'm

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.120
not going to avoid something because we

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.940
know it's not going to be it's literally

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.650
impossible for it to be an active item

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.289
if it's coming from a standard boss

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.180
unless my my Luke tables are a little

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:45.180
bit messed up as Austen would say I

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:48.000
don't believe that we can have a an

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.650
active item from a boss that is vanilla

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.970
well not vanilla because that implies

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.160
that they're you know they can't be a

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.530
champion etc etc I'm just basically I'm

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.240
stunned that we lived and then this is

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.770
life affirming for me although we could

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.830
still die in one hit on the next floor

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:05.580
please bhp its squeezy which is actually

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.850
basically HP sweet but yeah you know as

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.410
always two days before I left I was like

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.120
I can't wait til I get there and then

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.389
two days before I left to come back I

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:19.169
was like I can't wait to come back you

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:21.180
know it was it was a productive trip

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.099
from a mental health standpoint for sure

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:27.060
it's always nice to see my parents I

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:28.500
went back to my old alma mater actually

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.120
my I don't know if you call it an alma

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.449
mater if it's high school I went back to

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:36.539
my high school I graduated from to

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:38.370
present a bursary to a graduating

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:41.039
student that I had never met before in

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:44.520
my life but I was assured that she was a

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:45.900
great student and I mean honestly when

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.789
they were like this is who's getting the

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:52.440
award and then I looked through the

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:55.560
program she was getting like 11 other

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.030
awards so I was like first off a little

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.740
kind of capitalist nightmare you got

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.630
going on here one person getting like

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.940
80% of the awards she's like the Warren

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:06.659
Buffett of having a five oh four point

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.310
zero nine GPA or something but then

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:10.020
secondly I was assured that you know

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:13.020
this was this was going to a person that

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.669
it was deserved that that deserved I

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.020
should say not that I was fronting the

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:17.820
cost for it to begin with but anyway

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:22.139
that was that was weird and surreal but

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:24.690
also kind of cool trying to think of

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:27.720
what else really it was Canada's 150th

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:30.289
birthday I celebrated I don't take this

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:34.500
curse to blind again are you kidding me

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:35.120
don't take this as me disparaging my

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.500
parents

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.560
we're gonna take this as well just yeah

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:43.760
it's so good um disparaging my parents

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:46.699
at all at all at all my parents are like

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:49.040
an exaggeration of the characterization

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:49.340
of adult me and I have great respect for

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.210
that

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:56.240
oh we smelt it nothing at all I think

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:57.889
it's a little dicey there um and what I

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.800
mean by that is you know how I'm like oh

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:02.419
my sleep schedule is like slightly late

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.210
I wake up later that I'd like to wait

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:08.120
wake up and I'm like that's embarrassing

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:10.220
you know there like that but to a larger

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.960
degree they've worked their butts off

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.419
their whole lives and now they're like

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.970
in their 50s so they're just like you

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:20.360
know a little on the older side they're

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:23.000
not geriatric at least but well not yet

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:26.270
but you know we it was Canada's 150th

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000
birthday July 1st I know oh you're like

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.320
a little baby country my country is I

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.380
don't know what accent that is it's just

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.150
you know like Pangea cannot to offend

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.830
everybody which is probably not that you

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.930
use that word but anyway I don't think

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:41.240
that word actually exists rotten baby at

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:44.690
least on our curse of the blinds here

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:47.690
we're getting some ok stuff well yeah we

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:51.169
so we like went out for dinner at like

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:53.060
5:30 and I just to put this in

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:55.700
perspective others anything wrong with

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:58.220
eating dinner at 5:30 but this is 5:30

00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:01.849
Eastern Time normally Kate and I eat

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:04.520
dinner at like between 10:00 p.m. to

00:08:01.849 --> 00:08:09.530
midnight Pacific time

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:11.599
so I'm actually eating dinner like jeez

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:14.990
I'm trying to think about it now's like

00:08:11.599 --> 00:08:18.770
nine hours before I sometimes eat dinner

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:23.330
this is so good okay we can't open them

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:24.919
all unless we get with two O's ace of

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.599
clubs so I'm going to do it um but we

00:08:24.919 --> 00:08:31.460
can at least suck up all the books and

00:08:26.599 --> 00:08:32.839
we're gonna get bookworm just give me

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:35.209
like the Bible or something to do this

00:08:32.839 --> 00:08:38.180
nekron um I mean it's okay not against

00:08:35.209 --> 00:08:40.550
it but okay I will suck it all up we got

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:42.560
a bomb out of it as well obviously we

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:44.750
just got the active benefits out of it

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:47.060
but that's still like really good now we

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.529
can't go to the shop but I'm just going

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.810
to I mean probably blow my

00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:53.689
self up and then respawn is dark Judas

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:57.199
anyway anyway I'm taking way too long

00:08:53.689 --> 00:08:58.699
for this for this anecdote here but it's

00:08:57.199 --> 00:09:00.290
because the run has had some kind of

00:08:58.699 --> 00:09:02.839
exceptional circumstances that have been

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:05.059
very good recently so we dinner like

00:09:02.839 --> 00:09:08.360
5:30 and then my parents have like a

00:09:05.059 --> 00:09:09.769
circle of friends so they were in touch

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.209
with their circle of friends and they're

00:09:09.769 --> 00:09:13.819
like hey you know two of them are down

00:09:11.209 --> 00:09:15.110
at this pub downtown you want to just

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:16.279
stop in and grab a drink with them so

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:18.110
yeah we stopped then we had a couple of

00:09:16.279 --> 00:09:20.180
drinks this point is like 8 p.m. and

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.980
then we're like the fireworks start at

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:23.240
10:00 and they were like I don't really

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.439
want think I'm going to stay awake to

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.749
see the fireworks oh I'm just going to

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:28.759
go home which is fine you know I'm not a

00:09:26.749 --> 00:09:32.269
big fireworks fan myself but you know

00:09:28.759 --> 00:09:33.920
that's that's the it's a life I've been

00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:36.889
living for like the past week and it's

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:39.139
it's not the same as the life that I

00:09:36.889 --> 00:09:40.910
lead in Vancouver so it was it's always

00:09:39.139 --> 00:09:43.220
nice to get away and get some

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:45.620
perspective I'm going to get this just

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:48.920
so we are more or less guaranteed to

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:50.480
live and and then come back and it's

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:55.370
nice to come back and I think that's

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:57.860
kind of the ideal for traveling and is

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:59.089
nothing more circle jerky than you know

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.589
when people who travel talk about

00:09:59.089 --> 00:10:04.220
traveling like it's the greatest thing

00:10:00.589 --> 00:10:06.019
in their life and I mean I'm getting off

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.670
like every tangent is a tangent I'm

00:10:06.019 --> 00:10:09.559
getting used to my own commentary style

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:12.259
again here but it's nothing wrong with

00:10:09.559 --> 00:10:13.519
traveling but different strokes for

00:10:12.259 --> 00:10:15.769
different folks and ever people are like

00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:18.079
you know it changed my life when I went

00:10:15.769 --> 00:10:22.399
to Thailand and got drunk for two weeks

00:10:18.079 --> 00:10:23.509
so maybe maybe not you know for some

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:26.000
people not for other people

00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:27.620
nothing I'm disparaging it but you know

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.300
it definitely there have been times in

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:32.179
my life where I like go away for a week

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:34.179
you know in the pre YouTube era it's we

00:10:32.179 --> 00:10:37.939
should like use this yeah why not right

00:10:34.179 --> 00:10:39.679
I don't know I kind of like having a

00:10:37.939 --> 00:10:43.550
little extra speed right now I mean I'm

00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:44.870
getting old I know that the left hand

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:47.720
could be anything it could even be a

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.980
speed upgrade but prefer taking the

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.329
guaranteed speed upgrade but it

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.399
definitely times I've gone away before

00:10:50.329 --> 00:10:54.589
in my life and when I come back you know

00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:55.670
you're dreading it for the last like 40%

00:10:54.589 --> 00:10:58.970
of the trip you're like oh there's only

00:10:55.670 --> 00:11:01.560
you know 25% of the trip left here it's

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:03.360
like the opposite of

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.680
when you work like an hourly job when

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.020
you do your math you know you're like

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:09.450
well it's 3 p.m. and I work until 4:30

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:11.340
so we're officially 87 point 5 percent

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:14.700
on the day you know you do that kind of

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:16.740
math or at least I did it's good - it's

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.390
good to want to go away recharge and

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:21.450
it's good to come back and I always come

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:23.580
back feeling recharged and full of

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:25.050
resolve never going to lose an Isaac

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.420
again definitely I'll tell you that with

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:28.710
100% certainty probably the next episode

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.390
of Kerbal space program they're going to

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:33.089
give me like an actual scholarship to

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:36.980
NASA University I say NASA weird there

00:11:33.089 --> 00:11:39.990
it's one of it that word has become like

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:42.089
it's become like a bagel word for me

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:43.860
where I worry so much about whether or

00:11:42.089 --> 00:11:46.050
not I'm pronouncing it correctly that I

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:49.680
think I pronounced it more incorrectly

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:54.210
now as a result so we could roll the

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:57.240
dice here I would not recommend it and I

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:59.910
mean it's I know okay like it's not that

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:03.150
exciting to just pick it up but I'm

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:05.190
never going to say no to an orbital when

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:06.570
our only other orbitals big fan but

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:08.790
hopefully we'll get a chance to use the

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:11.490
apollyon bonus pretty well here but

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:18.000
honestly just run as popped off so a

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:20.100
little dicey on HP but we have a lot of

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.980
damage ended to your rate upgrade so

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:26.820
that's good and then honestly that was

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:29.010
pretty much the gist of of my of my time

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:31.890
away my parents lead a domestic

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:33.540
lifestyle which they have earned so I'm

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:36.420
not disparaging it you know I'm the guy

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:38.460
who's like asking somebody to go

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:40.890
skydiving is selfish so I'm not the kind

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:43.459
of guy who's like mom you guys can't go

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:45.450
to bed at 10:00 p.m. you know I'm

00:12:43.459 --> 00:12:47.730
definitely like cool with it but it's

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:50.760
nice to be back as well back on my own

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:54.690
schedule and you live in my own life I

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:58.680
also like my parents recently moved into

00:12:54.690 --> 00:13:02.970
a into a smaller place they've been

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:04.920
downsizing because they're two adults

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:07.620
not to adults with like you know eight

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:11.209
kids at this point so don't they ever

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:13.800
had eight children that I know of but

00:13:11.209 --> 00:13:14.670
you know it used to be when when Kate

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.630
and I would visit

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.400
couldn't come this time if she was

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:19.860
writing her own that well the shoot

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:23.900
sorry she was taking her own Japanese

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:26.550
language proficiency test but anyway I

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:28.590
normally it's like an opportunity for me

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:32.760
to live a very gluttonous life as well

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:35.460
because like many people of a certain

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:38.010
age their kitchen is just so stocked

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:39.840
it's not like we're hurting over here

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:41.870
but we just don't stock as much because

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.740
we don't have this storage space

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:46.050
whereas when I go to their house they're

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:48.900
like oh yeah chips were on sale at

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:51.450
Costco three months ago so we got like

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.590
80 bags and I'm like that's awesome and

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.330
then I wait for them to go to sleep and

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:56.700
then I'm like I'm gonna have one bag of

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:58.860
those a night until I leave but now they

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.480
live in a place that's that's much

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.940
smaller so even after they go to sleep

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.410
they kind of got like a bead on the

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:06.270
kitchen they can tell what's going on in

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:08.670
there so I lived a very snack free life

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:10.740
for the past week which was I made sure

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:13.410
to make up for it I got a McDonald's

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.760
breakfast this morning not necessarily

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:16.440
the most unhealthy thing in the world

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.450
but it puts me back in the saddle again

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:26.250
you know what I mean so we had a speed

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:28.170
and shot speed increase here and the the

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.190
speed increase is nice not because I

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:33.060
need one point four five speed

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:36.090
necessarily but because I am excited to

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:38.280
be able to get rid of the goat hoof if

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:44.430
we want to which we may or may not seem

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:47.310
at emesis irrelevant I also like if you

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:49.080
this is such a narrow like not even

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:50.400
inside baseball a inside baseball is

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:53.730
stuff that people in the industry care

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:55.860
about this is just boring but if you

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:58.230
ever want to get back on like a normal

00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:01.350
sleep schedule and you live in the

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:02.880
Pacific Standard time zone go spend the

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:05.160
week in the Eastern Standard time zone

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:07.380
with people that hold like jobs with

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:09.480
normal hours because that's pretty much

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:11.700
what happened I took I took a red-eye in

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:13.860
landed like 7:00 a.m. Monday morning

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:17.490
took a four-hour nap and from that point

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:20.490
onwards I was on eft so i was waking up

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:22.710
at like 8 a.m. which is 5 a.m. my time

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:25.500
and now I'm like it's early in the

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:28.019
morning here do they do in Vancouver and

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:31.319
I'm feeling spry Vardi I went

00:15:28.019 --> 00:15:33.720
out for breakfast I got a coffee I had a

00:15:31.319 --> 00:15:35.910
very leisurely morning uh you know

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.499
posting nonsense on Twitter and now here

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:39.689
I am actually getting my job done so

00:15:37.499 --> 00:15:45.139
that I predict that'll last about 36

00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:47.189
hours at most but still and I had like

00:15:45.139 --> 00:15:49.499
we can get Book of Shadows here we

00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:52.679
should try it I had I had a travel

00:15:49.499 --> 00:15:55.079
nightmare and I I I'm skeptical we have

00:15:52.679 --> 00:15:57.329
lead must have gotten the Bible from

00:15:55.079 --> 00:16:00.569
that last book in there too I'm

00:15:57.329 --> 00:16:04.079
skeptical of people because people lie

00:16:00.569 --> 00:16:06.660
and I don't mean people embellish okay I

00:16:04.079 --> 00:16:09.720
don't mean this to be like never trust

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:10.949
to anybody because everybody is a liar I

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:14.579
shouldn't have walked over that

00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:18.929
obviously um all I mean to say is that

00:16:14.579 --> 00:16:23.249
if you ever ask some people about travel

00:16:18.929 --> 00:16:25.139
it's always a nightmare and on the first

00:16:23.249 --> 00:16:28.019
off you got to remember it's a privilege

00:16:25.139 --> 00:16:30.689
but secondly people well hell is your

00:16:28.019 --> 00:16:31.860
hell is your 25 minutes life it was

00:16:30.689 --> 00:16:35.490
awful

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:38.279
the captain turned the seatbelt signs on

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:40.799
the whole time and there was a mild bump

00:16:38.279 --> 00:16:43.040
and I just say it was not okay and not

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:45.809
chatting people for having anxiety but

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.490
you know if you've never flown and you

00:16:45.809 --> 00:16:50.639
heard someone talk about a routine

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:52.889
flight it's always like it's the worst

00:16:50.639 --> 00:16:55.829
thing in the world I make an effort to

00:16:52.889 --> 00:16:58.139
be like k9 when we fly back from Japan

00:16:55.829 --> 00:17:00.389
is like a 10-hour flight unless it's

00:16:58.139 --> 00:17:02.129
actually bad in any way people are like

00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:04.439
how is that flight you know the subtext

00:17:02.129 --> 00:17:07.949
being like it was torture and I like nod

00:17:04.439 --> 00:17:10.649
odd it was like being in an airplane for

00:17:07.949 --> 00:17:13.649
ten hours I watched like five movies it

00:17:10.649 --> 00:17:16.649
was basically like a really like

00:17:13.649 --> 00:17:20.970
slightly uncomfortable day out oh my god

00:17:16.649 --> 00:17:23.189
that was disgusting I'm sorry it's like

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:25.380
a slightly uncomfortable day off you

00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:28.350
know it's not that bad but this one was

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:29.490
bad it's like I flew in or the nonfluent

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:32.159
sorry I was getting ready to leave

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:33.600
leaving from a small airport so like the

00:17:32.159 --> 00:17:35.429
flights literally you get your security

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.320
in like 45 seconds and then they're like

00:17:35.429 --> 00:17:38.850
okay well just hop on the plane you walk

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.710
out on the tarmac hop on the plane but

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:42.040
it's time they uh you know you got to go

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:43.330
to Toronto and Toronto there's a

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.430
thunderstorm so they won't let us take

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:48.040
off here until the thunderstorm stops so

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:49.660
that was like a 45-minute delay and that

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.920
as a result of the 45 minute delay I

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:53.950
couldn't make my connection so they

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:55.840
rebooked me to a slightly later flight I

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:59.740
landed I look at the board in the

00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:01.330
airport quite hungry I'd like to point

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:03.220
out here look at the board in the

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:06.430
airport and it's like hey your flight is

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:08.590
on like final call and it's across the

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:10.210
airport so I was the first stop in my

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:11.950
head I was like nice I finally get to

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:14.200
live that movie moment where I get to

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:15.520
sprint across the airport and I did and

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.960
I loved every second of it because it

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.550
made me look like a very important

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.530
person they're like oh my god this guy's

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:21.910
sprinting across the airport he must be

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:24.220
accomplishing some very important

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:25.840
business and I didn't do as much as I

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:30.160
could have to dissuade that notion

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:31.990
so I ran across the airport and I found

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.820
my gate looked at the gate agent she's

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:35.710
just looking around like there's nobody

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:37.660
else at the gate and I'm like hey did

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:39.250
you guys start boarding yet and I gave

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:41.950
her like a little smile and she was like

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:43.660
actually we're almost done so okay

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:45.520
I tried to bring some levity to the

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:47.440
situation I didn't realize I should have

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:50.380
told the pilots on my first flight to

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:52.810
land faster it's good Daniel might be

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:54.610
able to do boss rush anyway then I get

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:56.260
seated on the airplane if we keep in

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:58.480
mind I'm not in great shape these days

00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:00.010
sprinted across this Airport you know

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.480
probably took three or four minutes not

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:05.700
sprinting three or four minutes that's

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:08.980
like it would kill you but like jogging

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:10.510
somewhat strenuously and I get there and

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:13.120
I'm not a breath not feeling fantastic

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:15.160
and I'm like I made it as soon as I sit

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.840
down the pilots like ladies and

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.130
gentlemen we're gonna have a 25 minute

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.420
delay on this flight just want to keep

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:21.850
you guys posted there's a maintenance

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:23.830
issue with the plane okay cool look you

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:25.990
guys have a hard job maybe you can think

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:28.810
about propagating that notice out to the

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:30.490
board in the airport so that people

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:32.800
don't have the sprints across the whole

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:35.740
you know freaking airport to get to the

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:37.780
plane just before you know just for them

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:39.040
too late Lear just as soon as you board

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:41.170
that you're going to be like add by the

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.940
way just kidding I'm distracting myself

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:45.220
from the Isaac play a little bit here so

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:47.320
I sat down like you know out of breath

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:49.560
my god probably not gonna have a heart

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:52.960
attack on this flight which is good and

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:54.820
then I mean after that point it's like

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.940
pretty much just in an airplane I

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:59.330
watched the second

00:19:55.940 --> 00:20:01.490
season of master of none and I thought

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:03.919
it was fantastic television

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:05.419
I watched the Mike Birbiglia film don't

00:20:03.919 --> 00:20:08.029
think twice and I was like this is a

00:20:05.419 --> 00:20:11.419
wonderful film and I had a great time

00:20:08.029 --> 00:20:15.139
realizing that I was a hipster sure

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:17.480
let's take this then we landed and I'm

00:20:15.139 --> 00:20:19.009
waiting at the carousel for my bags you

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:21.500
know where this is going

00:20:19.009 --> 00:20:24.649
people always go oh Emily lost my bags

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:26.299
and I'm like I don't think it happens as

00:20:24.649 --> 00:20:27.289
much as people seem to think it happens

00:20:26.299 --> 00:20:30.980
it happened to me

00:20:27.289 --> 00:20:32.960
this time I'm waiting for a long time at

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:34.509
this carousel like what's up and then

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:37.220
eventually I went and talked to some guy

00:20:34.509 --> 00:20:39.889
was up some guy he was at him he said a

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:41.629
sign that said baggage information and I

00:20:39.889 --> 00:20:44.750
said hey my bag didn't show up and he's

00:20:41.629 --> 00:20:46.850
like well that's weird because we don't

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:49.580
want any of this that's weird because

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:51.350
like we have this thing from Toronto

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.789
that says your bag was scanned and as a

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:55.070
result it should be on the airplane and

00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:57.350
I was like yeah you got me what I'm

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:59.750
trying to do is see if you guys have

00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:01.669
found two bags that look exactly the

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:03.169
same as mine so I can steal a random

00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:05.690
person's luggage because I got nothing

00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:07.639
better to do after taking a so basic I

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:10.460
was being a little bit of a jerk but

00:21:07.639 --> 00:21:12.740
anyway yeah my bag was lost but even

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:16.639
still like it was mostly like an okay

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:19.490
trip and that's why I don't know BAE I

00:21:16.639 --> 00:21:20.750
guess I what I want to say is that where

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:22.429
I was originally going to come at this

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:25.039
from is like don't let people tell you

00:21:22.429 --> 00:21:26.779
that even though anytime you're

00:21:25.039 --> 00:21:28.519
traveling and somebody has like a small

00:21:26.779 --> 00:21:32.000
inconvenience they're like it was a

00:21:28.519 --> 00:21:33.289
nightmare I asked for a corner room in

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.690
the holiday and they didn't have any

00:21:33.289 --> 00:21:37.549
corner rooms left so they gave me a room

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:39.139
close to the elevator nearly little

00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:40.460
people these days are incompetent and

00:21:39.139 --> 00:21:45.259
don't know how to do their jobs you know

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:47.000
it's like a big circle jerk but this was

00:21:45.259 --> 00:21:48.470
actually pretty inconvenient in the

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:54.259
whole scheme of things I got my chin up

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:56.659
you know also on the then this is now

00:21:54.259 --> 00:21:58.789
getting into like petty complaints I

00:21:56.659 --> 00:22:00.350
would see we're going to do with that I

00:21:58.789 --> 00:22:02.929
would say that my first complaints like

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:05.269
losing my suitcase not so much a petty

00:22:02.929 --> 00:22:08.720
complaint having to sprint across the

00:22:05.269 --> 00:22:09.950
airport airport only to sit down and

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.970
have them be like actually

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:13.039
joke's on you is gonna be like another

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:15.559
30 minutes so we take off yeah I mean

00:22:13.039 --> 00:22:17.659
more of a petty complaint admittedly was

00:22:15.559 --> 00:22:19.279
still kind of annoying because I didn't

00:22:17.659 --> 00:22:21.889
get a chance to eat then I had to eat on

00:22:19.279 --> 00:22:24.769
the airplane which a was like a little

00:22:21.889 --> 00:22:27.350
expensive but be they had like no food

00:22:24.769 --> 00:22:28.940
and they're like big people in front of

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:30.830
me are going you know a we shouldn't

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:32.090
fight the hush people in front of me are

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:33.200
like I want the chicken wrap and they're

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:34.970
like oh sorry sir we don't have any

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.610
chicken wraps and the guys I was up and

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:39.350
they're like oh they didn't cater the

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:41.090
plane properly like we don't we only

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:43.190
have like a half the meals were supposed

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:44.630
to have so in the end I guess I was

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:47.690
lucky because I was sitting in like row

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:50.330
15 people back there in row 40 you're

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:53.539
getting young nothing so I had this like

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:57.289
$13 airplane Pizza that was basically a

00:22:53.539 --> 00:22:59.389
lunchable it was not fantastic but then

00:22:57.289 --> 00:23:01.220
I got home and opened my fridge and my

00:22:59.389 --> 00:23:03.169
wife before she left cooked a bunch of

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.789
Korean barbecue and just left it in

00:23:03.169 --> 00:23:05.269
there it's like it's like a ten out of

00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:07.700
ten

00:23:05.269 --> 00:23:09.799
like let's renew our vows sort of

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:11.210
situation obviously that's ridiculous

00:23:09.799 --> 00:23:12.590

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:16.580
not going to renew my vows that's like a

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:19.010
ten year plus sort of thing but you know

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:20.570

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:23.630
thing here that I'm appreciative of and

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:27.799

00:23:27.799 --> 00:23:31.190

to talk to one another um mind you she

00:23:36.169 --> 00:23:39.980
was also out of town you know after I

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:43.010
landed I'm like hey I think he lost her

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:45.440
suitcase and she's like us pretty crappy

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:47.090
and then the next tweet or not tweet

sorry the next like text that comes in

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:50.120
is like her five-star meal from whatever

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:52.940
restaurant she's eating that and I'm

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:55.730
like so we're living in different worlds

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:59.990
right now I'm like sinking the whole

00:23:55.730 --> 00:24:03.440
airport up running running wild on this

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:06.139
like 600 calorie airplane pizza that I

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:08.799
ate four and a half hours ago one or

00:24:06.139 --> 00:24:11.690
where they hacked my toothbrushes and

00:24:08.799 --> 00:24:14.149
you know I don't mean the lamb shoulder

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:16.750
is a little tough she didn't actually

00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:20.120
say that she said it was delicious but

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:21.649
it's like we're on I'm in the first

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.160
world problem situation but you're in

00:24:21.649 --> 00:24:26.520
like a zero with world problem

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:31.350
situation right now and I wish I could

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:33.960
be there but I couldn't I have again I

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:35.580
know I understand how inside baseball

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.320
and circle-jerk you've said whatever

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.820
adjectives you want to use for talking

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:42.510
about being at the airport

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:45.180
how how self-serving it is you know but

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:46.470
I have an airport routine and I think

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:48.420
the routine is important because it's

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:51.270
helped me get over my airplane anxiety I

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:54.300
like to arrive probably like half an

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:56.550
hour earlier than you're supposed to

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:59.550
just in case anything happens nothing

00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:03.440
ever does then you get through security

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:06.510
you'll find like an OK sit-down

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:09.660
restaurant you order like whatever you

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:11.400
want have a drink or two then get on the

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:13.560
airplane and then I'm relaxed tonight

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.880
might even be able to catch like 45

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.670
minutes of sleep over the flight

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:19.080
although usually that's a pipe dream and

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:23.910
I'm good to go

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:26.130
but neither neither of my flying days

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:28.650
allowed me to experience this and it was

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:31.400
like mildly stressful but still yeah I

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:36.470
guess you got to keep it in perspective

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:38.790
it also made a liar out of me because I

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:40.380
usually fly Air Canada because I've had

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:42.270
good experiences with them and I

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:44.340
appreciate that almost every plane has

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:47.280
feedback entertainment which is I'm not

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:48.780
doing I'm doing it again there's no

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.800
reason to fight Isaac on each one of

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:52.500
these floors let's just see how

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:55.350
ridiculous it can get and then like I've

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:57.240
people have been going you know Air

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:59.430
Canada voted North America's best

00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.930
airline whatd what a joke and I'm like

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:03.210
hey you guys it's actually looked pretty

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:04.920
good and then like everything that could

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:06.210
have gone wrong went wrong I'm not going

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:08.550
to blame them for the thunderstorm but

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:10.820
still I mean you know what I'm gonna

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:13.800
blame them for the thunderstorm

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:16.800
you got Doppler radar you can't see a

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:18.600
thunderstorm coming a day in advance and

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:22.500
be like hey guys just show up to the

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:24.300
airport like 45 minutes later rather

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.770
wait till everybody gets through so okay

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:28.200
you know they're doing their jobs but at

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:30.900
the same time you know what this is an

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.790
outrage all right so that was like 20

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:34.530
minutes of playing conversation I didn't

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:36.659
even talked about what happened on the

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:39.149
plane which is largely

00:26:36.659 --> 00:26:43.470
now so I'm not gonna but you know I

00:26:39.149 --> 00:26:47.549
could spend some mild inconveniences out

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:49.349
of it for example hey dude I know they

00:26:47.549 --> 00:26:52.769
turned the seatbelt signs on if you're

00:26:49.349 --> 00:26:54.989
in row for TF you can't get up walk the

00:26:52.769 --> 00:26:56.309
road 15 and then block me out we all got

00:26:54.989 --> 00:26:58.460
connections here do we live in an

00:26:56.309 --> 00:27:02.460
egalitarian society okay

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:04.799
Mohsen to some extent you know I booked

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:06.899
this seat specifically because I want

00:27:04.799 --> 00:27:08.789
her to disembark 45 seconds faster than

00:27:06.899 --> 00:27:10.349
the people at the back it's the cheapest

00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:10.950
way to feel superior over your fellow

00:27:10.349 --> 00:27:12.809
man

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:14.519
I mean business class do that's going to

00:27:12.809 --> 00:27:15.059
be like a five hundred dollar upgrade no

00:27:14.519 --> 00:27:17.129
thank you

00:27:15.059 --> 00:27:19.320
you're telling me as long as I just

00:27:17.129 --> 00:27:23.119
check in early I can sit up here at the

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:26.749
front absolutely

00:27:23.119 --> 00:27:31.830
Air Canada also uses a silent auction

00:27:26.749 --> 00:27:33.809
style now to to get business class

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:36.450
upgrades if they haven't sold them out

00:27:33.809 --> 00:27:40.109
in advance so instead what they used to

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:42.570
do is hey you want to free food free

00:27:40.109 --> 00:27:45.179
drinks in a lay down seat give me like a

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:48.570
million dollars and you were like that's

00:27:45.179 --> 00:27:49.950
ridiculous obviously I'm not going to

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:51.749
pay you a million dollars for three

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:54.059
hours I'm slightly greater but still

00:27:51.749 --> 00:27:55.729
suboptimal comfort and then I said okay

00:27:54.059 --> 00:27:59.239
you got a good point I'll tell you what

00:27:55.729 --> 00:28:02.940
what if you bid against your fellow

00:27:59.239 --> 00:28:04.529
passengers for business class and you go

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:07.590
that's a cool idea what's the minimum

00:28:04.529 --> 00:28:10.979
bid a million dollars Oh sign me up

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:12.899
yeah dude because then you've got the

00:28:10.979 --> 00:28:14.369
little the art of the deal thing going

00:28:12.899 --> 00:28:18.509
on where you could be paying a little

00:28:14.369 --> 00:28:19.830
bit less than the people that are around

00:28:18.509 --> 00:28:22.979
you so you feel like you've got some

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:26.220
superiority no I didn't do that to this

00:28:22.979 --> 00:28:30.029
day I have never dude this is such a

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:32.970
good shop or not shop a chest here to

00:28:30.029 --> 00:28:37.169
this day I have never flown first class

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:41.070
a lot of youtubers do and I'm not trying

00:28:37.169 --> 00:28:43.259
to throw them under the bus but I'm

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:45.419
throwing them under the bus a little bit

00:28:43.259 --> 00:28:48.479
which I don't mean to do because I mean

00:28:45.419 --> 00:28:50.429
I guess above a certain income threshold

00:28:48.479 --> 00:28:52.860
it sort of makes sense where your

00:28:50.429 --> 00:28:54.570
like you know I make more just from

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:58.259
being on this plane than the tickets

00:28:54.570 --> 00:29:00.269
going to cost me but I'm like we just

00:28:58.259 --> 00:29:03.179
we're all on the same plane first off

00:29:00.269 --> 00:29:05.159
there's the obvious undertone of if this

00:29:03.179 --> 00:29:07.169
thing goes down we're all going down

00:29:05.159 --> 00:29:09.600
it's not like you're going to be in

00:29:07.169 --> 00:29:11.220
first class like I would like to get out

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.809
of the emergency exit first I was in

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.999
first class and everybody in coach is

00:29:12.809 --> 00:29:19.350
going to be like oh oh after you sir

00:29:14.999 --> 00:29:21.690
after you the other thing is you're

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:23.009
mostly still just sitting down if I had

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:25.980
like points or something but I'm too

00:29:23.009 --> 00:29:27.960
lazy to collect those five points or

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.610
something I probably consider it the the

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:31.470
chance of an upgrade but just paying for

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:34.710
I don't know it's a little cost

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:37.679
prohibitive in my opinion I only get

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:39.450
angry when I see like 10 year olds in

00:29:37.679 --> 00:29:40.860
first class cuz I'm like I don't know

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:44.090
it's not your fault you know your

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:47.039
parents are rich ball look at that

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:49.590
expression is your parents are rich ball

00:29:47.039 --> 00:29:51.090
but no your parents are rich ball out

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:53.789
you know until you get old enough to

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:55.740
feel guilty about it because you should

00:29:53.789 --> 00:29:57.779
be making your own way but you know if

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:59.429
you're if you're a 10 year old and your

00:29:57.779 --> 00:30:01.679
parents buy you a first-class ticket you

00:29:59.429 --> 00:30:04.950
should have to trade with like a like an

00:30:01.679 --> 00:30:07.139
iron worker in coach let them experience

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:10.110
it they worked for it you don't even

00:30:07.139 --> 00:30:12.149
know it yet they pay tax to fill the

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:13.740
loopholes that your parents are using to

00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:15.929
save enough money to put you in first

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:18.299
class anyway long story short feels good

00:30:15.929 --> 00:30:19.889
to be back great episode for coming back

00:30:18.299 --> 00:30:21.840
