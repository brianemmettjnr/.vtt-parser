00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.460
hey everybody welcome back to nor the

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.919
line please inviting advise gathereth

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.630
Plus don't make me do it I don't wanna

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.059
do a lit lit thread

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.379
we've been knocking out these mega satan

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:19.080
runs like it it's nobody's beeswax so we

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.640
got mega satan Delirium oh this is

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.539
prayer I know we just did a Maggie run

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.140
but hush no way we don't need mega satan

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.970
Aarti

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.890
we don't need delirium either disregard

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:36.510
disregard disregard meg is Satan nothing

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:42.360
but greedier mega satan delirium mega

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:45.020
satan delirium just greedier mega satan

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.579
delirium greedier

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:53.460
Azazel has to do like the whole negative

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:56.969
path did I not do am I out of my mind no

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.930
because we did the hush and delirium

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.180
last time I understand so you got hush

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.750
and negative path and then you're

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.130
actually done I'm gonna give Lazar try

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.650
so we want to finish the negative path

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.729
and do hush it's a it's a tall order but

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.140
let's see if we can get the job done

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:19.020
here these six abs one a nine and if I

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.369
mess up the to-do list I apologize it's

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.990
a lot easier to look like you know what

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.939
you're doing when the to-do list is long

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.430
it's when it gets highly specific that

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.920
uh you know you can start the flounder a

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.810
little bit like the main characters best

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.450
friends in the Little Mermaid that's

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:38.009
ignorant her best friend was you know

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:41.579
Sebastian the crab I mean that dude

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.130
ain't no lobster let's be on he's a crab

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.750
he's probably a crab I don't know Disney

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.320
movies have permanently like warped what

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.030
animals look like in my brain they're

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.950
just reasonable for similes is this uh

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.170
it's not an excel floor dude we've been

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.280
getting long floors look at this there

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.790
should be something in the Geneva

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.979
Convention it's like if a floor is caves

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.829
are sorry depths or sorry basement one

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.780
or cellar one or burning basement one

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.940
you can't have more than two rooms that

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.610
are larger than the normal like you know

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:17.549
one by one size we got a two by two

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.140
we got a 3/4 2x2 we might even have more

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.909
than that you never know I knew that's

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.359
going like completely fine to start with

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.310
here

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:26.069
you know the Lazarus gameplan I prefer

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.590
to get the whole resurrection business

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:33.989
out of the way as soon as is conceivably

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:38.579
possible respawn with predominantly I'm

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:40.170
looking for that damage multiplier keep

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.000
in mind I'm trying to like keep a good

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.439
pace here as well we want the zero luck

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.010
as well as opposed to the negative one

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:52.680
luck obviously we need to find a item

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:57.389
room first there's a chest hidden behind

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.639
oh it's a stone chest hidden behind some

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:01.139
stones of its own there we're not gonna

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:04.049
get any bombs unless we get some right

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:06.810
here the Hale

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.159
don't take it yet I almost took it that

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.290
would have been very silly

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.090
so here's oh let me get some bombs as

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.260
well here's what I'm thinking we

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.489
probably want to get the golden chest

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.859
because I don't think a single bomb will

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.280
do this I've been loving these self

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:28.650
sacrum lately let's come in give them a

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:33.389
little love why not we feel blessed stat

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.459
bonus tears upgrade all of a sudden not

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:37.709
so silly anymore is it look at that the

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.819
halo not a tears upgrade but our speed

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.590
is at least out of control here I think

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.079
I'm feeling better about our pace

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.479
I am hoping by the way to get to enough

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.010
money to get an arcade on the next floor

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:52.349
but kind of skeptical about our chances

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:57.479
here and he used my bomb open this bad

00:03:52.349 --> 00:04:00.959
boy decidedly unworthy it's not like the

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:04.590
key is a problem I really would like

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:06.269
this to be worth some more kind of want

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.509
to play the self-sacrifice room one last

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:12.509
time but like do we need we've already

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:13.949
done mega Satan yeah we don't need key

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:16.259
pieces it wouldn't be the worst thing in

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:17.519
the world but we don't necessarily need

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:19.229
them we could also just get a bunch of

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.680
spirit arts from it it's it's too risky

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.210
I shouldn't do it will I do it normally

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.139
I'd say yes because it would be a good

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.759
subversion of expectations but instead

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.189
just gonna say no cuz I don't think I

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:32.560
don't think the economics make sense

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:34.210
right now right now are the economics if

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.289
you will because I mean look who's

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.550
talking instead we'll just play it a

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.960
little close to our chest we already got

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.909
lucky but the way that the gamble worked

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.229
and it only worked out as well as it did

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:46.479
because of the fact that we actually got

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:51.490
the halo you know it's a great enabler

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:52.900
for us to get the the Lazarus respawn

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.719
working as soon as possible we're also

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.979
getting a surprising degree of value out

00:04:55.719 --> 00:05:01.449
of the permanent anemia permanent as I

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.949
always call it's also my favorite tool

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:04.569
album and now you've been making a lot

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:07.150
of tool references lately yeah that's

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:10.810
cuz I'm ignorant I don't really know

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:14.110
anything about tool I missed that when I

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.490
was you know growing my musical interest

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.139
back in that would a pretentious way to

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.629
put it by the way but when I was growing

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:22.689
my musical interest you know back in my

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:24.849
teenage and young adult years I went off

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:27.819
in the you know the John Bryan's sort of

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:30.789
school of you know lost campesino is how

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:34.599
twee can you go instead of the tool side

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:36.550
but you had the tool faction if you will

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.000
but I actually caught a tool song on the

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.159
radio

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.399
it's got a cool radio station called sea

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:44.560
Fox here that plays a little bit of that

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:46.839
you know like slightly more alternative

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.550
stuff at all is like obviously a huge

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:50.080
band but you know you're not gonna hear

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.779
tool on you know virgin what a four

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.550
point one where you just hear he's

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:55.779
Selena Gomez and Bruno Mars over and

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.000
over and I don't say that to insult

00:05:55.779 --> 00:06:04.210
either of them but that Bruno Mars he's

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.099
got some hooks please save me alright

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.139
we're doing very well here not taking

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:10.569
damage that I can't what we haven't

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:13.990
taken any damage I think actually not

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:18.399
since we got to our respawn llamar is

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:20.589
bad it just does not fit into our into

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:23.620
my like Platonic ideal for what a good

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:25.060
spacebar item is but there is the odd

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.689
chance that we can make this work for

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.759
ourselves if we get super lucky find

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:32.080
like a bunch of temperance cards or

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:33.430
something like that all of a sudden yum

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.709
hard we you know we can start to do

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.800
business but for the time being not very

00:06:35.709 --> 00:06:42.099
strong we do find our secret room

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:45.220
I mean we did find our secret room I'll

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:48.780
use a key instead of a bomb to access

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:51.639
our shop you get dull razor now

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.659
immediately is less useful but cut and

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:54.490
of course we get the temperance card

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:56.620
right off the bat but I'm immediately

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.259
less useful I think you got to look at

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:05.289
this and say the dull razor is much more

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:09.550
interesting for us I think I'll even try

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:12.669
this there's a 1 cent gamble did it work

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:14.800
now but I'm not too upset in fact you

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:17.310
know we're we know we definitely want to

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.659
like go to the hush fight cuz that's

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.159
it's just hush negative yeah so we

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:23.199
definitely want to go to the hush fight

00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:25.629
but I think we should take our time on

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:27.729
this floor you know what's the

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:30.419
expression an ounce of prevention is

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:30.419
worth a pound of cure

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:36.129
if we put in our legwork here and get a

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.229
little stronger it's only gonna make

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:39.550
things easier for us and probably faster

00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:41.650
as well in the future

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:43.300
let's go probably shouldn't have taken

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:48.099
that yet because our deal with the devil

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:50.289
might sort of undermine it but so we're

00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:52.240
looking for actually something like a

00:07:50.289 --> 00:07:53.740
Fame would be pretty quality here

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.539
obviously there's items that are better

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:58.750
but a theme would fit well with dull

00:07:55.539 --> 00:08:00.699
razor you can make it works in foils

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:03.460
lovely damage is getting out of control

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:05.770
you know what let's go for an angel run

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.810
not because HP is scarce that's a normal

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:09.909
reason and not because we need anything

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.650
to unlock you know it's the other reason

00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:13.090
but just because book of Belial is not

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.500
that good and it adds a little bit of

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:17.889
entertainment value here I think to go

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:19.659
with this I think this is the right

00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:21.460
course of action here but it's speaking

00:08:19.659 --> 00:08:23.199
of an ounce of prevention being worth a

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.289
pound of cure aka of course what I'm

00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:28.050
about to refer to is the metric system

00:08:25.289 --> 00:08:30.909
you know I I was not aware until

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:31.990
literally like two days ago that there

00:08:30.909 --> 00:08:34.440
are people in the world who don't know

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:37.240
that a cup is a measurement of something

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:40.360
and I don't even mean that I mean that's

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.800
really good but dull razors more fun it

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.269
has the potential to be more fun at

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.279
least I don't mean that to be needlessly

00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:46.899
dismissive you know it's it's kind of a

00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:48.760
stupid measurement I'll admit but I

00:08:46.899 --> 00:08:49.899
actually thought a cup now that I think

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.760
about it what I'm about to say is

00:08:49.899 --> 00:08:52.960
idiotic but just give me a free pass for

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:57.520
this one please cuz I'm admitted

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:59.200
to it thus Grammy clemency I thought a

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.120
cup was a metric measurement cuz it's

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.560
and the reason I thought it was a metric

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.200
measurement even though obviously you

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.490
know it sounds stupid

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.740
it's because I've always thought of a

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:10.540
compass ten mill or 250 milliliters

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.830
which it is so I was like it's in

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.960
milliliters it has to be a metric

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:16.540
measurement it's a strange way to think

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:19.030
about it but you know I think my you can

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:22.630
understand why my reasoning albeit bad

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:23.860
existed that's true you like when when a

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:25.420
recipe if you don't know this side

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.670
because I know Austin also like didn't

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:29.410
know that what a tablespoon was you just

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:31.510
thought it was like a spoon you just put

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:35.020
a spoonful of this in in some situations

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:36.010
that might you know work out but always

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.900
the kind of thing it's probably worth

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:39.460
measuring you're down there in the

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.830
teaspoon or the tablespoon range

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:43.150
obviously teaspoons much smaller but you

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.530
know you should you should break out the

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.570
measuring spoons that's what they exist

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:48.160
for similarly if a recipe calls for a

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:50.560
cup of something it's the first time

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.150
you're making it don't eyeball it get

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.790
the cup out you forget that's why they

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:56.980
called measuring cups get the measuring

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:59.260
cup out is 250 milliliters no just pour

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:02.320
like a tall glass of the pint is 500

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:05.470
milliliters you can accidentally end up

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:07.180
you know adding twice as much anyway

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:09.250
this is a weird thing to get on a high

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:13.390
horse about I'm just I'm actually just

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:16.780
trying to like be educational

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:18.910
edutainment 'el to a certain degree a

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:21.550
cup is not just a measurement that's

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:23.530
like you know eyeball it it's got an

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:26.950
actual number value attached to it

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:28.750
what on earth now if you want to get

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:31.420
angry at measurements and recipes a

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:33.400
pinch is stupid if you ever use

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.870
teaspoons at any point in your recipe

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.790
and then later you say a pinch of

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:38.650
something what are you doing a teaspoon

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:40.870
is already a pinch just give me like the

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:42.340
teaspoon value I want to be scientific

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:44.020
about this when I cook on my own if I'm

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:46.180
working off like a mental recipe oh

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:48.070
that's so good from working off like a

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:50.080
mental recipe a pinch of this pinch of

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:53.530
this you know I've made chili so many

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:55.270
times part of the artistry of it is just

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:57.450
you know adding the spice is kind of by

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:59.280
feel

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:01.230
until you know that it tastes just right

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:05.880
you know there's a certain you shouldn't

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:08.160
say qualms about it but the first time

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:12.450
you're doing a recipe of pinches come on

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:14.400
now it's just insulting all right it

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:16.680
looks like I might have given myself an

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.960
angel slash devil chance despite the

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:20.490
fact that we look like it was fairly

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.100
likely we take damage and we got a

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:25.610
genuine test here but we do have a great

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:28.050
rate of fire great speed which is

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:31.080
extremely relevant for a little Gertie

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:32.970
fight and good damage to begin with now

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.280
if we get super close to taking damage

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.840
we could actually pop dull razor and

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.990
maybe get ourselves out but nothing to

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:41.520
worry about

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:43.560
get a second syringe which is good for

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.330
you know max speed and high damage but

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:48.890
unfortunately not exactly what I'm

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:54.900
looking for but I'm not gonna complain

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:57.900
just continue to save cash room continue

00:11:54.900 --> 00:12:00.210
to save our money you know what maximize

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:03.420
your chances in the future I'm gonna

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:05.190
keep this yera rune we've been doing so

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:07.080
many negative runs the air arun has lost

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:09.660
a little bit of its luster not a lot

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.490
just a little bit of its luster because

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:14.570
it's not as good on the negative floor

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:17.010
you know the dark room as it is on the

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:21.390
the chest it's not the dark room it's

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:25.140
dark room like in life is strange you're

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:27.240
looking happily derange now I should

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:30.870
have saved the bomb but we didn't really

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:33.300
have a chance there did we all angel

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:34.830
statues I believe now give a key piece I

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.720
said that earlier what I meant was that

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.950
both Angel statues statues in an angel

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:42.150
room will give it I don't know if it's

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:43.530
actually true if all angel statues

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:46.280
throughout the game will give it but I

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.280
hope that that's the case

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:56.290
okay good work

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:58.060
easy money we're actually on pace and we

00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:00.670
need to be on pace because we want to do

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.960
the hush fight we can do a hush negative

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:04.090
and then we'll actually have everything

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:06.610
done is Lazarus and you know those of

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:10.840
you who know me know I think I actually

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:13.060
prefer Lazarus as a character I let me

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.620
put it this way I rape Lazarus higher as

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.960
a character than most people out there

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.910
in the Isaac community a lot of people

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.710
seem to think Lazarus is unremarkable I

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:24.280
can understand it but I kind of

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:26.650
appreciate the the fact that Lazarus has

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:30.550
like a built-in early game puzzle that

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:32.500
was so dumb of like you know when should

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:35.200
you use the the resurrection mechanic

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:37.090
because it is an extremely non

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:41.260
negligible part of the Lazarus game I

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:42.820
mean you could probably negligee it it's

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:45.760
not really I think what non-negligible

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:48.190
means but now you couldn't dig a tit you

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:52.020
could decide just to ignore it even but

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:54.730
it's at your own peril because it is a

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:56.560
strong way to improve the run I should

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:58.120
not have stood there this is what

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.610
happens you know you get a little bit of

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:03.250
Isaac affluenza get some spirit hearts

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:05.200
under our belts here it's gonna say

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:06.880
under our belly which is weird you know

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:10.150
if something's under your belt I suppose

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:18.820
it would be under your belly as well I'm

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:20.350
going to I was thinking I don't want to

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:22.210
blow these guys up even though the money

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:26.640
might be worth it so I want to say bombs

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:30.760
I want to see this guy drops bombs first

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:33.910
just HP I mean we're gonna get a bomb by

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:37.480
using Euro regardless so I'm gonna try

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:43.000
this put this it down got an extra

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:45.939
nickel yarra so we're gonna get for luck

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.569
upgrades a bomb

00:14:45.939 --> 00:14:51.669
a lot more money I don't care about the

00:14:49.569 --> 00:14:53.409
coupon in this situation although we can

00:14:51.669 --> 00:14:54.849
use it to get quite a lot of free stuff

00:14:53.409 --> 00:14:56.529
because of the battery charges but it's

00:14:54.849 --> 00:14:58.599
only we give us 15 cents worth of free

00:14:56.529 --> 00:15:00.489
stuff so I don't think it's necessarily

00:14:58.599 --> 00:15:01.239
worth it what all that buy that it could

00:15:00.489 --> 00:15:04.059
be worse could be worse

00:15:01.239 --> 00:15:05.439
what's the pill vert because another

00:15:04.059 --> 00:15:07.359
tiers upgrade

00:15:05.439 --> 00:15:11.470
so we'll then buy verb which will give

00:15:07.359 --> 00:15:13.859
us another tiers upgrade that's very

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.859
good

00:15:15.569 --> 00:15:21.399
this is a smart run like we're playing

00:15:17.979 --> 00:15:23.559
intelligently have we been bullied by a

00:15:21.399 --> 00:15:25.720
little bit of you know fortuitous drops

00:15:23.559 --> 00:15:27.539
yeah do we got you know the best two

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:32.589
thirds of syringe you could ever ask for

00:15:27.539 --> 00:15:34.209
within reason we've been able to play

00:15:32.589 --> 00:15:38.109
blood banks and get some good stuff out

00:15:34.209 --> 00:15:40.449
of a phd's lovely perks is now really

00:15:38.109 --> 00:15:45.519
that relevant but yeah we've had luck on

00:15:40.449 --> 00:15:46.779
our side to some extent at least we've

00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:49.119
also made some plays that I would

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:55.689
consider you know independently sort of

00:15:49.119 --> 00:15:59.909
creative and fun oh dude please we do

00:15:55.689 --> 00:15:59.909
want to like get a move on no question

00:16:02.399 --> 00:16:07.449
here's the dream plate we got five luck

00:16:04.869 --> 00:16:09.699
oh my god you give me HP that I can use

00:16:07.449 --> 00:16:10.779
to play the blood bank and get more HP I

00:16:09.699 --> 00:16:12.159
wasn't talking about that I was talking

00:16:10.779 --> 00:16:14.259
about like an HP upgrade but you know

00:16:12.159 --> 00:16:15.609
take your time we don't since we don't

00:16:14.259 --> 00:16:21.429
need to make it the boss rush that's

00:16:15.609 --> 00:16:22.959
pretty bad and you know what we tried

00:16:21.429 --> 00:16:25.479
since we don't need to make it the boss

00:16:22.959 --> 00:16:27.309
rush we're doing fine on time to be

00:16:25.479 --> 00:16:30.459
honest with you as well I kind of like

00:16:27.309 --> 00:16:32.679
this trinket it's got a little little

00:16:30.459 --> 00:16:35.679
charm to it even though it's not overly

00:16:32.679 --> 00:16:36.970
offensively useful 30-something percent

00:16:35.679 --> 00:16:38.439
chance of a deal with the devil you're

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:41.079
like a thirty five point four percent

00:16:38.439 --> 00:16:44.199
chance or something of a deal with the

00:16:41.079 --> 00:16:45.639
angel I meant to say so we got lucky we

00:16:44.199 --> 00:16:49.499
did get a deal with the angel now that's

00:16:45.639 --> 00:16:51.909
a trinket everyone can enjoy curved horn

00:16:49.499 --> 00:16:55.450
magician the devil Devils a better card

00:16:51.909 --> 00:16:57.630
what are those

00:16:55.450 --> 00:17:02.590
[Music]

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:06.790
angelic prizm eclipsed by the moon it's

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:09.160
just a it's a attack flying what happens

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:11.500
if a shot goes through it what happens

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:14.829
if you find yourself living in a shotgun

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:18.630
Shack oh if you can get your own tear to

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:24.069
go through it it turns into many tears

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:27.069
yo that's pretty cool and I think I mean

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:30.270
at first blush it seems relatively easy

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:34.000
to enable that to be honest with you

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:35.260
forget the blood bank not relevant we're

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.310
a minute and a half by and schedule we

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.500
definitely want to make sure we're

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:41.100
making it to hush with as much certainty

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:44.070
as possible so just start to leave

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:46.690
non-essential stuff behind

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:52.140
thank you gimpy I mean we do have six

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:52.140
locks so I'm thinking gimpy is a fairly

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:57.400
it's gonna be a fairly good friend of

00:17:54.670 --> 00:18:00.850
ours as we make our way through this so

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:05.080
anytime that we're able to conceivably

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:06.940
shoots with the prism helping us we're

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:10.000
gonna do so but we shouldn't like

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:12.340
cannibalize the entire run just to make

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.030
the prism work but in situations where

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:19.150
it can happen let's make it happen still

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:22.780
looking for a dull razor in a blur don't

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:24.220
really have one of those yet dude I

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:27.010
gotta hand it to him this seems like a

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:29.260
cool item in a booster pack all you know

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:31.090
recognized it I haven't always been the

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.830
most open-minded about every item that

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:34.570
I've seen in a booster pack and then you

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:37.900
know that's my own personal mountain to

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:40.560
climb but this one has won me over right

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.560
off the bat

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:47.780
maybe a little harder to enable then I

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:53.690
gave it credit for but looking bad when

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:55.040
it works it works she's got another 18

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:57.190
percent chance at a deal with the devil

00:18:55.040 --> 00:19:00.560
or a deal with the angel or so

00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:04.580
hmm it's kind of tempting to just go but

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:07.600
we have so much money be a shame to just

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:09.770
leave our item room and shop behind

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:13.550
especially because we can especially

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:15.350
when they're close together we can keep

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:18.230
pressing for advantages and we probably

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:21.650
have like 24 minutes total I should say

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:23.150
um like we don't need to be ad boss rush

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:24.350
we can skip that and still make it to

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:26.510
the hush fight pretty easily especially

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:32.480
if we get like literally any form of

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:34.490
mapping just donating because we can and

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:36.830
the donation machine is broken so now we

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:43.270
cannot and will move on one key for two

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:46.370
chests give us some money back oh

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:47.810
absolutely Holy Light is a wonderful

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.280
option here we probably should have

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:51.470
saved our bomb and used dull razor

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.150
instead like I have this too good to use

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:54.910
syndrome a dull razor but we're not

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:56.750
getting any value out of it except for

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:58.310
occasionally stopping ourselves from

00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:00.140
taking damage we're getting a lot of

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:02.600
value out of our bombs because our bombs

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:04.610
allow us to blow up the angel statue and

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:08.870
get the second key piece not that we

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:10.640
need to fight mega Satan but you know

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:12.410
we'd like to ensure the angel statues

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.790
show up because we're doing an angel run

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:15.650
apparently there's some new items there

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:21.200
that I've never seen before like this

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:24.580
one instead of room there's not a room

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.580
what did I think was a room

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:34.000
it would be cool they gave you like it's

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:36.160
a little overkill but it'd be cool to

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.920
give you piercing shots either way it's

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.390
still a cool item like I'm not I'm 0%

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:43.930
hating do you think it works with

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:46.260
technology too like I'm skeptical but if

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:48.670
it did that would be cool

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:50.590
like if you shot a laser through it and

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:52.500
it split into five lasers that were all

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:54.760
different colors

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:57.910
why now let's give it a try

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.570
if it ruins it it ruins it oh did sick

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:06.580
it works

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:09.010
okay that's really neat all right I'm

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:11.440
glad they thought of this synergy it's a

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:13.060
very logical synergy I mean talking

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:15.040
about a beam of light going through a

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:16.810
prison like it for this not to be

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.220
hard-coded I mean I'd start to ask if

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:24.010
the developers had even seen a Rick and

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:26.440
Morty I'm sorry even if you only get it

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:28.270
for a split second it's cool it's cool

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:30.190
so I'm kind of thinking that even though

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:32.260
we have no need to if there's a good

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:36.520
item on boss rush we could probably

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:40.200
afford to do it don't care about

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:40.200
converter or battery here so much

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:45.730
not-not-not worth it we're not doing

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.900
anything else with our money we will

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:53.560
probably try to go to the Blue Room but

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:55.210
not good enough I'm not super concerned

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.710
about our finances there you know what

00:21:55.210 --> 00:22:00.330
we know there's good pills so let's

00:21:56.710 --> 00:22:02.840
check that's a good one

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:05.850
[Music]

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:10.220
we use verb immediately to get to nine

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:10.220
luck kind of an intimidating number

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:19.739
spades all right let's get out of here

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:21.539
if we can make it to boss rush we could

00:22:19.739 --> 00:22:26.070
pop the devil card do a bunch of damage

00:22:21.539 --> 00:22:27.299
I think there's there's worse outcomes

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:30.899
there I think we can make it through it

00:22:27.299 --> 00:22:32.369
and still have a chance to do the the

00:22:30.899 --> 00:22:40.019
hush fight which is of course what I

00:22:32.369 --> 00:22:42.149
really want oh man holy mantle from

00:22:40.019 --> 00:22:46.739
little Gish shooting through angelic

00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:52.559
prism now that is unexpected you want

00:22:46.739 --> 00:22:54.960
the negative forget boss rush get the

00:22:52.559 --> 00:23:00.919
second angel statue what do we need

00:22:54.960 --> 00:23:00.919
again we need negative path and hush

00:23:02.869 --> 00:23:07.200
isn't chocolate-milk technology to like

00:23:05.609 --> 00:23:10.799
exceptional I mean The MITRE would be

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:16.619
fine as well may be exceptional is a

00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:25.320
strong word but I might have screwed

00:23:16.619 --> 00:23:26.999
myself out of out of the hush play it

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:31.379
must be chocolate-milk technology one

00:23:26.999 --> 00:23:33.929
that's like 10 out of 10 so this looks

00:23:31.379 --> 00:23:37.139
like it might be a little on the tedious

00:23:33.929 --> 00:23:38.970
side there's really no one to blame but

00:23:37.139 --> 00:23:42.749
myself for that Hey

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:46.980
gimpy I just want you to know like we

00:23:42.749 --> 00:23:48.779
have nine Lux oh okay that was not what

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:50.759
I meant to do but thank you when we bump

00:23:48.779 --> 00:23:54.109
into an enemy you should have about a

00:23:50.759 --> 00:23:56.999
100 90 percent chance to give us a

00:23:54.109 --> 00:23:58.320
spirit heart so fact that you didn't pay

00:23:56.999 --> 00:24:01.859
out three times in a row made me a

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:04.609
little ornery yeah we probably screwed

00:24:01.859 --> 00:24:04.609
our house chances

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:17.130
Lanta but do we really want to do stop

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.840
moving please do we really want to do

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:20.550
the hush fight in a situation like this

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:22.320
anyway weird like we're gonna get

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:24.510
screwed by super armor we need it for

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:27.240
the post-it note but hey it's who dares

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:29.430
wins sometimes who dares you know loses

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:32.090
a little bit lose a little bit of HP

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:32.090
unfortunately

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:47.270
I'm offended and impressed it's just you

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:49.700
know I never see it coming you get these

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:52.040
boss rush runs where you go well the run

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:54.050
was good and then I went to boss rush

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:58.550
and the whole run just turned into a

00:24:54.050 --> 00:25:00.740
garbage fire like little horns should

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:03.290
not take that long to kill and I can't

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:07.010
even blame super armor for this one as

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:08.780
much as I'd like to like this guy taking

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:14.570
forever to kill is a national

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:20.300
embarrassment surprise we don't get more

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:25.280
of a window of the prism working you

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:27.650
know what you got me you're probably

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:30.140
saying he's gonna die I don't think so

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:34.940
as bad as Gympie has been about spirit

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:37.940
hearts and we got very little to worry

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:43.220
about cuz even like the occasional red

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:46.220
heart adds up and blow this up so we get

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:47.840
better vision well yeah I would say

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:49.550
goodbye to the chance of the hush fight

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:52.910
now what I'm hoping for is that we're

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:59.380
vindicated like posthumously at this

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:59.380
point you see my game plan now

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:07.760
essentially essentially it's a use dull

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:09.350
razor to do any damage at all via our

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:14.030
orbital should have been doing it

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:15.920
earlier we're gonna play that card maybe

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:18.140
I shouldn't be have to be doing it to

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:20.240
begin with what it would add stilted

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:23.230
expression shouldn't to have to be doing

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.230
it in the first place

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:30.700
I don't know why all of a sudden it

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:40.330
seems like our highest our highest

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:42.400
damage attack is our anemia creep I'm

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:44.770
guilty okay I got enamored with a good

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:46.390
item a cool new item and I decided to do

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:51.400
something that probably didn't have the

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:53.890
resources to accomplish better men than

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:57.970
myself have fallen victim this similar

00:26:53.890 --> 00:27:00.130
Isaac related trap and it's all good you

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:01.540
know what you get a you get a free show

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:03.460
here we get to watch a little bit of

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:05.200
boss rush action for no reason

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:07.750
whatsoever it's a lot of fun we have fun

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:12.880
here you know watching me fight against

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:24.790
Gertie for 25 years goody-goody in the

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:26.530
Jets I am like losing my mind just let

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:30.580
me use my orbital for everything yeah

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:34.780
dude sign me up sign me up for taking a

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:41.710
lot of preventable damage just the

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:43.180
slightly speed up this fight the worst

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:46.410
part about this is that chocolate milk

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:46.410
didn't even make it any better

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:51.880
actually the worst part about it is that

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:55.470
we absolutely did not need to do this in

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:58.450
the first place that's the real problem

00:27:55.470 --> 00:28:01.980
is that we're garnering so little

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:01.980
benefit for such great cost

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:12.820
there is a silver lining though like

00:28:08.059 --> 00:28:12.820
Ragman dude is getting hard counter

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:24.770
you tell their status affects connected

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:27.950
to these you know by the way that I am

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:29.480
you know I come by and honestly I'm

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:32.630
looking at this and I'm going we could

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:35.930
still make the hush fight there's still

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:37.850
a chance again I do question whether or

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:40.490
not I would even want to fight the hush

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:43.490
I shouldn't frame you like the run is

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:46.580
bad cuz it's not but seems to not handle

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:48.170
bosses very nicely we can afford to be

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.700
very aggressive you're either mean any

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:50.780
damage we take is not damaged you should

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.820
be rolling your eyes at that's

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:55.340
productive damage to finish the fight

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:56.900
off faster so we have a better chance to

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:59.750
get to the hush legs there's more than

00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:05.600
enough HP to go around get crapped on

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:12.440
dude I didn't want that I didn't want

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:14.600
that I didn't want it yet no it's okay

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:21.680
this damage is fine doesn't look fine is

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:30.650
fine kind of like DJ Qualls I don't know

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:32.360
my apologies let me out you know that

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:33.980
song by the Sam Roberts band I'm not

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:35.480
ready to go there might be by the truths

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:39.080
this is the most Canadian music

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:43.100
discussion I've ever had I'm living the

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:45.290
opposite of that I'm living the opposite

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:46.700
of that song the song goes and you're

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:49.610
gonna pick up the words real quick I'm

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:52.190
not ready to go and then the people in

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:56.830
the audience go I'm not ready to go and

00:29:52.190 --> 00:30:02.650
then The Trews go I'm not ready to go

00:29:56.830 --> 00:30:02.650
well here's my version I'm ready to go

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:07.790
do you pretty much you know solve the

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:13.940
rest of it yourself

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:18.020
all right please easy trip to Easy

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:19.760
Street nah

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:23.240
we're still gonna continue to use our

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:25.280
orbital I was gonna say against my

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:31.100
better judgment but this is my best

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:34.070
judgment the orbital is the right play

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:36.559
it's only the wrong play if you get hit

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:38.929
if you don't get hit

00:30:36.559 --> 00:30:41.260
it's the rightest of plays you could

00:30:38.929 --> 00:30:41.260
ever imagine

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:52.820
that's the rightest play you know right

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:55.400
is play no we're not gonna okay see it's

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:56.660
good we got three bombs probably we want

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.670
to attempt to use those on the next

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:59.990
floor dude I just realized how the heck

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:04.210
are we gonna kill mom's heart fast

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:04.210
enough to make it to the hush fight I

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:10.490
think it's a wonderful question oh my

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:13.040
god it's a dead end all right our dreams

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:17.900
of hush superiority probably died right

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:20.330
there particularly nasty room when

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:22.910
you're not killing enemies too fast but

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:26.120
this one it does come down to me we

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:29.860
should not have taken technology to I

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:29.860
think is what it comes down to here

00:31:35.869 --> 00:31:42.869
if it's a little unfortunate but you

00:31:41.129 --> 00:31:44.460
know this is you might look at this and

00:31:42.869 --> 00:31:45.779
say why would you take technology to in

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:48.419
this situation so wanted to see the

00:31:45.779 --> 00:31:51.330
light reflected through the prism you

00:31:48.419 --> 00:31:53.549
know Isaac synergies might look like

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:56.610
common sense but most of them are

00:31:53.549 --> 00:32:00.929
learned through you know a sincere and

00:31:56.610 --> 00:32:05.970
severe degree of trial and error the

00:32:00.929 --> 00:32:08.759
ones that work the ones that don't you

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:11.369
know it's some total of many many hours

00:32:08.759 --> 00:32:16.769
of gameplay you shot the perfect shot to

00:32:11.369 --> 00:32:17.879
hit me I'm a little upset not an Excel

00:32:16.769 --> 00:32:18.950
floor I know I've been saying that a lot

00:32:17.879 --> 00:32:21.659
lately

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:24.179
at this point I think we just gotta

00:32:21.659 --> 00:32:28.350
focus oh that's pretty good too yours

00:32:24.179 --> 00:32:30.989
just gotta focus on surviving do the

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:34.200
faster our rate of fire the more time we

00:32:30.989 --> 00:32:36.299
probably get with the with the prism

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:41.369
being hit by the tears cuz they're gonna

00:32:36.299 --> 00:32:44.970
fire faster you know so if we're focused

00:32:41.369 --> 00:32:45.480
on survival and not on speed then what

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:49.499
do we do

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:52.080
well you open these which there are

00:32:49.499 --> 00:32:58.379
several behind us but you know hey rome

00:32:52.080 --> 00:33:00.359
wasn't built in a day when we get the

00:32:58.379 --> 00:33:04.799
Holy Light shots like it all comes

00:33:00.359 --> 00:33:07.710
together we also ruined Holy Light more

00:33:04.799 --> 00:33:09.570
or less by taking technology excuse me

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:15.720
sir I know I said earlier that that was

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:19.139
like a good synergy it wasn't because we

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:21.659
lost holy life in exchange for

00:33:19.139 --> 00:33:24.149
occasionally giving Holy Light to little

00:33:21.659 --> 00:33:27.119
Gish which is just actually like who

00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:28.830
cares yeah it's kind of cool but is it

00:33:27.119 --> 00:33:30.119
like merely is good from a

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:30.960
damage-dealing perspective absolutely

00:33:30.119 --> 00:33:33.389
not

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:35.580
so I'm I'm playing lazily right now

00:33:33.389 --> 00:33:38.429
that's the cardinal sin you know to do

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:40.019
something lazily in this situation no

00:33:38.429 --> 00:33:41.999
we're already 30 minutes into the run

00:33:40.019 --> 00:33:43.440
why not just finish it off right I'm

00:33:41.999 --> 00:33:44.970
gonna try to from this point on were

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:46.919
it's just about recognizing that bad

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:48.870
habit before it gets too far ahead you

00:33:46.919 --> 00:33:50.460
know so what should we do

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:52.380
pick up spirit arts if we think there's

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:54.289
any chance we're gonna die if there's no

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:56.340
chance we're gonna die

00:33:54.289 --> 00:33:59.039
don't take the spirit arts coz the

00:33:56.340 --> 00:34:00.630
spirit arts are valuable in and of

00:33:59.039 --> 00:34:03.570
themselves you know we could take them

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:06.150
down to the next floor instead I like

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:08.520
this is this my reward for recognizing

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:15.960
bad play no it's just quite a lot of

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:17.310
money well we can still I have a pretty

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.869
good chance to accomplish something

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:24.830
worthwhile on this run all we got to do

00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:28.889
is beat the lam shouldn't be too bad I

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:32.399
do hate scolex we have like a five and a

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:33.480
half percent chance of getting and we

00:34:32.399 --> 00:34:36.089
shouldn't have picked that up but we

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:37.770
have like I'm oh my god we definitely

00:34:36.089 --> 00:34:39.270
shouldn't have picked it up about five

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:45.240
and a half percent chance of getting a

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:46.859
deal with the angel nothing but we don't

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:49.619
deserve anything there we'll take our HP

00:34:46.859 --> 00:34:54.690
we'll go should have had you know way

00:34:49.619 --> 00:34:58.170
more HP than we do but my brain is in

00:34:54.690 --> 00:35:01.339
like Full Tilt Poker right now if we get

00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:07.170
really really lucky get-out-of-jail-free

00:35:01.339 --> 00:35:09.089
or possibly like mega mah could allow us

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:12.720
to open the blue womb door but let's be

00:35:09.089 --> 00:35:16.140
real we don't want to fight hush what we

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:17.940
want is a d4 like get rid of this run

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:19.320
scrap it for something else there's a

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.780
lot of good things to take away from

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:24.810
this run like I'll never oh wow that was

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:26.910
fast I'll never forget angelic prism

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:28.200
after I get it like six or seven more

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:31.940
times and really cemented in the old

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.940
memory banks I'll never forget it

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:40.980
let's go but we want to we want to break

00:35:39.329 --> 00:35:43.200
free from the mistakes of the past here

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:46.440
to play the crappy games that suck but

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:49.770
and the mistake was technology I'm just

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:51.510
learning you know I want technology to

00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:53.279
be so much better than it actually using

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:55.970
technologies fine technology to is the

00:35:53.279 --> 00:35:55.970
is the bummer

00:35:57.049 --> 00:36:02.309
just try to speed this up we do have a

00:35:59.839 --> 00:36:19.349
chance of getting a deal of some sort

00:36:02.309 --> 00:36:22.910
here no I was doing all right there stay

00:36:19.349 --> 00:36:22.910
still stay still stay still

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:30.760
well we're down to Sheol and this run

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:32.860
I don't wanna blame anybody but myself

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:37.530
but my dude

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:39.850
gimpy you gotta give me a little juice I

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:41.650
walked it no I didn't I managed to hit

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:43.840
the button in time thank God you got to

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:45.940
give us a little juice my dude we got

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:49.120
nine luck and you still hold now with

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:51.490
these gimpy plays like what world am i

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:54.070
living in hematemesis is a is a

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:57.760
get-out-of-jail-free card please the

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:58.870
virus this is this is a throw just hold

00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:02.830
it together dude

00:36:58.870 --> 00:37:06.610
tears up still worth something thank God

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:10.870
we got mom's key helping us out in the

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:13.210
everything Department more or less you

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:16.619
know what let's take explosive diarrhea

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:26.680
I smell a magic mush

00:37:16.619 --> 00:37:28.420
must have been my armpits I want to take

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:31.449
this opportunity to mention that I am a

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:33.219
moron oh my god this is one of the

00:37:31.449 --> 00:37:36.519
actual worst mistakes I've ever made in

00:37:33.219 --> 00:37:43.959
Isaac technology to still allows you to

00:37:36.519 --> 00:37:45.430
shoot it's here oh oh that's a brain

00:37:43.959 --> 00:37:48.729
fart and a half this run is actually

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:50.380
fine and I am just an idiot at least I

00:37:48.729 --> 00:37:52.150
recognized it before the end people are

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:54.160
still gonna be upset some people at

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:56.289
least bets you know entertaining at the

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:57.880
very least oh my god so what am I

00:37:56.289 --> 00:37:59.949
getting at what was the mistake well

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:01.150
I've only been shooting the technology

00:37:59.949 --> 00:38:03.729
laser this whole time

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:06.009
turns out we still have one perfectly

00:38:03.729 --> 00:38:09.160
functional eyeball that can shoot an

00:38:06.009 --> 00:38:12.119
amazing you know Holy Light high-damage

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:15.459
chocolate milk shot in there

00:38:12.119 --> 00:38:17.829
moreover we really play our cards right

00:38:15.459 --> 00:38:20.229
we could split that shot into five and

00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:22.949
many opportunities and oh my god the

00:38:20.229 --> 00:38:25.569
damage output is 10 times better oh

00:38:22.949 --> 00:38:31.420
that's that's your cue to stop playing

00:38:25.569 --> 00:38:33.279
Isaac for the rest of the day but you

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:34.660
know what again at least we recognized

00:38:33.279 --> 00:38:36.099
it before the end we probably could have

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:39.039
done hush but who cares

00:38:36.099 --> 00:38:41.589
oh there's redemption at the end it's

00:38:39.039 --> 00:38:43.059
like you know we're Darth Vader we've

00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:45.219
made some mistakes that's probably a

00:38:43.059 --> 00:38:49.329
pretty polite way to describe what Darth

00:38:45.219 --> 00:38:53.170
Vader did okay I mean you gotta take

00:38:49.329 --> 00:38:55.299
relic we have no reason whatsoever to

00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:56.890
fight this guy except to increment the

00:38:55.299 --> 00:38:59.650
relic counter I don't even know if it

00:38:56.890 --> 00:39:01.299
works like that but it's also now I'm

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:03.880
realizing this run is great and I was a

00:39:01.299 --> 00:39:05.829
moron so I'm like oh we got the Mulligan

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:08.109
and we have nine luck you know what that

00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:09.699
means we're doing everything we actually

00:39:08.109 --> 00:39:12.910
have no reason to do mega Satan but

00:39:09.699 --> 00:39:15.779
we'll do it anyway I'm sorry wait no no

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:20.650
no we have no reason to do magazine

00:39:15.779 --> 00:39:23.130
yeah it's correct but as my penance I'll

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:23.130
do it regardless

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:32.620
yeah and this run is actually like

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:35.890
really good now um so nine luck you know

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:39.550
I'm jonesing for some items here these

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:46.900
six yeah you know what yeah okay that'll

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:49.270
do I don't think I've ever messed up the

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:51.280
value in a run by this much especially

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:52.750
for items that have seen before like I

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.890
should know that technology chocolate

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:56.170
milks still allows me to shoot this

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:57.730
technologies of one eyeball thing it's

00:39:56.170 --> 00:40:00.310
just me it's actually because of the

00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:02.260
fact that the shot is charged that I was

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:05.740
able to be willfully ignorant for so

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:11.080
long not that that's a great excuse in

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:18.390
the end I dodged 100% into that yeah

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:21.490
spider bite is fine if we can shoot

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:28.180
consistently into the prism like the

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:34.060
damage output is outrageous it's harder

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:36.610
than you'd think and the rate of fire

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:39.580
allows it to charge so quickly man

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:40.540
I'm not salty the only thing I'm salty

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:41.980
about is that I said a lot of things

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:44.730
that now seem stupid in hindsight

00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:48.130
because they were they were ill-founded

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:49.740
I'd rather take a Boleyn reroll kamikaze

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:53.110
even though none of them are really

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:54.910
amazing and so I basically just it's

00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:56.470
like someone having mom's knife but not

00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:57.820
knowing that you can charge it to shoot

00:40:56.470 --> 00:41:00.670
it and being like I don't want to walk

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:04.030
into the enemy's this run sucks you know

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:05.470
it's just it's ignorant basically like

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:07.870
look at the damage output when we got

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:13.970
that prism working in on our behalf

00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:15.800
instead of against us well

00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:21.680
I would not like to do a victory lap

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:23.440
please we did get the posted filled but

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:29.630
hush will have to wait for a later day

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:31.670
like TJ from the weekenders stigma haaa

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:34.720
dude nothing wrong with that all right

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:40.910
we should stomp on mega Satan stomp

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:43.490
stomp let it all out these are the

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:55.670
things you can do with that

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:58.270
come on I'm talking come on not the best

00:41:55.670 --> 00:42:00.950
mega satan run we've ever had but dude

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:05.300
way better than i was giving it credit

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:07.130
for just the only thing we can do to

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:08.750
mess things up would be to focus too

00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:11.390
much on the prism cuz like there's just

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:13.190
times when it doesn't work it is worth

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:17.300
waiting I think a second to make sure

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:20.390
the shot hits though like obviously here

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:22.400
we want to shoot but if we can get the

00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:24.619
shot to hit later we could also like

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:31.070
move the shot into it probably look at

00:42:24.619 --> 00:42:33.820
that using the power of like you know

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:33.820
movement

00:42:36.569 --> 00:42:40.769
yeah exactly we can shoot on a diagonal

00:42:38.549 --> 00:42:48.479
well moving in the direction of that

00:42:40.769 --> 00:42:52.759
diagonal diagonal that being said I'm

00:42:48.479 --> 00:42:52.759
overthinking it cuz like we're good

00:42:54.619 --> 00:42:59.459
little risky

00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:02.609
I miss my window that's fine you're

00:42:59.459 --> 00:43:04.199
probably done and dusted go to phase two

00:43:02.609 --> 00:43:05.999
again we don't even need to fight this

00:43:04.199 --> 00:43:09.119
guy in fact we don't even accomplish

00:43:05.999 --> 00:43:11.189
anything except like something intrinsic

00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:13.019
value and having defeated him because

00:43:11.189 --> 00:43:16.499
we've already done this as Lazarus

00:43:13.019 --> 00:43:19.349
apparently look at dad

00:43:16.499 --> 00:43:21.479
it's like took him down a tickin damage

00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:24.419
like a phasing damage all by its

00:43:21.479 --> 00:43:27.329
lonesome that was lovely great item my

00:43:24.419 --> 00:43:29.039
apologies for being a moron oh well we

00:43:27.329 --> 00:43:30.900
already have it anyway my apologies for

00:43:29.039 --> 00:43:33.509
being a moron we've all logged Pandora's

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:35.130
box a lovely item hopefully that helps

00:43:33.509 --> 00:43:36.719
ease the pain a little bit plus my own

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:38.039
recognizance of the fact that I messed

00:43:36.719 --> 00:43:39.059
it up but anyway thanks for watching
