##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.840
everybody welcome Eckener the lamp is

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.109
binding of issac afterbirth plus we're

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.450
done challenges it became like a kind of

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.179
nervous tic or the habit nervous stick

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.240
is not the right word or pair of words

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.560
there describe that to go down the into

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.789
the challenges page but we don't need to

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.050
do that what we do need to do is

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.970
anything at all is Lilith and I'm

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.800
stalling for time let's do it

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.820
you know we're gonna have to beat things

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.070
with Lilith eventually to DQM x QV M

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.770
that's what I always say it's Latin it

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.329
means do one to Lilith as you would do

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.489
unto yourself but without being gross

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:44.160
you weirdos ya Latin is a very dense

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.360
language I'm not anti Lilith and I

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.579
talked about this on the last episode

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.629
where we like steamrolled greed mode as

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.059
Cain but I'm not anti Lilith what I am

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.109
anti is the seeds that we've had as

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.600
Lilith like forever but also

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.300
predominantly like on the new save so

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.270
sure we've had some amazing runs as

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.680
Lilith I just think Lilith is maybe one

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.900
of the only characters in the game that

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.369
requires an enabler and I don't know

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.229
what that enabler is and I think that's

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.619
where I find myself kind of you know

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.549
lost in no-man's land here but we're

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.409
gonna make it work

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.420
regardless you've already done boss

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.049
rushes Lilith so we I think if I

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.090
remember correctly we had a good run but

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.670
we we basically chose to do boss rush

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.900
boss rush kind of caused me to take a

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.540
bunch of damage and then we ended up

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.240
getting nothing out of it in the end so

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:40.159
we made our choice there did the choice

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.159
work yeah it's a more or less it did

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.540
knocking out a difficult achievement as

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.540
Lilith is something to be proud of to

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.070
some extent I'm actually more eager

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.600
though to get back to doing these kind

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.549
of runs not just Lilith runs but like

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.549
the standard runs because not only is it

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.960
like a free aura it's more free than

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.490
doing the challenges but we have all the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.649
runes from the challenges now we have

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.180
all the all the good stuff all the bad

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.619
stuff and all the stuff that nobody's

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.969
really sure about whether or not it's

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.740
good or bad like kidney stone for

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.080
example which you know I've said my

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.600
piece on but I'm sure

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.720
over the course of the next however many

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.640
hundred videos we do have Isaac will get

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.310
to say a lot more please don't be in

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.670
this item room right off the bat okay

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:29.610
I'm alright with this tough love is just

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:31.110
okay but it can become and in fact I am

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.670
NOT gonna hedge my bets with this item

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.440
too much cuz I go like oh you know it's

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.780
just okay but if things go really really

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.190
right it could be amazing but it's not

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.810
great by itself it's pretty good by

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.580
itself hopefully we can get the luck to

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.100
enable it if we can we can if we can't

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.720
we can but right now I'm just getting

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.030
used to the fact that as lilith the

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.160
first floor takes 25 minutes to complete

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.540
by the time we finished the third floor

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.280
i will be middle-aged what the windiest

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.710
thing middle age starts by the way I

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.660
asked asking for a friend because as a

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.640
child I thought when you were like 25

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.660
that was middle age and then I was like

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.120
okay that's ridiculous

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.060
it went out 25 but like thirty now I'm

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.250
like is 40 even middle-aged I don't know

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.660
about you I know that here's the thing

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.390
everyone goes like well if you look at

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.630
the average lifespan in like Canada the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.489
United States you know average man lives

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.680
to like 72 when the average woman lives

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.020
like 81 or something like that yeah but

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.660
you got to imagine those are the

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.000
averages for everybody so most of the

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.090
people dying at the age like you know 72

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.730
right now were born 72 years ago I would

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.160
say all the people dying 72 years old

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.730
now are dying or were born 72 years ago

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.459
we're born in I was born in the late

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.590
1980s I have a high hopes then that our

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.239
generation you know maybe people my age

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.590
we could be the first young male

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.520
generation to make it to 80 on average I

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.110
mean because obviously there have been

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.930
80 year old men maybe we could be the

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.510
first male generation to make it to 85

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.739
that would be amazing progress so I'm

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:13.350
calling it 42.5 I think what your

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.090
definition of middle-age depends on how

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.010
optimistic you are about the future of

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.450
the human race now I'm gonna be real

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.510
cheesed if it turns out that middle age

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.920
is actually like 15 because dude I'm on

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.840
thin ice then

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.690
you guys are like I've still got 15

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.280
years left nah son college doesn't even

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.400
count cuz those years are lost to the

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.170
ether and then you know you spend one

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:39.300
year traveling and before you know it oh

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:41.790
yeah thirty making YouTube videos of the

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.490
same game oh no I'm fulfilled by my job

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.170
mostly because despite the fact that it

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.930
seems Jim Carrey esque and inherently

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.180
meaningless if you didn't see Jim

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.650
Carrey's semi recent interview on the

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.960
red carpet I would encourage you to do

00:04:52.650 --> 00:05:00.570
so I have seen people know I have seen

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.770
people they're retweeting that interview

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.170
and going Jim Carrey's got it all

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.720
figured out I'm a big Jim Carrey fan I

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.850
love man on the moon Eternal Sunshine of

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.710
the Spotless Mind The Truman Show a lot

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.390
of his comedy work as well we're gonna

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.500
grab this for the five bombs and then

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:19.140
we're gonna blow this up that dude does

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.240
not know what he's talking about he's

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.650
like this is all in it he just he smoked

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.820
a lot of weed before you down the red

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.920
carpet it doesn't mean he's got to

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.030
figure it out it just means he's he's in

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.770
a weird mental state

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.900
oh how who are you to talk down to Jim

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.940
Carrey I'm not talking down to the

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.080
ladies there doing her job and Jim

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.310
Carrey is like what are you doing this

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.530
is meaningless you know we're all just

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.470
adrift in a sea of stars that's not deep

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.790
that's just nonsensical I'm not saying

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.290
you know don't dare to dream I'm just

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.220
saying Jim Carrey doesn't know what he's

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:50.280
saying in that moment okay it's his

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.020
right to you know imbibe whatever he

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.670
chooses before he goes to an event that

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.690
he's obviously not that big of a fan I

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.310
don't think he's being a jerk

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.810
necessarily I'm just surprised by the

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.560
number of people who are like I aspire

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:05.490
to be as tuned in as Jim Carrey is one

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:08.280
day dude you could do it in many states

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:12.240
it's already like on the table for you

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:14.130
there anyway long story short it's

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.170
fulfilling because of the kind messages

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.850
I get of course where people go you know

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.460
you know I really enjoy your videos

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.470
they're thought-provoking rarely

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.000
comforting that's the best I can aspire

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.940
to and you know what I think that's okay

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.500
I really wanted a spirit heart to be

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.930
there so you can tell this Lilith run is

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.610
getting a little shaky as is but we have

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.580
kind of an ace in the hole it's Midas

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:37.460
touch this whole run is like potential

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:40.039
now it's Jake for tannin we don't know

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.930
how it's gonna turn out yet maybe

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:43.909
shouldn't have taken the HP doesn't

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.610
matter because we got the garbage deal

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:48.379
with the devil spirits

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.629
wow that is trash

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:53.270
well we might have some angel setups I

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:56.719
think our our hope on this run basically

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:58.520
lives and dies with our item rooms and

00:06:56.719 --> 00:07:00.889
to a lesser extent I suppose our boss

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.389
rooms as well but we can no longer rely

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:04.129
on deals once you get that first

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:05.180
guaranteed deal squandered like that

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:08.150
what can you do right

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.469
first off right walk on the creep that's

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.849
what I was just gonna say is without

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:15.229
spirit arts we can't guarantee ourselves

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:16.310
any kind of survival of our chances of a

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:17.900
deal with the devil if we make a mistake

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:22.729
of any sort including that one right

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:24.050
there so kind of screwed there so

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:25.729
without being able to rely on that you

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.900
got to remember that even if we do get a

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:28.370
deal with the devil it could be a bad

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.110
deal like we just had or it could be a

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.580
deal with the angel it could be a great

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.960
deal it could be a bad deal we got all

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.930
sorts of things to worry about here for

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.409
now clearly we should mostly just be

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:44.090
concerned about our own survival

00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:45.830
that's good Empress is also good I don't

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:49.129
like this I don't like this setup we got

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:52.000
for ourselves here yep

00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:55.039
took us out that's fine restart the

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.839
Lilith runs you you can't wear me down I

00:07:55.039 --> 00:07:58.039
am gonna check out our curse room for

00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:59.210
better for worse and I'm gonna say that

00:07:58.039 --> 00:08:02.150
that's for better because we need the

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:05.180
defensive vitamin Lilith is in a weird

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:10.219
spot due this is not an easy character a

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:13.250
hint just like I don't want to be the

00:08:10.219 --> 00:08:15.860
guy calling for a bus because I'm always

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:17.779
like the game's too easy and really I

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.389
feel like my losses with Lilith are like

00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:22.879
half game-based half luck-based and half

00:08:20.389 --> 00:08:24.529
psychological maybe 50% based on the

00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:29.870
fact that I can't do basic arithmetic as

00:08:24.529 --> 00:08:31.639
well but you gotta give Lilith something

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.680
what's the bonuses Lilith you start with

00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:35.479
an item that makes her not that bad once

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.430
every four rooms that's not good enough

00:08:35.479 --> 00:08:38.659
not good enough to keep her it if you

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:39.769
want her to be a hard character that's

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:41.360
fine but it's not good enough to keep

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:44.149
her you know aunt pace with the other

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:46.130
characters in the game it depends on

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:48.220
what you're looking for as a as a

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:51.410
designer or a developer

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:53.390
not that angry at best bud contributes

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:55.430
to Beelzebub we're probably going to get

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:57.110
hit on occasion so this helps but we're

00:08:55.430 --> 00:09:01.700
kind of in the same boat as we were with

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:05.000
tough love we would like to get as lucky

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:07.400
as possible not esoterically but like

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.120
the literal luck step the literal luck

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:15.500
stat the literal if we can get the luck

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:21.440
stat even like one maybe I'll say two

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:24.050
just to get a little ambitious but we

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.110
can get a luck stat over zero and start

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:28.070
getting spirit hearts for getting hit

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:31.400
there's something to be said about this

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:35.000
run I do see the the tinted rock in

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:36.800
there I'm always sad to lose money or

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.320
nominee goes power of a - touched by the

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:43.370
way - that like straight-up naughty the

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:45.200
no low key no high key just regularly

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:46.970
one of my favorite items in the game

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.940
sure it requires some enabling but when

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:51.950
it pops it pops - so I'm very

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:55.460
disappointed to see that one go but I

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:58.870
love to watch it leave now if I could

00:09:55.460 --> 00:10:03.560
just get you to stand still for like um

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:05.450
mark a second that's a microsecond but -

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.010
markiplier he experiences time just

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:10.370
slightly differently than the rest of us

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:11.660
we're gonna head down here if you could

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.310
stand still were just a mark a sec I'm

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:17.450
gonna kill you no time flat

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:19.490
we shouldn't check that yet but if you

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:21.860
this is a trap by the way we don't want

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:25.700
to use a box of friends here cuz this

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:28.220
enemy is easy enough box of friends is

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:31.070
just gonna make this guaranteed kill

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:36.650
take half as much time so you're better

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:39.920
off to do things that way as annoyed as

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:46.670
I am that we can't seem to pop off early

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:50.870
as Lilith this is a tough one as well we

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:53.840
have to play right we can't just be like

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:55.850
oh the run is hard and old patrol engine

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.250
screwing us so those guys don't block

00:10:55.850 --> 00:11:00.760
shots that's just the how that works or

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.200
more power - yeah I suppose which me

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.610
we can't just go to the curse room

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.230
willy-nilly and we are gonna take damage

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:07.210
there so we're gonna ruin our deal of

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.860
the devil chance but dog throw it away

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:10.480
and also don't go chasing waterfalls

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.200
stick to the rivers and the lakes that

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.120
you're used to

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:18.010
we got another familiar and that's an

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:20.800
okay pick up as as lilith now we do have

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:23.890
the ability and it's a little bit shaky

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:28.560
in here but we do have the ability to go

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:32.260
into this room and just don't get hit

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:36.580
for God's sake there's a spirit hard it

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:39.760
made it worthwhile we'll go pick up

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:41.680
young Hart and by the way lord knows I'm

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.930
tempted to get rid of box of friends

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:47.800
it's like slightly better than bad which

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:50.650
is why I keep it around here but if we

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:52.120
can get scoop the whoop I'm all over it

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:54.220
I think I'm past the point where I'm

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.750
like we got a as a poly on you keep the

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.370
void cuz you're like I want to keep the

00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:01.320
original flavor of the character on this

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:03.940
one I'm like we got to win so sorry

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:08.530
it's the built in same factor we got to

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:09.730
get over nice job okay so our luck stats

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:14.350
still not good but we have a trinket

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:16.450
that I'm quite fond of the more bombs we

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:17.980
can get the merry or no question should

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:20.500
we use a bomb to get two bombs if you

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:23.170
answered no first off your player after

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.760
my own heart secondly you are wrong but

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:27.550
you probably know it so you know what

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:30.550
keep doing you I respect that kind of

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:32.650
like brazen confidence so we squandered

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:36.640
yeah we'd like royal II squander that

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:38.560
but let's give this one a try we got to

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:45.220
remember we're on challenges now we

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:46.780
actually can do a donation machine

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:49.330
plague we could blow up our donation

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:52.150
machine we also apparently get best bud

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:54.370
activated when we use a box of friends

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:57.160
it's not like 10 out of 10 but it's a

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:59.650
pretty useful little value added and

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.210
considered before deal with the devil

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:04.930
does not exist and does not deserve to

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:06.100
exist toothpicks is great though so I

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:08.560
think we should go through the rest of

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:11.320
this floor look for a secret room a

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:13.570
secret room in particular is really nice

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.350
for us if it contains some money these

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.300
are two of the

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:19.420
Hill which means especially with the

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:21.070
tinted rock we should go for it because

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.480
if they're bad we'll only take one if

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:26.250
they're good we'll take to the other

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.250
ones not worth going for it's bad gas

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:30.820
still I think it was worth a try it's

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:34.210
probably our secret room right here well

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:36.790
the 50-50 and we got the wrong 50 in

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:39.670
that one this humbling bundle you got to

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:41.140
go with it if you have to blow up a

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.400
donation machine to get humbling bundle

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.770
that's like a 10 a 10

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.990
easiest decision I'll make today that's

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:48.520
not true the easiest decision I'll make

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:50.500
today's what they have for breakfast all

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.300
we had is cereal so I said to myself we

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:55.030
might have cereal or nothing as his

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:56.260
cereal you might say nothing but I for

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:56.620
me breakfast the most important meal of

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:03.240
the day

00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:05.230
I always said you know people don't like

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:08.290
people have stopped coming to me for

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:09.400
advice first off it's never good I guess

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:10.960
if you're looking for advice if the

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.450
first thing someone says to you is like

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.970
I don't know what I'm talking about

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:17.730
but i just find it honest though like

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:19.720
that that's an honest bit of advice

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:21.010
people like what do you what would you

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.540
do in this situation and I'm like well

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:24.040
first off I'm kind of an idiot but

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.390
here's what I would do this no no don't

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.830
tell me like that tell me like you're an

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:29.170
authority figure it's all about the

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:30.700
therapy to the to the person who wants

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:34.180
the advice for whatever reason I don't

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:36.220
get that but secondly I always say

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:37.450
things that they don't want to hear like

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.770
whenever someone's like oh I'm feeling

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:40.060
kind of bad today I'm like does you

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:42.880
breakfast like yeah I'm like deal with

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:44.770
GD lunch like yeah would you have oh I

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.170
had the you know a bag of chips with the

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:48.370
sandwich there's your problem

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:49.540
try having a piece of fruit instead see

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:50.920
how that sorts yeah well that's not

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:52.930
really germane to the problem right now

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:55.180
an elbow just so Kaylee I mean you might

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:56.470
be right but tell me tomorrow mix it up

00:14:55.180 --> 00:15:00.580
tomorrow and tell me of the same things

00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:03.610
happening I might be a bad friend I

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:06.690
don't know I think I'm a bad friend to

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:06.690
talk to if you have real problems

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:13.620
cuz I'm just I I'm like yeah many of you

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:14.700
are probably not that comfortable

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:17.070
talking to children

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:18.690
I understand but before I taught I was

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:20.850
kind of in the same boat where I'm like

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:22.620
you always try to reason with children

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:24.150
as if they're adults because you feel

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.920
weird putting on a baby voice like it

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:27.210
demeans them somehow and then you get

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.190
over and eventually you just go alright

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:30.840
you're not an adult so I can go like hey

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:35.430
what you got there slugger

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:36.720
a baseball card a baseball card Wow

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:38.370
you know if you did that to an adult you

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:40.050
get punched in the face you spend like

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:42.380
our entire adolescence learning not to

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:45.270
talk to people like that but anyway

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:47.940
that's how I feel talking to adults who

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:49.410
are under emotional distress when

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:53.160
they're like I had a really bad day I'm

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:53.670
like what's what's the problem there

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:57.120
slugger

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:59.970
oh they foreclosed on your house huh

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:03.740
well that's too bad you know I'd said

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:08.550
it's it's a problem I should work to fix

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:10.560
I'm not like emotionless but just get

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:12.330
uncomfortable around other people's

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.460
emotions is the thing so we've

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:16.980
squandered our deal with the devil yet

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:18.480
again I blame myself and by myself I

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.980
mean I'm gonna say that I blame myself

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.790
but internally I'm blaming the game

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:26.120
because I would how many of you are

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:29.010
there here too many is the answer I

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:30.990
would really like to hit an item room or

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:33.300
a shop or find a single Tintin Rock on

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:35.220
this floor because you know how am I

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:38.670
supposed to be expected to protect

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:40.440
myself you can't even hit the enemies

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:42.030
because of the fact that you know we're

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.440
Lilith in the first place and then you

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:45.710
know I digress okay let's just move

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.710
along

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.470
we will fight the boss the only reason

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:53.350
not to fight the boss is if we think

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:56.440
we're gonna die or I guess okay we will

00:16:53.350 --> 00:17:00.070
not fight the boss oh it might be for

00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:03.100
the best to fight the boss should use

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:07.540
more bombs in combat - not a secret room

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:09.790
alright let's we can take this boss as

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:12.610
long as he doesn't accidentally hit us

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:19.810
with our own bomb I like our odds here

00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:23.020
and we should really like bomb up okay

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:25.150
we got lucky damage is getting pretty

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:29.020
good but still like survivability is an

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:30.340
issue we do have gimpy but the bud is

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:33.970
pretty obvious that we're not really

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:35.800
crushing it from a lock standpoint we

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:39.280
can afford to use bombs quite frequently

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:42.700
because we have a lot of them and if we

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:45.850
can use the bomb to to damage an enemy

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:47.470
that was it an extremely lucky dodge you

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:49.450
can use a bomb to damage an enemy and

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:53.140
also give us a chance at like getting a

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:54.790
penny well that's pretty lucky then we

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.320
we usually will get our bomb back or at

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:59.350
least we'll have a decent chance - so

00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:00.910
like something like this I'll use two

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:03.430
bombs to get to sense I think it could

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:04.900
be worth it I mean with hub like bundle

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:06.430
if it gives us a bomb it will give us

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:09.130
two bombs and now that I think about it

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:11.410
so oh they did just got both bombs

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:12.940
anyway oh well it could give you a troll

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:18.550
bomb that's the outcome nobody

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:19.840
considered we're in this weird position

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:21.430
where look if you look at the items on

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:23.410
the right side of the screen you'd be

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:25.240
saying this is an amazing run and then I

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:30.700
say it's Lilith and you go okay say no

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:33.490
more it's a little jacked just because

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:35.470
it's hard to hit the enemies in the

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:37.030
first place so I think we blow this up

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:39.690
we obviously got to donate a lot to it

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:43.030
as well but we got to strike a balance

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:45.370
so we'll take the extra spear at heart

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.870
the entire reason for that is just

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:48.790
trying to keep our deal with the devil

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:51.670
chances live you know one brimstone

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:53.110
could set the world on fire here so

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:55.710
there goes the one spirit art we

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:55.710
purchased

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:03.020
we can use some speed or something like

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:03.890
the runs just missing a certain you're

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:08.230
in the st. claw

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:08.230
yeah good player Manning the keyboard

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:18.560
power pill none of that was really worth

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:20.990
it Oh or was it speed up that's still

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.370
damage okay fine let's go I'll give you

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:24.740
a let's go for that is that I happy

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:26.480
let's go it's not the most excited let's

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:32.030
go I've ever had but it's a it's a let's

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:33.620
go not a secret room secret room might

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:35.270
as well look dude it's free bombs if we

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:37.430
get it maybe if there's money inside

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:40.550
well there's literally free bombs inside

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:45.560
it's like a the game told a well-crafted

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:48.170
joke subverted my expectations paralysis

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:53.120
pill magic mushroom please I'm bagging

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:54.860
yeah well you know the runs not that

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:57.680
good cuz despite all the great items we

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:59.930
got we're behind schedule and it's not

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:02.690
like we've been doing particularly you

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:05.420
know incredible stuff so we head down

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:07.310
there is an out for us here there's an

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:11.270
amazing play on the next floor and it

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:17.810
revolves around getting an arcade just

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:21.890
give me that arcade and possibly

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:24.740
remember D to use box of friends more

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:28.340
frequently it's a range up okay with

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:31.280
that puzzle room if I get hit on this

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:34.970
one it's a hundred percent me battery

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:36.710
charge okay there's a lot of items I

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:38.740
would give up box of friends for at the

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:42.500
present moment

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:45.890
Wow that was extremely close I'm gonna

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:49.310
use it here but I would give up box of

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:53.240
friends for Book of Revelations Satanic

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:55.880
Bible the nail anything that gives us HP

00:20:53.240 --> 00:21:01.430
basically okay thank you can we get a

00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:04.130
little action here oh lucky yes and then

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:10.610
like extremely unlucky us mere moments

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:12.770
later just escape what do I want to see

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:14.660
from a deal with the devil weirdly

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:16.580
enough I always want offence but I don't

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.900
really want offence right now I don't

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:20.090
want it the most if they're gonna give

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:25.730
us like brimstone or moms knife sign me

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:28.700
up but I would love to get like dark

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:31.460
bomb we're gonna get a lot of red hearts

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:34.550
thanks to gimpy dark bomb could allow us

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:36.830
to make that like biggest use of them if

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:40.610
we're talking item rooms pyromaniac is

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:44.690
like a really really good a bit of fun

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:47.750
for us here makes it tough for us to die

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:53.000
despite having very little HP this is

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:55.700
bad but offense isn't really our problem

00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:00.080
everything else is and also it is a

00:21:55.700 --> 00:22:03.800
little bit still like offense isn't our

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:07.100
biggest problem but it's probably not

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:09.020
like MVP territory here and a lot of

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:11.570
it's been my own fault admittedly but

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:13.520
games kind of gotta meet us halfway here

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:15.410
I guess giving us a bunch of really

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.030
really decent items is not meeting us

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:23.150
halfway in my world cuz I'm entitled

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:26.960
well I am a millennial after all why

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:28.760
won't the Millennials stop complaining

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:34.000
that the houses in their neighborhood

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:34.000
are 1.1 million dollars okay

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:40.320
Haga lies here a font is 10 out of 10

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:49.290
Haga lies I'm gonna look for some magic

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:51.030
machines we didn't get any yeah we left

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:53.190
in the middle of that explosive diarrhea

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:54.930
going off cuz you know honestly I'll

00:22:53.190 --> 00:23:00.630
stay for the fart but I'm not around to

00:22:54.930 --> 00:23:03.120
handle the the mess that comes later I'm

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:05.790
a millennial after all okay now

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:10.980
good job good job item room be kind

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:13.590
that's kind offensive item honestly like

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:15.600
not all damage upgrades are created

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:18.570
equal and this one is one of the better

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.650
ones but it's also after we've gotten a

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:20.850
bunch of pretty good ones so I'm not

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.560
looking to give towards the mouth I'm

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:24.090
always happy to have extra damage but

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:26.100
you know I think it means a little bit

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:27.510
less to go from like 5 to 7 damage than

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.450
it does to go from three and a half to

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:31.800
five in the first place thank you gimpy

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:32.400
she's not saying as bad it could have

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.140
been a lot worse

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:37.890
for example it could have been magic

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:40.550
fingers again for the 20th time no

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:40.550
tinted rocks

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:48.780
it had to be a curse the lost on on the

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:51.390
run where I needed to find an arcade to

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:56.970
write just remember you know I'm trying

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:59.580
to read make my Isaac habits here one

00:23:56.970 --> 00:24:01.560
thing we should do is play slower like

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:04.850
we have no reason to play quickly on

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:08.670
this run almost you got somewhere to be

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:10.740
because we've already done boss rush

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:14.700
hush would be fine I can't remember if

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:17.070
we've done it or not more damage and we

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:20.670
will take it it's very risky but I think

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:22.170
gimpy mitigates the risk somewhat that

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:23.550
being said now we can't take advantage

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:25.110
of an arcade as much so I'm gonna head

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:27.240
down to the next floor we're at the tear

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:28.830
cap I think I don't think we've gotten

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:32.040
anything that's busted that open for us

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:35.730
yet I think you stick with burne penny

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:39.000
here and we're just gonna rely on like

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:42.620
sheer killing power I guess that's the

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.620
that's what this runs gonna come down to

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:48.960
and honestly the stats are built for it

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:51.630
right now eight point five damage on the

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:54.600
depths one really good rate of fire cap

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:57.570
literally can't get better until we pick

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:59.580
up some enablers spacebar item leaves a

00:24:57.570 --> 00:25:03.680
little bit to be desired but every now

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:03.680
and then a good little bit lonely as

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:09.830
and trinket I still think there's a

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.190
game-changing moment left in this burnt

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:16.750
penny but I don't know if I'll be alive

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:16.750
to see it here power pill dude

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:24.530
power pill is like exactly decent I'm

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:27.380
mad at myself but I should have known

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:32.030
that that could have happened throw a

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:34.070
bomb in here we don't really need keys

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:38.540
we don't have Guppies tails so the keys

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:41.390
are fairly unlikely to ever require the

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:43.760
amount that we have right now although I

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:46.610
might be lucky if they do who knows what

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:49.420
that could mean for us this is the worst

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:53.470
like enemies who suffer knock back and

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:56.270
also drift like their unhittable

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:59.510
it's like infest the Furious three Tokyo

00:25:56.270 --> 00:26:02.440
Drift when little bow-wow says if you

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:05.210
can get up to 120 kilometres an hour

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:07.100
it's like you get up to 80 the police

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:10.010
won't even try to catch you man and I

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:12.380
was like yeah it sounds legit that's

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:14.000
like if you commit too many murders the

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:17.240
police are like he's too dangerous to

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.710
try to lock up this seems like one of

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.090
those things that I'm ignorant in and

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:21.559
maybe that there actually is like a

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:22.820
precedent for like yeah they don't chase

00:26:21.559 --> 00:26:25.850
you cuz it's too dangerous to the other

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:27.679
pedestrians but at the same time when

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:30.170
little bow-wow says it in the 3rd Fast

00:26:27.679 --> 00:26:35.960
and the Furious movie you go oh god I

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:38.420
see some sources on that one so we've

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.940
been taking some damage we did get an HP

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:44.150
upgrade pill which is really nice

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:46.010
predominantly survivability but maybe

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:48.470
fuel for a deal with the devil but we

00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:49.790
got to be very cautious with the deals

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:51.679
with the devil we take at this point

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:54.020
because as we learn from so many of

00:26:51.679 --> 00:26:56.150
these challenges like we can pretty

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:59.730
easily screw ourselves by just having a

00:26:56.150 --> 00:27:02.279
little bit too much hubris

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:05.399
the shop is actually where we want to be

00:27:02.279 --> 00:27:06.870
so I'm happy with this

00:27:05.399 --> 00:27:09.149
don't give me greed unless you're gonna

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:11.519
give me like Steam sale and then restock

00:27:09.149 --> 00:27:17.720
on the next floor compass is fine no

00:27:11.519 --> 00:27:19.950
dude we're going jar of flies and

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:27.809
compass but we're going Jarrah flies

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:29.490
over nice-ish over box of friends

00:27:27.809 --> 00:27:30.870
because it's actually more useful we

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:32.820
should probably reroll box of friends

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:34.769
cuz it's free and then ended up being

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:36.779
garbage because it give us some mister

00:27:34.769 --> 00:27:41.809
whatever his name is in this game it's

00:27:36.779 --> 00:27:41.809
not mr. music so because they get sued

00:27:42.769 --> 00:27:47.429
maybe I don't know Adult Swim seems like

00:27:46.169 --> 00:27:48.510
one of those companies that at first

00:27:47.429 --> 00:27:52.889
glance it doesn't seem like they'd

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:54.630
litigate but you would be just that much

00:27:52.889 --> 00:27:57.990
more betrayed if they did right you'd be

00:27:54.630 --> 00:28:04.169
like I thought you were cool you made

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:07.409
Aqua Teen Hunger Force what it's like to

00:28:04.169 --> 00:28:11.490
be like a lawyer at Adult Swim or at the

00:28:07.409 --> 00:28:14.309
firm that Adult Swim retains well the

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:15.960
talent Eric Andre smashed a plate on his

00:28:14.309 --> 00:28:17.760
head in front of our client

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:20.429
Lauren Conrad and blah blah blah blah

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:23.809
and probably just like okay oh good

00:28:20.429 --> 00:28:29.700
so Jarrah flies is actually worthless

00:28:23.809 --> 00:28:32.580
Jarrah Flies gives us one fly because

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:34.590
it's Incubus getting the kills not me or

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:36.179
maybe it was just broken for a second

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:42.000
there cuz now it appears to be working

00:28:36.179 --> 00:28:45.269
who knows so we're on depths one still I

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.570
don't know two keys for a tea bombs who

00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:47.570
cares

00:28:50.419 --> 00:28:59.029
please be Luck upgrades Deus health up

00:28:55.289 --> 00:28:59.029
these health ops are out of control

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:06.179
give me some HP back

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:08.700
I do want blood bag I really want IV bag

00:29:06.179 --> 00:29:16.470
as well so we can't obviously get both

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:18.169
but blood bag speed and HP obviously IV

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:26.070
bag

00:29:18.169 --> 00:29:34.710
gimpy plays activating a swarm protector

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:37.019
as well come on just a single like gimpy

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:43.980
payout would be worth my while here as

00:29:37.019 --> 00:29:45.259
well that was so dumb I just stood in

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:48.120
the eye of the storm

00:29:45.259 --> 00:29:50.850
let it happen okay we got plenty of balm

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:53.370
so just use them get out use them break

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:56.059
the wrist walk away break the wrist walk

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:58.529
away I don't know why it's been such a

00:29:56.059 --> 00:30:01.259
challenge to get a winning Eden run

00:29:58.529 --> 00:30:05.190
sorry yeah winning Lilith run partly bad

00:30:01.259 --> 00:30:07.830
play admittedly but blood bank we got it

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:09.809
and I'm content I mean we went from 0 HP

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:12.500
to 4 HP on one floor so somebody up

00:30:09.809 --> 00:30:12.500
there likes me

00:30:13.169 --> 00:30:22.779
it'd be hard for argue for us to argue

00:30:15.789 --> 00:30:24.700
the the opposite in this case we're

00:30:22.779 --> 00:30:26.169
doing great work even without box of

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:28.120
friends remembered we're gonna miss box

00:30:26.169 --> 00:30:30.130
and friends were not using it but it was

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:33.850
also like only available once every four

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:36.159
rooms so don't let that trick you speed

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:37.120
upgrade is a speed upgrade I think at

00:30:36.159 --> 00:30:44.919
this point you probably know how to

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:47.049
judge those for yourself situational but

00:30:44.919 --> 00:30:49.480
kind of still in a little bit of a

00:30:47.049 --> 00:30:50.080
holding pattern but the four HP from one

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.049
floor

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:54.129
they weren't gifts I mean we worked for

00:30:52.049 --> 00:30:55.419
one of them was the item room so there's

00:30:54.129 --> 00:30:58.779
an opportunity cost of one of them we

00:30:55.419 --> 00:31:00.870
worked on that blood bank really thought

00:30:58.779 --> 00:31:03.909
we had the speed to make it out there

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:06.490
but the fact that they existed was like

00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:07.750
a huge plus regardless he's got a good

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:11.049
deal with the devil chance here don't

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:12.370
squander it so many things could just

00:31:11.049 --> 00:31:14.679
make your dreams come true

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:17.019
I still don't I so jar applies is

00:31:14.679 --> 00:31:18.759
garbage it just does not work luckily we

00:31:17.019 --> 00:31:23.950
got one more shop if it has greed a

00:31:18.759 --> 00:31:27.240
little cheesed off how Incubus are you

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:27.240
working for you're like a double agent

00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:39.669
splinter cell or otherwise oh my god

00:31:35.799 --> 00:31:43.409
okay I can't be too cheesed lest I get a

00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:43.409
reputation for being a little cheesy

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:53.289
but where's my blood bank it's kind of

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:55.539
like a pivotal part of my plan it's okay

00:31:53.289 --> 00:31:57.039
item room and shop whenever the item

00:31:55.539 --> 00:31:58.360
room is shopper together you know

00:31:57.039 --> 00:32:08.649
there's gonna be trouble

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:10.539
I don't know sorry I'm I'm working you

00:32:08.649 --> 00:32:12.130
might be wondering why I got quiet there

00:32:10.539 --> 00:32:13.750
in my head right now I'm just saying

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:15.399
like when they get together you know

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:17.019
there's gonna be trouble I was like

00:32:15.399 --> 00:32:19.570
there's got to be like a movie tagline

00:32:17.019 --> 00:32:22.000
in there you've got to take conehead HP

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:26.799
well spear and hard plus it gives you a

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:29.350
damaged negation you gotta go chaos to

00:32:26.799 --> 00:32:35.130
it clubs ancient recall is a bunch of

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:42.610
cards to a diamonds moon card judgment

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:43.659
that's a luck upgrade right no it's well

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:45.909
we're not doing anything else with their

00:32:43.659 --> 00:32:48.760
money so in my head I was like there's

00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:50.019
got to be like I'm a movie name that

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:51.639
could use that when they get together

00:32:50.019 --> 00:32:52.990
you know there's gonna be trouble so in

00:32:51.639 --> 00:32:54.669
my head I was like their neighbors and

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:56.019
the movie could be called like adjacent

00:32:54.669 --> 00:32:58.210
but then I was like what if you made it

00:32:56.019 --> 00:33:00.970
one of the Friday the 13th movies that's

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:02.649
right adjacent Voorhees but it took me a

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:05.529
long time to put those pieces together

00:33:02.649 --> 00:33:06.940
in my head I don't care what you give me

00:33:05.529 --> 00:33:09.519
just give me anything for like the

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:15.070
trouble of being here sure that's

00:33:09.519 --> 00:33:19.210
actually completely okay I just don't

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:21.460
care about a devil card so there's a

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:24.990
couple of things I'm running in the old

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:30.370
noggin right here one of them is bombs

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:35.010
might and clearly do activate Jarah

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:35.010
flies so we want to use those

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:41.270
even if we just use them to store up

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:44.960
flies for the boss fight' trust me when

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:46.400
I say I'm not happy with that but I

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:48.110
don't understand why an incubus kill

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:50.210
doesn't count as getting the kill anyway

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:52.490
because you're not getting the kill

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:55.040
well I'm also not getting the kill when

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:57.650
I drop a bomb on an enemy it's your bomb

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:59.690
well it's my Incubus no the Incubus he

00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:02.360
has his own sense of agency okay

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:04.550
whatever you say incredibly convoluted

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:08.030
straw man argument I made up in my own

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:09.770
head you're not even real okay that's

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:11.990
why a straw man's logical fallacy is

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:15.680
because I exist and it doesn't so suck

00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:27.320
on that I made myself mad with my own

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:30.170
counter-argument good work go for the

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:31.940
easy mode take it die man why not at

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:33.170
this point I guess we got Leviathan

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.100
which is huge I was looking for

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:36.770
Beelzebub

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:39.950
we got a Leviathan so now we can fly our

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:44.050
damage is really good and dude Loki

00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:48.320
compass is the greatest of all of our

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:48.860
pickups here the less rooms we do the

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:52.760
better

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:58.640
Loki probably best played by Thomas

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:59.690
Hiddleston in my in my assessment at

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:01.310
least Thor

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:05.900
Chris Hemsworth at his jokes goin

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:12.410
nowhere much like Thor the dark world at

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:15.380
the box office right I oh that movie

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:18.410
came out like seven years ago uh we

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:20.780
actually got teleported by a curse of

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:21.950
the maze we gonna go cursed room would

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.780
you go curse room

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:25.370
cuz I'm probably gonna go curse room

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:30.290
originally the answer is gonna be no cuz

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:32.480
it's more sane to avoid it but we can

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:34.970
fly so we're only gonna get hit once

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:37.150
as long as like viaje by enemies on the

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:37.150
roof

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:43.190
it's like the weirdest run because if it

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:48.710
was any other character we would have

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:50.540
gotten carried this run is like you know

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:51.830
I mean nine damage five rate of fire

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:54.170
that's all you need to know along with

00:35:51.830 --> 00:36:00.380
really good HP so it should be winnable

00:35:54.170 --> 00:36:01.970
for anybody but Lilith is the only wild

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:04.760
card we gotta situate gotta pee this

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:09.700
room there's no question even if only to

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:09.700
like replenish your your bomb supply

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:14.280
[Music]

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:21.050
wouldn't mind getting like I mean

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:24.200
Guppies head would be better than JA

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:28.520
replies no such luck

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:32.390
no troll bombs please thank you and this

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:37.520
guy stands no chance definitely we are

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:40.370
not going to the hush fight like I might

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:42.850
actually be content to try but we're

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:45.170
just not gonna make it in time I think

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:47.030
tinted rock - small rock could be so

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:49.760
good we got the speed necessary to

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:51.260
absorb the loss but oh okay that's why I

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:53.300
love curse of the maze you get attached

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:58.640
to the idea of moving somewhere and then

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:59.150
no surprise you go with nowhere wait let

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:03.590
me try it again

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:06.560
hey freak show you going nowhere I got

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:10.850
you for three minutes three minutes late

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:13.310
time which my college roommate maintains

00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:16.010
to this day we had like a actual

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:17.600
argument he maintains to this day it's

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:20.660
three minutes of me time and I will

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:22.820
never forget that we watched it he said

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:26.330
you can watch Macho Man Randy Savage his

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:29.300
mouth he says pole' he makes a plosive

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:31.670
he goes on IMDB to check and the IMDB

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:34.670
quote submitted probably by him like two

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:36.770
hours earlier said three three minutes

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:39.200
of me time and the see use that as like

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:41.750
the the feather in his cap for the whole

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:46.230
argument despite reality

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:48.600
never meet your heroes kids he's a

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:50.640
pretty cool guy all right let's continue

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.900
working towards Beelzebub for no reason

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:53.910
oh we got Lord of the Flies which is

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:55.980
Beelzebub unlock something in the game

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:58.260
so it turns out it wasn't for no reason

00:37:55.980 --> 00:38:01.440
it was just for not a great reason we

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:04.050
got something unlocked in the game still

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:07.770
kinda at this point like let's shy away

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:11.210
from our curse rooms I think we might

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:14.070
need this might be the only HP we get so

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:20.100
might as well lean on it as much as we

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:22.440
can cherub flies is only even like a

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:25.530
little competent that was such a bad

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:27.590
dodge it's only even a little competent

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:30.090
here because of the fact that we have

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:36.090
homing but bombs and also like

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:40.020
eighty-three of them so you might be

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:42.900
unhappy with this one I'm not intending

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:44.610
to fight hush we will almost certainly

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:47.850
get the chance which is a big surprise

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:50.490
to me but I'm not it's it's not on my

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:53.010
to-do list definitely won't be

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:55.740
backtracking health up is so good range

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:58.070
up is just fine but still thanks for

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:58.070
asking

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:04.830
what were you doing there homing shot I

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:08.490
got a no I got to see the targeting code

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:17.720
ah just find something and kind of go in

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:17.720
a circle around it land of confusion

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:23.400
yeah I'm definitely not gonna be

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:27.450
fighting hush go ahead baby has appeared

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:31.260
in the basement that is a that is a

00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:33.000
co-op baby sprite that maybe gives the

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:35.760
main player the go-ahead I don't know i

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.109
I've played a ton of co-op I'm might be

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:39.660
in the running for having played the

00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:43.410
most Isaac co-op on earth by a you know

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:45.570
Kate's YouTube videos shows streams anti

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:48.599
birth rebirth after birth after birth

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:50.430
plus etc etc I still have almost no idea

00:39:48.599 --> 00:39:51.540
what the baby mechanics are like there

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:53.849
are probably people out there who have

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:56.640
me beat in hours but I got it

00:39:53.849 --> 00:40:00.960
I imagine the like 80% of people who own

00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:03.180
Isaac have never booted up co-op so it's

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:05.820
like being a doubles tennis player you

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:09.119
know just by virtue of having played

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:10.500
quite a lot of singles I don't know

00:40:09.119 --> 00:40:13.490
where I'm going with that metaphor but

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:13.490
Daniel Nestor right

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:23.440
okay we don't want to open that I'm

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:26.890
actually like again scared for my life

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:29.800
on this one and I think I should be good

00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:32.470
card not a good card at this point I

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:33.760
think I should be for HP is that you

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:35.230
know just enough it's the most dangerous

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.770
lead and Isaac that's what they always

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:38.650
say

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:48.270
and as the John Madden of Isaac I think

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:50.410
I'm content to say it let's go down here

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:52.870
can't bomb our way through the big room

00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:54.370
that makes me very sad two extra spirit

00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:58.660
hearts is gonna go a long way towards

00:40:54.370 --> 00:41:00.130
making things work here though Lord of

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:03.640
the Flies is also allowing us to

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:05.830
occasionally generate flies I respect it

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:07.360
it's not quite the same you know it

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:15.130
doesn't make up for jar of flies not

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:18.420
working basically at all but it's a

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:20.740
start it's a little bit of a Mia culpa

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:23.830
sorry I've never seen home alone

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:30.190
it's me a couple of the the lead child

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:31.750
Hector thank God for homing bombs cuz

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:34.900
the Incubus is knocking these ones like

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:36.940
way out of left field or in the left

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:39.930
field I don't know literally didn't have

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:39.930
righties that pole

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:47.820
it's alright we lost her spirit arts but

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:49.050
you can never take away our freedom also

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:51.480
you can't take away the fact that it's

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:55.590
look at 61 but bombs here I can't

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:57.270
believe that we got gimpy and zero luck

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:59.160
you see how many pennies we picked up

00:41:57.270 --> 00:42:03.660
over the course of this run luck ups

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:07.260
just don't exist no luck up hills no

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:08.880
magic scabs shouldn't have stood there

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:12.570
we should not pick up the spirit heart

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:15.690
actually we should let it go in fact you

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:19.440
might think I'm crazy here but we

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:22.770
actually can afford to take no we can't

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:24.330
I was gonna say we could afford to take

00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:29.220
a hit I'm gonna do it anyway

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:31.140
I was trying to get gimpy to pay out no

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:33.360
we'll do that there will come a time

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:35.670
where we will luck into a Judas sorry a

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:37.320
Lilith run that's just great and then

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:38.580
we'll do that but rune bag appearing in

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:44.370
the basement is actually a really great

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:49.020
item HP HP stop watching the card not

00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:51.650
that good card is the moon HP is nice

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:51.650
don't get me wrong

00:42:54.599 --> 00:43:00.029
I'm happy to be I'm not happy for that

00:42:57.150 --> 00:43:01.739
but I'm happy to be a a little closer

00:43:00.029 --> 00:43:04.229
maybe to where the boss fight is gonna

00:43:01.739 --> 00:43:06.779
take place I'm still scared we did not

00:43:04.229 --> 00:43:09.239
get carried at least not as much as I

00:43:06.779 --> 00:43:11.640
would have liked to it did I did I put

00:43:09.239 --> 00:43:12.989
enough conjunctions in there at least

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:15.930
not as much as I would have liked to

00:43:12.989 --> 00:43:18.569
have liked to have there we go that's

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:20.039
that it sounded right but I couldn't

00:43:18.569 --> 00:43:23.420
shake the lingering suspicion something

00:43:20.039 --> 00:43:23.420
with that sentence or same dress

00:43:29.039 --> 00:43:41.950
okay it's a long road and we also don't

00:43:34.059 --> 00:43:46.539
expect to get many / any items due to

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:48.400
our again kind of anemic luck step we're

00:43:46.539 --> 00:43:52.960
gonna try though and hey man the

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:54.940
occasional broken stopwatch working out

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:56.859
in our favor is fine by me sure some

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:59.650
rooms are probably gonna be larger as a

00:43:56.859 --> 00:44:02.999
result as are you faster as a result got

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:02.999
the wrong Daft Punk lyric there

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:16.200
but this room being a little easier is a

00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:23.490
okay by me still got 36 bombs one for

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:27.300
every chamber in the wu-tang clan and HP

00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:29.640
we've might want eventually for now this

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:32.130
is like I don't know if I've ever seen a

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:34.260
run with stats like this be this

00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:40.500
underwhelming it's like yeah we got

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:42.960
great everything and it sucks but we

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:44.880
we've already unlocked some parts of the

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:46.830
post-it note as Lilith shouldn't have

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:47.670
picked that up yet a little bit of a

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:49.710
sloppy plate

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:51.030
we've already unlocked some parts of the

00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:53.460
poster notice Lilith and I think we're

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:59.940
gonna get the big one here as well it's

00:44:53.460 --> 00:45:01.500
like absolutely useless but I'm a

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:03.450
logical manner at some point I have to

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:05.550
think that if we're getting Bad Seeds

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:07.320
over and over there's there's a point at

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:09.270
which I could believe that we're just

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:10.740
getting it by bad berries and then

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:12.780
there's a point at which I'm like okay I

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:14.580
got a look internally and see what I'm

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:16.920
doing around here I'm not even gonna oh

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:18.390
I thought that was like a double blue

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.410
baby fight there for a second but I'm

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:21.960
not even gonna go back and pick up the

00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:24.120
HP yet cuz if we get hit here and we did

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:25.740
I would like to not lose spirit arts cuz

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:28.100
they're harder to replenish and there's

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:30.630
plenty of red hearts back there so

00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:32.330
better to give ourselves the maximum

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:34.680
chance to get good stuff from gimpy

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:38.190
without losing the good stuff we already

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:41.100
hold sick and now I'm not gonna go back

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:45.960
at all and my master plan is revealed

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:48.390
but our HP ended up being fine there so

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:49.890
we should not be able to lose here Lord

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:51.840
of the Flies is actually working out

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:54.210
okay we're generating some flies for

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:59.940
ourself we've also taken way more hits

00:45:54.210 --> 00:46:04.190
and I'd like to admit here let's put a

00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:06.440
cork in that like ASAP

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:10.430
how sad that I'm looking at this running

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:12.290
going if only we had box of friends we

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:15.770
gave it up for jar of flies which sucked

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:17.569
and he gave that up for deck of cards

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:19.880
which might have actually sucked worse

00:46:17.569 --> 00:46:22.339
at least we got some flies out of jar of

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:24.859
flies deck of cards gave us resources we

00:46:22.339 --> 00:46:28.849
can't even use all it did teleport us as

00:46:24.859 --> 00:46:31.339
well so maybe there's a case but all

00:46:28.849 --> 00:46:33.589
right we made it no sir no sir not today

00:46:31.339 --> 00:46:35.089
we've done it we unlocked cambian

00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:35.990
