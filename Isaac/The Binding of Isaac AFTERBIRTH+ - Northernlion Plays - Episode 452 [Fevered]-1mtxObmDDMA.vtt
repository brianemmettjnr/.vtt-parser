##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.120
everybody fresh off of the wind that we

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.620
had with Azazel last time let's get some

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.120
good stuff done you wanna you want to

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.740
stay here you want to go Tomo you want

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.429
to stay you want to go he wants to use

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.430
God took off like a cat out of heck um

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.359
alright you know what we're making good

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:26.910
progress what about a cane hardmode

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:29.550
negative delirium mega satan hush we

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.000
haven't done hush with cane yet a B WH

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.680
and fx9

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.969
how did we create blood did you see that

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.460
there was like a blood stain in that

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.820
room when I shot and paused at the same

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.559
time it was very strange as was that

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.289
burp that has come out of nowhere but

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:51.300
either way please give me the virus uh

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:53.160
boss I'll tell you what a pill tella

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.670
pills us to the arrow room where we get

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.050
the virus I was stretching a little bit

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.800
there that was probably like a 1 in

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.619
10,000 chance that might only borderline

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.470
be an exaggeration but Cain might be the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:11.010
character that I've played least in the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.170
new save file well obviously I mean you

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.930
know you get a half mark if you save a

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.280
keeper cuz it's not really what I meant

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.400
you get a half mark and you say the loss

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.960
cuz he's not even on locked technically

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.360
correct is not the best kind of correct

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.060
don't let Homer Simpson teach you that

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.560
the answer I was looking for was

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.939
whichever character I've actually played

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.090
as the least of the ones that are like

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.890
default are unlocked quickly because

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.610
Cain you know II he's kind of like he

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.189
got killed with kindness he's really fun

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.899
and relatively easy to win a run with so

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.259
as a result we don't end up doing repeat

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.850
runs like we do with Lilith or you know

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.930
some other characters that tend to be a

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.250
little bit on the more difficult side so

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.799
he's kind of like you know we do one

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.880
Cain run and then we're set for two

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.979
weeks which is fine this time we've got

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.579
an actual to-do list we got to get that

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:11.849
negative sorted out if we can do uh hush

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:13.230
Oh Billy look at that piercing shots

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.610
right off the bat I like the ace of

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.930
spades

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.520
think more than the more than the master

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.770
of unlocking but it's closed like

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.860
they're both reasonably good I don't

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.120
think you can go wrong if we get like

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.770
Guppies tail we might feel a little

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.940
differently about the situation but for

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.990
now this is fine um it would also I mean

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.400
of course if we can get like mega

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.290
Satan's setup on this run that would

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.330
also be great but you know we got a we

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.830
got to play the cards were dealt we've

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.270
been trying to make mega Satan work and

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.750
it's not always coming through in the

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.459
clutch here we might be better off not

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.320
even trying to go for the angel room

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.820
mega Satan path but just going for like

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:55.780
self-sacrifice room path if you go down

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:59.090
a floored reset it resets yourself cells

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.690
it resets your self-sacrifice room path

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.690
so there progress rather so it can be a

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.540
little bit of a tricky enabler but it

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.860
seems okay so far the Sun is a little

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.450
better if we actually have a chance to

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.880
get an arcade on the next floor without

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.010
that chance we're a little bit bereft of

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.440
the same kind of value here but I mean

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.600
the Sun cards still really good we don't

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:27.489
need to do boss rush but we would like

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.489
to do the hush fight if possible

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.799
magician also not particularly strong uh

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.269
this floor is really like it's it sets

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.930
the tone in Tambor for the rest of the

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.070
run if we're able to get to that deal

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.570
with the devil I think we have every

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.239
chance available to win this run in a

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.400
pretty expedited fashion strong I mean

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.100
piercing shots are essentially one of

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.750
the most like underrated damage enablers

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.660
in the game I know I can say an enable a

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:59.950
lot here too low think of me local c'mon

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:02.390
homey enabled but we're actually like

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.680
able to spread our damage around so much

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.209
more effectively your brother Bobby

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.209
helps out with that zero percent

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:19.060
I think we want to do it like this you

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:21.430
know there there is a better way or a

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.200
faster way but there's no safer way than

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.750
this is hoping maybe we've got secret

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.280
room access secret room access gives us

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.350
nothing of value yet but there's always

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.100
a chance

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:36.010
bombs please two cents we get up to five

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.780
cents we can nail probably buy a spear

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.070
at hard from the shop or a bomb that

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.040
could give us more than one spear at

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.410
hard via like a multitude of different

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.680
chances but um I'd rather not cuz I

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:50.730
think we don't really need to right now

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.990
I don't like to spend money that isn't

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.480
necessary for our progress in the game

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.250
you know I'm not the kind I watch other

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.820
people play Isaac and I don't disagree

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.050
with them

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.430
by the way cuz a lot of these people are

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.200
probably better at Isaac than I am

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.870
they'll go to the shop and they'll have

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.700
a spirit art they'll buy like two spirit

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.220
hearts out of the shop via the reroll

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.380
machine I'm like it's not for me it's

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.190
just not the way I play the game one

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.810
spirit art valuable valuable enough but

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.330
they got more of a I'm a feast or famine

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:24.880
shopper and it's true in real life too

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:25.360
you know I it's not that good but I'll

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.800
take it

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.680
Necronomicon is also fine but whatever

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.800
I'm content you know if I've got like

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.170
any food I don't need to go to the

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.250
grocery store if my wife is like let's

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.450
go to the grocery store I'm like you

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.660
know what let's go to the grocery store

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.790
she's got a good point but if it's just

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.710
me I can wait it out for a while I don't

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.970
mind eating you know for breakfast and

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.870
lunch two tablespoons of peanut butter

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:54.490
each not exactly the picture of a

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.120
well-balanced macronutrient profile but

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:00.430
pretty low-maintenance

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.110
in that regard feel the same way about

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.760
the shop I'm like I don't need to buy

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.990
spirit arts when I could just keep five

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.990
cents and not get hit

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:10.699
it's probably a bad habit but I have a

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:12.710
feeling a lot of people out there are

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:16.369
like and that's why like you know

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:18.909
although I rail on Rob and Austin for

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:21.139
eating off paper plates I get it

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:23.029
especially in my younger days I used to

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:25.759
be in a similar boat did I ever use

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:27.229
paper plates no at least I mean I've

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:28.759
used paper plates in my life but did I

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:31.909
ever use them as my primary means of

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:36.020
consuming uh food no usually I tried to

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:37.309
use energy rich calorie etc see and see

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.229
you don't eat the plates is the thing

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:41.870
and I just failed linguistically at

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:47.529
getting that joke out there but I get it

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:47.529
cuz it's about like pseudo optimization

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:53.330
even if it is absolutely terrible for

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:54.770
the planet people have visited they make

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.360
like a false equivalency well they're

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:59.659
like will you use water when you do the

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:02.629
dishes use water to make paper you know

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:06.830
my this is a statistic I'm not making up

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:08.809
it takes 100,000 tons of water to make a

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.309
single sheet of toilet paper so just

00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:12.620
think about that next time you're wiping

00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:13.849
your butt that's why I don't wipe I just

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.430
get in the shower and I use only a

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:19.839
thousand liters of water to pressure

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:23.209
wash that okay look that's not true

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:25.789
neither is that statistic I don't want

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:27.589
to slander the the lumber industry or

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:29.509
the paper industry the pulp industry I

00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:31.370
don't know it's a big part of my

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:34.639
provinces economy so I want to you know

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:37.639
papers got its place I'll admit you know

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:39.979
when I go to the when I go to the public

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:43.550
bathroom if they've got paper towels and

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:45.949
a hand dryer I use the paper towels it's

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:48.649
just faster I also think that they have

00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:50.839
never made a hand dryer that works

00:07:48.649 --> 00:07:52.309
properly I don't know why this is still

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:55.039
a problem in today's modern era like

00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:57.229
recently that Dyson Airblade

00:07:55.039 --> 00:07:59.870
has been you know making its way around

00:07:57.229 --> 00:08:01.370
the the world you know I recently I mean

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:04.459
within the last 10 years that's like the

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:06.919
you know the cyber hand dryer you put

00:08:04.459 --> 00:08:09.229
your hand in it goes like breeze it

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:12.289
shoots the water off that one almost

00:08:09.229 --> 00:08:14.719
works I think mankind is almost hit like

00:08:12.289 --> 00:08:17.930
a certain level of proficiency No thank

00:08:14.719 --> 00:08:19.969
you sir with making with making hand

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.510
dryers there but apart from that the

00:08:19.969 --> 00:08:23.120
ones that

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:24.800
the old you know length spout on the

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.750
nose and then you put your hands under

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.550
it you rub your hands under it as fast

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.830
as you can I think sometimes they

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.390
actually leave wetter than when you just

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:35.060
don't use the hand dryer to begin with

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:36.890
plus you know you got a busy public

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:39.650
bathroom they got like one or two hand

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:44.030
dryers takes 10-15 seconds to dry our

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:46.760
hands at those dad's a lot of overhead

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:48.440
to the whole bathroom game that's why

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:52.280
I'm a paper towel boy through and

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:53.720
through though I'm loath to admit

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.460
let's pop strength because I want to

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.520
finish this room quickly we got other

00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:00.320
things to be gonna hold here magicians

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:04.540
not good it feels like I'm walking on

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.540
sunshine is actually not good either

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:12.350
it's like the most we've ever invested

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:15.140
into a single room here card wise we

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:20.540
need an orbital to make feels like I'm

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:22.100
walking on sunshine any good I also this

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:24.230
is definitely something we've touched on

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:27.560
on the show earlier but I was leaving an

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:29.510
engagement downtown the other day I was

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.870
was I walking fast did stations pass

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:34.310
while I was homebound

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:36.380
dududududududududududu yes to answer

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:38.000
your question well no stations passed I

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.710
I went to one station and then took the

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.530
Sky train back to the station closest to

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:43.940
my abode but anyway the point is when I

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:49.010
left a lot of people had to use the

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:51.230
bathroom I am going to go here so many

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:53.690
people were using the bathroom that all

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:55.490
the urinals were full if you're not

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:57.650
familiar with what a urinal is maybe

00:09:55.490 --> 00:10:00.560
you're of the female persuasion or you

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:04.070
work in a country or live in a country

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:06.140
where urinals are not as common it's

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:09.950
basically just like a personal trough

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:11.480
that you urinate into as a man all the

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.280
urinals were taken I got no problem

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:16.070
using a stall I like to use a stall to

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.540
begin with because I'm like a triple Z

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.310
list celebrity so I do

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.050
I don't wouldn't say I worry but I've

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:22.580
given the choice I'm like I'd rather use

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:24.650
a stall just so somebody doesn't you

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:26.480
know TMZ had a picture of my junk

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:28.010
you know nothing I'm not trying to

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.250
flatter myself by saying that it's you

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:32.980
know scandal worthy I'm just saying you

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:35.050
know if I can avoid that why not

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:37.030
right I like the privacy all the stalls

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:39.520
were taken but I didn't realize until I

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:42.520
got right up almost inside a one because

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:45.190
one dude was in the stall peeing but

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:47.170
with the door open dad actually III

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:48.910
wanted to talk to him but you know it's

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:50.650
kind of a I don't know who he is and

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:52.360
it's kind of a strange question to ask a

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.470
stranger of a hey buddy what went

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.300
through your head when you went into the

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.810
private stall but left the door open to

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.430
pee

00:10:55.810 --> 00:11:01.690
cuz I got a couple different options

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:03.130
here in my noggin man and tell me I want

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:05.500
you to like vote with which one you

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:07.540
think is correct okay one of them would

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.960
be why would I waste my time closing the

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.330
door

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:12.760
I'm just urinating if I was urinating at

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:14.800
a urinal there would be no privacy

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:18.270
anyway you think that's the I think

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:21.820
that's probably number one number two is

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:24.250
he's embarrassed that he's urinating in

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:27.190
his stall because stalls are poop

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:29.830
territory so he doesn't want anybody to

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:34.080
think he's pooping so he leaves the door

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:37.510
open that's number two number three is

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:40.750
this is gonna be a really impressive pee

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:43.090
so I want people to know that it was me

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:47.260
tell Cersei I want her to know it was me

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:49.810
that did this urination I just don't

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:53.260
understand cuz it takes I I understand

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:55.150
the time argument even though it's

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:59.050
stupid and I would tell him that to his

00:11:55.150 --> 00:12:01.380
face or at least insinuated because how

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:05.320
long does it take the closes stall door

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:07.980
15 microseconds you know but I could use

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:10.270
those 15 microseconds to accomplish

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:12.370
thinking about a single flap of a

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:14.680
hummingbird's wings right it's just a

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:16.780
it's a nonsensical argument I really

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:20.230
think it's like a masculinity thing that

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:22.060
the dude is like wow I'm first off I'm

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:24.550
embarrassed but also I noticed our

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:26.770
damage got a little stinky there on that

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:29.860
floor let's keep it going here I think

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:33.070
it's a masculinity thing I think the

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:35.260
dude is saying I got punked out into

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:37.870
using a stall but I don't want anybody

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:40.750
to think that I need privacy to pee cuz

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:42.550
that's some betta nonsense so instead

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:45.520
he's like I'm gonna pee with the door

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:46.660
open like a real man which caring about

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.640
whether or not people

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.980
think you're a real man is an extremely

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.510
alpha thing to be like fully concerned

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:55.900
with whether or not other people think

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:58.870
you're a good dude that's the most alpha

00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:00.400
thing ever being alpha is not caring

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:02.550
about what everybody else thinks that's

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:05.230
why I structure every action in my life

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:08.340
to give the appearance of me not caring

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:11.020
what everybody else thinks

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:13.810
what is this eye patch placement cane I

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:15.520
got a no by the way this run is also

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:17.620
granted deserve a run this great after

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:21.460
throwing the last one but I'll take it

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:22.780
either way well yeah I was just I was

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:25.810
struck it's like a crib Your Enthusiasm

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:28.210
moment but I lack the you know the humor

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:30.310
chops and then attacked or maybe perhaps

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:33.670
I have too much tag to really fully

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:34.930
Larry David it out there I think there

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:37.660
was another tinted rock back here I

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:40.000
think the strikes me as weird like right

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:42.160
when I go into the stall if I go into

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.660
there was no other tint to drive if I go

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:48.010
into a public bathroom and there's

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:54.250
nobody anywhere I take a stall I like

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:55.540
the privacy then I'm like 0% actually

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.100
ashamed of it I'm not gonna argue that

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.840
it's like the best way I think they're

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:01.120
both perfectly fine ways you know it's a

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.680
urinated a urinal it's a urinate in the

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.830
stall as long as you're not pooping at

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:07.270
the urinal that's the only thing that

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:10.840
you know what would really be cause for

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:14.760
alarm I would say do this is also a

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.760
pretty good early spacebar get

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:25.140
it worked um but I just I wanted to know

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:27.430
cuz essentially you're just making me

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.840
hear a little bit more urine than I

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:30.220
otherwise would or see a little bit more

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.780
urine than I otherwise would so I think

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.520
I have the right to at least to at least

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:35.950
ask you to back it up I'm not gonna say

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:37.300
you can't do that but I'd like to I'd

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:38.140
like to ask him the question just be

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.880
like what went through your head

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:44.500
explain to me cuz I think you know

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:46.000
you're a smart guy probably what's the

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:49.240
what's your reasoning for this specific

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.160
thing right here I'd like to know maybe

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:54.160
you guys in Chad have something everyone

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:56.560
thinks I'm being judgmental when I say

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.730
things like this and I am a hundred

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.350
percent However

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:01.750
I think I'm not saying this guy's a

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:04.180
moron I'm just saying I can't understand

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:05.950
the psychology without asking so this is

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:07.590
me asking this is me trying to learn and

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:10.900
do better in the future

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:13.900
got to exactly 15 cents here this run is

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:18.070
ballin so I don't use that word lightly

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:22.330
this is a baller run there's also a

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:25.720
library here it seems or at least a some

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:27.250
kind of special key room that we it's

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:32.520
not a library because it's double key

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:35.590
room stop running into enemies you idiot

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:37.450
it is a dice room okay so it'll reroll

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:39.370
all consumables on the ground in this

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:42.310
room only I don't want to re-roll nose

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:46.080
Goblin so it's pretty much useless right

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:48.340
now try this it's a two of spades

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:50.740
downtown ducka ducka down two down two

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:54.700
down and to take potato peeler I'm gonna

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:57.310
be an idiot because I I want to be this

00:15:54.700 --> 00:16:00.190
allows us to get like a modest damage

00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:02.560
upgrade that in hindsight is completely

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:04.930
irrelevant because we already have 18

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:06.220
damage but also a second level keep of

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.990
meat which is really just the first

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:12.840
level Cuba meat with the sprinkles on

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:14.830
top it also very much compromises our

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:18.340
chances of getting a deal with the devil

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:20.800
which sucks except oh my god the one

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:22.270
time I give up this much HP we get a

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:25.540
deal with our we get a boss fight that

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:27.220
has two blood banks on it that's just a

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.699
slap in the face there's like no other

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.939
way to

00:16:27.699 --> 00:16:32.589
that it's the game insulting me we might

00:16:30.939 --> 00:16:34.209
still take a deal with the devil in fact

00:16:32.589 --> 00:16:38.499
especially with magic mush we probably

00:16:34.209 --> 00:16:39.579
will yeah we definitely will we should

00:16:38.499 --> 00:16:41.319
have played the blood bank a little bit

00:16:39.579 --> 00:16:45.129
I guess in there but dude I mean like

00:16:41.319 --> 00:16:50.069
look at this we got twenty nine damage

00:16:45.129 --> 00:16:53.199
on the second floor pretty great

00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:59.259
we could have also not taken sac dagger

00:16:53.199 --> 00:17:01.980
and instead gone oh my lord oh my god

00:16:59.259 --> 00:17:05.860
instead gone like heavy potato peeler

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:07.870
get a get a third level meat boy and I

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:10.000
actually think that's not what I'm gonna

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:11.350
do but I am gonna take Guppies head cuz

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.240
it's amazing we'll get rid of the pony

00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:15.220
cuz we'll be able to fly on the next

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:18.419
floor if we get guppy items anyway so

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:21.459
this is just like a dream come true

00:17:18.419 --> 00:17:24.789
anyway moving on here that's that's my

00:17:21.459 --> 00:17:28.089
urinal story it's the only one that I

00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:34.409
have it's the only one I get not much of

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:34.409
a story never makes you laugh a lot

00:17:35.159 --> 00:17:43.899
guppy items on the curse room gonna be a

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:46.360
smokey run smokey run lucky the thing

00:17:43.899 --> 00:17:47.529
with and I've never taken like an improv

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.789
class or anything like this so I might

00:17:47.529 --> 00:17:50.529
be talking out of my butt but the thing

00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:53.590
with improv I'm saying this definitively

00:17:50.529 --> 00:17:57.130
as an expert is that you just got it you

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:59.110
got to trust your instincts and really

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:00.940
like have faith in yourself that

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:02.889
whatever word bubbles up to the surface

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:06.519
is actually gonna be relevant to the bit

00:18:02.889 --> 00:18:10.480
at hand and in this case it was not and

00:18:06.519 --> 00:18:12.220
all you know I'll beat myself up over

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:15.600
that later when I when I go back over

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:19.269
this video and you know punch it up

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:26.740
that's a Hollywood term for making your

00:18:19.269 --> 00:18:29.620
script better yeah worth it we don't

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:30.940
really care about our shop like okay we

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:33.309
I think we should just pop two of Spades

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:34.870
even though it's a suboptimal time to do

00:18:33.309 --> 00:18:37.179
it because we have to consider the fact

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:38.799
that we also have verb and if we get a

00:18:37.179 --> 00:18:40.160
good pill we'd much rather have verb

00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:43.580
available to us then

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:46.250
have a few extra keys because burp is

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:48.740
like exquisite could double an HP

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:51.530
upgrade could give us you know four

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:54.890
spirit hearts instead of two from balls

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:56.990
of steel for example and we aren't gonna

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:58.970
speed up a little bit through this run

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:00.890
the main reason why is very simple we

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:06.110
have 29 damage on the third floor so we

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:08.780
actually can't really go slow and I mean

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:11.210
we're doing kind of putting yourself in

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.470
a bit of a scary spot here HP wise but I

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:14.840
mean piercing shots that do thirty

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:21.770
damage each come on who say a note of

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:25.900
this right now nobody you know it's a

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:30.770
good run if we can kill mega fatty

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:33.650
within like under 30 seconds so the

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:38.210
dangerous part of this run is hopefully

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:39.350
right now hopefully and that's we're

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:42.050
quite fast as well

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:44.450
hopefully we're able to you know like

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:47.300
this is like the last point on a run on

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:49.160
this run i should say that's that has

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.120
our HP called into question so we're

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:54.560
gonna blow that out because if these

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:56.660
peels are good so it almost is but let's

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.040
check this first i mean obviously we

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.690
don't want to vert that I don't think I

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.820
want to vert 48-hour energy right now

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:04.250
like I'm happy to generate a fly army

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:07.810
but we can get better than six to nine

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:07.810
flies out of a verb pill

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:20.380
I think like I'm basically waiting for

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:21.760
balls of steel hpf tears up probably and

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:26.320
I like speed up is not even good enough

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:28.270
I don't even want to do that yet

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:34.540
oh especially because I just took damage

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:36.910
right there so we could die I really

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:39.430
really don't want to I've already got

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:42.250
magic much so and I'm not really worried

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:46.750
about mini mush so I'm not gonna blow up

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:49.360
those mushrooms hanged man is fine to

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:51.460
enter the curse room but we still need a

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:53.140
way out well let me use the chariot card

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.540
well how am I gonna use the charity card

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:57.190
if I had to hold hang the man to get it

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:59.620
well actually there is a way in

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:02.530
hindsight that was a pretty stupid

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:04.210
comment for me to make there is there's

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:11.560
completely away give me a moment here

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:14.160
first secret room that's okay never do

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.160
what I did there

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:26.700
having a brain fart secret room much

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:29.410
easier to find it there blow this up

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:31.750
shop does not contain a spear at heart

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:38.560
which was really kind of what I was

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:42.220
hanging my hat on life does go on Halo

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:49.020
of flies also lovely we will check our

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:54.430
double key room because we can yikes

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:55.810
yeah not not too good think around one

00:21:54.430 --> 00:22:00.370
and a half spirit arts but it could be

00:21:55.810 --> 00:22:02.950
wrong so first it's very simple you pop

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:06.310
hanged man grab the chariot enter the

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:08.590
room and then after you can enter the

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:10.950
gungeon if you'd like we're definitely

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:13.990
not gonna try to walk on that goose it's

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:16.000
potentially extremely deleterious pop

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:17.830
the cherry in an escape so we were able

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.150
to do that for free which is great

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:20.890
because we got to see that that room

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:23.320
contained for troll bombs which i think

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:24.730
was a big boon for us in our nihilistic

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.140
philosophy believing that there's no

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:27.940
benevolent ruler looking out for us

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.110
because if anybody out there had our

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:30.340
best interests in mind he probably

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:32.230
wouldn't let that room contain

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:34.180
absolutely nothing of value in fact

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:36.220
beyond that containing exclusively

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:38.740
things that are overall deleterious to

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:39.450
our chances for success but what do I

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:48.590
know

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:50.299
now pop this down here nothing still

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:57.590
you won't hear me complain too much

00:22:50.299 --> 00:23:00.620
about a run that has 37 damage ever much

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:03.080
lace much lace much less on like the

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:05.480
third floor fourth floor so even though

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:08.900
we're still like really in tight here on

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:11.120
this run way ahead of schedule to curse

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:12.559
of the unknowns in a row kind of upsets

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:15.080
me cuz it's like at this point the game

00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:22.870
is actually just actively trying to

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:27.200
screw me up try this on for size amnesia

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:31.460
lock down lock up so we could get a

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:39.860
second lock up and actually I would like

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:44.710
to I just don't know if I can afford to

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:51.590
cuz I really really want this verb pill

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:54.640
so hook me up with HP your boy is not in

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:57.100
a wonderful position in that department

00:23:54.640 --> 00:24:01.190
probably but I don't know cuz the

00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:03.760
dangled double curse of the unknown as

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:08.510
much as I'm trying

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:10.130
virus would be lovely so by taking that

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:11.390
pill we unfortunately did sort of screw

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:13.640
ourselves out of being able to get the

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:15.080
other luck upgrade right away but again

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.690
we're kind of shooting for the moon here

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:21.380
it's it's very strange to feel like we

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:25.549
have to focus on a on a run that is 37

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:28.850
damage but I do I do believe it's the

00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:31.700
right call unfortunately so just stay

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:33.740
steady and we still have four bombs we

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.539
can use those to blow up blue fires

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:38.630
we're probably said we definitely need

00:24:35.539 --> 00:24:41.659
this key by the way I'm like all in for

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:42.559
boss rush like doing boss rush our rate

00:24:41.659 --> 00:24:45.169
of fire sucks

00:24:42.559 --> 00:24:47.149
it's like triple the average start or

00:24:45.169 --> 00:24:49.429
one third of the average rate of fire

00:24:47.149 --> 00:24:51.110
however our damage is almost 10 times

00:24:49.429 --> 00:24:53.840
the average rate of fire and unless we

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:56.239
get explosive oh our shots

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:57.409
go right through most enemies and if

00:24:56.239 --> 00:24:59.119
they don't go through the enemy because

00:24:57.409 --> 00:25:01.249
of X placebo or nose goblin they do a

00:24:59.119 --> 00:25:04.219
lot of damage over time like we were

00:25:01.249 --> 00:25:07.190
really we're getting paid at both ends

00:25:04.219 --> 00:25:11.179
here so that's a real expression for

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:13.489
sure getting paid at both ends it has to

00:25:11.179 --> 00:25:15.139
do with both back in the old railway

00:25:13.489 --> 00:25:18.259
industry you know you'd work a day you'd

00:25:15.139 --> 00:25:19.700
hop on the line you get off at another

00:25:18.259 --> 00:25:21.169
station you work there but usually you

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.399
only got paid at one end but if you got

00:25:21.169 --> 00:25:26.739
paid on two ends you know you were

00:25:22.399 --> 00:25:31.129
working for a good company these six

00:25:26.739 --> 00:25:33.919
actually also very tempting but you know

00:25:31.129 --> 00:25:36.399
having flies that do 70 4.8 damage each

00:25:33.919 --> 00:25:38.960
is also really tempting because it's

00:25:36.399 --> 00:25:40.909
incredible so I think we'll stick with

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:45.799
that but of course there's always the

00:25:40.909 --> 00:25:49.789
chance that we could use the d600 let's

00:25:45.799 --> 00:25:55.580
go then we could use the d6 to create

00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:58.089
items as we like a little bit more there

00:25:55.580 --> 00:26:05.839
is a mom's bottle of pills play in there

00:25:58.089 --> 00:26:07.609
no question oh dude starting to get

00:26:05.839 --> 00:26:09.529
something good here sure we could take

00:26:07.609 --> 00:26:13.729
blank card but we had it recently I mean

00:26:09.529 --> 00:26:15.529
last time got this grab this still a ton

00:26:13.729 --> 00:26:19.700
of money out not at I'm still a little

00:26:15.529 --> 00:26:22.059
money to donate a ton is probably not

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:22.059
the right word

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:28.370
we picked up enough spirit arts there to

00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:30.200
probably be in a good spot and look at

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:32.240
that we got a second what I assume is

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.940
the second health up indeed it is all

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:37.700
right so holding out for verb of course

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:40.549
it only paid out like well past the

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:42.350
point when we were scared but that's the

00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:44.120
way the cookie crumbles sometimes if you

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:47.990
get that third level cube of meat here

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:49.940
and it got the item no Guffey we got two

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:52.010
HP I'm not taking candy and I'll take

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:53.419
goat head though we need this extra HP

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:55.730
for future deals with the devil

00:26:53.419 --> 00:26:59.450
now we're golden we're in this look at

00:26:55.730 --> 00:27:02.960
that seven and a half HP seven and a

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:11.390
half HP it's the Teenage Mutant Ninja

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:17.059
Turtles theme song it's the world's most

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:22.940
stylish Windows theme dynamic

00:27:17.059 --> 00:27:29.600
backgrounds 3d font scheme scrolling

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:32.870
screen savers in the pack don't forget

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:35.890
about the sound effects painkiller we

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:35.890
run pack with pack

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:44.100
ultra dynamic windows the heem ultra

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:45.570
dine I'll take it okay cuz first off

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:50.850
that's punishment for that bit going

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:53.040
nowhere but also I mean again most

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:56.130
enemies are gonna die like pretty much

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:59.040
as soon as the shot touches them so I

00:27:56.130 --> 00:28:02.240
think we're beyond set in that

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:04.860
department oh don't mind if I do

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:09.180
we got golden bombs so I'm not sweating

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:11.160
the the ratio of fires to bombs at this

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.890
point we're also easily gonna make boss

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:16.520
rush this is one of the like objectively

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:18.960
strongest runs I've had in a long time

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:22.530
we did have one recently that was

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:28.410
amazing I do remember that but this is

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:31.620
also up there especially like oh we got

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:33.060
to take the negative especially when you

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.960
remember we got that goat head potential

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:36.570
of course we're gonna take copies

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:41.550
collars so now we're gonna get mobbed

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:48.480
avoid and I mean gotta take holy light

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:52.620
here but you are not wrong in suggesting

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:53.690
that it also probably would have been

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:56.370
sick

00:28:53.690 --> 00:29:01.980
apparently oh ma just takes 80 years to

00:28:56.370 --> 00:29:04.110
charge it also would have been sick to

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:08.730
get bloody lust we just don't have the

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:12.380
HP to really make it pop right now but

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:12.380
that's to like very good choices

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:22.040
I gotta be honest like I just look out

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:24.140
big plans for our damage here and buy

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:30.890
plans I mean I've got the hope that

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:32.690
we'll get more damage in the future even

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:34.820
though we're one shotting pretty much

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:38.360
every and every enemy you know if we're

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:39.380
fighting delirium actually you know what

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.770
that's what we should do on this run

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:46.870
forget the negative we got 40 damage

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:49.610
like force the hush into delirium play

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:50.480
we absolutely have the tools to make

00:29:49.610 --> 00:30:03.680
that happen right now

00:29:50.480 --> 00:30:09.230
I can't even see the run is so good I

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:11.740
have lost my vision it's only happened

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:11.740
to me once before

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:21.940
we're done already okay

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:23.440
holy water it's trash I mean you know

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:24.910
there's not too many holy water

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.200
apologists out there I think that are

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:26.680
like you're not giving that item a fair

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:32.710
shake

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:35.770
it's just not very good is it

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:37.720
offensively bad only when it shows up on

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:38.890
Angel roofs and you're like finally I've

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:42.340
gotten that angel room

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:42.970
what angelic pleasures await me oh it's

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.740
holy water

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:54.820
like that's that's where you get

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:59.520
offended not really gonna open golden

00:30:54.820 --> 00:31:02.140
chests we still need keys to make the

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:08.380
the hush fight as strong as it could

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:11.680
conceivably be looks like there's a

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:16.350
spirit heart back there keep in mind

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:21.520
like ma the void can create demon hearts

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:24.370
just most enemies tend to die from the

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:27.910
first shot as opposed to just you know

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:30.190
giving us any chance at all to pick up

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:31.450
something from their body like again I

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:33.490
don't really care about the curse room

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:37.420
either the best we could do conceivably

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:40.180
is getting like the mark or something

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:41.920
like that but I don't think it's worth

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:43.600
the guaranteed loss of one spirit hard

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:45.550
to just have a chance to get what is

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:50.830
gonna be a pretty meager damage upgrade

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:53.350
at this point fourth level Cuba meat not

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:54.790
a common pickup we definitely do not

00:31:53.350 --> 00:32:00.840
care about super guppy

00:31:54.790 --> 00:32:03.760
oh you got the items making

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:06.190
transformations there's a boom boom boom

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:09.730
boom boom boom baby's got that super

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:11.940
guppy mmm it's not night really gonna

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:11.940
work

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:22.500
and I was at a reference to Nicki

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:26.550
Minaj's 2011 Jam Super Bass yes it is

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:28.710
although I think it's 2010 kind of

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:31.770
embarrassed actually that you didn't

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:34.620
know that so we're done with this floor

00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:37.260
now we got to remember we have not done

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:39.360
hush we've not done delirium if we do

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:42.090
hush we will absolutely have the chance

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:44.100
to do delirium so I mean it's written in

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:47.430
the cards for us definitely not worth it

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:49.020
it's gonna go in here do this and then

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:50.070
actually we've got a great play on the

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:51.660
delirium floor because we have the

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:53.490
emperor card which basically is just a

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:55.140
glorified teleporter there but still

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:56.670
it's better than nothing maybe we can

00:32:55.140 --> 00:33:04.260
get a per throw because those items are

00:32:56.670 --> 00:33:04.920
garbage I'll try it we we we made it

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:08.250
work

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:12.930
so grab dice shard we roll these boys

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:15.330
take adrenaline the other question I

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:18.180
guess is do we care about fate because

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:20.160
we're already flying we have no reason

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:23.900
we don't get any value out of a red

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:28.160
heart I guess so let's just not do that

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:28.160
instead we'll donate as much as we can

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:32.130
this could be a good opportunity for us

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:34.890
to really make some headway on our

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:36.990
donation machine I'm gonna scripts it's

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:42.990
not a postage stretch it's an intra

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:45.630
Isaac stretch but the the difficult part

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:47.940
of the run is conceivably more or less

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:50.400
over we don't care about the chariot we

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:53.010
will care about mystery gifts but it's

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:54.330
sucked and we will also because we're

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:58.440
not doing anything else with our money

00:33:54.330 --> 00:34:01.400
might as well take the Bible and really

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:06.450
the game plan is not to use that to fly

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:10.820
but rather to use that never because we

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:10.820
have Guppies head whoops

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.330
I was like I can't believe we've gone

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:14.649
through this whole run without a

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:16.270
spacebar item that doesn't seem right

00:34:14.649 --> 00:34:19.089
and it's like wait a minute we just

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:20.409
bought the gifts did we use did we have

00:34:19.089 --> 00:34:21.730
something else before the gift and

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:25.919
perhaps that was giving us infinity

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:28.300
flies um the answer of course being yes

00:34:25.919 --> 00:34:30.460
however the Bible is like maybe it'll

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:32.080
create before not a huge get but again

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:34.149
what are we gonna do you can't take it

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:38.740
with you you die with 18 cents it's not

00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:40.359
like it rolls over I don't know maybe

00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:44.320
it's a good thing that Meat Boy has

00:34:40.359 --> 00:34:48.099
chosen to maintain a non-aggression pact

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:51.690
with the hush here I'm not sure how it

00:34:48.099 --> 00:34:51.690
relates to the super armor of the game

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:59.680
we're gonna be done with this fight in

00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:04.089
like no time flat I don't think we

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:06.730
necessarily have a very Pro Delirium

00:35:04.089 --> 00:35:09.190
bill I don't necessarily think we have

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:16.210
an ant's like a bad build for fighting

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:19.890
delirium the one sore spot as it stands

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:22.869
is I would still love to pick up like

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:25.119
some more rate of fire so our rate of

00:35:22.869 --> 00:35:30.160
fire the present moment is adequate

00:35:25.119 --> 00:35:32.920
considering our damage is 41 but it's

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:34.330
more than adequate however if we can get

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:36.099
like triple our rate of fire which I

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:37.300
know seems like a pipe dream if we could

00:35:36.099 --> 00:35:41.440
triple our rate of fire we'd be in

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:45.550
heaven so we got like the d12 not my

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:49.660
favorite no spirit arts all right we're

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:51.010
out just make sure you're going delirium

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:52.599
path again we don't need the money

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:56.710
we might get money equals power it's

00:35:52.599 --> 00:36:01.200
fairly unlikely kirsta the unknown is

00:35:56.710 --> 00:36:01.200
horrible here just just god-awful

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:12.230
but the hero font isn't we've gone into

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:16.270
the starting room for her for the lamb

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:20.480
fight so the only way I will use the

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:22.310
emperor card is if I get into the

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:25.010
Delirium fight and it seems like we're

00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:26.660
gonna lose I think right now like if we

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:29.810
get into the Delirium fight too early

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:32.570
we'll just fight it because I mean I run

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:33.740
is very strong if we get in there and

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:37.720
we're getting our butt kicked

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:37.720
I'll teleport out using the Emperor

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:45.320
until that moment comes though you don't

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:47.570
really need to worry which means

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:50.990
actually that if I could find it I would

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:52.400
love to replace the Emperor with a card

00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:53.690
that's maybe a little bit more valuable

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:56.510
right now like I don't know the strength

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:59.480
card would it actually give us double

00:36:56.510 --> 00:37:00.920
damage or damage multiplier considering

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:09.690
we already have magic much maybe yes

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:12.000
maybe no cage

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:15.000
well didn't even get a chance to attack

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:19.099
theirs bookworm what I thought we did we

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:25.020
pick up the sin book of sin the Bible

00:37:19.099 --> 00:37:27.510
how to jump I must be mistaken

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:29.130
other people you know I watch a little

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:31.530
more streams than I used to other people

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:34.849
you know something bad happens to them

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:37.980
in the game they go home must be a bug

00:37:34.849 --> 00:37:39.480
to thine own self be true right whenever

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:41.089
something bad happens to me in a game I

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:46.039
go what did I do

00:37:41.089 --> 00:37:49.349
I I must in somehow be responsible for

00:37:46.039 --> 00:37:51.869
this also I must somehow someway keep

00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:55.319
coming up with funky-ass like every

00:37:51.869 --> 00:37:57.690
single day may I kick a little something

00:37:55.319 --> 00:38:00.000
for the Gees and take a few steps as I

00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:01.530
breeze through 3:00 in the morning and

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.829
the party still jumping cuz my mama

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:07.230
ain't home I got people in my living

00:38:04.829 --> 00:38:11.160
room getting it on and they ain't leavin

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:13.400
till 6 and the 6 in the mone so what you

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:17.279
gonna do see I got a pocket full of

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:19.109
rubbers and my homeboys do too so turn

00:38:17.279 --> 00:38:22.970
off the lights and close the dole but

00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:26.270
for what we don't love them though so

00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:31.260
we're going to weigh an ounce to this

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:36.059
jeez up those down as my mom and friends

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:39.510
bounce to this look that just ate up

00:38:36.059 --> 00:38:44.480
like a full minute of dead air Greed's

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:48.839
gullet showed up and I'm I'm not tempted

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:52.289
because I think that it's actually bad

00:38:48.839 --> 00:38:54.180
for us right now however I'm going to

00:38:52.289 --> 00:38:56.279
pick it up after we killed the lyrium

00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:58.190
assuming weed that we can I think we can

00:38:56.279 --> 00:39:00.809
leave after we fight delirium right and

00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:02.490
because I want to knock it off the to-do

00:39:00.809 --> 00:39:05.510
list it's not necessarily an item that

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:05.510
shows up very frequently

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:10.570
so especially I think it's in the secret

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:12.970
room pool so it might also be in the

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:15.040
item room pool but just one of those

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:17.320
things where you know having having gone

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:19.930
through this before if you see a rare

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:21.910
item even if it doesn't help you even if

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:28.420
it actively hurts you sometimes it can

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:31.060
be for the best to pick it up we're like

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:34.050
this is among the fastest runs I've ever

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:34.050
had against delirium

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:46.720
what's going on he's dead he's dead let

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:48.310
me out so usually for I think for

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:52.560
killing delirium do you get items or you

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:52.560
just get the trinkets I can't remember

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:59.170
dude how far did we run after getting

00:39:57.310 --> 00:40:05.710
greens gullet I thought it was like five

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:07.000
rooms I guess we didn't have permanent

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:08.620
pulled or invincibility so there was not

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.880
much to worry about but I just I always

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:11.950
feel like with curse of the unknown you

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:14.230
want to be a little bit just a little

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:20.020
bit more concerned about the way your HP

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:21.510
looks versus the norm anyway we're out

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:24.480
that was a fun one

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:26.140
we have unlocked Silver Dollar

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:27.100
