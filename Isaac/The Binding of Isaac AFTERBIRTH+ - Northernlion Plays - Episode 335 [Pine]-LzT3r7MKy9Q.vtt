00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.909
hey everybody welcome back and run the

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.790
Lyon place abiding rising after birth

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.770
plus where we cannot lose for the life

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.730
of us we're going for the baker's dozen

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.910
I know that a baker's dozen wh d HW 8 9

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.980
p wow really good stats your 4.5 damage

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.240
basically right off the bed decent speed

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.380
better than average rate of fire and

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.710
Jacob's Ladder +3 HP this is like

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:29.250
actually an 8 plus as far as starts go

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.349
you know it's no hold on hold on hold on

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.290
I don't care Twitter why you got to put

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.010
this forza east bored stuff in the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.300
background i do not desire to have that

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.610
running in the background well then

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.250
closed twitter look why don't why don't

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.710
you close your aorta so blood can't

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.329
reach the rest of your body why don't

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.160
you close your trachea so you can't

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.539
oxygenate the blood that can't reach the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.020
rest of your body that's what twitter

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.879
means to me okay just close it why don't

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.770
you why do you crush my beating heart

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.480
with your bare hand I don't know where

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.160
I'm going with this one okay

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.400
the point is this is an amazing start

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.780
here right off the bat and I was talking

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.280
about a baker's dozen I don't buy I

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.170
don't buy into the idea that a baker's

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.430
dozen is 13 it's not fair why should

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.030
they get a different dozen than the rest

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.430
of us I think we probably do want to

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.520
book a Belial over the gamekid pretty

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.439
close to getting bookworm already but

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.280
they've been they've been running this

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:29.670
13 as a baker's dozen facade charade and

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.530
farce for too long as far as I'm

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.750
concerned for the next six years a

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.060
baker's dozen is 11 and then if you

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.799
prove you can handle a diminished dozen

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.159
then you get to go back to 12 with the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:45.930
rest of us and maybe maybe on your

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.759
birthday 13 what a bizarre crusade

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.680
anyway we're going to take the pill we

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.409
can afford it we can afford for it to be

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.840
bad and actually getting a duplicated

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.930
vert pill it might seem like it gains us

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.820
nothing and on a large scale level it

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.079
does but we now have knowledge of what

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.020
the vert pill is and now we can

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.850
duplicate whatever pill we want if we if

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.340
were able to find one at least this run

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.160
is like well it's taking its toll on me

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.590
it said goodbye too many times before

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.700
and we have basically

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.680
almost no cynicism right now we have a

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.930
good Zane item Jacob's Ladder which is

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.000
also just good to begin with we've got a

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.470
good space bar item we've got a chance

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.090
of the bookworm transformation we got

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.700
enough HP to not be worried about our

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.900
survival at all and then beyond that we

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.330
do have a deal with the devil coming up

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.860
on this floor as well and I'm assuming

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.660
that vert pill is going to lead to like

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.000
some kind of statistical benefit at some

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.380
point like if we get it Sears upgrade or

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.170
a speed upgrade all of a sudden it's

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.959
basically two tiers or to speed upgrades

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.310
at least if they come in in pill form

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.250
but what doesn't in this day and age am

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.209
i right I have no idea but there's a

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.760
reason I'm not working at

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.350
GlaxoSmithKline and it's not you know

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.320
personal code of morals and ethics that

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.850
they ain't hiring anybody with the

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:09.600
bachelor's degree by liberal bachelors

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.240
with honors in biology to do anything

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.680
but you know clean the microscopes after

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:19.170
the big boys are actually done doing

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.459
their research regardless it's not like

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.190
I'm bitter we took chocolate milk I

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.680
think chocolate milk is anti synergistic

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.200
with Jacob's Ladder to some extent I

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.670
don't know if the electricity does more

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.900
damage if it hits with like a fully

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:37.050
stocked chocolate milk shot versus a not

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.000
fully stocked one but I do know like I

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.180
think at least the more tears we put on

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.769
the ground the more electricity we're

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.880
going to get which is probably what we

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.680
should be looking for if we're trying to

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.200
make a Jacob's Ladder pop but I think

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.000
it's like negatively synergistic for now

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.530
but the idea is that in the future it

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.860
could conceivably pop off exquisitely

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.540
but I mean we are at 3 minutes and 20

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.750
seconds we're about to beat the second

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.610
boss not only if we not taken damage

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:11.580
there's almost no way for us to take

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:13.560
damage at least right now we'd require

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.850
like experimental treatment this is the

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.340
one thing that would get me right now

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.220
experimental treatment really bad role

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.370
that's almost all staffs downgrades then

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:27.090
I might be persuaded ooh we could also

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.450
completely squander this right here and

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.490
put our

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:38.460
dangerous spot all the - this is

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:40.410
actually incredible should have gotten

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.770
to plays out of that should also pick up

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.360
a contract from below but this is the

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.340
fact that we got power pill out of this

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.820
is kind of hilarious that's so good for

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.610
us let's see what we get here I am going

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.880
to take a look as much as possible this

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.010
has already been of cause this has

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.270
already been a pretty great deal with

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:04.230
the devil for one that doesn't actually

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:10.170
allow us to get anything nothing

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:12.720
that's a surprise to me we could create

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:17.520
another power pill with verb and I think

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:22.830
that would be advisable now we cannot at

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:27.180
least not easily okay we basically have

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.590
to go at this point and that verb will

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.060
give us another range upgrade which is

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:34.160
effectively worthless but we might as

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.840
well look for a red heart quickly I am

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.480
genuinely worried about our survival now

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.940
because I've done this to myself but at

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.890
the same time I'm not that worried as

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.600
long as we can get you know more HP

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:49.190
which we just did we might not be able

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.390
to get back to the deal with the devil I

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.800
don't think I care about the card keep

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.870
the verb pill and just use it for

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.160
something better later as of right now

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.630
it doesn't do anything for us we're

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.210
going to spend some time here because we

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.560
probably do want to go back to the to

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.610
the curse room as well and see what we

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.380
can get in there oh man okay so now

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.150
getting like something actually improves

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.220
our stats would be really nice we've

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.140
gotten some utility items and the virus

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:18.840
has good future potential that's two

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:19.950
verbs it's not worth anything man dude

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.140
power pills

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:26.400
power bill with two verbs means this guy

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:29.490
is paying out with something okay we got

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:32.370
experimental treatment damage downgrade

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.620
but stats up in like almost every other

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.970
conceivable direction I'm just going to

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.380
keep verb and we're going to head down

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.640
to the next floor I don't think I can

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.020
afford to go to the cursed room anymore

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.770
but we're one away from the sponge

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.810
transform a

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:49.259
and we made that deal with the devil

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:53.190
work for us very afraid actually of this

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:55.590
situation right there getting hit twice

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:58.110
I think guaranteed would have killed us

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:04.380
so you can understand my concerns

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:08.400
probably at this point it's really all

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:10.770
about getting an HP upgrade if we could

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.060
stack up like six spirit arts like the

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.990
other thing that would work well and we

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.479
have a good chance of is because we've

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.280
got nice like finite we've got a good

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:19.800
balance sheet or an income statement if

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.449
you will because we're getting a lot of

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.550
money like at least a penny per room

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:26.340
basically that is just coming from head

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:27.930
of the keepers so essentially we get a

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:32.789
reroll machine in our shop we should be

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:38.490
able to buy a few spirit hearts there's

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:42.240
one and then there's two we shouldn't be

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:44.550
able to buy anymore because the green

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.630
machine didn't pay out the greed statute

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.699
didn't pay out I should say but

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:49.320
otherwise it was the most Canadian out

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:52.289
I've said in quite some time but anyway

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:53.570
we're good work there any other I'm

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:55.020
trying to think of other English

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:57.449
colloquialisms that make no sense

00:07:55.020 --> 00:08:00.060
baker's dozen nobody uses baker's dozen

00:07:57.449 --> 00:08:03.030
anymore I kind of got roasted likes

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:04.199
Invicta and I did this this video well

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.580
isn't really something to do the video

00:08:04.199 --> 00:08:08.310
and I just showed up it's called how

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:11.340
Canadian are you where you wanted me to

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:12.840
take 10 Canadian isms and ask him about

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:15.930
them and then we'll see how many you can

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:19.139
identify either from for knowledge or oh

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:21.719
my god we dodged it either from you know

00:08:19.139 --> 00:08:25.560
for knowledge or just deriving the

00:08:21.719 --> 00:08:27.419
meaning of it dynamically and lockdowns

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:30.630
not that terrible to be honest with you

00:08:27.419 --> 00:08:31.110
and most of them people are like yeah I

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.789
get it

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.380
you know in Canada we do use the term

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:37.409
gongshow from time to time it's more of

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:39.479
like a hockey thing you're gonna be

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:41.130
lucky it's lacrosse you know it's all

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:43.229
the same you just don't realize it yet

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:44.430
I'm not saying hockey and lacrosse are

00:08:43.229 --> 00:08:47.670
the same sport I'm saying it's the same

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:49.740
culture while in the hockey we use

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:51.630
sticks and in La Crosse we use sticks

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.870
they have a little net on the end of

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:53.790
them

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:56.220
I'm not anti lacrosse I don't know where

00:08:53.790 --> 00:09:00.240
narratives come anyway oh dude

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:02.910
transcendence absolutely Joker card we

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:06.020
will obviously get stacked here and we

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:08.850
should fight the angel statue this is a

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:12.600
unexpected angel run without a doubt but

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:13.740
anyway people were like yeah okay I know

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.970
what a Keener is I know what a

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.380
double-double is these are Canadian

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.810
servers you can watch them victus video

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.730
you know if you want to get more of a

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:23.310
feel for what those actually mean in

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:25.250
Canada but then I said you know what's a

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.530
Chesterfield and some people were like

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:30.990
Chesterfields not really a used term in

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:34.560
Canada anymore well you know I guess I'm

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:37.560
the I'm the the Link to the Past Legend

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.360
of Zelda style here when I grew up we

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.730
called it a Chesterfield when I got

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:44.130
older well I I don't think I've ever

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:48.330
heard a Canadian used the term sofa I

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:50.370
use the term sofa because it's you know

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:52.560
I like to Americanize it because

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:55.470
otherwise sometimes when you say

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:57.360
something that doesn't fit something

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:59.070
that they've heard for their entire

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.580
lives they get up in your face you know

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:05.460
they go you know sounds funny buddy

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:07.980
where are you from you spelled color

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:10.170
with a u in that place you know so I try

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:12.960
to be like I hide in plain sight you

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:14.610
know I remove the use from the words

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.650
even though me and my other Commonwealth

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:18.540
bros know color and neighbor both ever

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:21.980
you in them it's just you know so

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:23.820
shallow be written so shall be done but

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.710
yeah I don't think I've ever heard a

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:30.390
Canadian use the term sofa the same

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:33.000
thing we in parts of Canada we say soda

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:34.590
but I definitely grew up saying pop but

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.800
I will admit that just on a logical

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:39.780
level I think the pop is a worse name

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.550
I'd prefer a name that is descriptive

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.790
over a name that sounds like what the

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:46.260
can does when you open it but anyway I

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.700
call it a couch now most of the time I

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.570
hate take a seat on the couch I don't

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:52.740
know why that came across so weird but

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:55.200
thanks a lot Internet anyway the point

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:58.530
is Chesterfield is what we grew up

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.780
calling it I've also heard the term

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:03.570
Davenport somebody in the comments was

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:05.220
like you know if my grandmother calls it

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.960
a Davenport that was definitely like an

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.660
old-world

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.670
oldest word not an old world you'd be

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.980
like you know grandma's not of Davenport

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.390
as a Chesterfield they use it in a

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.020
sentence I'll just go with the finger

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:19.220
here man

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:20.779
why not the runs go on fine let's take

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.750
some it's going better than fine let's

00:11:20.779 --> 00:11:25.250
take some weirdo items and pop off here

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:28.490
so we're gonna throw a bomb down here

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:30.260
and this bomb granted us hive mind we're

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:31.820
unlikely to become guppy but I'm going

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:37.130
to take hive mind regardless just in

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:38.779
case we do this is a I mean it's nice

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:40.550
it's nice to have a run like this

00:11:38.779 --> 00:11:45.260
because it's basically my favorite type

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:49.580
of run it's not traditionally strong but

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:53.270
it's very strong in its own unique way

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:56.000
like we have pretty poor stats you can't

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:57.320
really uh we can't use verb for tears up

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.089
until we break the tears cap

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.820
unfortunately you can't really be like

00:11:59.089 --> 00:12:03.860
oh we need to bond before we go through

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:05.450
here in case we get the other angel

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.680
statue but you can't really look at it

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:09.020
run with chocolate milk and then go oh

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:11.600
my tears dad is 12 that's pretty bad but

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:15.290
admittedly 12 rate of fire plus 3.5

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:17.570
damage is not very good on Adam just raw

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:19.010
attribute level but again your tier stat

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:21.740
becomes completely nullified by the

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:23.779
existence of of chocolate milk on this

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:27.740
run so it's actually pretty solid we're

00:12:23.779 --> 00:12:29.810
at the fierce cap actually we know that

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:31.010
we need to play this to get a bomb I'll

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:32.240
spend money we've already bought

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:33.709
something on this floor I mean maybe we

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.660
could just buy a bomb in the shop but

00:12:33.709 --> 00:12:39.770
where's the fun announce roll the dice

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:42.440
student well okay let's not roll the

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:44.690
dice let's go buy a bomb instead but we

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:50.120
through the strength of Jacob's Ladder

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:51.980
and finger and common cold you know

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:56.320
we've been shackled milk of course we've

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:58.820
created nice a run that is actually

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:02.570
incredibly strong it's not just like

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:04.970
above-average it's very very good so I'm

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:06.380
a happy camper right now of course you

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:09.680
know the guppy dream is something that's

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:13.130
it exists in my mind's eye right now and

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:15.079
with contract from below right you

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:17.750
should pop that with contract from below

00:13:15.079 --> 00:13:19.130
I'm definitely hoping that we're in

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:19.400
contract from below plus left hand

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.780
really

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:24.110
I'm hoping we can make this guppy dream

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:25.670
come to fruition since oil gives us fun

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:29.450
so now our damage is no longer a concern

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:31.040
and another vert pill honestly we should

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:32.660
stick with angel precedent because we

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.310
have no ole angel chance at least

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:36.020
because none of those items offer us

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:37.850
enough we don't need the baby it's going

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:42.410
to add you know like 2% to our overall

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:44.330
ability to kill things right now and we

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:47.180
certainly don't need Lord of the pit

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:48.680
we've already got the passive ability to

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:50.960
fly by a transcendence we've gotten

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.520
great payouts for having not had to pay

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:55.580
for a deal with the devil items so far

00:13:52.520 --> 00:14:00.590
that's really like the the best part of

00:13:55.580 --> 00:14:01.880
this run right now it's the three demon

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:07.850
judgments in that first deal with the

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:09.740
devil did so much for us of course you

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:11.570
know that room is like if you can do it

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:16.010
do it it's a no-brainer

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:18.290
if you can do it do it get it prequel

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:20.390
means free are we selling prequel memes

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:22.040
yet and the meme economy is turned on

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:23.510
them they were they were huge for alive

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:30.620
as a blue chip stock it's like buying

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:33.170
Amazon I don't know maybe there might

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:35.560
still be around wait maybe maybe sell

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:39.170
half of your position and then hold the

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:40.640
remainder until the release of episode 8

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:43.400
and then we'll see how things look at

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:46.210
that point and they might have a

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:48.590
resurgence you know you can afford to be

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:50.030
you can afford to be conservative in a

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:52.010
Meem economy like this if you're coming

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:54.710
from a power position of holding a blue

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:59.620
chip asset I don't know anything about

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:59.620
Star Wars or stocks for the most part

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:05.050
only in the Star Wars fandom because you

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:08.770
have seen almost every piece of you know

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:11.600
media about about Star Wars except for

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:15.820
any of the books and be like I don't

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.820
know anything about this but it's true I

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:21.980
like Star Wars I've held this position

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.540
on the show many times as well and and

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:26.000
that inevitably is going to offend some

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:29.120
people but Star Wars is one of those

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.330
things where I like it but I really

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.880
think that good god how did Star Wars

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:36.240
fandom

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:38.310
survive the prequels it's really like a

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:41.940
new hope put yourself back in the shoes

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:45.140
of being alive in like while being a

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:49.170
Star Wars fan at least in like the year

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:51.390
2005 a new hope was great you know

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:54.330
kick-started as a sci-fi revolution

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:55.920
Empire Strikes Back most people believe

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:57.900
that it's even better and I would agree

00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:00.270
with that you know it's a mature and

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:02.310
excellent movie Return of the Jedi yeah

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:05.010
it's alright but they usually he walks

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:08.580
is just there to sell toys and then no

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:09.660
movies for like 17 18 years something

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.640
like that

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.150
and then the first one that comes out is

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.350
garbage

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:15.180
and then the second one that comes out

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:16.620
is possibly I mean I don't think it's

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:19.260
even worse but it's close to being on

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:22.800
the same level I know people go what the

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:24.510
podracing I I watched it in 2015 for the

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:29.040
first time since I was like 12 years old

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:31.680
that is bad it's not the pod raising is

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:33.510
the best part of a bad movie but even

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.120
the pod racing is still terrible in my

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:39.000
opinion but anyway again let's not it

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:40.740
make too many enemies here and then you

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.320
know Revenge of the Sith I I still think

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:45.690
that movies mildly underrated I think

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:47.850
there's a lot of the silly stuff that

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:49.770
happens in that movie no doubt the no

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:52.560
from Darth Vader is hilarious I have no

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:54.870
idea how it got passed quality control

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:57.510
on which I guess would be editing and

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:59.250
this were like literally anybody in the

00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:03.390
room go and please don't put that in the

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:04.770
movie but anyway but I think like for

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:06.540
the most part that movie is at least

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:08.910
entertaining even if it does seem like

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:13.370
spoilers Anakin flips to the dark side

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:15.510
in like 15 seconds you know anyway

00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:18.540
that's where you're at after the

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:21.390
prequels how it is a testament to the

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:23.430
quality of the first two and to some

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:26.069
extent Return of the Jedi and maybe the

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:27.839
Timothy Zahn novels as well that Star

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:30.030
Wars fandom managed to survive that

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:33.090
because it's like the at that point in

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:37.230
time it was like the franchise that had

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:39.930
the least average quality of media plus

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:41.310
the highest level of like diehard fandom

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:43.200
and that's actually you might think I'm

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:45.890
punching down here I actually think

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.890
that's super cool

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:50.540
I'm trying to think of like anything

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:52.130
that has a similar you know what there

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.180
is there is one thing and I'm not trying

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:54.260
to punch down here as well because

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:56.240
Wonder Woman just came out and

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:58.550
apparently it's fantastic but that's

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.350
sort of how I felt about the DC films

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:01.970
for a while although I understand and

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:03.680
respect that a lot of people love them

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:05.300
and a lot of people like violently

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.620
defend them which is also finding the

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.300
you I understand you think there's like

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:10.670
a narrative against them founded like

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:15.410
the critics have it out for DC anyway

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:17.960
the point is I hate sauerkraut now the

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:20.870
point is like I'm glad that that

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:22.310
franchise is doing good things now not

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:24.290
just cool things for good things I

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:26.630
thought finally saw Star Wars Episode

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:28.640
seven like nine months after it came out

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:30.020
and I was like you know what we don't

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.370
want to smell the left hand so let's

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:35.330
bomb through here I was like you know

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:38.770
what it is it's a rehash but I'm okay

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:41.210
with that because they needed like

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:43.940
they're I'm trying to think of how to

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:46.730
phrase it I think they needed like a

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:49.880
single rather than swinging for the

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:51.530
fences and trying to get a maybe we

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.870
should take a moon for now trying to get

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:56.690
like a Grand Slam the baseball analogy

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:59.690
probably does not hold but they took a

00:18:56.690 --> 00:19:01.400
safe shot and created a very likeable

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:03.770
film that didn't take any risks and now

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:06.230
you know it made a trillion dollars

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:08.870
which is fine hopefully in the next one

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:10.970
you know they they take some more

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:12.290
artistic and cinematic risks and take

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:15.290
the franchise in an interesting place

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:19.190
it's not just like oh you know another

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:21.170
Death Star that I think people would

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:22.430
start to lose faith in the franchise a

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.720
little bit if they went back there but

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.920
and that's probably obvious anyway

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.570
they're smart people working on this

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:28.820
film smarter than me

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:32.510
and I saw rows one and I was like rogue

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:34.130
one was really fun I think that there's

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:36.890
there's a case to be made the rogue one

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:42.650
is like maybe the third best Star Wars

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:45.380
movie I did probably don't need to tell

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:46.880
you what the top two are get the heck

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:51.320
out of here so we I mean we've been a

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:55.010
holding verb for infinity years it will

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:56.570
just never ever not be here I mean I

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:57.010
know it's on the floor right now it's

00:19:56.570 --> 00:20:01.030
the

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:03.340
value we can fight mega Satan on this

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:05.920
run that's up to us right now I don't

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:06.910
see a good reason why we wouldn't we

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.620
should have played the blood bank a

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:12.060
little bit before we sacrificed our HP

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:12.060
but that also does not matter

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:18.670
there's no blood bank on the site there

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:23.080
is a blood bank we could play the

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:25.420
judgment it's not a bad idea but I took

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.250
the guffy item even though it cost us a

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:29.290
bunch of HP for two reasons one of which

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:31.960
gives us nine lives which compensates

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:34.690
almost always for the lack of HP or the

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:37.140
loss of HP and then beyond that we got a

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:42.180
decent chance to become guppy with the

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:47.880
contract from below combined with the

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:50.380
left hand but the run is actually

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:52.050
besides the point at this point it's

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:54.160
Baker's besides the point

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:56.470
thanks for the battery charges like

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:59.770
sackboy contract from below is getting a

00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:01.870
little ridiculous in a good way but I do

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:04.390
I do hit like sack boy fatigue from time

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:06.580
to time where you know eventually your

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:08.320
run is just won and then it's dropping

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:09.670
sacks which drop batteries which give

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.170
you a chance to give sacks sometimes

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:14.200
depending on your space bar item ages

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:15.610
it's a little silly I did just realize

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.080
as well we took chaos earlier which is

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:18.850
probably why our deal with the devil

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:20.770
sort of or deal with the Angel sort of

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:23.500
stunk but it also allowed us to get

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:25.450
Trinity shield sort of randomly out of a

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:28.200
redshift so our guppy chances I don't

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:30.370
know if they're better or worse now

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.720
probably worse because of the amount of

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:34.720
chance we're going to get thanks to the

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:39.250
left hand but 9lives again is good like

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:41.530
in a vacuum as well so I ain't mad much

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:44.370
it's another verb pill and a luck

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:49.930
downgrade probably a pill I'm not

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:52.690
interested in duplicating what we will

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:56.080
do is make our way to the presume 'add

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:58.210
item room here okay what we will do is

00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:00.040
walk all the way backwards to the

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:02.520
presumed item room back there and

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.520
that'll be good

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:08.170
rest assured like if you've been a

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:10.420
die-hard fan of Star Wars for a long

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:14.470
time that that tangent was not meant as

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:17.020
a shot on you to begin with for one for

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:19.420
the most part I think the fandom is like

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:21.490
a good thing you know you get invested

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:25.630
in things and part of a community even

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:27.910
if like you're bonding over like an NL

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:31.140
doesn't respect Star Wars that's fine by

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:33.700
me dude creates another human connection

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:35.680
gets us through this mortal coil I'm

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:37.690
okay with being that galvanizing agent

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.190
in this situation you want to want

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:41.170
something more to hate me about I think

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:43.000
Revenge of the Sith is a little bit

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:45.690
better than Return of the Jedi I know oh

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.870
but the Leia and the gold bikini and

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:51.550
Millie I know okay I don't like Return

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:56.320
of the Jedi as much as almost anybody

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:59.800
else on planet earth I think the forest

00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:02.020
bike or the I forget what it's called

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:06.070
which is undermining my limited nerd

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:08.530
cred but it's the Ewoks man I know it's

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:10.480
like a little too much of a circle jerk

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:11.890
at this point and they're not as bad as

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.180
Jar Jar Binks which is its own circle

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:15.100
jerk as well though if you go back and

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:17.020
watch those movies watch episode 1 that

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:18.550
one's not that much of a circle jerk Jar

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:22.840
Jar Binks is actually just super weird

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:24.970
but anyway Revenge of the Sith has way

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:27.430
more like individual cringe-worthy

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:29.950
moments stakes suicide King we can get

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:33.760
something out of this on the chest but I

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:37.060
think overall the movie is like not ten

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:39.430
times better but like maybe like 0.2 out

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:43.780
of 10 better than Return of the Jedi but

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:46.180
anyway any time I say that people go you

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:48.880
are out of your mind and I understand I

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:50.290
respect that I'm against consensus on

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:52.300
this and it's not from a hipster

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:53.580
standpoint it's my genuine honest

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:57.970
opinion but that doesn't mean that it's

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:59.590
right if it could something is twisted

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:01.480
up in the old noggin that that leads to

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:03.030
that opinion perhaps okay okay okay we

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:07.360
got a look at this

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:09.100
so the problem here is that like mom's

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:11.920
knife is too easy and it ruins jacob's

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:18.040
ladder' potato peeler is weird I mean

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:19.900
it's okay we could use that with we

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:21.400
could use it with our HP plus nine lives

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:23.740
to get a bunch of meat boys but I

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:26.590
actually think like blue baby's only

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:28.660
friend is the right choice they're as

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:31.450
weird as that might seem and I don't

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:34.150
think it really does anything for us but

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:36.550
for having for chaos items on the angel

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:40.840
room we sorta you know struck out as far

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:42.820
as quality is concerned there I think of

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:45.010
course I mean the one item is so good I

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:46.450
feel I can't take it so not necessarily

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:57.790
fair the moms knife pickup would have

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:59.050
been very good don't want to spend too

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:05.050
much more time on this room if I can

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:06.280
avoid it we'll take the keys we have we

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:08.770
know we don't have Guppies tail

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:10.900
so we're I'm hoping for a deal with the

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:13.360
devil but I'm running it through my like

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:15.580
brain analysis right now I'm like that

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:22.179
can't happen because we we don't have

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:23.860
duality really thought I could squeeze

00:25:22.179 --> 00:25:28.000
myself in the corner there we don't have

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:29.920
duality which means that we are

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.130
guaranteed to deal with the angel if we

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:35.080
get a deal you remember there was a time

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:38.200
mr. Fred actually showed up like on

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:41.850
every single boss but it seemed like or

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:44.920
every single womb run it seemed like

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:46.780
those were the days man now mr. Fred is

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:48.820
like a special boss like I think we see

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:50.980
brimstone more often than mr. Fred I

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:52.240
figured we might as well fight the angel

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:55.809
statue just to see if we get anything

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:57.460
but obviously we didn't and it's still

00:25:55.809 --> 00:26:00.490
completely fine again like this run at

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:02.380
this point it's basically maintained its

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:03.910
quality throughout it's still great it

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:08.429
started great it's still great that's

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:08.429
bookworm it's like extremely bookworm

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:13.769
and Book of Shadows we got a case for

00:26:10.409 --> 00:26:15.929
but I don't know where the it's kind of

00:26:13.769 --> 00:26:19.340
a weird situation like I do

00:26:15.929 --> 00:26:23.220
don't take a look down you're weirdo I

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:24.899
get roasted sometimes and a lot of it is

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:27.509
on runs like this and I'm not trying to

00:26:24.899 --> 00:26:31.649
set up you know like a false narrative

00:26:27.509 --> 00:26:33.749
of like oh like the haters the haters

00:26:31.649 --> 00:26:36.090
don't want me to succeed I get tweets

00:26:33.749 --> 00:26:38.249
sometimes people go you know and L don't

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:40.049
let the haters get you down and I just

00:26:38.249 --> 00:26:42.029
I'm very thankful for the tweets but I

00:26:40.049 --> 00:26:46.590
also look around and I go I got it like

00:26:42.029 --> 00:26:49.409
a real limited percentage of people that

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:51.269
watch my content just to just to make

00:26:49.409 --> 00:26:53.580
fun of me I think you know I've

00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:56.399
cultivated what is mostly a genuine

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:58.850
personality and playing games I like and

00:26:56.399 --> 00:27:01.350
not kicking up needless drama and I got

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:02.909
I've developed a fanbase of people that

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:05.850
enjoy that kind of content which is

00:27:02.909 --> 00:27:07.289
which is cool so honestly like when I

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:08.940
see those those tweets that are like

00:27:07.289 --> 00:27:09.779
don't let the haters get you down I go

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:12.389
oh no what did I do

00:27:09.779 --> 00:27:14.220
why do why do I have a higher percentage

00:27:12.389 --> 00:27:16.590
of haters all of a sudden but know that

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:18.869
sometimes I get criticized which is

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:22.169
different and it's hard to remember that

00:27:18.869 --> 00:27:23.610
sometimes but it is sometimes I get

00:27:22.169 --> 00:27:25.919
criticized they say oh you're not using

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:28.070
book of Belial that much like you might

00:27:25.919 --> 00:27:32.519
as well use it once every three rooms at

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:34.710
some point we've reached a level of like

00:27:32.519 --> 00:27:36.629
who cares miss I think on this run who

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:38.669
cares miss averaging like yeah we should

00:27:36.629 --> 00:27:40.649
be using a book of Belial you're not

00:27:38.669 --> 00:27:41.639
wrong once every three rooms but we're

00:27:40.649 --> 00:27:44.249
going to win either way

00:27:41.639 --> 00:27:47.369
and it's not like it's a more impressive

00:27:44.249 --> 00:27:52.950
win if we use book of Belial I think I

00:27:47.369 --> 00:27:54.690
might be mistaken Satanic bottles a

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:56.639
little different cuz it actually does it

00:27:54.690 --> 00:28:02.210
gives you like a demonstrable repeatable

00:27:56.639 --> 00:28:06.029
benefit sad bombs are so good here um I

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:08.610
mean we should probably fight hush we

00:28:06.029 --> 00:28:11.460
got a pretty strong hush fight here but

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:12.919
yeah you know at some point it's like if

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:15.809
we get for the man who has everything

00:28:12.919 --> 00:28:17.909
you know you're talking to on a run like

00:28:15.809 --> 00:28:19.859
this we're like the societal equivalent

00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:22.509
of like an NFL player and you're like

00:28:19.859 --> 00:28:23.949
hey you know why are you buying the

00:28:22.509 --> 00:28:25.449
why you get an extra meat on your subway

00:28:23.949 --> 00:28:27.579
sandwich you could just get a another

00:28:25.449 --> 00:28:29.829
six-inch for the price of the extra meat

00:28:27.579 --> 00:28:31.509
on a premium sub like this here's a

00:28:29.829 --> 00:28:34.089
little life hack for you you know

00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:35.079
LaDainian Tomlinson blue stick was

00:28:34.089 --> 00:28:38.229
suicide King for now

00:28:35.079 --> 00:28:40.329
lady dudes making well I mean LaDainian

00:28:38.229 --> 00:28:43.629
Tomlinson is probably out of the NFL by

00:28:40.329 --> 00:28:45.129
now and I'm dating myself but yeah

00:28:43.629 --> 00:28:47.139
obviously we'll take that the dudes

00:28:45.129 --> 00:28:50.589
making you know 35 million dollars a

00:28:47.139 --> 00:28:52.359
year something like that he can afford

00:28:50.589 --> 00:28:54.789
the extra meat that's kind of how I feel

00:28:52.359 --> 00:28:56.499
about this Isaac run right now is it's

00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:58.599
not good to espouse the attitude that

00:28:56.499 --> 00:29:00.639
you know we can afford to make mistakes

00:28:58.599 --> 00:29:03.039
but I mean we can afford to make minor

00:29:00.639 --> 00:29:07.989
mistakes it's part of part of the luxury

00:29:03.039 --> 00:29:10.539
you know luxury is just living your life

00:29:07.989 --> 00:29:12.219
in efficiently without it being able to

00:29:10.539 --> 00:29:15.069
you know come back and bite you in the

00:29:12.219 --> 00:29:16.799
butt so we have a luxurious position on

00:29:15.069 --> 00:29:22.479
this run oh there's any doubt about that

00:29:16.799 --> 00:29:24.969
please a devil card would help a lot the

00:29:22.479 --> 00:29:26.739
fool card would be just horrible for us

00:29:24.969 --> 00:29:31.619
bookable i'll unfortunately does not

00:29:26.739 --> 00:29:33.639
stack so probably spending a lot of time

00:29:31.619 --> 00:29:35.499
mashing on this button you'll get it

00:29:33.639 --> 00:29:37.809
really used to the sound of my keyboard

00:29:35.499 --> 00:29:45.190
click click that's the sound of the

00:29:37.809 --> 00:29:50.199
keyboard and that's it I've exhausted

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:51.909
all topics for conversation what could

00:29:50.199 --> 00:29:58.149
be talked about now I was driving around

00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:59.859
in Vancouver today cloudy day GPS every

00:29:58.149 --> 00:30:02.079
like 15 seconds was changing its

00:29:59.859 --> 00:30:03.519
directions I'm aware of the fact that we

00:30:02.079 --> 00:30:05.709
live in the future I talk about this on

00:30:03.519 --> 00:30:06.940
a regular basis like this GPS is getting

00:30:05.709 --> 00:30:09.129
downright dangerous though you know I'm

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:11.440
driving on King's way and it goes oh the

00:30:09.129 --> 00:30:13.059
term right on the Fraser and then as I'm

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:15.309
single to get into the lane to turn

00:30:13.059 --> 00:30:16.449
right on Fraser it goes oh no keep left

00:30:15.309 --> 00:30:18.879
on the Kings way for the next two

00:30:16.449 --> 00:30:20.589
kilometers and people are going and let

00:30:18.879 --> 00:30:21.969
me know that kind of made that honking

00:30:20.589 --> 00:30:24.129
part up but at the same time you're like

00:30:21.969 --> 00:30:27.309
you know if your GPS can't function on a

00:30:24.129 --> 00:30:28.869
cloudy day how useful is that in

00:30:27.309 --> 00:30:30.909
Canada's radius city so that's what

00:30:28.869 --> 00:30:33.549
that's one bit that I'm prototyping for

00:30:30.909 --> 00:30:34.590
a future Isaac episode suppose what else

00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:44.340
can we talk about here

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:50.730
I got nothing I've lived a pretty

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:54.179
uneventful series of days recently I was

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:57.720
waved at by a child on the street two

00:30:54.179 --> 00:30:59.549
days ago they went they were walking

00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:01.620
with their parents they were like maybe

00:30:59.549 --> 00:31:05.250
three years old maybe four and they were

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:09.809
like hello and I responded hello and

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:11.399
then I thought about like the it wasn't

00:31:09.809 --> 00:31:12.450
like it was an awkward interaction and

00:31:11.399 --> 00:31:14.580
I'm trying not to

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:17.100
obviously overthink it because I'm like

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:19.559
for the most part of rational adults the

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:23.730
devil car doesn't stack with the book of

00:31:19.559 --> 00:31:27.539
Belial but like you're really that's the

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:29.429
pureness of a child is to not understand

00:31:27.539 --> 00:31:33.200
the position that he's putting people

00:31:29.429 --> 00:31:36.779
into there I had that child's like

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:38.970
belief in the goodness of mankind in the

00:31:36.779 --> 00:31:41.730
palm of my hands I could have just

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:45.779
ghosted that child I could have said yet

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:47.340
whatever goodbye you know I could have

00:31:45.779 --> 00:31:50.870
been a total jerk I'm not suggesting

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:52.980
anyone in their right mind would be but

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:54.750
you know that puts a lot of pressure on

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:57.899
somebody into social interaction there's

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:59.700
like an innocent human being in front of

00:31:57.899 --> 00:32:02.279
you that is just like I know two things

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:04.830
about the world breastmilk

00:32:02.279 --> 00:32:06.179
young secondly I don't think

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:10.309
three-year-olds and usually breastfeed

00:32:06.179 --> 00:32:10.309
but admittedly I don't remember

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:14.290
and then the other thing is if I say

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:17.190
hello to anybody on the street they'll

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:19.420
say hello back if that if if they were

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:22.090
eight years old I would have said hello

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:23.560
back still if they were fifteen I would

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:25.240
have been like what is what's going on

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:27.490
here and you're going to say that Enel

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:29.410
you're being cynical this is not cynical

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:30.820
put yourself in anybody else's shoes

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:33.790
there if you're walking down the street

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:37.240
and a fifteen year old teenager just by

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:39.330
themselves goes hello in a big city I'd

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:43.540
start to be like what's going on here

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:46.930
like am I about to be punked in some way

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:49.390
or another and if they were like 40 and

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:53.140
they waved and said hello I would be

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:55.240
like this this person has a problem but

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:57.610
these these might just be Vancouver's

00:32:55.240 --> 00:33:00.460
social norms as well I did I grew up in

00:32:57.610 --> 00:33:03.160
a small ish down even if you were

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:04.780
downtown there making your way downtown

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:07.180
walking fast stations passing them

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:08.590
homebound you know downtown late at

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:10.930
night or early in the morning you would

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:13.270
sometimes pass somebody on the street

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:15.430
and you'd be like oftentimes you give

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:17.200
them a nod or you might even say hey you

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:19.060
know it's like a little bit more of a

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:21.280
small-town thing I also think it's kind

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:22.930
of like a signal that when if you say

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:24.760
hey to someone when you're the only two

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:26.470
people on the sidewalk it's like don't

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:28.060
sweat it I'm cool I'm not going to like

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:32.740
you know rob you or punch you or

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:34.300
something so you know that there's that

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:36.280
signal we don't do that in Vancouver it

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:39.610
has a reputation for being a cold city

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:44.290
from a social standpoint and I I sort of

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:47.260
understand it to be honest with you but

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:50.800
I also people they come to Vancouver and

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:52.210
they go you know why nobody I said hi to

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.070
a stranger on the SkyTrain and they

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:56.740
didn't say hi to me back the thing is

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:58.960
you get jaded sometimes living here and

00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:00.970
this is bringing up a whole other like

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:03.220
class of issues that are very prickly

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:04.870
but you get jaded living here sometimes

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:08.860
from talking to people you don't know

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:10.600
because probably like at least

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:12.850
two-thirds of my interactions with

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:16.389
strangers in Vancouver are like hey oh

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:19.210
hi um like can you give me some money

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:21.370
please there's an enormous population

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:22.780
here I'm not saying oh my life's so hard

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:25.060
I have to

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:28.330
deal with being asked for money from

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:31.540
time to time but you know I'm just

00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:32.980
saying that is one reason why you know

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:34.810
if you ever if you ever come to this

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:39.790
area you go why are people so unfriendly

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:41.620
it's like most of the time genuinely you

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:45.580
get talked to by a stranger it is with

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:47.980
an ulterior motive you know and it's you

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:50.110
know it's a fundamental problem maybe

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:51.250
that that allows us to compromise our

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:53.830
ability to get close to one another

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:56.380
maybe I'll admit we had a weird

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:57.970
situation and it's it's something you

00:34:56.380 --> 00:35:01.330
know I hesitate to talk about is again

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:03.130
like homelessness and poverty or sincere

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:05.680
and serious issues and oftentimes

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:10.360
there's like drug use and mental illness

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:13.860
tied up in it but like canine we're at a

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:16.180
McDonald's like two weeks ago and I

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:17.590
think in a drop the left hand here just

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:20.110
before I go off on this tangent and

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:22.210
forget K tonight we're at a McDonald's

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:24.610
like two weeks ago after we left this

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:25.690
person started walking beside us and we

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:26.950
were just kind of you know this is par

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:28.240
for the course so we just kind of like

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:30.970
having a conversation amongst ourselves

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:32.050
and then she goes like hey like could

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:33.880
you guys give you some money and we're

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:35.710
sorry we don't have any change and then

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:38.320
she's like yeah well would you use to

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:40.210
buy the food and we just sort of walked

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:44.260
off and you might say NL this is

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:46.030
extremely rude but that same for stuff

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:47.620
we use a credit card I'm not giving this

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:49.840
lady my credit card she got a reader or

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:53.770
something maybe I don't know but

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:56.410
secondly like three months earlier and I

00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:59.020
don't think she remembered three months

00:35:56.410 --> 00:36:01.120
earlier I was at that same McDonald's by

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:02.350
myself I was waiting for my food and she

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:05.290
came up and was like hey could you buy

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:07.810
me a meal and I said sorry like

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:09.520
basically I'm not going to do that which

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:11.500
I guess makes me a dick but all I wanted

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:13.000
for the purposes of this anecdote I

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:15.130
didn't say sorry I'm not going to do

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:21.160
that I just said sorry you know and then

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:24.700
the rest spoke for itself I suppose and

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:27.280
then she said you're a selfish dick and

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:29.400
I was like I mean in this situation I

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:32.170
can see her point but at the same time

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:33.520
I'm definitely not gonna give you my

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:35.560
loose change the next time I see you

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:36.730
outside of that McDonald's you just you

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:38.260
spoiled our future

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:40.270
her actions you know maybe I was having

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:42.730
an off day and all of a sudden now

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:46.360
you're like you know the customer's

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:49.750
always right man I'm like you created a

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:52.510
situation that allowed me to be a dick

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:55.030
but also self righteous and again it's

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:57.130
not like you can't analyze the issue on

00:36:55.030 --> 00:37:00.070
that level or you become like a total

00:36:57.130 --> 00:37:03.100
jerk there's no doubt about it but I was

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:05.350
like man for once I have like a great

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:07.600
excuse and it's not that I feel no

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:11.710
empathy is quite the opposite it's more

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:13.780
like you know when it comes to giving

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:15.310
money I got options I'm going to go with

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:18.190
the person who didn't call me a selfish

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:19.480
dick that's just I'm sorry for being a

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:23.460
human being on that level but that's

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:27.100
what it comes down to anyway that's

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:28.240
that's what life's like in Vancouver and

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:29.950
you might think that I'm being

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:33.130
insensitive there and there's a chance

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:36.310
that relative to the normal relative to

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:37.990
the rest of the population I am but not

00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:40.300
in Vancouver and Vancouver people are

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:42.340
like people are heartless sometimes man

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:44.290
I think you know I've only lived here

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:47.050
for like you know a small chunk of my

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:49.600
adult life I've avoided becoming like

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:53.410
completely jaded with it but it's a city

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:55.870
that it's gorgeous but it's God got some

00:37:53.410 --> 00:38:00.910
stuff going on under the surface as well

00:37:55.870 --> 00:38:03.850
there's no doubt about it not to make

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:05.710
the episode like too real we are just

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:08.110
playing but that's what the iSeries is

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:12.790
at this point you know is like talking

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:14.080
about not about real issues necessarily

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:15.670
but talking about things that aren't

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:17.200
Isaac especially on a run like this in

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:19.240
which we've you know bawled out of

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:21.400
control how did suicide King work for us

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:25.500
well in the end I gave us X plus Evo

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:25.500
which is like a pretty okay choice

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:33.970
how many waves of mini-bosses are there

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:33.970
am i losing in here

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:41.540
in the end I probably would rather have

00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:43.430
12 HP than X placebo but we don't have

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:46.760
much choice in that matter at this point

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:50.600
and the thing is like if we die we just

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:53.950
come back and we don't fight mega Satan

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:56.420
or we fight mega Satan later you know so

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:58.010
it's kind of like I've added a little

00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:01.820
bit of intrigue I'm not going to say it

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:03.740
is you know series finale of Breaking

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:06.950
Bad but we've added a little bit of

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:08.870
intrigue on this run because now it is

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:11.150
conceivable that we could die

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:13.610
we have stopped watch so this guy is

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:21.260
like secondary attacks right now should

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:22.940
be pretty easy to not get tagged by yeah

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:24.400
we made it happen man we only got it

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:25.610
once on the mega Satan fight that's

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.350
encouraging

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:30.200
for now though thanks for watching hope

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:32.390
you guys enjoy the episode you still

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:33.710
don't think so lowly of me if you did

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:34.610
click a like by the upside a great deal

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:36.410

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:41.110
