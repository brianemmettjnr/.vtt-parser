##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.419
everybody welcome back nor the line

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.440
please fighting guys again for plus

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.820
where I've been playing good and bad

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.110
critics would have you believe more bad

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.870
than good but I don't know we've had

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.690
positives we've had a lot of good runs

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.310
we've had some runs that haven't been so

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.380
hot I'll admit that dude it looks like

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.730
we're going negative with Maggie here if

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.769
you want me to get negative with Maggie

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:29.310
your hair stinks P 6 to 6 is e zero to

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.410
zero and your speed stat is garbage I'm

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.460
sorry that was a little uncalled for a

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.190
little close to the bone if you will

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.450
Maggie gets a bad rap dude I don't want

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.180
to be the home for misfit toys

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.070
necessarily but you know everyone talks

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.410
about Maggie as if she's a pariah

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.489
she's a persona non-grata you know she's

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.270
not invited to a boat race

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.949
stole that joke from Flight of the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.350
Conchords it's not stealing if you cite

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.000
your sources you know when you write an

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.440
essay they don't go you stole this

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.300
information you know it's an on the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.070
shoulders of giants sort of situation

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.420
cancer pickups pretty good here I just

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.070
think she gets a bad rap for being

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.290
garbage recently in her history sure

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.210
she's been a garbage character now she's

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.180
fine you know three point five damage

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.240
ten rate of fire one speed to start once

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.560
you get you know like greedy you're done

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.729
I don't know if it's greedy or or if

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.350
it's sad we've got me killed delirium we

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.820
have killed delirium so that might have

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.420
been what gives us the the bonus pill

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.000
can't remember actually still dealing

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.320
with the little neck strain today not

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.270
that this is where you go to get you

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.310
know an update on NL's spinal health

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.180
yeah I think it's actually a blessing in

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.100
disguise it's only been one day since

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.020
the neck pain started it's like 50%

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.229
better today so you know if it continues

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.560
on that pace it will continue to get 50

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.090
percent better every single day until

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.000
inevitably I end up having some kind of

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.560
super neck I'm interested in that I'm

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.390
looking forward to it but I think it's

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.450
like my cue to get rid of this freaking

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.280
dxracer dude I know it's twitch it's

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.290
anathema for a twitch streamer to say

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.819
they don't like the dxracer chair it's

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.300
not that I don't like it I think I just

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.390
aged out dude I'm not even trying to get

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.720
sympathy for like

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:22.270
I'm old I'm turning 29 this year please

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.780
return to the concept of a pension just

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.300
joking

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.130
anyway but I think I got it I got a a

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.790
job I gotta get some organ Amish stuff

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.770
dude you get older you learn you're not

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.840
invincible I got a little tendinitis in

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.000
both wrists I'm sure from having like an

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.230
odd organ AMA computer setup combined

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.420
with spending a lot of time at the

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.489
computer you might be like 16 17 18 19

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.989
20 there's many other numbers you could

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.300
be as well in terms of your age in terms

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.560
of years on planet Earth but if you're

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.550
on the you know the side it's a little

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.410
lower than me you might consider

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.170
yourself immortal you might say why

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.910
don't you just not get tendinitis

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.040
grandpa it's the easiest thing in the

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.220
world look at me you'll you'll see you

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.019
know you get older ergonomics aka like

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.510
the lamest science in the world becomes

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.850
not so lame we got a spine we got to

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.720
figure out what to do with it pretty

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:13.650
sure that by the time I turn 80 the new

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.060
phenomenon you know we we've had desks

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.730
we had the Hawaii chair of course that

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.780
was a big one now we got standing desks

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.850
people are like sitting is the new

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.880
smoking you gotta you gotta stand up I

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.950
don't disagree with that I I could you

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.950
know live with the concept of a standing

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.390
desk for streaming I think I'm not

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.799
saying it would be fun for the first

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.780
couple of weeks but you know I think I

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.489
could get used to it the only problem is

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.070
the ceilings in my current office are

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.870
like you know seven feet high so I mean

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.489
I'm not seven feet tall but it would be

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.700
a little claustrophobic plus we get some

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.620
weird echo off the you know where did

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.040
the floor of our upstairs neighbor if

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.750
you know what I mean either way I'm

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.430
pretty sure by the time I'm 80 the new

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.610
phenomenon is gonna be like underwater

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.019
desks like the desk isn't underwater but

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.880
you spend the whole day like fully

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.190
submerged in a water tank it's great for

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.110
your spine your spine wasn't meant to

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.230
take all this gravity so now we'll just

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.670
you know in the womb we're not subject

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.230
to the pressures of gravity as much

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.950
because we're buoyant so all we got to

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.510
do is get one of these buoyancy desks

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.120
that's like as soon as I said that I was

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.859
like oh my god a buoyant desk I got to

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.840
stop giving away these awesome ideas for

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.270
free

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.190
that could make me you know a trillion

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.440
dollars one day which is gonna be worth

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.760
like you know slightly less than a

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.770
trillion dollars now but would probably

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.840
be more than enough to purchase a parcel

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.830
of land in Vancouver so that's all you

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:42.660
need Boyan desks is it gonna be annoying

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:44.220
to have a buoyant desk probably you know

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.410
you ever spring a leak the whole place

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.330
is going out but plus you're surrounded

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.460
by electronics you know you're giving me

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.990
a lot of excuses you're not giving me a

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.190
lot of solutions right now you're fired

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:58.080
I'm sorry I want to be the Steve Jobs of

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.580
the desk industry probably a sentence

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.150
that has been uttered on ironically at

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:06.180
least once in human existence you know

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.729
it always gets me there are still people

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.550
out there and by the way if you are one

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.020
of these people this is not me like

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.490
roasting you there's still people out

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.729
there on planet Earth to sleep on water

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.720
bits I want to know why cuz this strikes

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:20.940
me as one of those things where I'm

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.590
ignorant I'm like a waterbed as a 1980s

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.090
thing if you're still sleeping on one

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.870
you know you missed it you missed the

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.010
fad die

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.510
what's wrong like you're behind the

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.100
times but is this one of those things

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.750
where I'd you know I make fun of bullet

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.620
ball and all of a sudden everyone comes

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.970
out of the woodwork and it's like

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.650
actually it's like a really inclusive

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.960
sport for people that you know have

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.550
physical ailments and disabilities and I

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.289
had come across as a jerk is that like a

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.570
waterbed is like really good for you if

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:44.280
you have spine problems it seems like it

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.650
would be the opposite but you know what

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.860
do I I'm like a hundred percent not a

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:53.160
chiropractor so I'm not even a Keyser

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:59.510
söze dude it's been a very very

00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:04.740
laid-back run here Dingles not too bad

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:06.599
ladies we're hoping here to get it that

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.400
was pretty terrible get a deal with the

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:09.660
devil we got tons of HP so we want to

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.580
trade it away for some damage because

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.990
we're still rolling like bass damage we

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.530
also have the cancer item which is

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.000
really nice for extra survivability on

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.169
the late-game floor so we don't have to

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.180
worry about the late-game floor so now

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:22.580
we got to worry about you know the floor

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.810
that we're on at the present moment

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.010
just continue to use this poop to help

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.780
ourselves out please don't break the

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:31.020
break the poop please don't break the

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.669
poop actually just came across more

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.470
offensive than I intended C was just a

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:36.730
misspeak

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:38.660
to begin with alright we if we get a

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.780
came being conception could be really

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:44.470
good but if we can get a blood bank it

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:48.200
can be even better especially with the

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:50.150
young heart working out for us here no

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.890
chance to make it into that mob trap

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.560
room which is actually a boss trap room

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:57.140
so instead we'll just bounce think I'm

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.730
gonna use the Stars card but I'm gonna

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.110
use it productively so we're gonna go

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.520
into the cursed room hope to get like

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.810
copies head cuz young hearts doing

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:08.090
nothing yet and then teleport out I

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.800
think this secret with this you just got

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:13.280
a go for it you know it's actually

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.990
really easy to not take damage on the

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.520
spikes you just don't touch him I know

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.490
it's it's like it easier said than done

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:23.930
sort of you know situation they're not

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:25.610
good enough good enough but I think you

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:28.000
just got it you got to put the ball in

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:30.050
your own hands oh my lord

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.760
think you gotta say you know what I'm

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.169
gonna force the game to hit me here I'm

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.980
gonna give myself a chance to prove that

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:38.419
I'm great

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:40.970
we did so and it works sort of I do

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:43.790
these enemies this is like I like this

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:45.530
because it's an enemy that fires in a

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:48.380
way we've never seen before like that's

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:54.229
not it's kind of like mega fatty shots

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:55.729
but not exactly the same it's a new

00:07:54.229 --> 00:07:58.460
mechanic I can appreciate that

00:07:55.729 --> 00:08:00.979
piercing shots of course happy to have

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:03.979
them getting paralysis out of the

00:08:00.979 --> 00:08:05.300
ecosystem is fine by me as well we're

00:08:03.979 --> 00:08:09.010
not going to the shop cuz I don't want

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:11.330
to be tempted by the fruit of another

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:14.090
tempted but the truth is discovered

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:16.610
what's been going on now that you've

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:18.919
been gone there's no other tempted by

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.750
the fruit of another I don't think I've

00:08:18.919 --> 00:08:27.110
ever heard that song outside of a

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:30.110
commercial it's like that and day

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:32.930
bow-bow akka oh yeah by Yello

made famous by its Always Sunny in

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:41.690
Philadelphia

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:44.219
[Music]

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:46.500
what did that song ever was on the radio

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:50.220
or he was it Birds for movie trailers

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:52.800
only like that song that goes like it's

00:08:50.220 --> 00:09:01.589
getting hot hot hot like those are movie

00:08:52.800 --> 00:09:05.010
trailer exclusives oh please let me

00:09:01.589 --> 00:09:06.269
shoot before you die we want to keep our

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.769
deal with the devil chance alive here

00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:12.089
the odds of it working out for us are

00:09:07.769 --> 00:09:13.620
very low to be honest with you thirty

00:09:12.089 --> 00:09:15.290
three point seven five you know I

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.700
wouldn't I wouldn't hang my hat on that

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:21.899
that's like going to the casino betting

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:23.970
it all on green I know there's zero I

00:09:21.899 --> 00:09:27.750
know there's double zero it's a little

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:31.440
bit of a stretch you know I mean you

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:34.769
know there are there are books for like

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:37.260
how to make money at the roulette table

00:09:34.769 --> 00:09:38.790
have I talked about this before like if

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:42.690
you go to Amazon right now and search

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:44.430
like roulette strategy you can find

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:47.370
books you can find books about how to

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:51.930
like win money it's like the best way to

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:52.290
play slot machines the roulette table is

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.660
like a

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:56.940
I really liked the concept of roulette

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:59.029
because it's like pure mathematics and

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:01.140
probability I think I'm just gonna go

00:09:59.029 --> 00:10:01.820
yeah we'll take world with us and just

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:05.100
get out of here

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:07.560
like literally there's like a 1% edge

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:11.370
for the casino which is the the green

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:12.810
none the green nuts no the green buttons

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.670
that it can land on zero and double zero

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:18.120
and then apart from that it's just like

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:20.880
well your risk essentially is nearly

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:23.790
exactly the same as your reward there's

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.380
books that are like they proclaimed that

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:28.709
they can teach you how to be better at

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:30.329
roulette who is writing this I don't

00:10:28.709 --> 00:10:32.250
really like don't even start me on who's

00:10:30.329 --> 00:10:34.589
buying it because that's just like I

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:36.240
don't want to say it's sad because maybe

00:10:34.589 --> 00:10:37.589
I'm an idiot maybe there's strategies

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.199
you can do with regard to your betting

00:10:37.589 --> 00:10:42.180
that make it you know you you know you

00:10:40.199 --> 00:10:44.459
want to bring your stake in and then you

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.480
know see you later like at first time I

00:10:44.459 --> 00:10:46.949
don't know what I'm talking about it's

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.690
the most important part your please give

00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:51.360
me a spirit heart so I can play the

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:55.110
the came being conception enabler a

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:57.000
little bit more here zero luck not

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:58.470
working too well I think we should just

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.940
keep ourselves alive for the time being

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:04.050
build up more charges but like there's

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:07.350
some people are you know gambling

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:08.700
addicts some people are just ignorant of

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:10.260
the fact that it's not a game of skill

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.180
it's entirely a game of chance who's

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.700
writing these books like roulette

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:16.170
strategy with Vick martingale or

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.870
something like that I don't understand

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:21.240
you gotta have a pair of brass cojones

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:22.500
on you dude to be like Oh what do you do

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:26.130
I'm an author I write books about

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:27.990
roulette strategy again maybe I'm

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:29.610
actually missing because I know that

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:30.720
like there is a strategy I think it's

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.820
actually called the martingale strategy

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:37.170
which is why I've used that name for an

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:38.550
author in hypothetical land here and

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:42.300
what you do is you go to the roulette

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:44.820
table you bet X where X is low and if

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:47.730
you lose you know don't speaking of

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:49.110
losing I had to take the hit there just

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:54.030
to keep myself from getting hit by the

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:55.740
champion don't do this to me I think

00:11:54.030 --> 00:12:02.310
we're gonna be fine we got in Cuba said

00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:05.160
I can be in Concepcion um we just did

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:07.350
one more room we can do this and then

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:10.050
basically if you lose you bet double you

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:11.430
lose your bed double so the idea is you

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:13.080
only have to win once cuz the first time

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.730
you win you just back away you put 20

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:16.410
bucks down if you win you walk away with

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:18.270
40 bucks if you lose you put 40 bucks

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:21.530
down you lose you put 80 bucks down etc

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:23.880
etc the problem happens we have no bombs

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:25.590
to a clubs yeah well we'll probably use

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:29.550
that right away lovers card is good here

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:32.340
too the problem becomes you know if you

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:35.580
lose 80 bucks bet 160 lose 160 bucks you

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:38.040
bet 320 lose 320 bucks uh

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:40.440
maybe you don't have 640 back bucks left

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:42.630
to bet with or maybe the table has like

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.820
a maximum you know of like you can only

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:46.410
place $100 bet all of a sudden you you

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.480
know you've lost six times in a row and

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:51.000
you can't win your money back your

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:53.070
strategy has failed but apart from that

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.300
I'm like what

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:58.530
the heck is roulette strategy my dude

00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:01.170
maybe I should read the book like for

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:02.640
curiosity's sake I've talked about it

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:04.020
before again it's not meant to be like a

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:06.630
holier-than-thou sort of thing but I

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:08.520
sort of just don't get gambling like

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:10.080
I've done it before and I've had an okay

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.730
time but I've never been like I could

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:16.170
really go for a trip to the casino right

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:18.330
now but maybe maybe I'm missing out for

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:21.630
now though we're gonna try to get off

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:23.550
this topic this tangent conversation

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:27.260
continue playing this get some more

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:29.430
money but the money is very secondary

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:31.320
although that was very nice

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:35.610
- getting came being conception - pop

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:36.840
for ourselves so like that we're gonna

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.610
continue playing this guy just want like

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.170
one spirit heart I can actually go for a

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.790
single red heart as well we're gonna get

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:45.980
rid of young heart we don't need it

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:48.450
anymore please just give me a red heart

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:50.700
cuz I shouldn't have played it as much

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.530
as I did and I feel bad no spirit heart

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:55.380
that's fine because what can we do now

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:57.900
well we can go to our curse room without

00:13:55.380 --> 00:14:07.740
having to spend anything you could also

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:09.750
open that golden chest no we got hit but

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:13.140
we got unlimited bombs in the process as

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:18.120
well hey I am not playing very well

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:21.540
would be a good way to put it a little

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:23.430
HP back out of that and the run has

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:24.810
given us a chance so I really do you

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.160
know blame myself quite a lot for the

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:30.090
fact that it seems like we're doing

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:32.190
fairly poorly here we're still like on

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:34.320
basic stats but we should be starting to

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:35.700
run away from it like Incubus helping us

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.870
out is huge we're not gonna get boss

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:41.190
rush but this is all about getting the

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:45.000
negative to begin with like I actually

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:46.680
completely understand why the most

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.510
popular mobile games not all of them but

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:51.600
like a certain chunk of that maybe like

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:53.460
you know 1 out of the top 10 on the iOS

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.590
App Store at any given moment it's just

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:57.780
a slot machine I get it it's exciting

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:59.940
the you know you push the button it's a

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:01.680
minor investment you see what comes out

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:03.829
of it sometimes nothing oftentimes

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.929
nothing sometimes the little reward

00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:07.100
very rarely a big reward you go ahead

00:15:05.929 --> 00:15:11.779
you know I can see how they'll get your

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:15.170
neurotransmitters pumping but I don't

00:15:11.779 --> 00:15:18.319
know just don't I don't understand like

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:19.910
people have to know that there's no

00:15:18.319 --> 00:15:22.369
strategy right or is this one of those

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:26.629
things like I don't know why like I know

00:15:22.369 --> 00:15:28.730
that ads are always targeted to you but

00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:31.999
I don't know why how somehow I ended up

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:35.089
getting like exclusively on Facebook I

00:15:31.999 --> 00:15:37.429
only get ads I get ads for like door -

00:15:35.089 --> 00:15:41.269
which is fair enough and then I get ads

00:15:37.429 --> 00:15:43.220
for like this Tony Robbins ask self-help

00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:45.049
stuff where it's always like you know

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.239
before I made my first million dollars

00:15:45.049 --> 00:15:49.160
at age 30 people asked me what success

00:15:47.239 --> 00:15:51.470
meant to me and it's always like Tom

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.259
Harris consulting and then I click on it

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:55.069
not the ad but you know I go like

00:15:53.259 --> 00:15:56.929
independently in an incognito window

00:15:55.069 --> 00:16:01.600
searched and there's like a whole

00:15:56.929 --> 00:16:06.709
industry of 25 year old dudes in suits

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:08.360
selling how to make money - 25 year old

00:16:06.709 --> 00:16:10.610
dudes who want to be in suits like I'm

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.230
I'm missing out on this weird kind of

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:14.059
like Ouroboros I think it's happening

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:16.279
but I'm not missing out on it cuz all of

00:16:14.059 --> 00:16:18.170
my freakin ads every day I go to

00:16:16.279 --> 00:16:19.579
Facebook and it's like are you sick of

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:23.509
not accomplishing anything in your life

00:16:19.579 --> 00:16:25.459
and I'm like I'm alright dude I'm doing

00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:27.949
okay and they but it's then like this

00:16:25.459 --> 00:16:31.850
dudes like you know I've made 30

00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:34.459
millionaires of my time and I'm like I I

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:35.449
just don't I just don't care I got it

00:16:34.459 --> 00:16:37.160
you know what if Facebook is actually

00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:38.329
good about targeted ads I can click the

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.819
button that says don't tell me about

00:16:38.329 --> 00:16:42.319
this I don't want to see this anymore

00:16:39.819 --> 00:16:45.439
but I kind of take pleasure in the idea

00:16:42.319 --> 00:16:46.790
that the ads are not like they're paying

00:16:45.439 --> 00:16:50.689
for them and then it's going to me and

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:52.100
I'm laughing at them and then cuz I

00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:53.509
don't want to get self-help from the guy

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.980
who's like let me tell you how I made a

00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:56.360
million dollars cuz I'm pretty sure the

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.980
guy made a million dollars selling

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:01.489
ebooks to people who want to know how he

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:02.929
made a million dollars I want to I want

00:17:01.489 --> 00:17:04.669
to talk to the businessmen who's like I

00:17:02.929 --> 00:17:07.159
don't have time to think is a

00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:09.589
businessman I want to talk to the

00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:11.569
businessman or businesswoman who's like

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:13.429
I don't have time to talk to you you

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:15.169
know I got work to do that's the person

00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:16.490
I want to talk to I don't want to talk

00:17:15.169 --> 00:17:16.819
to the guy who's like sign up for my

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:19.069
free

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:22.339
course I don't want to talk to either of

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:23.569
them to be honest but if I have to give

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:26.839
me the guy who was like I'm Way too busy

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:28.100
to talk I'm too busy being successful

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:30.080
instead of the guy who's like let me

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:32.090
write blog posts about how successful I

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:39.649
am but I get I might this is all coming

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:43.909
from a place of ignorance all admit like

00:17:39.649 --> 00:17:45.200
I have a friend and he's a good friend

00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:46.669
this is not like an acquaintance

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.259
situation that I'm selling out but he's

00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:49.909
a good friend of mine he was really into

00:17:48.259 --> 00:17:51.259
like Eckhart Tolle for a while there's

00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:52.700
nothing wrong with that Eckhart Tolle

00:17:51.259 --> 00:17:56.210
you know I'm familiar with some of his

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:57.830
axioms he's like a philosopher in the

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:59.509
modern eras written some books like the

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:01.429
power of now it's all about like

00:17:59.509 --> 00:18:04.789
motivating yourself if not now when

00:18:01.429 --> 00:18:07.250
etc etc but I always found out like a

00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:08.750
weird sort of paradox and maybe this is

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:11.870
just my way of glossing over things but

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:13.700
you know Eckhart Tolle is like all there

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:15.200
ever is is now so what are you doing

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.549
with your time and I'm like Eckhart I'm

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.350
reading this book right now you're

00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:20.240
making me feel guilty first from

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:22.610
indulging in the products that you have

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.409
sold me I kind of want to return this

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.850
and I don't even know it this but it

00:18:24.409 --> 00:18:27.679
started going out and learning how to

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:29.029
paint wild flowers in my backyard or

00:18:27.679 --> 00:18:32.659
something like that that's obviously a

00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:34.029
joke we don't have a backyard please

00:18:32.659 --> 00:18:37.389
stop hitting me

00:18:34.029 --> 00:18:40.490
madness imprisoning me all that I see

00:18:37.389 --> 00:18:41.720
absolute failure anyway I don't even

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:43.370
know how we got off on this topic you

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:45.350
know how we got off on this topic cuz

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:48.559
we're on the fifth floor and I have

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:52.429
three point five damage that's how I

00:18:48.559 --> 00:18:55.250
ended up on this topic I'm just like the

00:18:52.429 --> 00:18:56.149
same thing like I used to get ads on

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:57.500
YouTube all the time I don't know what

00:18:56.149 --> 00:18:59.299
happened to this guy you got you got

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:01.190
swallowed up by Tai Lopez I guess but he

00:18:59.299 --> 00:19:10.820
used to be like i'm mike chang with

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:12.590
sixpackshortcuts.com like has paid

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:15.649
tuition for every class I'm taking as an

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:16.970
adult is my guess and that is not even

00:19:15.649 --> 00:19:18.710
an exaggeration but you always you know

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:20.389
you click on a video hey guys what's up

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:21.649
here's the foods you should not be eaten

00:19:20.389 --> 00:19:24.080
if you want to have a six-pack abs

00:19:21.649 --> 00:19:26.659
number one Donuts number two just a

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.950
glass of water with a kilogram of

00:19:26.659 --> 00:19:30.260
powdered sugar in it you're like my

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:33.710
Chang I know I don't need this ad

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:35.900
I know the secret to abs I just there is

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:38.320
no there's no I don't need a shortcut

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:40.880
yet I haven't even taken the long way

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:43.460
proper diet and exercise and I don't

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:48.110
need the I don't need the long form

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:50.480
approach the recipe is very simple not

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:53.240
easy but simple you know I just I love

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.800
the taste of food that's bad for me more

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:57.560
than I love being able to take my shirt

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:59.300
off and go hey look at those and also of

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:01.000
course the other benefits like probably

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:03.680
living a little bit longer but like

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.880
that's not really like a benefit that I

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:10.670
can feel until I'm already there

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:13.300
like sure the program is called Six Pack

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:18.470
Shortcuts it's not called the longevity

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:19.790
log book it's how to get a Beachbody not

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:23.090
how to get a body that'll you know

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:25.220
survive through octogenarian ism you

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:28.220
know what I mean they know what sells is

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:30.380
what I'm trying to say I've already made

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:32.930
that sure I had you know I was in shape

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:34.910
in a high school it made sense for me at

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:36.470
the time because I didn't know how many

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:38.060
good foods were out there I was dead in

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:39.980
high school I didn't eat soup because it

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:42.980
was too wet that's not even a joke I

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:44.720
know that's what Austin believes is a 24

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.730
year old but as a 17 year old that's

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.750
what I believed I didn't like eating

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:49.460
rice coz it was just too much work

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:50.930
there's so much rice on this plate who

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:54.350
could have possibly eat all this rice

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:58.340
it's outrageous you know made things

00:20:54.350 --> 00:21:00.500
very simple I don't need a six pack

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:03.380
shortcut I need to I need the motivation

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:06.040
I need you to like you know that that's

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:07.790
what I need in like a personal trainer

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:10.570
people are always like well you need

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:12.950
someone that'll keep you honest math I

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:14.990
don't need the information I know the

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:17.570
information stop eating those dang

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:18.830
pretzel chips just because you're eating

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:20.600
them with hummus doesn't mean it's good

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:22.480
for you just adding a good food to a

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:25.010
food is bad for you doesn't make it good

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:26.630
the carrots do not purify the ranch

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:28.700
dressing regardless what I need is like

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:30.500
a personal trainer that would you know

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.570
I'd hire them and we'd sign a contract

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.410
and then they'd come to my house at like

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:36.560
6:00 in the morning

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:38.810
and like just blared like a airhorns

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:41.630
it's a good idea but you could take a

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:43.820
baseball bat and like threaten to break

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:45.379
my legs we're going on this morning

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:47.629
James you know I know I sign that

00:21:45.379 --> 00:21:49.460
contract but I don't really but Kuhn you

00:21:47.629 --> 00:21:51.350
know shatter a kneecap or something

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:54.080
looks like we're using the rowing

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:56.749
machine that's what I need in a personal

00:21:54.080 --> 00:22:00.110
trainer which is also terrifying never

00:21:56.749 --> 00:22:02.509
do that that's I'll just live with the

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:03.830
one pack for now there's a one pack

00:22:02.509 --> 00:22:04.509
shortcut I don't need a shortcut I'm

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:08.809
already there

00:22:04.509 --> 00:22:11.450
do it please Lord give me something

00:22:08.809 --> 00:22:15.220
that's not an active item that's worse

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:22.840
than the one we already have I'm beggin

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:26.629
beggin I'm dead just shut up so I mean

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:31.549
he has algae's know one of these days

00:22:26.629 --> 00:22:35.299
are gonna learn the runes dude could

00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:37.129
possibly make like oh that was bad we

00:22:35.299 --> 00:22:41.149
can make like another Incubus by doing

00:22:37.129 --> 00:22:43.909
this I think just pretty much what we're

00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:46.850
looking for cuz like it's the single

00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:48.489
biggest damage injection I think we

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:51.019
could have let's take death cuz like

00:22:48.489 --> 00:22:53.779
dude I don't know I want to I want to

00:22:51.019 --> 00:22:57.499
get through this I wanna get free I

00:22:53.779 --> 00:23:00.259
wanna get free I wanna get free from

00:22:57.499 --> 00:23:02.320
Mike Chang's ads isn't it funny it

00:23:00.259 --> 00:23:04.489
should be it shouldn't be six-minute

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:07.749
there's a joke in here give me a second

00:23:04.489 --> 00:23:12.919
it shouldn't be six-minute abs more like

00:23:07.749 --> 00:23:15.409
six-minute ads right right because of

00:23:12.919 --> 00:23:20.389
today's ad focused online content

00:23:15.409 --> 00:23:23.179
ecosystem this guy knows what I'm

00:23:20.389 --> 00:23:26.169
talking about oh my lord we actually got

00:23:23.179 --> 00:23:26.169
a luck upgrade

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:34.860
it's alright I'll hang I'll hang as long

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:38.730
as I need to hang by the way I didn't

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:42.600
forget I noticed that we got leach of

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:45.840
the Brian variety number two defenseman

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:52.890
New York Rangers look it up kids born in

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:54.450
the wrong generation we need I mean are

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:56.760
we on Depp's - now we are we're

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:58.770
surprisingly fairly close to being on

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:01.590
schedule for boss rush and hush not that

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:05.340
either of them is a particular relevancy

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:08.250
I was a advance move there I wanted to

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:09.960
use oh that sucked I wanted to use IV

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:13.200
bag to prevent myself from taking spear

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:14.940
at hard damage you know if that's not an

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.930
advanced move you've been in the Isaac

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:18.240
bubble too long

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:22.170
what's an advanced move to you then oh

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:24.030
when you oh you know you abuse the item

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:25.890
mechanics so that you get the extra

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:29.010
pools and they give it crashes the game

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:34.200
gives you a free no that's like guru

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:36.090
level I ain't about that okay we need as

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:42.360
many red hearts as possible

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:44.010
as much as I wish we didn't I'm hoping

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:46.350
IV bag does work with game being

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:48.270
conception cuz it did just like might

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:52.010
not oh my lord

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:52.010
that is awful

00:24:53.299 --> 00:24:59.119
you know leave for now I I didn't know

00:24:56.570 --> 00:25:01.759
you could go through a run this long

00:24:59.119 --> 00:25:03.559
without getting at ears speed or age oh

00:25:01.759 --> 00:25:06.259
I guess we did get HP at ears speed or

00:25:03.559 --> 00:25:09.470
damage upgrade at least like we've been

00:25:06.259 --> 00:25:12.230
living in this world where we're just

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:18.919
like this is just how Maggie is forever

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:20.629
apparently please God I mean I haven't I

00:25:18.919 --> 00:25:23.269
would never suggest that I've been

00:25:20.629 --> 00:25:25.279
playing the greatest I've ever played in

00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:27.259
my entire life but I really want to call

00:25:25.279 --> 00:25:31.159
attention to the fact that we're on base

00:25:27.259 --> 00:25:34.359
stats six floors into the game sure we

00:25:31.159 --> 00:25:34.359
squandered a deal with the devil

00:25:34.989 --> 00:25:39.590
we got lucky actually to get came being

00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:42.019
conception from our first deal with the

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:51.019
devil otherwise we'd be in a real nasty

00:25:42.019 --> 00:25:54.169
spot like we we've gotten almost

00:25:51.019 --> 00:25:56.389
exclusively these will always pay for

00:25:54.169 --> 00:25:59.139
themselves because we have IV bag in the

00:25:56.389 --> 00:26:09.710
blood bank but question mark card I

00:25:59.139 --> 00:26:11.989
don't know that seems horrible I don't

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:14.960
think it's worth 15 cents let's put it

00:26:11.989 --> 00:26:19.100
that way uh they just keep tossing some

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:23.239
bombs in there seven cent compost to a

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:24.889
club's with taro cloth could get a lot

00:26:23.239 --> 00:26:26.989
of bombs potentially it's that's

00:26:24.889 --> 00:26:30.529
tempting think instead I'm gonna buy a

00:26:26.989 --> 00:26:33.559
two-cent bad boy they're two of clubs to

00:26:30.529 --> 00:26:34.789
get us up to four I had no idea what

00:26:33.559 --> 00:26:37.989
question my card was gonna do for us

00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:37.989
there I figured that try it on for size

00:26:38.409 --> 00:26:46.100
let's find the item room I think it's

00:26:43.249 --> 00:26:49.899
weird but I think we have a win on this

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:53.749
run the Incubus is a huge help

00:26:49.899 --> 00:26:56.749
however like we need some damage of like

00:26:53.749 --> 00:26:58.789
any sort better tear effects piercing

00:26:56.749 --> 00:27:03.049
shots Incubus can carry us for a while

00:26:58.789 --> 00:27:05.109
but eventually that you know the carry

00:27:03.049 --> 00:27:07.639
juice is gonna run out

00:27:05.109 --> 00:27:11.749
or as they call it on Sex in the City

00:27:07.639 --> 00:27:13.459
sinn fein del now carry juice seed maybe

00:27:11.749 --> 00:27:15.169
my audience doesn't overlap with the Sex

00:27:13.459 --> 00:27:15.649
in the City demographic that much that's

00:27:15.169 --> 00:27:16.999
okay

00:27:15.649 --> 00:27:20.899
I mean I never really watched the show

00:27:16.999 --> 00:27:24.709
either it was on TBS when I was a

00:27:20.899 --> 00:27:26.929
teenager and Kim Cattrall is half

00:27:24.709 --> 00:27:28.989
Canadian so you know by law we have to

00:27:26.929 --> 00:27:33.979
watch a little bit of it every year in

00:27:28.989 --> 00:27:36.169
biology class but to a space that

00:27:33.979 --> 00:27:37.429
dislike enough keys for us to never have

00:27:36.169 --> 00:27:38.299
to worry about it for the rest of our

00:27:37.429 --> 00:27:46.939
natural lives

00:27:38.299 --> 00:27:49.579
I wanna get keys I wanna get keys give

00:27:46.939 --> 00:27:52.159
me some tears please give me some tears

00:27:49.579 --> 00:27:54.799
please give me some tears please why

00:27:52.159 --> 00:27:55.879
would you do this Edmund come in come in

00:27:54.799 --> 00:28:00.709
please

00:27:55.879 --> 00:28:02.269
I would settle for sure that would

00:28:00.709 --> 00:28:03.619
settle for that some speed is worth

00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:13.849
something here

00:28:03.619 --> 00:28:17.929
we need damage my dude that was not a

00:28:13.849 --> 00:28:20.119
good one I think we might be able to do

00:28:17.929 --> 00:28:21.589
the well it's irrelevant now but we

00:28:20.119 --> 00:28:24.739
might be able to do like the world's

00:28:21.589 --> 00:28:30.289
fastest play there like space walk walk

00:28:24.739 --> 00:28:32.329
space walk walk because you know you can

00:28:30.289 --> 00:28:34.689
get two plays out of the demon judgement

00:28:32.329 --> 00:28:36.769
which is why I was hesitating to use the

00:28:34.689 --> 00:28:38.749
IV bag before I played him is they

00:28:36.769 --> 00:28:41.149
didn't want to lower my effective window

00:28:38.749 --> 00:28:43.699
for getting that invincible play but in

00:28:41.149 --> 00:28:48.319
the end we got acid baby which is okay

00:28:43.699 --> 00:28:51.829
Oh No

00:28:48.319 --> 00:28:53.269
especially if we get any good pills in

00:28:51.829 --> 00:28:57.139
our rotation which you know as of right

00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:59.139
now let's be real I got no idea we're at

00:28:57.139 --> 00:29:02.059
27 minutes just getting through the

00:28:59.139 --> 00:29:03.919
first half of the game so I'm a little

00:29:02.059 --> 00:29:06.079
skeptical we do have a 100% chance of a

00:29:03.919 --> 00:29:08.319
deal with the devil and we can afford to

00:29:06.079 --> 00:29:08.319
take

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:17.510
it's no concern whatsoever sure but

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:19.130
bombs pretty not good but instantly

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:20.419
becomes like the second best item we've

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:25.130
gotten out of an item room on our whole

00:29:20.419 --> 00:29:27.919
run oh we did get a little brim now so

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:31.279
we got a nice little array of familiars

00:29:27.919 --> 00:29:33.830
walking around with us that annoys me

00:29:31.279 --> 00:29:35.750
but just don't lose your deal with the

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:42.889
devil chance by being a moron and you'll

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:45.110
be Bob's your uncle etc etc just looking

00:29:42.889 --> 00:29:49.250
at the the rate of fire and the damage

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:55.429
stat like it's a it's like a mark of

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:57.380
shame it's like the scarlet digit maybe

00:29:55.429 --> 00:30:05.590
all I need is a shot in the freaking arm

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:05.590
dude my veins bloodier than blood I

00:30:06.399 --> 00:30:09.950
think he was talking about blood doping

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:11.659
when he wrote that song probably not

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:13.789
right Jeff Tweedy doesn't seem like that

00:30:11.659 --> 00:30:17.120
and he follows the Tour de France the

00:30:13.789 --> 00:30:19.100
Tour de Pras can i I got an honest

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:22.100
question why don't they call it led Tour

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:26.210
de France we always say that the Tour de

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:27.950
France if we're gonna is usually if

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:32.679
we're gonna say France and we're gonna

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:32.679
say Tour Doug why don't we just know you

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:38.510
why don't we just go all the way and

00:30:35.059 --> 00:30:39.769
call you know Leigh Tour de France sorry

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:43.059
did I get too real for you

00:30:39.769 --> 00:30:45.019
Hunger Games no thanks I'm still full

00:30:43.059 --> 00:30:46.429
please have mercy

00:30:45.019 --> 00:30:53.080
look I ruined my own deal with the devil

00:30:46.429 --> 00:30:53.080
chance there let's go let's go

00:30:55.059 --> 00:31:06.279
give me some cambian

00:30:57.789 --> 00:31:08.700
I need more just hold onto this could be

00:31:06.279 --> 00:31:08.700
useful

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:14.670
I think like 1/2 of people are gonna

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:16.680
over rate this run they're gonna look at

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:20.430
it and go what's the problem you got you

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:22.830
know little brim Incubus piercing shots

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:26.160
the problem sorry I didn't want to get

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:28.050
mad there the problem so we've the same

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:31.920
stats we've had since we were birthed

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:36.300
into this mortal coil that never is a

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:38.100
good recipe on an Isaac run please Ben

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:40.860
like okay it's not the same stats cuz we

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:42.480
have raised our speed and we've probably

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:46.500
affected our shot speed in some way

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:50.070
that's like useless but like it's bad

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:55.380
dude this is a bad run I'm just telling

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:57.690
you that straight off the bad here we

00:31:55.380 --> 00:32:03.600
might be able to succeed regardless like

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:05.070
we did get a little stronger we have the

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:07.110
negative we want to make sure we make it

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:10.010
down to Sheol are you actually doing any

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:12.770
damage at all like or just irritating me

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:16.340
black candle that's pretty good

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:18.750
well worth the attempt to go down here I

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:21.900
know by the way that we can use our

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:24.120
pills to do damage within a room if you

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:25.680
try to do so not so much with bad trip

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:27.860
because that would be stupid

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.860
Oh

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:36.850
well there goes the Black Card we look

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:41.350
at the effects of black candle

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:43.060
regardless this is the you know that's

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:44.440
what I get for being like hey Maggie's

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:46.500
not so bad you should all give her a

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:52.270
chance it turns out she's actually

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:56.220
extremely annoying stop the thing is I

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:58.630
mean for ya set him up open up shop but

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:59.980
when we get the pill we want to hold bad

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:05.340
trip cuz it's useful for us so it's a

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:08.470
bad habit right now but we should leave

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:10.810
with a good pill or a pill that we want

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:16.630
to take regardless and then come back

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:18.990
for bad trip later quite a lot of money

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:26.500
it's a shame that that stat is worth

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:30.580
borderline zero right now sure we get

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:32.140
able add it to the pile of incredibly

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:39.130
useless familiars that we've managed to

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:41.380
accrue thus far lockup okay you're

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:43.960
starting to speak my language I can make

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:45.880
it out but there's a heavy accent thank

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:47.680
you for trying we're gonna work on our

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:49.830
communication process here and we're

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:52.150
gonna meet in the middle somewhere and

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:54.310
this runs gonna be beautiful yeah it's

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:59.140
so we actually we've now reached a new

00:33:54.310 --> 00:34:00.730
landmark we are worse than we the run

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:03.540
started with at least statistically

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:06.040
obviously in many ways were better but

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:07.810
from a statistical standpoint this run

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:10.360
is actually now the worst it's ever been

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:13.870
that doesn't happen too often so we

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:15.940
might as well relish in it while we try

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:17.750
to catch up so this run can cut the

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:22.840
mustard

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:22.840
please I'm begging you

00:34:23.649 --> 00:34:33.830
questions like just take this we know we

00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:38.230
want that I was working as a pill Lana

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:42.010
curse it run that much is true

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:48.619
Tyrone and all the people at the studio

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:52.550
don't want you to win boohoo don't don't

00:34:48.619 --> 00:34:56.570
you want me me in this context is a

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:57.849
juicy damaged up grade don't don't you

00:34:56.570 --> 00:35:00.859
want me

00:34:57.849 --> 00:35:07.340
shouldn't gun hit on capes too you would

00:35:00.859 --> 00:35:09.560
be free I want this - we got succubus

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:11.270
okay that's like a huge help what if

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:13.960
instead of giving me like every good

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:17.270
familiar in the game you just gave me

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:18.950
some damage so that I could hurt enemies

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:27.109
myself without having to rely on a

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:31.280
little help from my friends what do you

00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:36.050
do when the run goes awry I complain to

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:39.500
my YouTube audience what is the name of

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:41.510
the song that you play I get by with a

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:44.359
little help from my friends

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:48.140
oh I would die if I don't get some

00:35:44.359 --> 00:35:53.720
damage I'm gonna try to acquiesce some

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:56.060
damage acquiesce some damage the cat did

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:58.400
not like that note my dude there's some

00:35:56.060 --> 00:36:01.550
damage if I gotta sing for my supper

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:07.369
I'll sing for my supper here we go we

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:10.790
got a damage upgrade it doesn't even

00:36:07.369 --> 00:36:17.780
have to be mom's knife then it don't

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:20.859
need to be brimstone I need tears or my

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:23.930
run is gonna end

00:36:20.859 --> 00:36:28.160
can I get shears before the run it's the

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:35.060
end magic me here before the run it's

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:37.130
the end before the run hits the end and

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:39.650
there's that's not that bad like the

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:42.140
note is obviously horrible I know I can

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:43.430
I already can't sing but like coming up

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:44.030
with those lyrics right off the top of

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:46.820
the cut

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:49.400
that's not that bad more I've always

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:51.140
been more of a freestyle rapper like

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:53.720
here's one right off the top of the dome

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:56.119
piece you've got to lose yourself in the

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:58.849
moment the music you wanted you better

00:36:56.119 --> 00:37:00.650
never let it go you only get two shots

00:36:58.849 --> 00:37:02.830
do not miss your chance to blow this

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:07.430
opportunity comes once in a lifetime

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:13.180
look at that completely original 100%

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:16.520
original freestyle rap it did reference

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:20.230
lose yourself by Eminem I've cited it

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:20.230
MLA style in my bibliography

00:37:21.849 --> 00:37:31.299
and in my intergalactic planetary so you

00:37:28.719 --> 00:37:32.680
might think like onl is probably like

00:37:31.299 --> 00:37:35.979
he's having a good time on this right

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:36.759
now that he got count of nine tails you

00:37:35.979 --> 00:37:39.849
losing your mind

00:37:36.759 --> 00:37:42.699
obviously I'm not the runs still is like

00:37:39.849 --> 00:37:44.229
really bad we basically got enough

00:37:42.699 --> 00:37:47.410
damage to compensate for the fact that

00:37:44.229 --> 00:37:49.869
we got a enough damage to compensate for

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:51.519
the fact that we gotta tears downgrade

00:37:49.869 --> 00:37:53.559
on the last floor where we're still

00:37:51.519 --> 00:37:56.019
pretty much rolling at a base level mind

00:37:53.559 --> 00:37:57.549
you it's succulence of course kbu

00:37:56.019 --> 00:37:59.890
conception has been like an actual

00:37:57.549 --> 00:38:03.999
all-star it's pretty good investing to

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:07.319
be honest my favorite character from The

00:38:03.999 --> 00:38:11.160
Addams Family you know uncle and fester

00:38:07.319 --> 00:38:11.160
sounds like a tool song

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:21.260
help

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:25.010
please just die before these shots get

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:26.360
to me didn't get the deal dude I know we

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:31.100
got to go down I'm a little cheesed

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:33.200
about it though why don't we try to

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:34.880
accomplish a lot on this run excuse me

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:38.060
I'm the game what do you think you're

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:47.540
trying to do there make progress I don't

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:49.900
think so sir we had two bad trippy's no

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:49.900
Luck's

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:58.690
just trying to you know I hate to do it

00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:00.490
because it's much easier to just waltz

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:02.200
in on a run and just destroy everything

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:04.290
but you know we got to use every

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:06.760
available advantage here unfortunately

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:08.140
makes for a more interesting run I

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:10.060
suppose and the whole scheme of things

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:11.410
because it was kind of like a willy or

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:13.570
won't he's sort of thinking on its of

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:16.030
Ross and Rachel if he was a Ted and

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:19.720
Robin it's a you know every show it's a

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:21.790
Jim and Pam every every show's got its

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:32.920
own variety on this trope including mine

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:33.690
it's a it's an NL Maggie here yeah yeah

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:39.220
that's good

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:41.790
we might as well use the full healthy

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:45.610
also got three lookup greats

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:47.050
Wetteland follower where hurled might as

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:58.000
well keep full health is a slightly more

00:39:47.050 --> 00:40:00.040
flexible pill speed upgrade allows us to

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.410
use full health when we're not at zero

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:05.670
health not that I would ever expect that

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:08.440
to be like too relevant but still I

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:10.300
think we're gonna make it through this

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.770
floor the next floor is gonna be

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:14.710
potentially like a little bit of a

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:17.950
nightmare but I don't know dude weirdly

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:19.960
enough acid baby combined with a pretty

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:22.140
okay pill rotation and all you know

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:24.910
Bob's your uncle

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:27.040
does suck I wish I could just delete all

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:29.320
the familiars I don't like from

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:32.800
existence right here not not a NIH's ik

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:34.930
in general just in this run like all the

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:36.970
rainbow baby has no reason to exist

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:41.610
right now he's just making it so we can

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:41.610
miss with with Incubus

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:51.980
little brim I want him closer to the top

00:40:47.059 --> 00:40:54.829
so that my dude can land shots a little

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:59.780
bit more easily about one more hit you

00:40:54.829 --> 00:41:01.400
should use this hate to do it but it

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.900
also has to be done is that it another

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:05.720
it's a full health I thought it was

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:11.540
another infested it's actually much much

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:13.910
better I'm begging you

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:19.280
like please give me a joker card or some

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:22.069
give me a little bit of hope rebellions

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:24.260
have been built on hope another

00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:27.440
completely original phrase I do have to

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:30.829
cite rogue one I have to cite them in my

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:37.550
sources but I came up with that phrase I

00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:42.530
was influenced by them dude this is what

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:45.220
I'm doing here is dumb or is it because

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:45.220
we have full health

00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:53.270
and we have the cancer trinket so as

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:55.460
long as we don't leave the room we can

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:58.630
get items at least this way I don't

00:41:55.460 --> 00:42:04.580
really want to fight the angel statues

00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:05.420
but Seraphim is like pretty good I know

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:07.340
you're like this guy's gonna

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:08.380
accidentally kill himself that's not my

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:13.220
intention

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:14.060
okay we're gonna pick that up shouldn't

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:16.280
have picked it up you have it could have

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:18.710
useful help I don't want a teleport

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:21.020
however I could be mega Satan on this

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:22.940
run if we get absurdly lucky and the run

00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:27.260
becomes stronger I kinda just hoping for

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:29.180
more items though so I'm thinking like

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:30.440
we could use full health an IV bag to

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:31.760
maybe cheat the system but I don't think

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:33.800
it works like that I think I just got a

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:35.030
you know own up to the fact that I'm

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:37.040
gonna lose these spirit hearts right

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:41.000
what I would like to fight beat the

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:44.440
second angel statue and then pop full

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.880
health I don't think I want a teleport

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:50.030
cuz we'll just go down that way anyway

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:52.460
not have we beaten saving on this we

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:55.580
have so we could teleport but what is

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:58.010
actually maybe we should teleport cuz

00:42:55.580 --> 00:43:00.050
I'm getting any extra items down here by

00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:02.270
teleporting we'll get down to the juicy

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:07.550
red chests and hopefully regular chests

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:09.710
of the chests as quickly as possible and

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:11.060
at the cost of only half of spirit ours

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:12.230
is one of the few times it's actually

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:16.480
been productive to play the

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:16.480
self-sacrifice room nine lives

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:29.710
and a lot of spirit hearts so we've not

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:33.190
done mega Satan fantastic don't pick

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:35.470
that up yet I'm gonna play it by ear

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:37.210
cuz to be honest with you I don't like

00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:38.020
our odds against mega Satan I don't

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:39.670
think it's bad

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:41.740
like I think we do it's either mega

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:44.530
Satan or you know one whole floor full

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:47.380
of jerks both pretty nasty but we have

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:49.360
five luck so I'm thinking that you know

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:55.120
five luck probably allows us to pick up

00:43:49.360 --> 00:44:01.180
some more items so I kind of want to see

00:43:55.120 --> 00:44:02.350
oh Lord oh my god kind of well want to

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:08.140
see what we can get out of it first

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:12.300
there's an item shard of glass maybe all

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:12.300
I need is a shot of glass

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:21.960
I found the secret room for me it's very

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.300
nice of him

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:26.340
this this is why I'm not excited to like

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:28.530
do anything like mega save me on this

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:29.970
run sure it was pretty lucky that like

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:32.910
we were even able to have a chance to

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:34.650
get mega Satan but like you really want

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:36.870
to fight one of the tanky aesthetics in

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:40.530
the game pretty much just using little

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:45.330
brim my answer that question is no but

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:48.750
you know your mileage may vary Celtic

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:52.680
cross it's pretty I was bad it's just

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:55.500
pretty no it's pretty ok you know we

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:56.670
need like if we got bloody lust I'm

00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:00.150
gonna do like a little chefs kiss

00:44:56.670 --> 00:45:03.450
prepare yourself if we got bloody lust I

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:05.910
would be extremely happy I knew that was

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:06.960
question marks actually but I thought

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:08.280
you know we already use question marks

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:14.160
who cares if we use them again

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:21.120
might as well get some value so I might

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:25.800
be a baby and just leave this run after

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:27.300
the fight with the lamb this is where I

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:30.390
find myself confused again it's like can

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:33.090
I fight the lamb and the lamb one now

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:35.210
can I fight the lamb and then leave and

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:37.770
fight mega Satan

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:40.020
this we'll start with the lamb and see

00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:42.210
it feels like something I used to know

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:43.980
but again you know things get they get

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:47.690
popped and purged and you know pushed

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:49.770
back on the mental vector of my memory

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:51.750
why don't we get a range upgrade when we

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:55.370
got hit blood and guts or bloody guts

00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:55.370
shard of glass you get the idea

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:07.960
good pal dude okay

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:09.130
my favorite game show good pill I don't

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:13.270
want to go down that road it could be a

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:14.950
troubling mental story of what I think a

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:16.599
show called good pill would be about it

00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:20.250
would actually just be about sampling

00:46:16.599 --> 00:46:20.250
various pilsners the world over I

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:32.230
shouldn't have stood still there

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:35.349
we got lucky to get more than we

00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:44.920
bargained for dude I love that charmed

00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:49.119
lamb well somehow someway keep coming up

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:52.690
with funky a wins like every single day

00:46:49.119 --> 00:46:56.369
may I took the game engine into gear

00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:59.290
zing every familiar in the game cuz

00:46:56.369 --> 00:47:02.829
eight floors deep and my damage still

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:05.349
boned no I would not like to do a

00:47:02.829 --> 00:47:08.980
victory lap so hopefully that counts it

00:47:05.349 --> 00:47:13.089
does as we just see as we just saw I

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:15.069
should say I always get see and saw

00:47:13.089 --> 00:47:16.180
confused it's like a teeter-totter

00:47:15.069 --> 00:47:26.349
situation

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:29.680
I still want like more items but you got

00:47:26.349 --> 00:47:31.599
a wonder like is it worth it and not I'm

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:33.910
like I'm it's such a serious question in

00:47:31.599 --> 00:47:36.250
my eyes I'm not even gonna do the Missy

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:37.599
Elliott quote about putting her thing

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:39.339
down flipping it and reversing it

00:47:37.599 --> 00:47:40.690
because I I don't support the kind of

00:47:39.339 --> 00:47:44.069
riffraff okay this is a family show

00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:44.069
clean entertainment

00:47:53.790 --> 00:48:08.170
tenten tenten tenten tenten did you do I

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:10.780
don't know if that'll count as a win so

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:14.290
I have to like I'm looking to be honest

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:15.970
with you for Lazarus rags that would

00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:20.800
bring me back to life so I could

00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:22.150
Oh what about nine lives I don't think

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.800
it would work as I think I would die too

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:25.690
quickly like before the animation

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:27.790
finished does he do it to go in the

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:29.740
chest afterwards right but like if he's

00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:33.600
dead can I just walk back into the room

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:33.600
this is a Zayn fest I got a try

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:39.120
you know what they say about saying if

00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:45.120
it works it makes you look like a smart

00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:47.820
aleck it's a One Direction joke is this

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:58.590
how far we've sunk or is this how high

00:48:47.820 --> 00:49:00.720
we've risen I'm begging you for more

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:04.050
items five luck is usually good for more

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:14.010
items down here dude I'm getting ripped

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:16.680
off find a lot of enemies what I want to

00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:17.880
point out not particularly pleasurable

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:22.130
to fight I'm not sure if you guys are

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:22.130
aware of this but the runs not very good

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:30.480
died like and identical times

00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:31.950
this is an ideal room you may not like

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:35.780
it but this is what the performance

00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:43.160
looks like oh my lord

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:43.160
glitter bombs all that for glitter bombs

00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:55.420
I don't really have a game plan I mean

00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:59.860
that's pretty good

00:49:55.420 --> 00:50:00.310
what on earth I used it I used it in

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:04.690
time

00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:07.360
oh Lord uh like I mean that's bad

00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:10.690
obviously but I really don't I'm trying

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:12.160
to think like do we take obviously

00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:14.130
invincibility is pretty good if we could

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:17.320
take that in I'd be happy

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:18.820
do we take in Plan C I could roast them

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:23.710
pretty easily we have nine lives which

00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:25.600
could bring us back but would we live

00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:27.520
through wood under we can't take both

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:31.360
items in so you can't like make

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:34.020
ourselves invincible during Plan C nice

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:34.020
try though

00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:45.070
so the other thing is that glitter bombs

00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:50.470
could keep us alive if we get a bunch of

00:50:45.070 --> 00:50:58.230
red hard payouts well I suppose we gotta

00:50:50.470 --> 00:51:02.500
try what is life but one big try right

00:50:58.230 --> 00:51:03.850
I'm already doing the post I don't think

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:10.150
we can take it I don't think we can take

00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:14.710
it yet fantastic we could get battery

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:17.440
charges out of glitter bombs so I think

00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:19.570
we should use book of sin

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:21.610
sorry Book of Shadows as soon as it's

00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:23.980
available and and productive like it's

00:51:21.610 --> 00:51:32.800
not very productive right here so

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:34.540
productive the idea is we could get

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:37.720
battery charges so any period of

00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:38.530
invincibility is positive we could also

00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:42.130
get nothing

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:44.020
that's the other alternative seems to be

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:48.420
happening quite a lot despite the fact

00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:48.420
that up until recently we had 6 lakh

00:51:50.459 --> 00:51:55.479
now it's not a throw thank you for the

00:51:53.229 --> 00:51:58.319
red heart every red heart is worth two

00:51:55.479 --> 00:51:58.319
hits at this point of the game

00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:14.589
please more HP please the spirit heart

00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:17.049
my Savior all right no battery charges

00:52:14.589 --> 00:52:20.109
yet I'm going to feel real silly if you

00:52:17.049 --> 00:52:21.849
can't get a battery charge from glitter

00:52:20.109 --> 00:52:24.819
bombs but we won't know that until after

00:52:21.849 --> 00:52:29.230
the fight to begin with so just keep

00:52:24.819 --> 00:52:31.630
tossing these in there dude it's a

00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:33.130
useful card our damage is doubled our

00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:36.220
stats are good for the first time in

00:52:33.130 --> 00:52:40.680
this entire run I've tasted greatness

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:43.450
I've drank from the fountain of victory

00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:45.400
hey have you ever had an Isaac run where

00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:49.690
the Empress card was the best item you

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:55.750
got the whole time cuz I have I'm living

00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:57.960
that life right now that was not very

00:52:55.750 --> 00:53:00.599
smart of me

00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:08.480
another bomb hey dude a bomb is a free

00:53:00.599 --> 00:53:12.319
play I'm starting to believe

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:15.000
give me the angel statue see if I care

00:53:12.319 --> 00:53:17.789
spoilers I do because I'm very anxious

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:21.450
about losing here that's a full health

00:53:17.789 --> 00:53:23.549
pill we win it's a range upgrade can at

00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:28.349
least poison this dude we've completely

00:53:23.549 --> 00:53:32.039
failed on our use of that half a red

00:53:28.349 --> 00:53:35.190
heart that's an extra hit last pill or

00:53:32.039 --> 00:53:37.400
last bomb gave us nothing it's all right

00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:37.400
dude

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:42.250
get well and truly dusted sir we still

00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:43.300
have the ability to get hit six times

00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:46.710
excuse me

00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:50.350
and what planet are you still attacking

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:51.940
summoning enemies leave could also give

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:53.650
us some more HP not saying we should

00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:57.100
bank on it just saying there's a chance

00:53:53.650 --> 00:53:59.740
there is no planet in all of the

00:53:57.100 --> 00:54:03.100
multiverses in which we should complete

00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:06.100
the lam and manga Satan in the same run

00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:09.340
on this god-awful Maggie run Thank You

00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:12.310
acid baby and the greatest pill rotation

00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:15.400
for refusing to let me to die thank you

00:54:12.310 --> 00:54:17.430
self-sacrifice room for absurdly being

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:19.420
the right place strategically speaking

00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:22.060
despite the fact that has literally

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:22.570
never happened to anybody else in human

00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:25.240
history

00:54:22.570 --> 00:54:27.490
the sum total of mankind's existence on

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:29.620
this blue marble adrift in the Milky Way

00:54:27.490 --> 00:54:31.120
galaxy Thank You Empress card for

00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:32.380
keeping me from completely losing my

00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:35.470
mind and allowing me to hold on to a

00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:37.510
shred of humanity Maggie's faith and red

00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:38.380
