00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.350
hey everybody welcome back to another

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:09.240
land place binding of issac after birth

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.550
plus we lost is the keeper that's fine

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.759
dude I'm fine

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.490
what is the Isaac play-

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.539
plus mega satan mm-hmm you know what

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.520
it's been a little while since he played

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.480
his Isaac I mean it's been a little

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.289
while since we played his most

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.150
characters th le VBR one and we're like

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.309
v ba that's not a one also that's a

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.630
seven my brain does work I assure you

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:35.040
even though I just took damage on a room

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.739
that I shouldn't have taken damage on my

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.480
brain still works there's still great

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.620
matter pulsing around in those neurons

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.300
that's not how it works just due to a

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.789
electrochemical gradient the action

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.379
potential and the synaptic release of

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.570
neurotransmitters I understand that's a

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.100
reroll and a half hey what do you think

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:04.140
this is like a would you rather question

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:10.650
is BFF which is actually BB F is that

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.369
take about one of these days um well

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.270
that's pretty good

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.979
I think it's take about but I also think

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.210
there's a case to be made for not taking

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.890
you know rather we should we should talk

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.009
about that in the inverted case I think

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.960
I think that despite a lot of people not

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.270
really liking it I think it's not bad

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.500
we don't need invincibility to make it

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.600
work although it does help and the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.670
damage output is really useful but maybe

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.140
it's more of a like an edge case you

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.990
know it's a situation in which if your

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.450
damage is garbage like if we had a

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.860
really bad like 2.6 damage Eden run or

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.229
something we'd be all over that but as

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.579
Isaac we expect to get DPS we're gonna

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.409
see if we get some right here we don't

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.170
but that item is worth taking magics cab

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.759
is totally solid in its own right we're

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.439
definitely not gonna get another reroll

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.240
but we also don't gain anything really

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.430
by taking a battery charge down to the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.259
next floor we got the quarter instead I

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.360
think that is an improvement

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.899
you could go quarter coupon but I don't

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.869
think that's the right play moving box I

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.900
just do not like

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.180
think you pick up a 3-cent card and

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:19.580
that's not bad we can we can get value

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:22.670
out of that we put a bomb down you know

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.310
what we're gonna buy pay to play and

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.989
we're gonna test this pill yes not

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.540
horrible the reason we bought pay to

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.910
play normally considered maybe a greed

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.470
mode item it saves us money that we

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.510
probably would have spent on keys on the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.090
next floor leaves us our keys to open

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.049
golden chests etc etc we could even go a

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.079
little deeper here although I don't

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.670
necessarily want to given that we have

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.840
an okay chance of getting a blood bank

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.959
on the next floor so yeah we're gonna

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.310
hold up 15 cents is where we want to be

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.180
we don't want to put any more money into

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.650
it and then not be able to buy the items

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.329
that we eventually rear old into I think

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.579
we're in a very good spot of course deal

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.680
with the devil I'd love to secure that

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:04.120
if possible we've got a shop right off

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.120
the bat or some kind of a special room

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.500
Book Of Shadows is actually like pretty

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.000
great Book of Revelations was well worth

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.549
it though so this will also secure us a

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.260
cube of meats or ball of bandages but

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.410
let's be honest Cuba meatball bandages

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.959
same thing more or less this room might

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.420
as well just contained bookworm which is

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.940
a transformation that I think I grossly

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.670
over a but still the occasional extra

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.060
shot is not anything to sneeze that

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.440
either way we're moving along here

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.010
looking pretty good and I love the Isaac

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.090
runs dude it just feels natural you know

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.919
it's like traveling to another country

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.519
you've been there for a little while

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:45.139
you're sick even sukiyaki

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.099
boiled cockroach pupa you're like you

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.780
know what I could just go for a

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.630
hamburger you saunter up to the TGI

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.579
Fridays it's an $18 burger it's not very

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.380
good but it feels like home that's a

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:57.650
really terrible analogy cuz Isaac runs

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.870
tend to be pretty good say better better

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.639
than an $18 TGI Fridays burger no

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.130
offense intended if you're a shareholder

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:05.870
in the TGI Fridays corporation I've told

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.209
this story on the NSS before but did you

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:14.389
know that TGI Fridays it's like the

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:17.659
ultimate beta story it was founded years

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:19.190
ago by a dude who was like there's

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:22.639
nowhere to meet girls what does he

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:26.419
invent TGI Fridays I don't know how

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:28.069
in the 1950s somehow that made sense it

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.560
certainly doesn't make sense now I mean

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:32.060
I'm not gonna say that if you suggested

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.360
that you take your date to TGI Fridays

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:38.389
she would you know rebuke you sometimes

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.889
you want the unlimited appease right is

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.719
that what they do is that it's either

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:45.110
that or that might be Chili's I can't

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:46.819
remember however probably I wouldn't

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.319
suggest it as on a first date unless

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:54.439
it's like the nicest restaurant in your

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:57.289
town we're gonna take we're gonna go

00:04:54.439 --> 00:05:00.039
deep on this one if we respawn as Judas

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:02.539
we'll figure it out like we might

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:04.719
obviously already have some of the stuff

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:07.400
that we're gonna do unlocked is Judas so

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:10.099
it might be for the best to just not do

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.469
it but I'm gonna stick with this for now

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:13.819
because it's the right thing to do

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:15.860
we've also kind of like Trojan horsed

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:18.439
our way into having a Judas run that is

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.210
like already really strong like we

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:24.169
skipped the portion of the Judas run

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.699
where it's like oh we could die I guess

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.289
we should really talk about Judas and

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:28.969
dark Judas as two separate characters

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.620
but for the purposes of the post-it note

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:32.719
they're the same is what I'm trying to

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:37.009
get at there I'll take the pill pretty

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:39.620
fly plenty of battery charges if we can

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:41.810
somehow get the ability to fly and the

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.240
gift which is also not very good

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.909
unfortunately and I'm not talking about

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.659
the gift starring Katie Holmes although

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:51.589
that movie is also not very good

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:55.779
referenced in the much better film

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:58.909
Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle

00:05:55.779 --> 00:06:00.169
we're gonna grab the battery charges as

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:01.159
a result of this high glossary and it

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.680
really were just looking for something

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:05.449
better than Ouija board which is okay I

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.099
don't mean the slander the Ouija board

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:08.659
is if it's I mean it's not Ouija board

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:13.009
also because that's copy written by the

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:15.050
Hasbro corporation it's what do they

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:16.909
call it if like a spirit board in that

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:21.289
until Don yeah the spirit board that's

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:22.789
it it's not that bad a lot of items

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:24.129
accomplish the same thing and what it

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:26.839
accomplishes to begin with is not

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:28.490
transformative so for right now I'm not

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:29.779
too concerned about it but 20 cents we

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.320
should come back down here and check out

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:35.850
this jar of flies again huh

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.440
tell you what I'm gonna pop like five

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.870
cents into this bad boy see if you get a

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.040
luck upgrade we didn't we could have

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.450
bought another battery charge with the

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.790
money I think we just continued to save

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:47.040
money though because I mean we win by

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:49.440
saving money because later we can put it

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.140
in a high-yield index fund generate

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.820
seven percent returns annually start to

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:57.030
hit that financial escape velocity there

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:59.430
we go pyromaniac more along the lines of

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.290
what we're looking for immunity to

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.490
explosions thereby making its bill you

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.440
know a little silly that I didn't take

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.300
be a BBF on an earlier floor however

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.550
despite this it doesn't matter too too

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.840
much because we got the quarter out of

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.160
that anyway which kind of kick-started

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.000
this whole thing over here and by that I

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.500
mean whoa

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.160
yeah kickstart my heart no I never stop

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:21.570
whoa yeah baby

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.370
there's a part of that song that is

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:26.580
always stuck with me as needing a

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:28.500
further explanation cuz kickstart my

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.600
heart it's kind of like it's not a love

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.160
song it's like a it's an intercourse

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.650
song and that's alright there's a lot of

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.990
those in rock music right that's like

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:38.460
half of it November rain intercourse

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.140
song most people don't know that I would

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.600
do anything for love but I won't do that

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:45.900
anal intercourse song most people do

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.340
know that I want it that way one of my

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.580
favorite rock and roll tracks of all

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.580
time

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:56.580
they say oh yeah you know they'd start

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:59.550
the song it's quite vulgar when I get

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.660
high I get high on speed something lit

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.640
up like a Christmas tree

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:04.920
oh yeah kickstart kickstart my heart

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:07.080
right then later in the middle of the

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:11.790
Sun they go when we started this band

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:14.340
all we needed needed was a laugh years

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:17.460
gone by I'd say we kick someone they say

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:20.180
they were dying to say but when I'm on

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:23.220
when I'm in a rage or hidden the stage

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:25.170
adrenaline pumping through my veins it

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:28.110
wasn't really Ryan but that's okay well

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:30.570
I'd say we're still kicking a kicking

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:33.510
butt as the song wasn't about that it

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:35.550
was about I thought well maybe it is

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:38.790
about that or no I just don't respect

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:41.370
the when you you in bands write songs

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:43.860
about how good the band is like that's

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.889
leave that to hip hop hip hop is

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.179
self-aggrandizing

00:08:44.889 --> 00:08:50.589
a lot of the time rock-and-roll music

00:08:46.179 --> 00:08:53.799
it's a it's a bit different maybe I am

00:08:50.589 --> 00:08:56.049
NOT trying to insult Motley Crue I'm

00:08:53.799 --> 00:09:01.319
pretty sure that Tommy Lee actually

00:08:56.049 --> 00:09:01.319
physically ages like one month every 12

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:07.239
you Earthlings call it a year I believe

00:09:04.109 --> 00:09:11.980
Vince Neal ages the other collection for

00:09:07.239 --> 00:09:13.449
him that's not nice okay he was on The

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.910
Surreal Life and what have I done with

00:09:13.449 --> 00:09:20.079
my surreal life my so-called surreal

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:22.540
life stop taking dumb damage here you

00:09:20.079 --> 00:09:23.889
gotta hold it together we play it like

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.029
an idiot because you got this reroll you

00:09:23.889 --> 00:09:26.829
should've been using this reroll 12

00:09:25.029 --> 00:09:28.389
years ago even if we do have a deal with

00:09:26.829 --> 00:09:29.679
the devil chance but that being said I'm

00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:31.839
gonna keep moving forward guys now we've

00:09:29.679 --> 00:09:36.939
come too far we should go for the deal

00:09:31.839 --> 00:09:39.160
with the devil first excuse me sir okay

00:09:36.939 --> 00:09:42.879
we got nine bombs that we heal from the

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:44.379
bombs our damage is not that good but it

00:09:42.879 --> 00:09:50.319
can get better in the future so just

00:09:44.379 --> 00:09:52.149
hold it together here at least unlike

00:09:50.319 --> 00:09:56.799
the rap music in rock and roll they're

00:09:52.149 --> 00:09:59.919
actually singing rap music is just

00:09:56.799 --> 00:10:03.399
talking I don't understand it you have

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:05.319
to try the chevre by the way have you

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:08.889
heard the new Kenny G CD okay I'm

00:10:05.319 --> 00:10:11.350
insulting my people here tears upgrade

00:10:08.889 --> 00:10:13.089
spirit hearts I like it I'll take this

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:14.619
damage upgrade don't get too attached to

00:10:13.089 --> 00:10:16.419
the spirit arts we add for your shot

00:10:14.619 --> 00:10:18.100
occasionally good occasionally horrible

00:10:16.419 --> 00:10:19.769
hopefully it's gonna be more on the side

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:22.720
of good here

00:10:19.769 --> 00:10:24.519
puberty continues to erroneously tell

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:30.100
you it's a bad pill and it's actually at

00:10:24.519 --> 00:10:32.139
the very worst situationally good and we

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:34.419
are gonna continue to check out our shop

00:10:32.139 --> 00:10:36.730
here that is yet to be amazing for us

00:10:34.419 --> 00:10:38.319
I'll take it I kind of don't want to

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.879
because it ruins our chance at an arcade

00:10:38.319 --> 00:10:41.589
but it's not like we're playing the

00:10:39.879 --> 00:10:45.539
arcade in all likelihood anyway I mean

00:10:41.589 --> 00:10:45.539
look at the HP that we have right now

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:53.220
not gonna be anybody's favorite item to

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:54.930
grab I think boom but it is what it is

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.320
what I'm hoping to do is maybe now that

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.880
I boom pick up a second secret room

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:03.810
second secret room gives us HP or you

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:05.520
know some stats upgrades hematemesis is

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:07.860
fine I mean if one pretty fly is good

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.240
one health upgrade is good absolutely

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:11.279
don't get in a pretty fly in a health

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:14.130
upgrade not directly as a result of boom

00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:18.620
but I feel like I was more open to using

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:22.020
my bombs as a result of it so anyway

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:23.250
we're gonna move along here right on

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.480
pace for BA stretch but we're not

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:27.870
looking for boss rush we're looking for

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:33.240
negative mega Satan surprisingly strange

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:35.910
sentence to say negative mega Satan mega

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:38.100
Satan is gonna be probably not plausible

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:38.670
and that's okay we know that one day

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.980
it'll happen

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:43.860
dad's key does exist now although again

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:45.149
we're going to the lam floor so we we

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:49.589
won't have a chest down there unless we

00:11:45.149 --> 00:11:51.300
get really lucky but we can at least

00:11:49.589 --> 00:11:54.510
knock out something here I believe if

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:58.649
you if you beat them we have no money if

00:11:54.510 --> 00:12:00.149
you beat the lam you get an item I'm

00:11:58.649 --> 00:12:04.050
trying to remind myself this if you beat

00:12:00.149 --> 00:12:06.660
greedy or you just get trinkets and then

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:08.940
if you beat like boss rush as new

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:11.430
characters you get co-op babies which is

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:14.490
just like you know you needed for the

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:15.839
completion but also who cares most of

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:17.790
the time I mean I I would almost

00:12:15.839 --> 00:12:18.990
guarantee this there might be one of you

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.880
out there watching this video that's

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.570
played more Isaac co-opted me and I

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.720
don't care

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:27.029
I've played hundreds of hours of after

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.560
birth anti birth rebirth co-op and

00:12:27.029 --> 00:12:31.050
whenever I unlock a new co-op baby I'm

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:34.410
just like yeah maybe I'll see it one day

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:35.970
probably not not that the smarts a good

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.790
effort of the people at the niccola's

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:40.230
game development company I'm just saying

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:43.920
the items are what it's all about here

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:44.910
razor blade it's a good item always

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.970
forget that it comes with a statistical

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:49.710
improvement here which is very positive

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:52.590
for us

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:54.600
as our dps is good don't get me wrong

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.950
but not as good as I'd like it to be

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.140
long term you know this would be a

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:59.910
really good floor to maybe beat the odds

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:06.570
snag a deal with the devil

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:08.580
Bob's your uncle nothing there

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:11.310
all right that feels like a second

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:13.110
secret room feel like secret ran out

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:14.310
this feels like making love by bad

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:16.200
company incest

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:18.170
you've heard of them bad company I

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:25.470
didn't realize we were talking about

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:26.970
Electronic Arts I own well probably

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:32.730
should not have played you but also

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:39.930
could not resist extended stat effects

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:41.960
time perhaps to pick up perchance to

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.960
dream

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:45.030
look I'm still not done with this motley

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:49.910
crue thing I'm just trying to choose how

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:51.750
to approach it I'm also trying to

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:55.250
internalize the fact that I can actually

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:58.380
just walk into these bombs you know what

00:13:55.250 --> 00:14:01.430
do we have to I don't know why so

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:07.920
they're like a whiny kid do we have to

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:12.030
do we have to ever do the teleportation

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:15.650
on the spike trap room

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:15.650
the self-sacrifice room if you will I

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:21.300
thought that there was a non locket a CH

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.130
to that but I might be mistaken

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.540
certainly for dailies were probably

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:29.220
gonna want to use it I just remembered

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:31.830
oh my god we have like at least 30 daily

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:34.230
still coming we need to do 30 in a row

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:36.000
or wait you have to do 30 total and win

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:38.250
five in a row so we can accomplish those

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.970
at the same time that's no that's no

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:43.230
serious challenge but it is gonna be

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.570
time-consuming but I think we're

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:47.490
marching pretty close to getting our

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.870
full series of unlocks here and it's

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:50.280
actually been really nice I was

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:52.020
skeptical that it would be as much fun

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:54.870
as it is but I'm going on this journey

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:56.580
of kind of you know rediscovering when

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:58.530
items are unlocked and you know having

00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:00.120
runs that are a little bit different

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:01.350
because not all of the ultra powerful

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.470
items are unlocked from the get-go

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:07.500
although many of them of course are it's

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:10.080
been a trip dude I've had a good time

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:11.460
doing so not all the runs have been ten

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.380
out of ten but we've had some pseudo

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:15.780
streaks we've had some decent stuff

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:21.030
we've had the combination pseudo streaks

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:22.410
and decent stuff I can't be taking

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:24.900
damage like that on a regular basis

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:26.160
Joker please that's not Joker battery

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:32.700
charge is very good though we're on

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:34.350
necropolis 1 yeah dang Depp's 1 which

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:36.449
means

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:39.029
if we could make boss rush I would like

00:15:36.449 --> 00:15:40.860
to I I will like I'd be lying if I had

00:15:39.029 --> 00:15:43.170
said that I was not looking forward oh

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:45.120
that's these are terrible I if I said I

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:47.550
was not looking forward to being fully

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:49.079
unlocked let's do it look at that

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:50.339
and the reason I'm looking forward to it

00:15:49.079 --> 00:15:52.470
is not because like it's a sense of

00:15:50.339 --> 00:15:54.720
accomplishment necessarily but more so

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:56.250
so that I can do whatever I want on

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.050
every run but we have to earn that I

00:15:56.250 --> 00:16:02.790
think it's better to earn it all over

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:04.079
again much much better not that we were

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:05.519
in any danger of taking the beam to

00:16:04.079 --> 00:16:10.470
begin with unless I you know tripped and

00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:12.240
fell on my keyboard but we like it

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.560
normally in this situation we would be

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.480
about four floors ahead of where we

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.250
actually are and maybe having a bit of a

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.870
different time because we would you know

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:20.670
have killed ourselves to respond as dark

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:22.800
Judas our damage would be 15 right now

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:24.569
instead of seven we might be a little

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:27.690
bit lower on HP but maybe not you know I

00:16:24.569 --> 00:16:28.949
think we're still we've taken some dumb

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:32.399
damage that we probably would not have

00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:34.170
taken if we were if we were doing more

00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:38.130
damage mostly because I'm impatient not

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:40.440
because the run is bad patience by Guns

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:42.269
N'Roses that song specifically about

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:45.870
manual intercourse which is a really

00:16:42.269 --> 00:16:47.910
fancy name for an HJ and if I keep using

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:49.560
coded language like that there is no way

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:50.880
the machine learning algorithm is ever

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:56.650
gonna figure out this video should be

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:58.790
demonetised let's go

00:16:56.650 --> 00:17:00.920
that's the that's the secret I think

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:02.810
maybe that's why I've been a little bit

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.780
more resistant to the D monetization

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:08.000
thing that other people knock on wood I

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:09.920
speak in metaphors and microcosms and

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.579
allegories and oftentimes

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:15.079
Algor isms as a result it's hard you

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:17.420
know you remember that scene in Austin

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:19.459
Powers one of course you do

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:22.430
why am I even asking where Austin finds

00:17:19.459 --> 00:17:24.620
the Fembots or they find him rather they

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:26.510
ambush him and they you can't resist as

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:29.330
you can resist us mr. powers and he goes

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:31.280
all contraire baby I'll think you're the

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:32.960
ones who can't resist me and he dances

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:35.720
so well and he gives them a little cross

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:38.480
moja nation and then all their heads

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:42.010
explode and then Liz Hurley goes alright

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:42.010
Austin I believe you

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.970
it's like that like the algorithm tries

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:48.650
to come in here and it goes well does

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:51.620
anybody think that Renee the cart is

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:53.480
very much like the disturbed David

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:55.100
Draiman of his era and then it goes I

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.690
have no idea to parse this metaphor

00:17:55.100 --> 00:18:02.420
because it's inherently nonsensical to

00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:04.160
begin with that should have been damaged

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:06.650
I shouldn't call him David Draiman cuz

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:10.300
he always tweets in all caps I should

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:10.300
always say disturbs David Draiman

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:16.220
shouldn't have shouted that into the

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:19.180
microphone I apologize but it made a

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.180
good point I thought

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.440
houses shouldn't make fun of somebody

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.720
for talking in all caps I do it in Skype

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.280
all the time to make a humorous point

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.840
and everybody laughs when they say

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.970
northernlion you're so funny

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.290
and we're so lucky to know you and I say

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:36.360
you do you guys didn't have to say that

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:38.370
but it is appreciated if it was like the

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:41.640
unspoken truth I really thanks a lot you

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:45.420
didn't have to say that though dude

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:51.600
allow me please to acquiesce the again

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:53.340
with a so funny bits to find the room

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:57.570
that contains the boss please because

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:59.040
this is getting a little ridiculous I'm

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.900
happy to have the bombs because we got

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.580
the HP required to make the bombs work

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.990
for us this is actually like there's

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.760
there's a game playing for us that works

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:10.230
really well for winning here and it's

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:12.120
pretty simple get a deal with the devil

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:14.190
that gives us lump of coal or at least

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.210
it doesn't matter what it gives us if he

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:17.310
gives us Krampus that said we could

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:19.500
reroll it into something even better we

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:21.390
get essentially a DPS upgrade without

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:23.190
having to trade any HP we use our HP

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:25.140
with our you know plethora of bombs to

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:27.030
make it easy for us to survive the

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:28.710
harder sections of the game more HP the

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:31.500
merrier at this point but and as a

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:33.000
result like we're set if we don't get a

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.590
deal with the devil we will reroll Gish

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.730
it's like the easiest flowchart ever

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:40.400
designed here little Gish is fine but

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:42.570
not good enough to get excited about

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.910
almost anything else would be better

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:46.860
right now even pageant boy shot speed

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:49.380
plus card could be better in the form of

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:52.590
magic 8-ball just has to be a good card

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:55.170
you know little Gish is worth about 8

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:59.160
cents as far as I'm concerned we did get

00:19:55.170 --> 00:20:03.170
the deal ok phase one of the plan pretty

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:03.170
much working out as intended right now

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:15.480
what are what the best song about being

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:17.040
in a band is in the garage by Weezer is

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:20.240
pretty good there we go deaths touch

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.240
I'll admit that

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:33.120
formed a band by Boston an American band

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:34.710
by Grand Funk Railroad this is a

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.300
question it's rattling me because I

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:40.860
should have a better answer what about

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:42.330
um the city by journey that's kind of a

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.740
song about being in a band less about

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:46.110
glorifying it it probably shouldn't have

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:47.790
even taken that bit less about

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:49.260
glorifying it more about you know the

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:55.430
forlorn sense of being on the road all

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:58.710
the time it's an interesting question an

00:20:55.430 --> 00:21:03.180
arbitrary and interesting question ie my

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:05.220
brand's I'm spoiled and Isak dude I'm

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:08.840
looking at this and I'm like why am i

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:11.970
dealing so little damage but I'm not I

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:15.450
got any damage a trait of fire it's not

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:20.040
terrible it's just less than I would

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:23.910
like it to be that would have found the

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:25.590
secret room 100% odds I actually think

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:27.210
that we could still make it to the mom

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:28.560
fight well I mean obviously we're gonna

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:30.150
make it to the mom fight but I I still

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.940
think we can make it to boss rush in

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:34.680
time we're gonna need a little bit of

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:38.880
luck on our side like we need to not

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:41.100
encounter really really nasty rooms and

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.240
we need to find it pretty quick and you

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.410
might be saying NL you're skipping the

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:46.770
item room you're skipping the shop we

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:47.820
got no money for the shop and we are

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:50.310
skipping the item room

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:52.800
the idea is boss rush is kind of like

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:54.450
its own little item room and by little I

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.120
mean four times larger than the average

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:59.310
item room in terms of number of choices

00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:01.020
and if it doesn't give us anything good

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:02.670
then so be a week we get a reroll we'll

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.950
see what it is the thing is it's very

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:09.770
much we get it all or nothing at all

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:13.830
like an o-town song we need the negative

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:16.260
we either wants an item so good it's

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:17.429
worth doing boss rush which it does not

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.340
exist here although there's some good

00:22:17.429 --> 00:22:22.539
stuff

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:24.460
or to suddenly teleports us but I mean

00:22:22.539 --> 00:22:25.330
mom's wig is pretty good but yeah in the

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.070
end it was probably a little

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:37.539
short-sighted to come down here but life

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:40.090
goes on you think with the rise of milf

00:22:37.539 --> 00:22:42.549
culture John Cougar Mellencamp resents

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:44.260
his nickname it was like in the 80s I

00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:46.840
bet that was real fierce but now it

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:53.740
makes him sound like a horny middle-aged

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:55.240
single what she might be like I'm not

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:58.360
gonna tell him he can't be a me Who am I

00:22:55.240 --> 00:23:04.419
right I've never had a song go to number

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:06.130
one on the Billboard Hot 200 probably

00:23:04.419 --> 00:23:07.659
not yet anyway I'm working on it though

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:09.940
like like a lot of streamers I'm

00:23:07.659 --> 00:23:13.090
planning on launching my side' career as

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:15.039
a DJ this year I think I'm really I'm

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:19.049
putting up some hot mixes and they're

00:23:15.039 --> 00:23:19.049
gaining traction to be honest with you

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:23.649
that's not to look down on anybody

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:25.179
else's hobbies I mean of course be a

00:23:23.649 --> 00:23:27.909
little bit like pot calling the kettle

00:23:25.179 --> 00:23:34.210
black considering how often I'm like

00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:36.700
yeah Dae Ray's started one javascript

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:40.059
only has seven possible data types in it

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:41.830
I mean what were they thinking me for a

00:23:40.059 --> 00:23:43.960
dynamically typed language it's not that

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:47.980
bad but it'll never touch the statically

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:50.159
typed C++ compiler you get the idea cuz

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:51.640
it's just insufferable you know a

00:23:50.159 --> 00:23:57.370
hobbies a hobby

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:59.289
I mean if Hodor can deejay anybody can

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:02.760
be Jay I mean Hodor doesn't deejay the

00:23:59.289 --> 00:24:05.020
actor who plays Hodor deejays and

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:06.669
honestly dude more power to you because

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.539
there's also like I forgot we had the

00:24:06.669 --> 00:24:10.240
wafer by the way which is really

00:24:07.539 --> 00:24:12.010
carrying us but there's the actor on

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:16.179
Game of Thrones who played Hodor he

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:17.679
leverages is Hodor fame to DJ and at

00:24:16.179 --> 00:24:19.330
first you know when I was younger I was

00:24:17.679 --> 00:24:20.890
like I wonder if he deejays and he goes

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:22.450
uh half these people are only here

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:24.970
because I played Hodor and this like

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:28.210
novel now I'm like Dawg keep that hustle

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:30.309
up well done same with the actor who

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:32.290
plays hot pie hot pie opened his own

00:24:30.309 --> 00:24:35.890
bakery making like

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:38.620
direwolf shaped cookies and apparently

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:40.480
is doing quite well at first my initial

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:42.040
reaction is uh wonder if he thinks that

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:44.140
like he's not actually that good of a

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.070
baker and then you know people are just

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.300
coming because of the whole game of

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:49.890
thrones collection after that I was like

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:53.710
dude flaunt it if you got it absolutely

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:56.670
you think if I wrote a book which I'm

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:58.990
likely you think if I wrote a book and

00:24:56.670 --> 00:25:01.870
it came out I'd be like I'm not gonna

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:03.610
promote it because I worried people

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:06.220
would only buy the book because of you

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:08.800
know their connection to me they like

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:10.330
listening my voice I'd rather they just

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:13.570
found it on the bookstore shelves and

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:15.880
arbitrarily chose to pick it up hell no

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:18.460
dude I'd be on Twitter buy my book every

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:21.040
day it's a heartwarming coming-of-age

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:23.020
tale about a young woman living in the

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:28.420
rural United States who meets a vampire

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:31.870
named Ned on an open field now I'm not

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:34.630
gonna go there okay grab this grab this

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:36.580
we don't need that so we'll reroll it I

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:37.300
don't even we have the negative so we

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.650
don't even care that much about

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.270
permanent polaroid invincibility it's

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:45.430
all about just grabbing stats at this

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:47.950
point we might do the hush fight but I

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:50.080
mean as good as the run is and as and

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:52.420
besides the fact that we have keys kind

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:54.130
of don't want to sack any HP because

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.940
it's just it's not relevant right here

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:57.730
we already have

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:59.850
hush taken care of on Isaac and the run

00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:02.230
is not so good that it's like a

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:03.340
guaranteed walk in the park like it

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:07.360
could be the start of a chain of

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:08.620
terrible events either way this one's

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.090
it's coming through in the clutch

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.230
normally I wouldn't pick up that bomb

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:16.740
because we have too many but we're at

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:23.560
the magic number now so 69 the magic

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:25.150
number lived by the sea also a great men

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:28.800
at work song not Puff the Magic Dragon

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:28.800
talking about down by the sea

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:39.570
not to be confused with yes down by the

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:41.930
riverside as sung by Rafi I have a

00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:48.090
question for the churchgoers amongst you

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:49.920
do you have all the songs memorized cuz

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:52.440
I think I've told this before but it's

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:54.390
it's Korean Thanksgiving this week

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:56.280
aka Chuseok I'll call it you suck but

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:57.570
you know like 10 percent of people

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.590
watching this would know what that is so

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:02.180
I'm gonna call it Korean Thanksgiving

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:04.290
the same way we call you know kimbap

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:05.880
Korean sandwich even though it doesn't

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:07.500
make any dang sense but that's another

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.910
story for another day I'm always

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.260
reminded of a couple years ago when

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:11.790
Kate's parents invited me over for

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:14.250
Thanksgiving I have a good relationship

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:16.020
with Kate's family it's not like a you

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:17.880
know guess who's coming to dinner sort

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:20.460
of situation starring Ashton Kutcher and

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:24.810
Bernie Mac it's a completely you know

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:26.070
it's a amiable we have rapport is what

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.150
I'm trying to say and the more I say it

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:31.260
the more it sounds like we don't but

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:32.790
that's not the case but you know they

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.110
they they have different cultural

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:36.750
practices and religious practices and

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:38.100
I'm familiar with they started you know

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:40.200
they're like they turn the Bible to page

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:41.520
blank we're gonna sing this song I was

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.650
like I don't know what here's what I

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:45.170
know Amazing Grace doesn't really seem

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:47.550
necessarily like an appropriate

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:51.060
thanksgiving song but what do I know

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:58.170
and I know swing low Sweet Chariot and I

00:27:51.060 --> 00:28:00.210
know Michael row the boat ashore is that

00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:02.070
it is that a religious song they ever

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:04.730
sing Michael row the boat ashore in the

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:06.750
in church those are the only ones dude

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:08.370
well I mean then then like every

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:12.840
Christmas song as well which is old

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:14.520
another can't worms I suppose but do you

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.230
have a memorized if you go enough are

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:19.020
you just like oh I really hope they make

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:21.600
us sing swing low Sweet Chariot this

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:24.450
week I'm still just gonna go down to

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:27.900
Sheol I can understand that there were

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:30.870
songs I liked more than others we used

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:32.790
to have multiple Canadian national

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:34.950
anthems and I've told this before as

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:36.180
well but people go they tend to think

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:38.220
it's weird but we had to listen to the

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:40.740
national anthem before our classes which

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:43.220
was totally normal to me until people's

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:46.559
did saying like we don't have to do that

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:49.230
not to you know in Royal myself in the

00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:51.300
recent flag controversy but anyway the

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:53.880
point is used to listen the national

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:55.050
anthem every day before class which I

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:57.600
really thought was just to give the

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:59.309
teachers a break in hindsight but we had

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:01.110
like eight versions of national anthem

00:28:59.309 --> 00:29:08.640
there was the standard like you know

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:09.870
recorded in probably like 1955 oh and

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:12.120
then there was one recorded by a

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:16.530
Canadian acapella group called the

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:19.110
nylons it was like dude dude dude do pop

00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:21.120
up up it had a lot of flair right and

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:22.320
they like the one guy in the in the

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:25.740
foreground with the melodies going like

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:28.350
Oh Canada and in the background everyone

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:29.820
else is going bump bump bump bump up and

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:31.080
now for awhile I was like that's the

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.490
best then they played it for eight

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:36.030
months straight and I was like this is

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:37.320
poison then we had country music Oh

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:39.030
Canada for a while I don't know way I

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:42.179
just I think sometimes about the fact

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:45.120
that there's a there's a company out

00:29:42.179 --> 00:29:46.620
there that's like licensing different

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.380
versions of Oh Canada the schools

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:52.320
because they have to hear it every day

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:54.780
and I think about the implications of

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:57.690
diving into deep and possibly the

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:58.650
complications when I remember that what

00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:00.260
are what it's like to work at that

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:03.210
company

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:07.020
like it in 2008 were they like we need a

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:09.830
dubstep Oh Canada it's different though

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:12.900
like you know we were a bilingual nation

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:14.610
when I when I grew up usually when we

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.810
listen to the national anthem half of it

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:18.360
will be in French half of it would be in

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:22.980
English it's kind of like the what's

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:25.920
that old it's like a biblical parable

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:27.510
right where one lady comes to the king

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.770
and she's like the baby's mine and then

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:30.270
the other lady comes to the king and

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:32.400
she's like no the baby's mine and then

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:35.340
the Kings like looks cut it in half and

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:36.870
the one lady is like that seems fair

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:38.040
you're a just King and then the other

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:40.740
lady was like don't cut her in half

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:43.430
that's my baby so like the first lady

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:46.710
obviously gets the baby cuz she was like

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:48.270
you know she cared about the baby's

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:51.120
safety I always wondered about the

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:53.850
second lady who's what's she gonna do

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:55.830
with half a baby like I never really

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:58.770
understood what her point was that she

00:30:55.830 --> 00:31:00.210
was like totally okay she's like well

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:02.370
before I had zero babies now I have a

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:05.610
half a baby so it's like a is a net win

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:06.840
for me but anyway that's that version of

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:09.600
the national anthem is like I'm gonna

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:11.220
make sure very few people in the entire

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.440
country are gonna be able to understand

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:16.460
the entire national anthem that's

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:19.230
correct we're not all bilingual only a

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:25.650
subset that's too small unfortunately

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:27.120
either way now I used to know half of

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:29.910
the Canadian national anthem in French

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:31.590
and half in English now I only hear the

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:34.200
national anthem if I'm tuning into a

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:37.550
hockey game before it starts which

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:40.620
doesn't happen that frequently so I

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:43.560
think I'm atrophy I still remember the

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:45.570
words o Canada our home and native land

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:48.120
true patriot love for all thy sons

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:49.800
command with glowing hearts we see thee

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:51.750
rise our True North strong and free from

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:55.770
far and wide o Canada we stand on guard

00:31:51.750 --> 00:32:01.080
for thee and then it goes a pate I shall

00:31:55.770 --> 00:32:02.490
do something from pee and this is

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:04.970
totally the nylons version the a

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:04.970
cappella version

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:11.460
that's my anecdote there we didn't have

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.660
to say the Pledge of Allegiance because

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:16.290
there is no Canadian pledge of

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:16.770
allegiance the pledge of allegiance is

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:20.070
Oh

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:27.330
keep down you hoser try to listen to the

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:29.190
song we just heard me yeah there we go I

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:30.900
don't want to deal with that room I'm a

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:33.000
celebrity get me out of here

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:35.730
that's a British reality show if I

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.760
remember correctly this was just a nice

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:40.800
little I don't want to call it a lazy

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:43.620
run but a run on which our laziness was

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:46.320
enabled based on the fact that it never

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:48.929
really got difficult at all you know

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:51.120
what that means we should actually take

00:32:48.929 --> 00:32:53.550
advantage of our victory lap now as much

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:55.710
as I don't really want to

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:57.450
we now have lost poster that's not from

00:32:55.710 --> 00:33:01.530
the victory lap we still have to unlock

00:32:57.450 --> 00:33:06.390
the lost so victory lap achievement

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:10.530
Isak complete a victory lap defeating

00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:13.260
the lamb complete three victory laps and

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:14.730
star 2/4 okay so these are after birth

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:16.290
plus achievements of course because

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:18.690
that's when the reroll is added do we

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:20.040
still have mom's knife yes because I

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:23.130
thought you lose some items on each

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:24.870
reroll either way I'm gonna be honest

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:28.050
with you we're gonna speed run like as

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:29.460
much as we can without dying and we

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:34.429
could become dark Judas now and it might

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:36.480
not be relevant I see it look at shit

00:33:34.429 --> 00:33:37.770
but we're gonna we're gonna try to make

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.660
our way through this cuz there's no real

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:41.070
reason for us to slow down on this one I

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:45.420
mean we're gonna be way stronger than

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:47.460
the floors that we're facing Wow we're

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:49.890
gonna be way stronger than the floors

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:52.710
that we're facing because we just got

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:55.440
Polyphemus and this is a great run for

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:56.850
us to give a bunch of money to our

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.020
donation machine which we don't need to

00:33:56.850 --> 00:34:01.650
do just yet because there is no donation

00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:04.830
machine in there but it felt like this

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:09.300
was the right time to get these to give

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:10.950
this re-roll or sorry full run rerun

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:13.100
wait I'm saying it wrong again to get

00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:16.020
this rerun achievement done because I

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:18.860
mean let's be honest we're not in much

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:20.150
danger of dying mostly

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:24.200
intention on the fact that we have mom's

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:26.150
knife and a damage stat of 27 so I think

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:28.240
we're probably gonna be relatively in

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:30.800
the clear here we actually needed that

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:36.020
tears upgrade because Polyphemus gave us

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:38.630
a little tears downgrade maybe that was

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:40.910
a wonderful sound let me tell you all

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:42.290
right so we're gonna speed up here I was

00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:43.460
really I gotta be honest we're gonna be

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:44.600
in for some interesting commentary

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:48.680
because I'm not sure if you could tell

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:50.750
by the end of that national anthem talk

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:56.540
I was getting a little bit dry as far as

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:59.410
anecdotes go I don't need for cents and

00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:02.330
then I'm gonna get oh it didn't go up

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:04.790
I'm gonna grab this huge growth not bad

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:07.040
but I was really hoping for two of

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:08.570
diamonds so I could well I mean like to

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.950
be honest with you I would dump the d6

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:12.830
for like blank card Emperor and a

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:15.680
heartbeat it's a little bit more of a a

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:19.790
choice for our present run present

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:21.770
conditions hoggle eyes hoggle eyes it's

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:24.260
a complete three runs and started fourth

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:25.940
that's not that bad especially with the

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:30.260
combination of items we've got if we can

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:32.150
just more or less get some form of

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:34.310
mapping I think that that's all I really

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:36.770
need I mean we also have a deal with the

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:38.840
devil coming up and I think at this

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:40.700
point we should pretty much take what we

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:41.720
can get and not even in a way that you

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:43.100
know she just looked at me with those

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.750
big brown eyes and said you ain't seen

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:46.960
nothing yet which I normally do cuz then

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:50.720
I get to go baby

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:53.690
just a feed nothing yet so we did take a

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:57.230
left hand all the way which i think is a

00:35:53.690 --> 00:36:00.770
smart move actually contrary to what you

00:35:57.230 --> 00:36:02.780
might think because it allows us oh okay

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:07.400
well I mean we're still gonna go for it

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:09.650
here Leviathan now we can fly it gives

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:11.090
us a great chance to become guppy we

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:12.590
also continue to improve our damage

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:14.060
although you know one extra damage

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:16.910
doesn't mean as much when your damage is

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:19.630
already 28 faiths reward is also already

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:19.630
crushing it

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:24.190
yeah this was I think the right run for

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:29.110
this to happen I didn't expect for this

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:30.250
to happen right Ron right Ron it's

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:37.180
murder backwards

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:41.890
I actually just remembered that I had

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:44.290
such a good joke last oh yeah oh wait a

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:46.300
minute oh no no I totally remember I

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:47.770
meant to bring this up on the n LSS on

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:50.200
now I'm really excited for this video to

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:51.460
go up just apropos this is how my brain

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:53.200
works and probably how a lot of people's

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:56.650
brains work but it's just kind of firing

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:57.970
like it's just little fireworks are

00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:59.650
going off or their most of them are duds

00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:01.600
all the time sometimes I just wake up in

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:03.310
the middle of the night and go like if

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:05.140
she went to jail we could call her Ellen

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:05.790
degenerate or something like that you

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:10.540
know

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:13.750
I'm savor tax evasion or murder anyway

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:15.670
the point is last night I open up the

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:18.160
fridge to get a glass of water and just

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:19.840
my head this fully formed singular idea

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:23.650
comes out and goes you know that song

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:25.660
take me to church I wonder if they ever

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:28.510
approached that brand to try to get

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:30.670
sponsorship for that song for like a

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:33.340
Church's Chicken commercial which is an

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:35.500
American Fried Chicken company and then

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:38.800
you can't stop your head from writing it

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:41.920
it's like take me to church choose I'd

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:44.950
like to piecemeal with fries

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:48.430
give me a biscuit that would be really

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:53.530
nice I believe a good yelp review and

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:54.940
they're like I think it's just I don't

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:58.660
know what's going on up there is what

00:37:54.940 --> 00:38:00.280
I'm trying to say I guess but that would

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:02.230
have been a much better bid on the LSS

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:04.060
instead I gift it without it being

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:08.530
gift-wrapped to you and you can you can

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:10.390
make of that joke what you will it works

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:12.490
best I think because it's it's actually

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:15.370
like it's a searing song about you know

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:21.280
some kind of emotional pain and then we

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:23.560
turn it into a song designed to sell d

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:26.410
hydrogenated vegetable oil fried chicken

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:28.150
and that's what works that's how you

00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:29.890
know you've sold out and I got nothing

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:31.300
against selling out speaking of which

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:33.490
have you user twitch Prime subscriptions

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.920
recently come on give me the gob Stern

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:36.350
dude

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:38.540
give up the GUP you better shut your

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:43.000
mouth why you gotta judge everybody by

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:46.040
yourself that's another song where's

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.940
your Mercedes won't start yeah that's a

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.310
crying shame

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:51.860
I guess 90k year buys nothing but

00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:53.780
complain the people in the neighborhood

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:56.120
say that I'm a threat but as the boss

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:57.290
gets richer they get deeper in debt it

00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:00.680
really sounds like you're just using

00:38:57.290 --> 00:39:03.380
that as an excuse to completely you know

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:04.640
like hand-wave other people's problems

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:06.950
as well as your own behavior in the

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:08.090
neighborhood if the people in the

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:09.620
neighborhood think that you're a threat

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:11.840
what have you been doing - I'm not

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:13.430
saying no false accusations exist but

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:19.820
you know there might be something to

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:21.440
those allegations as well sure the you

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:23.240
know the growing income disparity

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.650
between the rich and the poor is

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:26.150
something to consider as well but that

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:28.940
doesn't mean you know you should be

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:32.050
allowed to skateboard on my driveway not

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:32.050
without my permission at least

00:39:37.359 --> 00:39:43.329
that's a Canadian song it's a Canadian

00:39:41.049 --> 00:39:46.709
so not everybody might be familiar with

00:39:43.329 --> 00:39:46.709
that bad boy but that's okay

00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:53.140
continue moving on yeah I mean the run

00:39:50.289 --> 00:39:55.660
from an Isaac standpoint is actually

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:58.660
tension free it's like it just got back

00:39:55.660 --> 00:40:00.700
from getting a massage take that we do

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:03.009
have four lux so we can make great

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:04.420
things happen there and if you're

00:40:03.009 --> 00:40:05.979
wondering you know why isn't he doing

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:08.200
this why isn't he doing this the answer

00:40:05.979 --> 00:40:10.180
is if we do everything by the book on

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.890
this run is gonna be a long book it's

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:13.299
gonna be like The Brothers Karamazov or

00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:15.579
something like that which you know I

00:40:13.299 --> 00:40:18.839
know the title of but haven't read so I

00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:18.839
still get like a little street cred

00:40:21.029 --> 00:40:26.769
let's actually The Brothers Karamazov is

00:40:24.099 --> 00:40:28.749
just one passage in a theater they have

00:40:26.769 --> 00:40:30.910
skis blah blah blah blah anyway the

00:40:28.749 --> 00:40:33.219
point is sure he's a good writer I guess

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:38.979
but you know is he Dan Brown because if

00:40:33.219 --> 00:40:42.609
not that don't impress me much we

00:40:38.979 --> 00:40:44.650
already have a dark matter so let's try

00:40:42.609 --> 00:40:45.569
to take a second dark matter it totally

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:47.349
worked

00:40:45.569 --> 00:40:49.449
continue moving on here I mean we're

00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:51.999
like less than halfway through this but

00:40:49.449 --> 00:40:55.059
hopefully timewise much more than

00:40:51.999 --> 00:41:00.910
halfway through this I really really

00:40:55.059 --> 00:41:04.809
should be using my money to buy shop

00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:11.349
items because a map would help us out to

00:41:04.809 --> 00:41:11.739
an enormous degree even blue map would

00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:15.400
help

00:41:11.739 --> 00:41:17.109
we don't need blank card Emperor blank

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:19.479
card world would also be fine

00:41:17.109 --> 00:41:23.170
even blank cards son won't you come and

00:41:19.479 --> 00:41:25.559
wash away the rain would be be a coup

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:25.559
for us

00:41:27.579 --> 00:41:31.490
still trying to finesse the Guffey deal

00:41:30.079 --> 00:41:33.680
as well we're doing really well on deals

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:34.970
with the devil that I will say I guess

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:37.700
the other thing and I hadn't considered

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:39.980
this is if our HP is good enough and you

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:41.900
got to remember we have the wafer every

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:45.079
self-sacrifice room could be played to

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:47.150
just send us down to the to the negative

00:41:45.079 --> 00:41:49.849
floor immediately because we're still

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:51.800
holding the negative presumably I'm

00:41:49.849 --> 00:41:53.750
gonna try it that idea sounds just

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:55.849
clever enough to actually be stupid and

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:59.240
kill me in a hilarious way so we're

00:41:55.849 --> 00:42:00.950
gonna finish this floor and then we're

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:03.050
gonna try to play the self-sacrifice

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:12.380
room I don't think we want that we

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:13.910
definitely do not want that come on okay

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:15.349
just finish this one up I'm still

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:17.329
hopeful we're getting the Guffey dream I

00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:19.220
mean 40 percent deal with the devil odds

00:42:17.329 --> 00:42:21.290
you're not gonna like this logic for me

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:23.000
but that's basically 50% you know what

00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:25.970
it what did 10% odds really mean for us

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:30.859
on a single dice roll and I mean 5050

00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:31.760
it's pretty close to 2/3 so I would say

00:42:30.859 --> 00:42:33.440
we have like a hundred percent

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:39.470
confidence we're probably gonna get this

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:42.589
to work for us I you know what jumper

00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:46.430
cables jumper cables would probably be

00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:50.630
good car battery is obviously just

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:51.980
horrible but for us could always blow up

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:55.420
the donation machine we could always use

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:59.650
this run to buoy our donation machine

00:42:55.420 --> 00:43:05.810
second level Cuba meet finally No Deal

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:12.560
Howie Mandel all right so let's go back

00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:16.010
to the pass to play the crappy games

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:17.540
that suck but and we have the HP

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:22.819
required to do this it's gonna be a

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:24.500
little delicate but we certainly can get

00:43:22.819 --> 00:43:28.839
away with this actually could we get a

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:28.839
mega Satan run out of this in that case

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:36.450
100% deal with the angel chance cuz

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:36.450
we're gonna get an angel statue

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:42.790
eventually oh it's the second guppies

00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:50.710
caller which might not even contribute

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:55.630
to the guppy transformation we could

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:59.080
also if we felt like it we could reroll

00:43:55.630 --> 00:44:01.020
both of the key pieces but dude I give

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:04.750
the mega satan accomplished on this one

00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:06.730
not even the jason magna satan who i

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:09.940
have to point out for everybody who was

00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:12.340
titillated by the jason magna satan joke

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:14.410
he's now been released by the vancouver

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:17.830
canucks so i'm sad to say that at least

00:44:14.410 --> 00:44:21.430
in the Vancouver area the era of jason

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:24.760
magna satan is now gone so you might be

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:28.120
saying NL you messed it up you lost your

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:30.790
keys that's not the case I mean it is we

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:33.010
definitely lost the key however on our

00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:36.400
next role which we still have to do we

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:38.350
could go back and play the self

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:39.820
sacrifice room again we could also we

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:43.030
already have a 100% deal of the angel

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:45.900
chance because we feel blessed so we're

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:48.370
gonna be able to one way or the other

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:50.620
probably create two key pieces anyway

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:52.180
unless that gets reset run to run here

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:54.690
which it might actually now that I think

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:54.690
about it

00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:07.010
we don't need the keys we don't need

00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:10.400
y'all lock opening mechanisms girl get

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:15.820
out go home and out don't don't thump

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:21.830
them no instruments to insert into holes

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:30.260
Brown but I don't come down we open the

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:36.530
doors with some panties teacher leave

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:42.890
those Lots alone wait hey streamer leave

00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:49.580
those locks alone hey diner leave that

00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:55.760
locks alone hey Lia no don't leave

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:59.380
Barcelona all in all it's just a another

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:59.380
kick on the ball

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:04.030
sort of works

00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:14.190
I'm begging oh there's a little Gump

00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:17.100
magic GUP head if you will

00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:22.020
we're not deaf yet and that's because we

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:25.260
still have only two guppy items we just

00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:26.790
have one of the items twice and it's one

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:28.770
of the worst to have twice actually I

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:35.490
guess weirdly enough Guppies head is

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:38.400
Worth's worse to have twice but except

00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:41.190
is a rear old target but we should have

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:42.690
just rear old Guppies collar but many

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:47.100
people in this situation would have done

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:49.410
the same thing I think yes ok so this is

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:52.350
a new pill has appeared so that's our

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:54.990
first full run we got to finish this one

00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:56.310
and start another one I think sure I'll

00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:59.850
take anything that works us towards

00:46:56.310 --> 00:47:02.130
transformations at this point why not we

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:05.000
also I can't up and notice down to 8

00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:10.170
damage now that's like actually horrible

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:17.750
why are you taking black hearts I don't

00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:23.340
like that is this run actually bad well

00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:26.240
ok why is it taking black cards dude I'm

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:26.240
losing my mind

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:33.960
save your money because we want the shop

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:36.440
to give us a math engine still can I'm

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:39.150
actually freaking out we're taking like

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:40.530
like it doesn't think we have a red

00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:42.720
heart I can't think of anything within

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:44.340
the normal rules of the game that should

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:46.290
lead us into a situation in which we're

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:47.730
taking red heart damage from playing a

00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:49.980
blood bank on the very first floor

00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:54.300
unless things just start dealing double

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:57.930
damage down here just because our damage

00:47:54.300 --> 00:48:01.410
by the way is still like real good our

00:47:57.930 --> 00:48:03.830
DPS at least we got a long road ahead of

00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:03.830
us though

00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:09.710
like I don't even want to go to the

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:15.710
cursor keep in mind like we could

00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:17.180
respawn as as dark Judas but I don't

00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:22.760
want to do that because I'm actually not

00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:25.099
sure if I've gotten the oh you got it

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:30.589
take Tarot cloth obviously I'm actually

00:48:25.099 --> 00:48:34.550
not sure if I've gotten the achievement

00:48:30.589 --> 00:48:36.140
for getting the negative path done that

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:37.460
might sound ridiculous and it would kind

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:39.320
of be ridiculous because obviously we've

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:44.359
done it ten times oh we also lost the d6

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:46.099
I see so you take the Emperor you take

00:48:44.359 --> 00:48:49.490
the band and then you have the facts of

00:48:46.099 --> 00:48:52.880
life as well but I think we might want

00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:55.190
to end it I mean by fighting mega Satan

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:57.140
would be ideal but it seems like we can

00:48:55.190 --> 00:49:01.180
no longer guarantee that so instead

00:48:57.140 --> 00:49:01.180
guppy guppy guppy it's not good at all

00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:13.910
instead we're just kind of gonna have to

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:15.680
try to roll this but yeah instead if we

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:18.050
have to go to the negative path and beat

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:22.280
the lamb again it should be fine so even

00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:23.720
though we've got are you a wizard I'm

00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:25.400
actually gonna speed through this a

00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:27.380
little bit and this could get me killed

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:29.599
now that now that we've lost our like

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:29.990
marquee item it actually could get me

00:49:29.599 --> 00:49:32.210
killed

00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:34.550
I'm gonna hope that it doesn't but it's

00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:36.349
also like you have to keep in mind that

00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:38.960
if I don't finish this run quickly I

00:49:36.349 --> 00:49:40.130
might die in real life of either hunger

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:41.750
thirst or you know I mean that's

00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:43.310
probably or making light of the fact

00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:46.550
that people on earth still die of that

00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:49.700
however you know I'll be you all I'll

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:53.390
suffer from mild boredom we have to beat

00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:55.040
the same Isaac run 20 times okay well

00:49:53.390 --> 00:50:00.740
let's say we still have pyromaniacs so

00:49:55.040 --> 00:50:05.660
that's a start I would also love to I

00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:09.369
would also love to still have the wafer

00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:09.369
which I don't know if I do

00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:17.610
definitely still have pay to play we got

00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:19.700
doubled wheels of fortune I don't know

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:24.750
why I said it like that doubled feels a

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:26.760
fortune of course specifically kind of

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:29.700
surprised by the lack of stuff we've

00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:30.720
gotten from our shops you'd think that

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:32.880
we'd have a better chance I'm also

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:35.070
surprised that we're three runs into

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:39.450
this game with the left hand

00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:41.130
excuse me I hit my poison my poison I'm

00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:44.130
also surprised that were three runs into

00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:47.910
the game and yet we have not managed to

00:50:44.130 --> 00:50:49.410
create a guppy transformation out of the

00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:50.850
left hand especially now that we've lost

00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:54.300
mom's knife it's more important than

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:58.790
ever we're going back for that HP I

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:58.790
could meet it we got an 80% devil deal I

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:14.010
also would extremely acquiesce phd right

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:15.690
now question mark pill is insidious cuz

00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:27.900
it makes you doubt all other pills that

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:30.720
you have no deal he's done it okay hold

00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:32.430
lemon party that pills fine still moving

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:35.420
along here and I've still got time for

00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:35.420
the streets it's the d-r-e

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:44.010
we're in a tighter spot than I would

00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:47.260
have expected I hope this is the last

00:51:44.010 --> 00:51:50.109
necessary run we won't get the value of

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:53.490
having defeated the negative perhaps

00:51:50.109 --> 00:51:56.530
however we will get the value of

00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:59.859
completing the rerun achievement which

00:51:56.530 --> 00:52:01.840
is substantially more annoying than any

00:51:59.859 --> 00:52:03.430
one time fighting mega Satan is the way

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:06.400
that I would describe that as politely

00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:09.400
as possible keep in mind we've got

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:11.290
unlimited HP by our bombs I mean and by

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:14.080
unlimited I mean 84 which is actually a

00:52:11.290 --> 00:52:16.210
hundred and sixty-eight full shots plus

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:23.800
TNT we can use like more than once per

00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:25.690
room little tedious though hasn't

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:28.570
actually been that long like we've had

00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:30.730
Isaac runs longer than this just goes to

00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:33.300
you know further prove the kind of feast

00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:36.760
or famine nature of Isaac in general

00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:38.740
that you know your run is either usually

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:40.869
really really good and there's no chance

00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:42.960
you'll fail or really really bad and

00:52:40.869 --> 00:52:46.830
it's gonna be a slog all the way through

00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:46.830
so there's a little tiny boy

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:58.330
very afraid there I have to open it but

00:52:56.350 --> 00:53:04.480
like at the same time I'm not at all

00:52:58.330 --> 00:53:06.700
excited about a single a single red

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:12.520
chest like we should be getting infinity

00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:15.310
single red chests at present though that

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:17.080
is not the case so we just kind of kind

00:53:15.310 --> 00:53:19.210
of we got a tough it out I'd be lying by

00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:22.210
the way again I want guppy but I also

00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:23.560
want brimstone like me if we can get

00:53:22.210 --> 00:53:25.120
duplicate items give me a duplicate

00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:26.950
mom's knife for all I care

00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:32.500
we had it and it was ripped from us

00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:34.270
unjustly well money's no problem so I

00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:39.520
don't feel bad asking for it again I I

00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:42.310
treasured it well I had it it's good

00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:44.500
actually our speed was pretty poor just

00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:46.120
don't get hit here we want this 100%

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:48.370
deal with the angel Chancellor's I deal

00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:50.020
with the devil if we messed it up I

00:53:48.370 --> 00:53:52.330
would be pretty disappointed in myself

00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:53.380
because we are way stronger than we

00:53:52.330 --> 00:53:56.170
should be at this point in the run

00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:59.830
probably halo which is more than decent

00:53:56.170 --> 00:54:01.510
and then another dark Judas and another

00:53:59.830 --> 00:54:03.700
rotten baby because rotten baby was

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:05.380
ripped from us I guess probably dark

00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:07.210
matter was ripped from us earlier then

00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:08.440
as well I still by the way do not

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:10.750
understand why we're taking double

00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:12.100
damage on every room except it must be

00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:22.590
something that's like hard-coded in

00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:25.930
reruns yeah that makes sense I'm

00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:31.300
probably overly worried about something

00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:35.320
I shouldn't be too concerned about okay

00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:36.940
balls of steel means I'm not gonna lie I

00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:40.330
couldn't teleport out anyway disregard

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:41.500
um it means I'm not gonna ruin my deal

00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:44.530
with the devil chance which is good

00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:47.290
enough in its own right there's gonna be

00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:52.230
no we might still ruin it there's gonna

00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:55.120
be no self sacrifice room play for sure

00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:58.240
in the end like with nine lives which is

00:54:55.120 --> 00:55:01.060
actually five lives for reasons that I

00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:03.740
cannot comprehend

00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:05.060
we're going to and then no question

00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:09.620
marks associated with them which is also

00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:11.600
hilarious we're going to probably win

00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:12.770
especially if one of those lives is dark

00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:16.190
Judas which now that I'm thinking about

00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:17.750
it it might not be and I'm also gonna

00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:23.150
skip the item room on this floor because

00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:26.860
I want to is that a good enough answer

00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:26.860
well save this for full health

00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:32.450
we also are close enough that we could

00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:36.380
probably get a really really good shot

00:55:32.450 --> 00:55:39.050
at our deal with the devil well a really

00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:43.010
really good below 50% chance of getting

00:55:39.050 --> 00:55:44.570
a deal with the devil nothing will take

00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:47.750
the polar way this time as we should

00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:49.160
still have the negative shoopdawhoop is

00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:52.300
kind of tempting but I don't think it's

00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:55.220
worth going through the the slog here

00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:56.690
keep me keep me mentally engaged in this

00:55:55.220 --> 00:56:01.820
one we got it I'm actually gonna Sun

00:55:56.690 --> 00:56:03.080
card right away I don't mind playing a

00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:06.140
little sloppy here cuz I actually feel

00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:08.270
like this is like sparring you know sure

00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:11.720
you you always want to play perfectly I

00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:14.660
suppose getting the good habits but it's

00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:16.880
also a run in which we can afford to

00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:18.890
mess around a little bit play a little

00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:20.450
looser have more fun because we're gonna

00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:24.980
be on it for 20 years

00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:28.910
lemonparty is fine but good well it's

00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:34.580
actually good but not great but totally

00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:36.200
adequate if I my collections are correct

00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:41.210
and according to my research this might

00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:45.530
be oh this might be our last re-roll

00:56:41.210 --> 00:56:47.900
necessary last rerun as this area should

00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:49.490
say victory lap probably a better piece

00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:50.990
of terminology I think that would be

00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:53.510
good for you and for me you know you got

00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:54.710
a day to get along with or a asleep that

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:58.220
you've already been lulled to by the

00:56:54.710 --> 00:57:02.840
dulcet sounds in my voice should just

00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:03.440
start whispering terrible stuff why not

00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:07.150
do

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:10.760
14 lives just aren't whispering like

00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:13.069
you're on a roller coaster and it's gone

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:14.720
off the rails you're careening towards

00:57:13.069 --> 00:57:16.690
they see that would be terrible but I

00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:19.160
would feel way less awkward about like

00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:20.750
that then being like I hope you have a

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:24.109
good sleep sweeties

00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:28.369
that's just that makes me very

00:57:24.109 --> 00:57:37.190
uncomfortable we're just gonna keep

00:57:28.369 --> 00:57:42.950
moving here as I say all the time other

00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:44.240
things I say can I kick it yes you can

00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:46.609
assuming you have the proper

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:50.170
documentation can I kick it yes you can

00:57:46.609 --> 00:57:50.170
assuming you filed for a permit for that

00:57:54.789 --> 00:58:01.460
don't make me fight the boss room like I

00:57:58.130 --> 00:58:05.079
have tenure all of this is defined in

00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:07.760
the collective bargaining agreement

00:58:05.079 --> 00:58:10.470
although after Austin we've started

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:12.099
calling it the collective bargaining

00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:15.470
[Music]

00:58:12.099 --> 00:58:17.180
agreement I can't even speak anymore

00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:19.420
NL shuts down it's like you know you

00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:23.180
don't get Cinderella home before

00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:29.329
midnight the chariot turns back into a

00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:32.680
pumpkin right let's go we are family

00:58:29.329 --> 00:58:32.680
I've got all my sisters in me

00:58:39.709 --> 00:58:44.910
still like I mean HP is not in a

00:58:42.359 --> 00:58:54.329
wonderful spot but wrote God's okay my

00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:56.119
buddy this cat do you hear this I wonder

00:58:54.329 --> 00:58:59.539
if he thinks that I'm like in trouble

00:58:56.119 --> 00:59:02.640
that's what we'd like we anthropomorphic

00:58:59.539 --> 00:59:06.509
anthropomorphic animals for sure you

00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:09.749
know cat meows we go all he said even no

00:59:06.509 --> 00:59:11.910
idea he might it's random neural firings

00:59:09.749 --> 00:59:14.900
or something maybe sad I got no clue I

00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:20.729
wouldn't pretend to be the cat whisperer

00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:25.859
should never have come in this room but

00:59:20.729 --> 00:59:27.630
I don't think that's the case I don't

00:59:25.859 --> 00:59:32.880
think he's sad I think he's trying to

00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:34.679
trick you into thinking he said that way

00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:41.489
you eat drums up support for him in the

00:59:34.679 --> 00:59:43.169
YouTube comments you take his side and

00:59:41.489 --> 00:59:44.999
then you go NL you gotta feed your cats

00:59:43.169 --> 00:59:50.159
I'll show you a picture there are cat's

00:59:44.999 --> 00:59:52.469
belly he's well fed as am I to be fair

00:59:50.159 --> 00:59:54.559
I'm as you know not the pot calling the

00:59:52.469 --> 00:59:56.849
kettle black in this situation but

00:59:54.559 --> 00:59:58.380
already oh no we didn't already see that

00:59:56.849 --> 01:00:00.509
room okay so we're not gonna fight hush

00:59:58.380 --> 01:00:02.640
we have to go to Sheol we got two floors

01:00:00.509 --> 01:00:09.569
left and then possibly our long national

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:11.939
nightmare is over it's still a good run

01:00:09.569 --> 01:00:13.499
I mean we have 14 lives it's a very

01:00:11.939 --> 01:00:15.509
strange number but it's also a very

01:00:13.499 --> 01:00:18.679
comforting number cuz surely some of

01:00:15.509 --> 01:00:22.859
those 14 spawn us with more than one HP

01:00:18.679 --> 01:00:25.390
movie had five and two of them might be

01:00:22.859 --> 01:00:28.540
dark Judas

01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:30.070
actually no one to zero of them might be

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:33.690
dar just cuz we didn't take the second

01:00:30.070 --> 01:00:33.690
dark Judas to me I don't think we did

01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:40.080
I'm actually losing it I'm like is this

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:43.510
the first time we've been down ash or

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:46.000
did we fight Satan on them on our first

01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:51.790
pass here I'm starting to get like time

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:54.190
dilation like Matthew McConaughey in his

01:00:51.790 --> 01:01:04.420
most famous 2013 movie the wolf of Wall

01:00:54.190 --> 01:01:10.000
Street okay this is where we gotta focus

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:13.150
we can get hit twice here luckily I

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:17.640
think we're immune to the feet and the

01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:20.290
actual explosion part of the bomb flies

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:22.240
but we can still get contact damage from

01:01:20.290 --> 01:01:23.530
the bomb flies not that I mean they

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:29.920
didn't even have a chance to spawn so

01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:31.660
disregard okay okay please God let this

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:33.790
be the finish here we have too many hour

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:36.430
long videos in like literally every

01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:38.470
series I'm doing right now divinity is

01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:42.010
always an hour long XCOM episodes are

01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:44.380
getting longer can I do this stupid joke

01:01:42.010 --> 01:01:45.790
of the NL SS it's three hours long

01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:49.630
what's up with that we should probably

01:01:45.790 --> 01:01:51.370
drop the left hands at this point but

01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:52.870
we've held on to it so long it's like

01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:54.850
I'm afraid to get rid of it it's a part

01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:58.690
of me one little voice is calling me

01:01:54.850 --> 01:02:02.070
calling contact damage not explosive

01:01:58.690 --> 01:02:05.790
damage so my bad their luck down not

01:02:02.070 --> 01:02:05.790
exactly a game-winner

01:02:06.830 --> 01:02:11.760
and without mom's knife we're at a

01:02:10.350 --> 01:02:16.460
disadvantage for the lamb fight

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:18.900
certainly however we do also have

01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:21.390
explosion immunity and explosions are

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:28.770
the Lambs bread and butter it's that in

01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:31.950
homing shots this cat is actually trying

01:02:28.770 --> 01:02:33.060
to like beat the door down I don't

01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:34.500
understand what we've done to create

01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:41.190
such a monster I'm like one of those

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:45.450
parents on Maury this was way easier

01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:46.920
than expected No yes yeah we always say

01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:52.290
yes and then it gives us the achievement

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:55.590
if we oh my god there's one more all

01:02:52.290 --> 01:03:00.420
right what one the last one you start is

01:02:55.590 --> 01:03:01.950
the lost right but we have nine lives we

01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:11.040
haven't we have nine lives though is the

01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:13.830
thing go fast go fast okay this blow it

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:16.760
up blow it out we're immune to

01:03:13.830 --> 01:03:16.760
explosions

01:03:31.330 --> 01:03:37.540
the sector oh I don't know how I did it

01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:40.940
but I did it

01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:43.220
are we perma are you a wizard wizard

01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:45.740
didn't know ok it was just our hour ok

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:47.150
we actually have to focus so this is the

01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:50.240
one that actually matters I forgot that

01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:51.560
the game did this but we're doing this

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:53.030
without holy mantle which is also

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:54.950
horrible we're gonna stick with Book of

01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:57.490
Revelations cuz even if it does nothing

01:03:54.950 --> 01:04:00.140
that still makes it better than TNT a

01:03:57.490 --> 01:04:01.970
little bit of a joke I guess however you

01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:03.620
know we like to have fun here however

01:04:01.970 --> 01:04:05.000
it's also gonna create cubes of meat

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:10.850
which you're gonna deal passive damage

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:12.380
for us grab the HP even though it's

01:04:10.850 --> 01:04:21.680
meaningless I'll let this cat inside

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:24.740
hello what is it what is it Roka no

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:26.780
meows I swear to God if this cat goes

01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:29.090
behind the computer I'm gonna flip my

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:31.790
lid great name for a hat flipping TV

01:04:29.090 --> 01:04:34.580
show not a great thing to happen because

01:04:31.790 --> 01:04:36.410
I'm not even wearing a hat is the thing

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:38.720
wait we used Book of Revelations but we

01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:44.390
did not get I keep a meet on the last

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:51.880
floor what's up with that we don't have

01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:56.690
a ton of lives probably or maybe we do

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:58.130
it's the thing so I'm just like we also

01:04:56.690 --> 01:05:03.710
don't have a holy mantle which is the

01:04:58.130 --> 01:05:05.110
real problem still have Tarot clock

01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:09.280
though what are you doing over there

01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:11.840
stop that get in the box you weird kid

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:14.240
hit the laugh button it's not a laugh

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:21.710
button anymore as a duck button get

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:24.970
tricked how are we gonna do this I mean

01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:24.970
we have a powerful run

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:31.540
I don't think we should take our eighth

01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:33.010
the rotten baby our damage is good and

01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:35.200
actually we're probably getting close to

01:05:33.010 --> 01:05:38.349
spun but really what I'm looking for I

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:41.830
think is more lives oh my god the cat is

01:05:38.349 --> 01:05:48.730
moving the mouse the irony is not lost

01:05:41.830 --> 01:05:51.040
on me you've seen old proptosis lovely

01:05:48.730 --> 01:05:55.300
item you've seen this room a million

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:57.460
times in your life buddy look yes we're

01:05:55.300 --> 01:06:00.940
friends weird actually like actual best

01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:03.369
friends you could be the best man when

01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:06.670
Kate and I renew our vows but you're

01:06:03.369 --> 01:06:08.800
leaning on me too hard buddy I know it's

01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:13.030
been a long either Grande but come here

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:15.520
just get in the lamp okay all right well

01:06:13.030 --> 01:06:19.510
distract him with love we should have

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:21.190
like I mean 14 plus nine minus the

01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:25.450
number of times he died probably died

01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:28.990
like five times already so we should

01:06:25.450 --> 01:06:30.550
have like 18 lives do we I just made a

01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:33.250
face like how the F should I know

01:06:30.550 --> 01:06:36.010
because I I can't see so really it's

01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:38.130
like pretty much up to the game at this

01:06:36.010 --> 01:06:38.130
point

01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:43.089
huge growth is like almost like a run is

01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:46.330
almost too good to make huge growth

01:06:43.089 --> 01:06:53.560
matter I think it's our eighth blood

01:06:46.330 --> 01:06:55.570
clot still begging for a a damage

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:57.280
increase and by damage increase I mean

01:06:55.570 --> 01:07:00.130
mapping those two items are like barely

01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:02.140
related check out okay this is good this

01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:04.690
is good we will donate first let's check

01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:07.810
and see what we got down here mm glass

01:07:04.690 --> 01:07:11.589
cannon is actually incredible because we

01:07:07.810 --> 01:07:14.050
already have no HP so what is the

01:07:11.589 --> 01:07:20.369
problem with glass cannon this should

01:07:14.050 --> 01:07:20.369
stop yes

01:07:21.590 --> 01:07:25.950
some of the donations aren't even going

01:07:23.850 --> 01:07:31.830
through there it's I have no idea what's

01:07:25.950 --> 01:07:33.810
happening on this run so one of the very

01:07:31.830 --> 01:07:37.230
very few times glass cannon is the right

01:07:33.810 --> 01:07:41.280
call I think Network would take a deaths

01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:45.000
we shouldn't be especially considering

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:47.640
we can pretty much destroy any enemy or

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.770
rather we can destroy all enemies with a

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:57.410
single glass cannon we might as well

01:07:49.770 --> 01:08:00.270
take large zip and I can't even imagine

01:07:57.410 --> 01:08:04.290
how strong our glass cannon shots are

01:08:00.270 --> 01:08:07.920
right now but in the end that doesn't

01:08:04.290 --> 01:08:11.640
really matter if we can't keep ourselves

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:13.950
alive what on earth did I do there cam

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:15.690
please let me continue to have the deal

01:08:13.950 --> 01:08:21.890
with devil thank you I'm still a little

01:08:15.690 --> 01:08:25.290
concerned world card is fine and so is

01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:27.029
juice is shadow which didn't oh the

01:08:25.290 --> 01:08:31.790
deals the devil are free because we're

01:08:27.029 --> 01:08:31.790
the lost that's right that's right

01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:39.739
all right world me please full run

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:43.200
reroll I wouldn't dare at this point

01:08:39.739 --> 01:08:47.040
thing is most enemies where he's gonna

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:54.779
shoot him glass cannons a little

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:57.560
overkill still really cool but a little

01:08:54.779 --> 01:09:00.060
overkill sure glaucoma

01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:02.839
there's just no shops anymore that's why

01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:02.839
we're not getting the map

01:09:07.989 --> 01:09:15.500
that was very satisfying continue to get

01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:17.989
a deal with the devil will take cambian

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:19.520
conception knowing that came being

01:09:17.989 --> 01:09:21.440
conception can't do anything except

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:25.759
contribute to its transformation because

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:27.380
we already have a full suite of not

01:09:25.759 --> 01:09:28.819
being able to take damage abilities like

01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:31.569
for example every time we take damage we

01:09:28.819 --> 01:09:34.639
just die I guess we could maybe

01:09:31.569 --> 01:09:41.630
conceivably get one item out of can

01:09:34.639 --> 01:09:43.130
being conception may be kind of tempting

01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:45.440
to do boss rush on this one is as

01:09:43.130 --> 01:09:47.000
ridiculous as that sounds I don't think

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:50.540
it would be hard I think it would just

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:53.540
be annoying it might not even be

01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:55.550
annoying the only thing that would be

01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:57.409
annoying about it is that you know we

01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:59.239
would be wanting to kill enemies too

01:09:57.409 --> 01:10:01.340
quickly and sometimes those enemies are

01:09:59.239 --> 01:10:04.580
you know gonna start underground or

01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:06.949
something like that but apart from that

01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:08.869
everything dies in like a second it

01:10:06.949 --> 01:10:13.639
actually like substantially less than a

01:10:08.869 --> 01:10:15.409
second I'll just record a couple of

01:10:13.639 --> 01:10:18.199
videos before a stream today good idea

01:10:15.409 --> 01:10:19.969
good idea well I mean we did it to

01:10:18.199 --> 01:10:25.099
ourselves not like this was a compulsory

01:10:19.969 --> 01:10:26.750
thing for us to do today now that's a

01:10:25.099 --> 01:10:31.699
new level of laziness there we at least

01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:33.560
got a check in bay man it's not bad now

01:10:31.699 --> 01:10:35.389
is mysterious liquid really that

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:39.429
relevant in a situation in which every

01:10:35.389 --> 01:10:39.429
enemy dies on contact with your tier No

01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:49.350
but why not right oh my god shall we

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:52.619
fight delirium I'm gonna say no is the

01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:55.560
answer to that question but it's funny

01:10:52.619 --> 01:10:56.880
that you would ask we might as well take

01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:58.770
the negative just in case we somehow

01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:01.139
lost it we should have access to both

01:10:58.770 --> 01:11:02.850
though none of those are worth it so

01:11:01.139 --> 01:11:05.429
we're out and remember this is the most

01:11:02.850 --> 01:11:10.170
important part you should go to show you

01:11:05.429 --> 01:11:11.909
got to go to Sheol I just wish that I

01:11:10.170 --> 01:11:16.320
still knew how many lives I had I know

01:11:11.909 --> 01:11:18.540
we can tell that we have lives because

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:20.130
of the the head stuff about two heads

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:24.420
actually still following us around so we

01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:29.460
should have at least 10 lives I also

01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:32.659
know we got pH D plus we got the item pH

01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:35.940
D however who cares

01:11:32.659 --> 01:11:38.550
we don't need pills for anything we

01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:43.260
cards an emperor card for example a

01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:45.600
world card nothing else really matters

01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:47.100
too much we could up our tier rate all

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:48.540
day it doesn't matter one tier kills the

01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:50.810
enemies we fire it as soon as we enter

01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:50.810
the room

01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:00.430
literally like all of our stats are

01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:05.260
irrelevant except for the one that means

01:12:00.430 --> 01:12:07.300
we kill enemies instantly so I'm just

01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:12.250
gonna keep moving here I'm gonna keep

01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:14.170
running into random eyeballs want you to

01:12:12.250 --> 01:12:19.930
know okay well I assumed that he was

01:12:14.170 --> 01:12:24.550
dead and that was my bad we now only

01:12:19.930 --> 01:12:29.710
have one head following us we also do

01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:30.580
have a dark to destroy they be no we

01:12:29.710 --> 01:12:39.719
still have two heads

01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:39.719
I was just incorrect room one tackled

01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:44.530
take two items that effectively do

01:12:42.970 --> 01:12:46.300
absolutely nothing for us and head down

01:12:44.530 --> 01:12:51.400
to the next floor I think we're gonna

01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:56.830
make it and my existential anyway will

01:12:51.400 --> 01:13:01.090
be over I start to like I'm just like

01:12:56.830 --> 01:13:05.590
hot it's 29 degrees in this room right

01:13:01.090 --> 01:13:07.330
now Isaac run has gone too long and we

01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:09.460
almost obliterated ourselves

01:13:07.330 --> 01:13:12.970
accidentally we used a little-known

01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:16.030
trick that I remember from like being

01:13:12.970 --> 01:13:17.470
told it four years ago once I'm just

01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:23.470
lucky that for some reason that got

01:13:17.470 --> 01:13:25.150
commuted to memory it's actually

01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:26.590
committed to memory for something to

01:13:25.150 --> 01:13:28.440
commute to memory doesn't really make

01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:32.590
sense

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:35.760
don't would love the virus actually

01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:37.960
would speed down irrelevant spun

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:39.880
probably also irrelevant okay you know

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:42.970
what I've talked myself out of it we

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:44.890
don't need it what we do need is to

01:13:42.970 --> 01:13:52.090
never see another dead end as long as I

01:13:44.890 --> 01:13:53.410
live because this is absurd you might be

01:13:52.090 --> 01:13:55.900
saying you're complaining a lot for a

01:13:53.410 --> 01:13:59.500
dude who's killing every single room as

01:13:55.900 --> 01:14:02.490
soon as he walks in yeah but you might

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:04.930
be complaining too on a run like this

01:14:02.490 --> 01:14:11.020
it's not that I don't like it it's just

01:14:04.930 --> 01:14:12.970
that it's long my dudes hoping at the

01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:17.740
only like 10 minutes and payout from a

01:14:12.970 --> 01:14:19.390
red chest is he's a teleportation of the

01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:21.610
deal with the devil that is like I'll

01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:23.260
sign up for that I'd be on time for that

01:14:21.610 --> 01:14:25.990
I also ain't thought of no rhymes that

01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:28.860
would line with that Kanye West 2004

01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:28.860
late registration

01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:36.710
but all the enemies are dead so you that

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:41.750
shot should never have existed is the

01:14:36.710 --> 01:14:43.610
thing as much as I hate the circumstance

01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:48.620
of this run right now I'm gonna hate

01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:52.010
myself a lot more if I mess it up so

01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:55.700
just stay on point we only got one head

01:14:52.010 --> 01:14:57.440
following us around now oh that was

01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:59.720
scary you know what we actually should

01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:04.510
do and this is like such a low

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:06.920
percentage play but I like it we should

01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:11.540
drop the left hand I mean basically

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:12.830
immediately and then probably sure to

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:16.370
drop it like two floors ago we're gonna

01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:19.250
drop it immediately and then use our

01:15:16.370 --> 01:15:21.680
luck stead to possibly create a

01:15:19.250 --> 01:15:24.830
situation where dad's he shows up on the

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:27.710
on the next floor give the odds of that

01:15:24.830 --> 01:15:30.280
about a 1 in one quadrillion chance of

01:15:27.710 --> 01:15:30.280
occurring but

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:40.670
I'm okay with this it's better than not

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:41.960
having any chance look at that we got a

01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:43.130
big golden chest right off the bat

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:47.960
thanks to dropping it that could have

01:15:43.130 --> 01:15:50.650
been a big red chest instead our final

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:53.900
dark room I believe

01:15:50.650 --> 01:15:58.100
thanks for the spirit hearts is not at

01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:59.690
all irritating you got to do well we

01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:03.610
might not have to do that room again but

01:15:59.690 --> 01:16:03.610
we probably have to do that again

01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:12.980
Beelzebub not a really relevant

01:16:10.010 --> 01:16:16.810
transformation do I really want to fight

01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:19.940
mega Satan on this run Wow yeah now I do

01:16:16.810 --> 01:16:22.910
just cut nine more lives

01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:25.610
so we're somewhere between 10 and

01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:28.160
infinity lives now through some

01:16:25.610 --> 01:16:32.300
combination of Guppies collar times two

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:40.670
9lives times three and one two to Judas

01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:43.610
shadows it's a little silly I mean that

01:16:40.670 --> 01:16:45.770
would be probably okay damage but how

01:16:43.610 --> 01:16:49.510
can you it's like the one situation in

01:16:45.770 --> 01:16:49.510
which glass cannon is actually excellent

01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:59.980
we've made it work and by we I mean the

01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:03.410
incredibly unique circumstances created

01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:08.810
by the game itself

01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:10.040
be nice if we had rubber cement milk is

01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:12.050
actually useless for us in this

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:15.500
situation and don't let the dairy Lobby

01:17:12.050 --> 01:17:22.580
tell you otherwise I think we're done

01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:24.700
save me no wait I had to say yes oh my

01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:29.360
god

01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:32.330
why do you have to say yes because if

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:36.250
you don't say yes you only get the

01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:36.250
achievement when you start the final run

01:17:37.450 --> 01:17:40.850
well this is the last Isaac run I'm

01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:42.650
gonna play for the rest of my natural

01:17:40.850 --> 01:17:43.820
life I hope you enjoyed it if you did

01:17:42.650 --> 01:17:44.990
click the like button helps out a great

01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:45.950
deal of course subscribe you wanna see

01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:49.030
more in the future for now thanks for

01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:49.030
watching and I'll see you next time
