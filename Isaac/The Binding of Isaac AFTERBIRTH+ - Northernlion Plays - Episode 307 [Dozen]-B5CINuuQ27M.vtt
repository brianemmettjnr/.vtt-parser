00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.899
everybody a well connected online plays

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.200
a binding of issac entereth Plus last

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.320
run bit of an aberration hopefully it

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:18.390
was no damage Oh God

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:19.859
no HP K 1 FZ 9 4 2 2 with ok damage more

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.300
damage than we finished our last run

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:27.330
with and a good rate of fire but now a

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.970
principle concern becomes the lack of HP

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.180
at our disposal however this is actually

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.670
I mean we won the last run but as

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.090
compared to the last run this one seems

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.860
like substantially more plausible of a

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.280
victory so that should be encouraging

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.719
above all else we were able to win that

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.700
weird blood rights run with dr. fetus

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.070
and 2 point 5 2 damage we should have a

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.590
decent shot and making our dreams come

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.660
true on today's run as well I would love

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.449
to get the peace of mind of being not

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.100
one champion hit away from death you

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.110
know two bombs pretty much guarantees

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.430
that one bomb probably puts us in a good

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.200
spot because we got one since it rock

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.299
but there's a second tinted rock in that

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.860
other room one of those has got to pay

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.540
out of spirit hearts it's it's

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.920
inconceivable that one of them wouldn't

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.450
so just give me the chance the other oh

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.040
I don't know how I feel about this I

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:28.439
like get these guys as far away as

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:33.329
possible from me and then maybe use the

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.799
ponies active effects yeah I didn't

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.689
really want to because I want to save it

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.369
for the boss but I kind of got myself

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.470
trapped in a corner there so I don't I

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.790
don't feel like we made the wrong

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.439
decision there and if we take a half

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.030
heart of damage we can always get

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.250
another charge rate for the boss fight

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.869
anyway potentially okay so that is

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.220
actually enough money to buy a spirit or

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.110
from the shop I'm sorry if I saying

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.270
sound like a little panicked right now

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.899
but if I'm being honest I am a little

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.880
panicked right now because this is a

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.079
tricky run ok the full heart there is at

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.049
least somewhat useful let me close

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.280
Twitter here because they just started

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.890
live-streaming a baseball game on it hey

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.710
you know good for them not really what

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.510
I'm interested in look at that 5 bombs

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.310
pack it open there's a spirit heart

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.590
let's crack this open in celebration

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.600
look at that 13 cents six bombs this

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.890
might be I mean it's a little premature

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.980
but it might be enough to give us the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.810
wind basically outright small Rock would

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.100
be nice but dude the more spirit hearts

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:40.460
the merrier here yet delicate run like

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:43.860
very very delicate run but here we are

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.750
now in like a pretty much demonstrably

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.890
better position than we ever got to on

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.150
our last year I'm not going to harp on

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.850
the last run too much because the last

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.860
run ended up being a lot of fun as well

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.330
I realized we have petrified petrified

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.130
poop as well right now so we should be

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.930
cracking up on poops than ever possible

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.490
but last run ended up being fun if

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.370
admittedly extremely strange it's

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.440
usually a secret room and I guess we'll

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.210
donate a key because I didn't even

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.330
notice that guy was there until it was

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.010
too late what do you think shop here

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:19.700
the floors got to be relatively small

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:21.780
there's our shop let's grab the map

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.100
we're not going to have a charge ready

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.230
for the boss fight and I think that that

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.170
is completely okay I'm just happy to be

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.880
alive at this point does this run any

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.000
run you know you could start me with

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.680
mega one HP and I'd be I'd be concerned

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.200
in fact I might be more concerned than

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.870
just having great stats and one HP

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.520
considering mega can cause you to you

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.800
know locomote in the wrong direction at

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.130
times not quite gonna be at 5 cents

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:50.310
apparently we're going to fight famine

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:52.080
we botched the bomb drop pretty badly

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.180
especially considering there's a tinted

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.610
rock up here but you know what it's a

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.040
luxury position we find ourselves in

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.890
being able to make a mistake without it

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.720
being catastrophic now with all this

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.040
being said I'm in a good mood you know

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.960
I've been playing Isaac lately and I've

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.640
been playing pretty well getting good

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:14.960
daily finishes top one or two percent

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:17.850
and I I will always love you

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.959
[Music]

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.640
it's probably not going to get me sued

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.070
that's my guess nobody even knows that

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.270
song it's not like the most popular song

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.110
in the history of planet Earth or

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.640
anything what is the most popular song

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.200
in the history of planet Earth do you

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.390
think it's Gangnam style or like

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.820
Beethoven's fifth symphony by the way

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.650
both of those in contention on the final

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:43.260
ballot for my favorite song of all time

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:46.300
as well if only someone could combine

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:50.290
they told them sit Symphony and Gangnam

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:54.970
style Oh

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:58.540
oboe Oh oppa Gangnam style Oh fuff stop

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:01.650
stop this you're disrespecting psy one

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:05.020
of the most talented artists of all time

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:12.940
by comparing him to a Beethoven didn't

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:17.650
even sing Oh believe you me I'm tempted

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:19.660
I'm tempted to use our white pony effect

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.870
here but I figured we might as well save

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.220
it for the second half of this hello in

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.240
hindsight it's actually the opposite of

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.300
what we should do because we get a

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.760
charge midway through but whatever we're

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:36.610
feeling great the orbitals nice but it

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:39.070
is it's tiny and we're pretty mobile

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.979
which is great except you know the lack

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.560
of friction here sort of makes it easier

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:46.360
to accidentally walk into enemies when

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.770
using your orbital but I'll admit you

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.160
know with the amount of HP that we have

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:54.490
especially with the Hierophant hooking

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:58.479
us up here here athon judgement world

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:00.070
why use the world card man especially

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:04.360
with the hero font backing us up I feel

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:08.590
pretty compelled to like use our orbital

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:10.419
as much as possible but if this is DPS

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.240
oh I'll change my tune pretty quickly

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:17.650
and still incentivizes getting pretty

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.970
close to enemies unfortunately well

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.020
unfortunately for them because we're

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.990
going to kill them hopefully not

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.690
unfortunately for us

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.250
we've got our boss fight the boss is

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.199
going to get pooped on didn't quite die

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.610
in the first little salvo there which is

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:33.400
a little surprising to me but please

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.229
know Krampus just damaged I've earned a

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:41.620
run that pops off right from the get-go

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:44.110
let's go is brimstone meet the cop who

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.860
can't be stopped this is an amazing

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.169
start

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.509
I'll dull our damage still sucks we are

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:51.130
in a great position here to make good

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:52.660
things happen on this right now if only

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.389
this happened at some point on the last

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.870
run when we had spoon bender we'd be off

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:57.870
to the races

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:04.150
instead we're just like in a great spot

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:07.870
which is also still completely fine and

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:09.520
you know if nothing else I say you have

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.410
nothing else but really like brimstone

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.210
does a lot more than this for us but if

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.620
nothing else it definitely enables a

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.990
little bit more efficient usage of

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.669
petrified poop and has me getting a

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.699
little closer to that double digit

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:24.430
streak which is to be fair cobalt is on

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:25.660
like a 110 win streak of Eden or

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:29.409
something as of the recording of this

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:33.639
video but I was on a negative 5 or

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:36.940
negative 6 run as of oh we already did

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:40.030
that room as of about a week ago again

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:42.460
via the time of this recording or as of

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:45.430
the time of this recording so I'm

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.740
feeling a lot better about my chances

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:52.000
and I as it can sure is this a free win

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:53.259
probably should we feel amazing about

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.900
the fact that we're probably going to

00:07:53.259 --> 00:07:57.639
win on this run no but you got a bank

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.409
those free runs when they come that's

00:07:57.639 --> 00:08:01.810
the thing you got it you want to get a

00:07:59.409 --> 00:08:03.550
good streak going you got to win the the

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:05.409
winnable runs and then you got to win

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:07.270
the loser bowl I mean that's the general

00:08:05.409 --> 00:08:08.740
gist of it like we're going to John

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:11.620
Madden now you got to win the winnable

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.909
one then the loser bull ones I've been

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.470
doing a pretty good job of losing the

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:16.330
winnable ones and losing the loser bull

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:19.750
runs but we pulled that back from the

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:25.090
brink lately I have not gone to the item

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:26.490
room where is this item room it's a

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:30.460
surprise

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:34.599
William Shatner impression did you know

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:37.690
William Shatner is Canadian

00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:40.149
that's the darn truth man I'm not even

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:45.970
joking with you we did find our item

00:08:40.149 --> 00:08:47.620
room you know what like it's really good

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:52.600
but let's go for something a little bit

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:54.040
better because we have the time to do so

00:08:52.600 --> 00:09:00.430
I'm going for something even better than

00:08:54.040 --> 00:09:00.699
dogtooth no that's not it oh okay here

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:04.269
we go

00:09:00.699 --> 00:09:06.459
so brimstone tiny planet is not the

00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:07.899
weirdest setup you can get but pretty

00:09:06.459 --> 00:09:10.509
weird and it also gives us a nice little

00:09:07.899 --> 00:09:13.180
shield to protect us in some situations

00:09:10.509 --> 00:09:15.490
as well which probably doesn't mean all

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:17.050
that much when you consider it but is

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.819
worth something and we actually get a

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:20.410
rear spoiler for choice like big fan

00:09:18.819 --> 00:09:23.290
being the worst of the four items we saw

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:25.029
is actually fairly ridiculous because

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:25.509
big fan is a decent item in its own

00:09:25.029 --> 00:09:27.940
right

00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:29.860
big fan is like the item you grow to

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.209
hate as you become an Isaac hipster

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.990
you're like I don't like that big

00:09:31.209 --> 00:09:36.610
orbital why will if I get sack dagger

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:38.560
behind it in the orbital order that it

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:41.949
slows down the rotation of sac dagger

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:47.560
I'm not going to say that that's not a

00:09:41.949 --> 00:09:49.750
concern but it's a concern like come on

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:52.779
basically you know that's like some

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:54.310
motor trend stuff I got a survey like a

00:09:52.779 --> 00:09:56.199
legitimate surveys I know when you say

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:59.110
like a I got surveyed over the phone

00:09:56.199 --> 00:10:02.410
it's like a scam basically vinayan we

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:05.470
own a Ford automobile I know very very

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:07.300
little about cars so sometimes when I

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:09.970
tell people I own a Ford they go like oh

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:11.589
hell yeah buddy thanks for supporting

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:12.639
American Motorsports and I go you're

00:10:11.589 --> 00:10:14.620
welcome but I don't know what you're

00:10:12.639 --> 00:10:16.689
talking about and sometimes they go Wow

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:19.269
why didn't you buy a Mazda 3 and I go I

00:10:16.689 --> 00:10:20.620
don't know that's a good question if

00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:22.060
someone had told me you're supposed to

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:25.389
buy a Mazda 3 I would have bought a

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:28.959
Mazda 3 let's go dull razor like we

00:10:25.389 --> 00:10:31.149
don't have anything that works with dull

00:10:28.959 --> 00:10:32.740
razor yet but it's a great item did you

00:10:31.149 --> 00:10:36.689
know to build on plus we're fast enough

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:39.399
to make this work but I got a call from

00:10:36.689 --> 00:10:42.459
the Ford Motor Company of Canada and

00:10:39.399 --> 00:10:44.920
they were like you know hey hey Ryan my

00:10:42.459 --> 00:10:46.689
name is Damian just wanted to a quick

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.160
little survey see how you feel about

00:10:46.689 --> 00:10:50.350
your Ford automobile

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.120
and I said alright and then he said

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:54.430
aren't so and just in general how do you

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:56.830
like the car and I was like is good and

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:58.570
then he said what in particular do you

00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:00.040
like about it and I said I don't know

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:02.590
I'm pretty close laitanan

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:05.230
it's got good gas mileage and then I

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:08.230
think the Dameon not his real name on

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:09.730
the other end of the phone realized I'm

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:13.450
gonna stick with the old razor for now

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:16.720
that he was talking to an idiot and he

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:18.010
said he kind of paused for a second like

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.410
he was waiting for me to fill in more

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:22.180
space and then he said well alright we

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:25.450
were just checking in thanks for letting

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:27.880
us know so there you go that's today's

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.750
episode of nl talks to a fellow adult on

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:34.660
the telephone

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:36.070
but in my defense first off I'm not

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.210
speaking for everybody here but I'm

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:39.820
speaking for a lot of people I don't

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:41.680
like to be called my satisfaction of

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:43.900
owning your product

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.400
it didn't markedly go down as a result

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:47.140
of our phone interaction and Damian

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:50.550
seemed like a perfectly nice individual

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:52.480
however I will say if you tell me that

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:54.280
Mazda won't call me

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.400
two years after purchase to ask how I

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.420
feel about the car then I would be

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.460
probably a little bit more tipped into

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:02.440
the Mazda Kamp admittedly that's that's

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:06.820
how much value not speaking on the phone

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:09.100
carries to me on a regular basis let's

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:12.220
inch closer to bookworm you know what

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:14.770
let's try this it totally worked so we

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:16.540
didn't have to do that but we can use

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.800
dull razor to take like no damage on the

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.840
way in but we'd probably still take

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:23.230
damage on the way out depending on how

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:25.360
we handled it the second thing is if you

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.590
got no series of questions to ask I'm

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.750
just going to make something up I'm not

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:30.480
going to lie to you

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:32.920
Ford Focus it's got great gas mileage

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:35.650
sometimes we'll be like leaving Seattle

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:38.770
to come back to Vancouver and it'll be

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:40.030
like you're going to need gas 70% of the

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.500
way through the trip and I go Kate do

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:42.910
you want to get gas and she goes I don't

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.770
think we'll need it I'm like man this

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:47.170
lady's crazy then we get up on the

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:49.060
highway and she's right by the time we

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.770
get home we still got like you know

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:54.340
thirty kilometers of gas left in the

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:57.250
tank so we can fill it up easily the gas

00:12:54.340 --> 00:13:00.280
mileage on that thing is pretty good but

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:01.260
at the same time I'm a millennial car

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:04.200
owner

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:08.570
it doesn't need repairs and it gets me

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:12.150
where I need to go let's be honest

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:13.920
Damien I'm just driving the forward

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:18.210
until Tesla comes out with an affordable

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:20.130
electric car that looks cool and gives

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:21.870
me like some social credit for driving

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:24.630
it because like we're not quite there

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:26.250
I'm not going to drop $100,000 on a

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:32.880
Tesla Model S who do you think I am

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:33.390
Reggie Watts I'm not there yet let's

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.210
crank it

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:36.870
Oh let's go okay so I am gonna go with

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:40.680
that for now

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:42.720
feel free to replace or I will feel free

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.860
to feel free to replace this if they

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.210
give me something that works with dull

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.350
razor over the course of this floor but

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:48.120
Gabi's head is good enough to hold

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.800
especially when you know I hate to say

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:53.160
it but our damage despite having

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.660
brimstone is just okay for the stage

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.600
that we're adding the game but anyway

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:59.010
I'm not that I'm complaining I didn't

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.780
say that to Damian over the phone and

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:02.400
maybe I should have but you know I feel

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:05.370
like Damian didn't ask for that

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:07.830
happiness right like Damian I know

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:09.150
you're not you know Ford Lee Iacocca but

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.530
at the same time when you guys coming

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:12.210
out with an electric car you know

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:17.910
Damien's not privy to that information

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:20.760
in all likelihood continue exploring

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:22.320
here Fred I don't like to receive

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.690
telephone because I put you on the spot

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:27.000
if you had told me I mean that's a

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:29.010
better choice right now what I would

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.640
love is an email that says hey we're

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:33.870
going to call you at this time a week

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.130
from now and then I would have prepared

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:37.070
an answer I would have been like hello

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:40.920
Damian I've heard a lot about you

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:45.210
on today's telephone call I'm going to

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:46.530
bring up a whirring a jarring shaking

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:49.110
sound that the transition decay

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:50.820
transmission occasionally makes as well

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:53.700
as complement the gas mileage of my ford

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:56.010
motor vehicle product you may prepare a

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:59.880
dossier of answers to deal with this as

00:14:56.010 --> 00:15:01.440
well I also though I think that the they

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:05.340
call you again

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:08.310
I don't know cars I think they think

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:10.560
that I'm gonna buy another car when I

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:13.249
pay off this one I gotta let them know

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:15.779
that doesn't make any sense

00:15:13.249 --> 00:15:18.420
that's like if you go to a restaurant

00:15:15.779 --> 00:15:19.649
and you eat your meal and then you're

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:21.359
like I get the bill please and you pay

00:15:19.649 --> 00:15:23.069
for it and they're like alright cool so

00:15:21.359 --> 00:15:24.299
what do you have next you don't

00:15:23.069 --> 00:15:27.660
understand I'm full

00:15:24.299 --> 00:15:29.790
I am car full for like possibly ten

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:33.869
years hopefully ten years you know that

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:36.600
would be awesome the neck I wanna I want

00:15:33.869 --> 00:15:39.089
to ride this one until self-driving cars

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:42.029
become more prevalent and acceptable and

00:15:39.089 --> 00:15:44.160
you know it exists if you think I'm

00:15:42.029 --> 00:15:46.529
going to you trying to milk as many like

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:48.929
focus purchases what have you changed

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:50.220
the car is existed is current form for

00:15:48.929 --> 00:15:53.790
quite a long time what kind of

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:56.579
revolutions do you have olds six-speaker

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:59.069
oh the balance between the front and the

00:15:56.579 --> 00:16:05.639
back why okay I don't care it doesn't

00:15:59.069 --> 00:16:06.839
matter Lee Iacocca call me you can call

00:16:05.639 --> 00:16:08.339
me many things but don't call me late

00:16:06.839 --> 00:16:11.850
for dinner but Damien you can call me

00:16:08.339 --> 00:16:16.470
again when you have a car that drives

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:18.480
itself or when you have a car that

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:20.160
requires no gasoline even better if it

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.040
requires no electricity like if it just

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.689
required like putting a bottle of Dasani

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.829
in it or something to start it up I'd be

00:16:24.689 --> 00:16:29.309
all over it

00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:30.569
until then Damien you know what enjoy

00:16:29.309 --> 00:16:32.519
your job because you seem like a hard

00:16:30.569 --> 00:16:35.239
worker this tangent has gone off or gone

00:16:32.519 --> 00:16:35.239
on far too long

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:46.850
I always like driving if you don't drive

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:48.980
I feel no you should feel no

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:51.769
embarrassment you know Rob does not

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:53.330
drive and I see these 26 I think he

00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:57.170
doesn't have a driver's license people

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:58.640
in the chat when they figure that out or

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:00.529
when he says it's not like he's ashamed

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.660
of it go like oh my god how can you be

00:17:00.529 --> 00:17:04.400
like an adult and not drive the dude

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:06.380
eats off of paper plates and chat goes

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.819
oh yeah that's pretty reasonable he

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.530
doesn't want to do dishes so he doesn't

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:12.679
know how to drive a highly-specialized

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:14.480
automobile a piece of machinery at least

00:17:12.679 --> 00:17:17.449
people go what is wrong with this guy we

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:20.689
got we got backwards social norms in

00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:23.270
this society but anyway I completely

00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:24.800
understand you know if you live in New

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:28.069
York City you've got public transit

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:29.660
everywhere you don't need to drive we

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:30.890
essentially got it I mean I learned to

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:33.890
drive because I grew up in a smaller

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:38.660
town and then beyond that people always

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:40.460
like the like 20% of you who don't drive

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:42.230
will hopefully relate to this if you

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.390
don't drive people always make up like

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:45.890
hilarious situations in which you will

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:47.600
need to drive in the future that I have

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:50.450
never seen happen in the real world

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:53.540
they're always like well what if your

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:56.870
wife or girlfriend knows how to drive so

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:58.910
she drives everywhere but one day she's

00:17:56.870 --> 00:18:03.669
in labor so she can't drive and you have

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:06.679
to drive her to the hospital well all I

00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:08.690
call a taxi or an ambulance or something

00:18:06.679 --> 00:18:10.700
you know I I mean I'm not trying to make

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:12.530
this a political single-payer healthcare

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:14.630
thing but we live in Canada so that's me

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:18.110
it probably would be a it would be

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:19.309
considered perhaps a little outlandish

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:22.550
to use an ambulance to go to the

00:18:19.309 --> 00:18:23.750
hospital for a routine baby delivery but

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:25.240
I actually don't know that might be

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:28.669
completely normal

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:32.510
and I mean I suppose that did literally

00:18:28.669 --> 00:18:34.490
happen in peep show but I don't think

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:36.919
this situation you know what I want to

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:41.620
try to make boss rush even though seems

00:18:36.919 --> 00:18:41.620
not super likely that's going to happen

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:49.790
well what if you know your your spouse

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:51.500
who does the driving as a heart attack

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:54.950
and you have to drive into the hospital

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:56.870
you know I think I guess if that

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:58.970
happened to me right now I would be like

00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:00.470
sweet I have a driver's license I do all

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:02.450
the driving is there not all the drive

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:05.300
and do much of the driving between Kaden

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:07.100
myself she's a capable driver as well at

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:08.720
least I'm not worried about like

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.040
learning how to drive while driving but

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:12.610
I think the first thought that crossed

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:15.800
my mind would be like oh my god

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:20.870
my wife had a heart attack this is like

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:23.450
I wouldn't be thinking thank God 12

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:25.040
years ago I got my driver's license and

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.840
now I'm because if you like got your

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:29.360
driver's license you're 15 and then it

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:31.660
happened when you were 55 I don't think

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:34.550
you're going to be like thank God in

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:37.340
1972 I learned how to drive a Ford Pinto

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:41.150
so now I'm capable of what is this GPS

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:45.230
you know so you know what like I don't

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:47.480
let society shame you into being forced

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:52.670
to learn how to drive now is it a useful

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:54.650
skill yeah I I'm not one of those

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:56.360
weirdos who takes pleasure from driving

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:59.750
most of the time you know who you are oh

00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:01.970
I love the thrill of the open road as I

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:04.390
you know no I'm not all about that every

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:07.190
time I get in the car I just think of

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:09.650
the screeching of metal on metal and

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:11.900
broken glass and the jaws of life and

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:13.820
you know Lovell adzan

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:16.370
melody Nelson or something like that but

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:18.110
that's a motorcycle you get the idea

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:21.590
thank God for the range upgrade right

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:22.820
but you don't need to you don't need to

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:24.140
be shamed into it if you live into a

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:27.620
place or if you live in a place that's

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:29.300
got good public transit it's also like

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.160
this I felt like there was a great

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.570
charade like my parents when I was

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.830
growing up and I'm glad they did it

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:34.970
because I probably wouldn't have done it

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:37.250
myself but they're like you got to get

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:42.710
your driver's license I was like oh it's

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:46.940
like a parody of most teenagers mum and

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:49.820
I want extra freedom can you just drive

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:52.520
me everywhere but I'm glad that they

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:53.960
that they did but then like as soon as I

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.670
got my driver's license they were like

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:59.030
don't drive anywhere

00:20:55.670 --> 00:21:02.210
never by a car driving is dangerous and

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:07.310
cars are expensive you should just not

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:08.570
do it it's like well the hell as far as

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:09.920
I'm concerned if you want to play the

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:11.660
like security role we should all be

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.460
getting pilots licenses man what if

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:15.170
you're on an airplane and you know

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:16.820
nobody else bought tickets and then the

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:19.610
pilot and the copilot both ate at the

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:21.740
same place for dinner and they got food

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:27.590
poisoning it's really only person on the

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:29.180
flight they probably cancel it but it's

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:30.440
probably happened there we go that's

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:32.420
what we're looking for a teleport card

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:35.420
okay let's go let's go

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:40.940
butter no let's not go let's go

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:42.470
I think we can do this pretty easily I

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:44.870
can't believe this is two runs in a row

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:47.390
we're still waiting on our first damage

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:49.790
upgrade actually NL you got a blood clot

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:52.850
on the last episode you're not wrong I

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:57.350
had about negative 22 seconds to use it

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:59.900
and then on top of that blood clot is

00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:02.390
not actually a statistical damage up and

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:05.930
this is a bit of nitpicking but it just

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:12.770
gives you tears that are twice as

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:14.800
damaging every other shot come on come

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:14.800
on

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:20.860
he's done it he's done it literally by

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:23.890
one second grab this going we got

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:25.870
algae's glass cannon haha good one

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:27.490
grab the fool card we're going to get

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:28.600
the heck out of here well gettin the

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:30.790
heck out of here because the game is

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.410
showing me no respect and I'm not even

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:33.970
pulling like a Rodney Dangerfield right

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:36.940
now I'm just being honest with you give

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:39.610
me a damage upgrade you little bee I'm

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:41.440
old enough to be your Creator and yet

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:42.610
here you are giving me no damage

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.020
upgrades with two runs in a row sure

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:45.130
last row me and mom's knife we didn't

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.930
really get the use of that much but we

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:48.010
did have mom's knife and we have blood

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:50.740
rights that actually worked out really

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:54.070
well for us and we had dr. fetus we

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:55.960
weren't exactly hurting although we did

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:58.480
almost die because it was still

00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:00.940
relatively not great and then on this

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:06.100
run sure we got brimstone but we got no

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:10.870
extra damage no was possible to get two

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:14.100
runs in a row with no damage starting to

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:14.100
approach ridiculousness

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:22.150
okay accidentally took curse died which

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.950
shouldn't make no difference whatsoever

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:25.420
with brimstone now that I think about it

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:28.510
but did freak me out pretty good for a

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:30.400
second there with our HP sort of

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:31.780
dwindling you might think that I'm

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.310
getting a little anxious here but that's

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:35.530
not the case you know I feel it pretty

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:41.560
relaxed from the driving conversation

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:43.600
that we just had you know the real

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:46.240
reason to learn how to drive is that one

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.010
day you might be the oldest person on

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.690
earth you might be the only person from

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:52.210
a generation that existed before

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:56.190
self-driving cars and then if a big

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:58.300
freaking like solar flare hits earth and

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:59.920
short-circuits all the electronics and

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.670
sets us back to the Stone Age or

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:03.430
something like that

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:04.720
at least well most of the cars will not

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:07.180
work because they have you know on-board

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:11.170
electronics as well but if you find an

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:14.680
old enough vehicle you will be the lord

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:17.350
of the land what I was going to say is

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:20.290
uh you think I might be a little

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:23.710
concerned about this run I'm not really

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:28.210
because straight up

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:31.240
we respawn it's dark Judas if we die

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:34.660
once so that's something that's actually

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:36.400
like keeping me going right now is the

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:38.230
idea that if we die now we got a health

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.000
upgrade to go along with it but if we

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:42.550
die we'll come back as dark Judas and

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.140
then like no matter what our damage will

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:46.240
actually be better so this might

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:49.870
actually be a great opportunity to make

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:52.090
that happen we need to find some fires

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:54.940
or spikes or something like that but

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:58.060
there's enough HP in the vicinity here

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:59.680
for me to want to do this and if we can

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.820
become guffy in the process as well that

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.580
would be awesome hopefully it doesn't

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:05.290
require nine lives because I don't want

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:08.280
to die nine times to get double damage

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:08.280
but we'll take what we can get

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:14.110
polydactyl has given us the Emperor

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:17.050
that's very very good for Speed purposes

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:18.520
at least take that so we'll take the

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:22.240
razor blade and the reason we take the

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:23.680
razor blade because it allows us to hurt

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.760
ourselves like that I mean I guess you

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:34.300
could just walk into the fire anyway but

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:36.490
and we die come back as dark juice our

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:41.320
damage doubled even though it looks like

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:43.150
it went down because that's because we

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:46.210
had three razor blade charges and then

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:49.420
our HP is like roughly the same and

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:53.560
we'll head down here Emperor car best

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:55.030
used on the Cathedral but we could use

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:58.000
it on I mean we could use it on this

00:25:55.030 --> 00:26:02.800
floor but we could use it on the camp

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:04.750
fly on the the chest if we really think

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:08.110
we're going to die just use it on the

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:10.000
chest you'll get less items and actually

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:13.500
like having six luck I'd really prefer

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.500
not to use it on the chest

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:25.760
but we'll see we'll see for now it's

00:26:24.409 --> 00:26:28.640
good probably not going to fight hush

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:32.630
and like for the first time in about an

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:34.280
hour I feel like our run like an hour of

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:37.669
game time I feel like our run is

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:40.340
actually capable encompassing here it's

00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:45.340
like a breath of fresh air seven damage

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:48.710
is it my birthday uh yeah okay dim bulb

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:50.570
it might seem like it's not that

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:51.860
valuable right now I mean it should seem

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:53.270
like it's valuable because of the stats

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:55.309
but it might seem like Maggie's faith is

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:56.809
better just remember we don't get that

00:26:55.309 --> 00:26:59.080
much more value out of Maggie's faith

00:26:56.809 --> 00:27:01.309
maybe two HP but we've already got one

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:04.970
heart holding it down for us here

00:27:01.309 --> 00:27:07.280
regardless we did get a deal this is a

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:09.159
great time for Gumby to exist but no

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.440
such luck

00:27:09.159 --> 00:27:13.520
alright well let's do this the fun way

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.659
at least as fun as you can get with

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:16.370
brimstone here it is going to be a

00:27:14.659 --> 00:27:18.470
faster run whether it's a win or a loss

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:22.640
you go into this room you teleport out

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:23.990
teleport out because I did not see a

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:26.809
tinted rock on there

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:28.490
may have been mistaken but seeing is

00:27:26.809 --> 00:27:30.580
there were zero rocks I'm going to go

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:34.419
ahead and guess that the tinted rock

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:34.419
probably did not exist

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:41.870
this is the run that is you know

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:43.490
sometimes people go a Brimstone's not

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:46.030
that good NL you need damage to make

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:48.770
brimstone work and you go yeah okay I

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:50.450
see with your able as sandwich isn't

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:52.130
that good unless you put something in it

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:53.480
like obviously if you have brimstone

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:55.429
you're going to have damage along with

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:57.320
it this is the counter-argument to that

00:27:55.429 --> 00:28:01.659
we did make it work through dark Judas

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:06.919
but it took some time it took some time

00:28:01.659 --> 00:28:09.830
all right come on you may leave this is

00:28:06.919 --> 00:28:14.630
it what my Tomo leaving the office let's

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:16.789
get a bit what something something and

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:20.750
meow mix what see it works you just got

00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:26.600
to wait on it okay well we only had two

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:28.909
keys oh it's a pill pheromones well we

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:30.590
know it's going to be this way okay

00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:35.990
taking a team for the lower tier delay

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:42.080
ends bonus damage speed is through the

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:43.460
roof now - but copy well we could have

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:45.650
gotten bookworm if we played our cards

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:48.409
slightly differently but we didn't and

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:51.830
that's also okay more keys we want lazar

00:28:48.409 --> 00:28:52.940
eggs I mean to be honest with you I

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:57.100
don't really understand why I didn't

00:28:52.940 --> 00:29:00.340
pick up lazar eggs to begin with like it

00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:02.960
doesn't cost us anything to hold it and

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:04.370
just gives us a chance like I guess we

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:06.890
could just say hey we don't even need to

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:09.500
pop the algae's room until Lazarus or

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:10.700
rags brings us back from the dead and

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:14.780
when that happens then we can be like

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:16.159
okay get to get that algae's rune out

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:18.409
and we'll probably win because we have

00:29:16.159 --> 00:29:22.010
so much damage output from our orbitals

00:29:18.409 --> 00:29:23.270
primarily right now and finally we're

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:27.559
not a slouch in the damage-dealing

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:31.130
department as well but it's actually a

00:29:27.559 --> 00:29:32.900
really good useless book if we're going

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:35.600
to get a useless book I'm glad that we

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:38.690
got one that had some usefulness showed

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:40.880
us where the boss room was and allowed

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:43.320
us to finish this run in a bit of an

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:45.759
expedited fashion

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:49.389
which is what this one's built for this

00:29:45.759 --> 00:29:52.029
is like a glass cannon style I would say

00:29:49.389 --> 00:29:54.909
that probably if we did not come on

00:29:52.029 --> 00:29:56.859
though if we did not get dark Judas this

00:29:54.909 --> 00:30:03.309
run would have been maybe only like a

00:29:56.859 --> 00:30:06.700
75% chance to win which probably sounds

00:30:03.309 --> 00:30:13.749
overly optimistic but I don't I mean 75%

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:15.700
is pretty bad in Isaac terms considering

00:30:13.749 --> 00:30:18.450
people are popping off you know 100 win

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.450
streaks right now

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:30.600
but with the Winstar Judas is basically

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:33.390
a hundred percent so this is one in

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:36.059
which we will absolutely like 1 million

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:39.270
percent not go to void it's just this is

00:30:36.059 --> 00:30:41.970
a perfect run to just make it through to

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:43.650
the Isaac fight and then go off you know

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:45.960
and do our own business because the void

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:48.150
fight here strikes me as a really stupid

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:54.860
idea so like we definitely should not do

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:54.860
it but who are you calling a baby

00:30:58.179 --> 00:31:07.629
you get your mojo I get your baby Austin

00:31:04.299 --> 00:31:10.090
Powers anybody classic film franchise so

00:31:07.629 --> 00:31:14.820
why do this one is pride like there's

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:14.820
two conflicting emotions pride and guilt

00:31:15.299 --> 00:31:20.470
the pride I think we're happier with dim

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:24.159
bulb

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:26.440
the pride factor is I think I can get

00:31:24.159 --> 00:31:29.440
good enough with the items we'll get

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:32.889
down here to beat delirium we also stand

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:34.659
a decent chance to get a guppy item

00:31:32.889 --> 00:31:36.970
because they basically the the item pool

00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:51.970
becomes chaotic down here as if you have

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:54.009
Chaos magic mush uh balls of steel ah if

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:57.460
we become guppy we're probably said now

00:31:54.009 --> 00:31:59.440
you give me the flippin keys man of

00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:04.179
knowledge is the keys and just show me

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:06.399
the lock okay but you've shown me more

00:32:04.179 --> 00:32:09.850
keys which is not specifically what I

00:32:06.399 --> 00:32:18.879
asked for I really really do not want to

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:21.789
fight delirium first good stuff mom's

00:32:18.879 --> 00:32:24.580
key we really are just looking for

00:32:21.789 --> 00:32:29.039
things that give us spirit hearts which

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:33.639
is why I'm doing every single room cuz I

00:32:29.039 --> 00:32:34.779
tinted rocks and like I mean mom's key

00:32:33.639 --> 00:32:38.289
is okay if we're getting a lot of chests

00:32:34.779 --> 00:32:40.029
down here but tinted rocks and you know

00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:41.470
blue fires and skulls and stuff like

00:32:40.029 --> 00:32:43.240
that that's our bread and butter right

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:45.730
now that's what we're looking for booger

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:52.539
tears does nothing the luck upgrade I

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:54.279
mean should be good it's probably you

00:32:52.539 --> 00:32:55.960
know what if that's a boss fight up at

00:32:54.279 --> 00:32:59.200
the top here there's no way it's going

00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:04.360
to be delirium so yeah this this should

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:06.129
not be a plausible delirium fight the

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.419
adversary should get dusted relatively

00:33:06.129 --> 00:33:09.039
easily as long as we kill him before he

00:33:07.419 --> 00:33:12.080
fires a brimstone shot I'm feeling good

00:33:09.039 --> 00:33:15.200
poison shots by a Scorpio

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:16.330
it's just ok as of right now it's

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:21.110
looking like we're going to need a

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:22.430
decent delirium fight to win obviously I

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:24.470
wanted to get to the point where it's an

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:27.640
automatic victory more or less but not

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:27.640
quite there yet

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:32.690
we've got golden keys so that's

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:34.310
basically irrelevant I mean this could

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:36.290
be a delirium fight down here but all

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:42.170
these other boss fights could also

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:43.700
basically be delirium fights there's a

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:46.970
couple of cards that could do good stuff

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:48.830
for us like called runes actually

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:52.580
algae's would be nice and then there's

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:55.640
pills like I'm drowsy is really really

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:58.640
good against delirium as we saw on a

00:33:55.640 --> 00:34:05.330
previous daily so oh you didn't watch

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:09.950
that one and see how it is getting a lot

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:11.540
of like pretty difficult boss fights out

00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:14.510
of the way down here which is actually

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:17.210
really nice but I wouldn't be surprised

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:19.280
to get hit once or twice against the

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:24.110
lamb you know this enemies not a

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:26.540
complete joke so close so close we've

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:29.149
done it didn't get hit got bobs rotten

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:35.560
head what a classic I think we got to

00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:41.120
take a demons tale The Dream

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:44.750
give me an item luck ops then the dream

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:49.280
is we get the full HP on on black hearts

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:50.810
and then we're we're set I think we're

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:53.780
going to go to the like upper right side

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:55.940
of the map right now we did lose some

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:59.810
stats by getting rid of dim bulb dim

00:34:55.940 --> 00:35:01.490
bulb is a very very nice trinket when

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:04.430
you have an item that makes it you know

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:06.260
pop consistently and admittedly guppies

00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:08.150
head is an item that makes it pop

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:11.780
consistently so we had the dream there

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:13.610
but in our situation every demon heart

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:18.440
could be the difference between like a

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:20.210
win and a loss so we're going to pick up

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:22.430
as many of those as prudent

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:25.250
similarly like that tinted rock paying

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:30.859
out with not a demon heart could be the

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:34.069
difference between a loss and a win this

00:35:30.859 --> 00:35:35.660
run as things have gotten you know more

00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:37.670
intense down the line here it's kept my

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:39.650
engagement which you don't get to say

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:42.349
that much about every brimstone run you

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:45.170
know usually brimstone I mean let's be

00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:46.490
honest it's worth it but I hate that I

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:48.609
took damage they're trying to get out of

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:51.980
the way weekend flying out though

00:35:48.609 --> 00:35:56.180
usually brimstone runs you know they are

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:58.400
just great it's not a bad thing wouldn't

00:35:56.180 --> 00:36:04.640
mind having just a super overpowered

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:06.710
brimstone run right now this one's a

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.309
little bit for better or worse more

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:13.339
engaging

00:36:07.309 --> 00:36:16.849
probably not delirium sweet just one

00:36:13.339 --> 00:36:19.130
last guppy item I don't care if it

00:36:16.849 --> 00:36:24.760
effectively makes fate not worth taking

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:24.760
I want that guppy item

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:34.670
shielded tears is also really good and

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:36.770
is actually particularly strong against

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:39.890
underline picking up keys we have a

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:44.840
golden key on what is by necessity the

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:50.990
final floor but this also should not be

00:36:44.840 --> 00:37:00.880
delirium bracket open dude no troll

00:36:50.990 --> 00:37:03.770
bombs it's a good start monstro - we

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:05.560
will really like shielded tears I think

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:09.130
against an enemy like delirium that has

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:15.260
bullet held properties but careful

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:16.850
better closer warmer please tell me

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:23.090
there's nothing on the other side we're

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:25.640
good could be delirium I don't know now

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:28.250
we get to the point where earlier on I

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:29.750
wasn't I had low expectations so if I

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:32.360
was like I've I got delirium who cares

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:33.500
now I'm like I could win this run so I

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:35.000
don't want to fight the lyrium yet

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:37.940
because if we lose a run we could win

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.010
there's a great association of shame

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:43.940
that comes with that so we got a we got

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:45.530
to fight back against that chance you

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:47.210
you could say that the tick is worth

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:48.980
taking into the delirium fight and you

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:51.290
may be right for taking off some of the

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:53.750
boss's HP especially if it takes off a

00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:55.190
static 15% because I thought that's how

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:58.700
it worked is like it took fifteen

00:37:55.190 --> 00:38:01.160
percent of every boss's HP if it takes

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:04.250
15% of deliriums HP it's like

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:08.690
extraordinarily worth taking but I

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:10.400
wouldn't rule out the possibility that

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:14.450
this was just a judgment call and

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:16.810
luckily worked but he's done it it's

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:16.810
guppy

00:38:18.289 --> 00:38:25.369
this might not even be delirium to be

00:38:21.799 --> 00:38:28.519
fair but if it takes 15% that's a time

00:38:25.369 --> 00:38:30.229
but if it doesn't we'd rather have demon

00:38:28.519 --> 00:38:32.029
tail because I think demon tail still

00:38:30.229 --> 00:38:33.559
gives us a chance if somehow we get

00:38:32.029 --> 00:38:37.459
something that can spawn red hearts they

00:38:33.559 --> 00:38:38.779
could spawn they could spawn demon

00:38:37.459 --> 00:38:41.209
hearts instead which are like

00:38:38.779 --> 00:38:42.529
drastically more likely to be useful so

00:38:41.209 --> 00:38:49.939
that was damage we can't afford to take

00:38:42.529 --> 00:38:56.119
for being being honest well there's only

00:38:49.939 --> 00:38:58.640
two boss locations left the one at the

00:38:56.119 --> 00:39:02.959
end is much more likely to be delirium I

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:04.189
think well to be honest with you we

00:39:02.959 --> 00:39:08.059
might actually prefer to go with

00:39:04.189 --> 00:39:09.799
something like the triple-a battery I

00:39:08.059 --> 00:39:13.039
can never remember those triple-a

00:39:09.799 --> 00:39:17.509
battery actually give you the ability to

00:39:13.039 --> 00:39:18.619
spawn extra charges on a one charged

00:39:17.509 --> 00:39:21.319
item as long as you're in a room that

00:39:18.619 --> 00:39:23.239
has enemies on it I thought it did devil

00:39:21.319 --> 00:39:28.489
is worth taking in I don't really care

00:39:23.239 --> 00:39:29.089
what our luck stats like right now who

00:39:28.489 --> 00:39:31.699
cares

00:39:29.089 --> 00:39:32.989
okay mr. Fred so we definitely are going

00:39:31.699 --> 00:39:35.089
to fight delirium we're fighting them

00:39:32.989 --> 00:39:40.119
last that's the best-case scenario it's

00:39:35.089 --> 00:39:42.979
exactly what you want to have happen and

00:39:40.119 --> 00:39:47.630
expose Evo should be functionally worth

00:39:42.979 --> 00:39:53.569
nothing so this is going to be I think a

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:56.390
bit of a knock-down drag-out fight the

00:39:53.569 --> 00:39:58.569
obvious thing is if we die once we're

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:58.569
done

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:15.240
and so far it's going real well but okay

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:17.130
that's what you got to watch out for we

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:24.750
could bail with a fool card that there's

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:28.590
absolutely no point to doing so except

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:31.470
for bravado if we wanted to fight we

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:33.030
wanted to fight void or delirium sorry

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:35.400
twice for some reason

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:38.280
turns out I maybe shouldn't have been so

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:40.530
like concerned about it it actually

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:43.380
seems like we're going to win pretty

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:45.300
handily I got to thank I mean Guffey

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:48.290
obviously was a huge influence in that

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:50.790
but Big Ups to shielded tears as well

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:52.140
not always a ten out of ten item but

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:53.430
might have been a 12 out of 10 right

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:56.130
here that's even you might have said

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:58.670
eleven nah this is twenty percent better

00:40:56.130 --> 00:41:02.430
than the best side and we could fathom

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:04.500
and we just won okay we ever deemed our

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:06.210
good luck at some point in that run we

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:09.450
Adam banks did we were the spoiled rich

00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:10.680
kid who finished the run too early but

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:12.060
then we came back and we played our

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:13.860
heart out in the finals for Emilio

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:14.760
