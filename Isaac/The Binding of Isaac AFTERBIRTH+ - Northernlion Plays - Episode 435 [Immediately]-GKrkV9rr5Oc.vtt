00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.740
hey everybody welcome enter the land

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:09.780
please binding of issac afterbirth coal

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.429
us you plus me it doesn't equal us guess

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.400
I didn't know my calculus that's a song

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.010
by together a parody boyband from the

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.500
mid-2000s mostly it provided me with an

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.939
opportunity to figure out which

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.130
character we're gonna play as here I

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.990
think that we should do a Judas run and

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.029
we should do Judas negative which is

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.550
gonna be like I don't know dude I gotta

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.719
remember 1 HK PJ Toro feel like you ever

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.180
get the idea that there's like a punch

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.210
line somewhere in that string I just

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.460
can't figure it out for myself

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.070
j-200 dark bomb is like a million out of

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.500
ten here to start with all we need is

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.680
one and a half red hearts and we could

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.940
be off to the races not getting anything

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.360
there is a little bit of a bummer but

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.590
life goes on so the last run I've got to

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.930
worry a little bit about highway

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:03.329
blindness cuz the last run was like so

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:05.700
good it was greed Samson quad shot Plus

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.900
something ridiculous like we 19 damaged

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.159
or something like that right off the bat

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:16.290
we could die right here that was very

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.210
scary I was worried because I didn't

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.159
actually know if I had the the power to

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.659
the speed rather to dodge that guy over

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.840
and over but ended up getting lucky come

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.040
on give me a spirit art directly or give

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.509
me half a red heart and I'll pick it up

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.009
myself all right all right all right

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.229
all right we're gonna moon it up

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.920
buttercup baby just to let you down and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.420
the reason behind that was hoping we get

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.320
something that actually provided us with

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.659
a little bit of value right off the bed

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.619
but like yeah there we go okay yeah okay

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.720
um I don't want to play the slot machine

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.250
yet it's possible we can get a red heart

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.770
it's also possible we could get you know

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.119
a bomb it's possible we can get a lot of

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.090
things you know there's there's myriad

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.310
options there as opposed but I want to

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.600
for now not spend our money because we

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.920
could get an arcade in the next floor we

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.340
could get a key and want to go to our

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.540
shop on this floor and possibly buy a

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.540
red heart as a result of that

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.680
these enemies don't seem that bad yet

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.290
[Music]

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:21.100
IED we asked myself because I think I

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:24.070
was incorrect take it take it I trust

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.420
you now just give me a half read hard

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.760
and let me cruise away to victory here

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.800
sure we won't have a book of belial to

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.380
fight the boss I'm putting all my hopes

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.760
and dreams on you thank you um we want

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.570
to book a Belial to fight the boss but I

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.620
think that's okay I would rather have

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.780
had it for that room which I think it's

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.540
a little bit more complicated we got

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.840
pretty lucky here though I think Larry

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.880
jr. please little horn not too bad

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.320
basic version of little horn I mean we

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.690
got four point seven two damage right

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.730
off the bat that's pretty solid all he

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.290
needs to do is hit himself like two

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.840
times with a bomb and then we don't

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.530
really have to do very much work at all

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.180
fact he's already quite nearly dead oh

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.220
come on Kyle that was a close one not

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.490
this one no chance this one maybe let's

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.520
go magic 8-ball kinda garbage but it

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.640
does come with a world card which is not

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.230
as relevant as the moon I think all

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.720
right so we're in basically dark bomb

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.280
and saved this run and I'm a little sad

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.500
that it had to save it as early as it

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.710
did but I'm happy that we got the item

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:32.470
that is gonna potentially enable our

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:34.150
victory here you got a look at these we

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.410
actually healed a little bit on taking

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.230
nine lives the item that we've been

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.090
looking for like endlessly but can't

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.800
seem to find in most situations but dude

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.170
nine lives now is incredible this has

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.150
every ability I would say at this point

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.830
to be a successful Judas run we've got

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.900
two really really good defensive items

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.580
nine lives actually is not just good

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.560
defensively but awesome as a utility

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.030
item for for trading into deals with the

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.780
devil without really it being too

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:02.500
destructive but tractor beam is

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:04.150
completely okay here mostly for the

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.280
tiers upgrade but you know there's

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.540
potential fringe benefits here as well

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.100
either way we're off to the races I

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.590
always love when a Judas run you know

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.060
comes together it's one of those lines

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.660
you always hear at the end of a movie

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.609
leather when a plan comes together I'm

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.260
beginning to think this is the beginning

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.680
of a beaut

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:26.160
whoo friendship roll credits

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:29.850
I want to I want to run something by you

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.700
my wife is in Japan right now attending

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.950
the game show in Tokyo not a Japanese

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.810
game show it's a game convinced anyway

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:43.260
the point is that's irrelevant

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:46.740
would it be weird no would it be weird

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:50.130
if I went and saw the horror movie it's

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:53.600
by myself I'm gonna run something by you

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:56.250
when I was younger sometimes one of my

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.840
things I would do in college wake up

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.910
early is Shawn like a Saturday or a

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.590
Sunday go see a movie my friends don't

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.930
want to see by myself you know

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.370
so like Friday night I'll hanging out

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.170
with my friends hey you guys want to go

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.700
see district 9 tomorrow with just open I

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.220
think it could revolutionize the sci-fi

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.720
genre and you know signal the heralding

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.600
of one of the young talents of the film

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.280
industry they snow that's stupid so okay

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.800
I wake up at 11 a.m.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.210
go down watch the matinee by myself hey

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.050
you guys want to watch the follow-up to

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.210
Borat

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.910
I'm sure it's gonna be just as good if

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.720
not better no that's stupid that time

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.510
they were probably right

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.650
Bruno not necessarily a 10 out of 10 but

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.400
I had a fun time seeing that in the

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.230
theaters by myself nonetheless however

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.650
like I don't get bothered by eating

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.880
alone in a restaurant or being alone at

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.690
a movie theater but something about

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.720
watching a horror movie alone is weird

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:52.200
like I have become Jason Voorhees if I

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.730
go watch a horror movie by myself people

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.920
are gonna be like who's that guy with

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:58.650
nobody he's not with anybody's just

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.570
enjoying a film I know you guys are

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.040
probably watching this and you know

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.430
people ask you things like this all the

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.710
time

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.120
and in the same vein and you go sweetie

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.040
just do whatever you want to have

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.840
confidence it's not really where I'm

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.090
coming at this from I mean I'm not you

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.460
know I I'll go out and do it if I feel

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:17.460
like I want to do it but is it stranger

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.700
this is this is I meant trying to get to

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.560
the core of the of the human issue here

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.300
is it stranger to watch a horror movie

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.070
in theaters by yourself than it is to

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.930
watch a comedy or an action film for

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.670
example because you know usually Kate

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.110
and I we're late on the superhero train

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.659
but we go

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.550
we don't really care about Joker just

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:36.840
yet I guess but um we're late on the

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.159
superhero train but we did you know I'm

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.169
a fan of the Marvel films in particular

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:41.970
so we'll go you know see we saw

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:43.500
guardians of the galaxy - like six weeks

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.699
after it came out there were a couple

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.080
people in the theater that were just

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:48.840
sitting by themselves and I was like you

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:52.340
know what not at all weird totally

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:55.650
normal but if we went and saw like

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.389
trying to think what would be like the

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.930
weirdest movie to see by yourself

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:03.479
I guess the weirdest movie to see by

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:07.409
yourself would be if an adult went to

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:11.219
see like a middle-aged adult male saw a

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:12.870
bad coming-of-age film directed at young

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:16.020
girls that would definitely be the

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.819
creepiest one right like if if someone

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.889
was in the theater watching wall-e by

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:21.960
themselves he would be like it's a work

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:25.199
of art of course they can go see Wally

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:27.120
but if your uncle went to the multiplex

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:30.030
by himself and watched Sisterhood of the

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.770
Traveling Pants - you'd be like Uncle

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:34.400
Jerry what are you doing it's just it

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:37.110
sends a weird message I just really like

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:40.009
Amber Tamblyn that's that's what's weird

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:42.500
about it Jerry that's the weird part

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:45.990
see I knew there was some meat in there

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:48.810
there's some kind of social strangeness

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:50.099
to get to um so we just won this run so

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.389
you better hope the commentaries on

00:07:50.099 --> 00:07:53.190
point otherwise it's a waste of our time

00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:56.039
might as well just call the episode here

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:57.120
uh which is probably a cardinal sin of

00:07:56.039 --> 00:07:59.490
entertainment just turn off your

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.020
televisions but I'm using reverse

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:05.300
psychology I can already tell it's gonna

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:10.050
be a true banger and you know what

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:11.430
fantastic you know what it's been a

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:13.020
while since we actually completed a

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:15.599
guppy transformation so I'm like very

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:18.270
for it and you know what I'm gonna take

00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:22.610
all the I found pills pills why not dude

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:24.599
it's like we're taking fish oil every

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:27.599
anti-inflammatory regimen well just take

00:08:24.599 --> 00:08:28.979
18 fish oil pills a day when you burp

00:08:27.599 --> 00:08:31.229
it's gonna smell like cat food for the

00:08:28.979 --> 00:08:35.699
rest of your life - a hearts not

00:08:31.229 --> 00:08:38.729
relevant chariot so we actually should

00:08:35.699 --> 00:08:40.849
take it a moment here because excuse me

00:08:38.729 --> 00:08:40.849
sir

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:47.440
we should take a moment because we have

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:52.300
not done hush so this is actually like a

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:54.760
very very good run for us to do a very

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.650
very good run for us to do hush we're

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.660
already very strong we have seven damage

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.770
without using book of Belial which

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:02.980
obviously we've thrown away

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:04.690
you're a font chariot it's fine if

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:06.730
anything sack boys kind of slowing us

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:09.460
down here but you know I'm not really in

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:11.740
the business of complaining so we might

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:13.240
be able to get hush wait we should be

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.530
able to get hush would be a better way

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.880
to describe that I don't think much can

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:19.000
stop us there's nothing that a hundred

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:21.880
men or more could ever do the line is

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.010
always weird to me you know it's gonna

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:26.380
take a lot to drag me away from you

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:29.770
there's nothing that a hundred men or

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:32.560
more could ever do why if the number is

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:35.350
irrelevant why specifically a hundred

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:38.920
why why not like there's nothing anyone

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:41.740
at all could ever do I guess it sends

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:44.080
the message that even a crowd could not

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.520
stop him but I'm gonna be honest I think

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.590
a hundred men can stop you from doing

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:50.710
pretty much anything if they if they put

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:56.110
their mind to it you know the Supreme

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:58.720
Court is like nine people so imagine

00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:00.250
like 11 Supreme Court's they could

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.700
overpower you physically even if you

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:04.960
were the World's Strongest Man which I

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:13.810
don't believe that the lead singer of

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:16.150
Toto is but it all comes back to this

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:18.100
great flight of the conchords lion in

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.840
the TV show not in the song you know

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.340
Bret writes a song about his prospective

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.770
girlfriend and he says you know I'd

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:26.620
climb the highest mountain for her and

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:28.420
then Jermaine goes well would you really

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:30.520
climb the highest mountain for and he

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.980
goes not it's a metaphor and Jermaine

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:34.930
says a metaphor for what and Bret says

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.850
for that I'd do anything for her and

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:38.830
then Jermaine says well would you climb

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:40.900
the highest mountain for and he says I

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:42.730
see your point I always thought that bit

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:44.440
was extremely good which is why I've

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:46.360
regaled it to you in such a monotone

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.030
sort of demeanor so that you could

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.770
appreciate it for yourself well this was

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:52.480
a bit of a whiff here I might have

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.120
wanted to reroll God's flesh but it

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.950
doesn't matter

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.990
I think we could save dice shard and

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.850
maybe use it to reroll boss rush for

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.650
example and get something dynamite out

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:01.910
of that we also have the potential to

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:05.540
save a lot of money right now which we

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:10.720
could actually use on our we can

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:14.779
actually use on our hush journey here

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:16.520
maybe re-roll all the items in boss rush

00:11:14.779 --> 00:11:18.380
we roll all the items in the shop we

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.450
roll a double item room and when we go

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:23.320
down to the blue womb you know the

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:25.580
world's our oyster however we do have

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.380
another thing potentially on the table

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:30.529
that I didn't really talk about but we

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:31.700
could theoretically maybe knock out mega

00:11:30.529 --> 00:11:34.700
Satan as well

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:36.290
no wait I was over I was under thinking

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.450
it I was like we could just go to the

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.890
self sacrifice room if we get enough HP

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:41.690
and then get teleported down but that

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:42.770
doesn't give us the mega Satan fight we

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.240
want the mega satan fight we're gonna

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:49.540
need dad's key and i don't know if we've

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:51.740
actually unlocked that or we could get

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:53.240
whatever the item is and I think it's

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.230
called duality it's been a while since

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.940
we've had it I don't even know if we've

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:58.850
unlocked it that gives us angel and

00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:00.529
devil deals and then walk into the angel

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:02.750
deal instead and hope that that works

00:12:00.529 --> 00:12:03.920
out for the best so I'm not gonna

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:06.440
min/max too much with this I'm just

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:12.620
gonna pop two of diamonds for the spare

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:14.570
18 cents the only reason we became guppy

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:16.130
was because of that Joker card so you

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:19.700
know we got to give some credit where

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:21.200
credit is due there but this is some of

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:24.110
the fastest that a run is popped off

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:26.510
recently post had pretty good item

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:29.390
immunity to explosions not likely to be

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:30.709
super relevant but if I'm being honest

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:34.850
when I look at this run right now I'm

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:36.950
thinking speed is I mean more damages

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:40.700
always lovely but speed is probably like

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:43.220
our number one concern here temporarily

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:45.560
at least if we can get to like 1.2 speed

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:47.720
no longer am i concerned the fact that

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.370
we can fly it's almost worth like you

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.950
know point to speed in and of itself but

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:53.330
just a little slow when it comes to to

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:57.680
dodging like to have a little bit more

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:59.360
quickness off the line I mean it's

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:02.180
definitely not worth paying 3 cents for

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:04.339
3 flies right now you know it's like I

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:06.209
want to be driving like a sports car but

00:13:04.339 --> 00:13:09.990
instead I'm driving

00:13:06.209 --> 00:13:12.119
a 2015 Ford Focus and don't get me wrong

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:15.929
I like the Ford Focus

00:13:12.119 --> 00:13:21.899
you know we drive one it sits thus far

00:13:15.929 --> 00:13:24.749
been a reliable automobile why not okay

00:13:21.899 --> 00:13:28.619
we got what we paid for it lots of flies

00:13:24.749 --> 00:13:31.199
out of it as well see we got in here

00:13:28.619 --> 00:13:33.119
though oh that felt like it was gonna

00:13:31.199 --> 00:13:34.649
freeze the game so we'll take little

00:13:33.119 --> 00:13:36.649
delirium we'll go down to zero HP

00:13:34.649 --> 00:13:38.999
because we can and then we'll grab this

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:39.990
and we want to make sure that we take

00:13:38.999 --> 00:13:42.779
the negative that's coming up pretty

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:45.839
soon but you know this times I end up at

00:13:42.779 --> 00:13:48.209
a stoplight we live in Vancouver BC a

00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:49.860
lot of really really nice cars here

00:13:48.209 --> 00:13:52.470
because you know when your neighbor owns

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:53.879
a Mercedes well you got to go get a

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:56.160
Porsche and now that you own a Porsche

00:13:53.879 --> 00:13:57.869
he's gonna lease you know a Maserati and

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.929
now that you're leasing the Maserati

00:13:57.869 --> 00:14:02.670
he's got a you know drive a McLaren f1

00:14:00.929 --> 00:14:05.059
GTR you get the idea you know there's a

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:07.050
lot of keeping up with the Joneses here

00:14:05.059 --> 00:14:10.889
so you know you're at a traffic light

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:13.379
you're next to a fancy sports car is

00:14:10.889 --> 00:14:16.429
something like that put the pedal to the

00:14:13.379 --> 00:14:16.429
metal the focus is like

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:25.450
the other cars are like right off the

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:27.490
bed like I we drove behind I think it

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:29.650
was a Ferrari I don't know what kind but

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:32.860
we were driving mind a Ferrari

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:34.690
downtown was going 30 kilometers now I'm

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:37.620
not insulting the Ferrari which I assume

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:39.910
considering that they're like you know

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:42.520
over a hundred thousand dollars each for

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:44.340
no regardless of what model it is I'm

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:47.710
assuming that they're a well-made the

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:49.570
machine but we're going like thirty

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:54.040
kilometers an hour you know like 20

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:58.600
miles an hour basically like 23 the

00:14:54.040 --> 00:15:00.580
whole time it was going his is loud and

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.020
like rumbling in my chest and I was like

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:05.650
I didn't pay for that experience it's

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:08.620
like I'm stealing it I feel like I owe

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:12.360
him money for experiencing the true

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:14.850
power of what an automobile can be I

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:17.230
don't know if he had like an aftermarket

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:21.940
what's the opposite of a muffler you had

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:24.160
like a boom muffler on it I can't speak

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:26.740
to that cuz I'm just honestly pretty

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:29.400
ignorant about cars in general which i

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:31.540
think is gonna vindicate me at one point

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:34.780
it's been a while you know in high

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:37.180
school and I'm not suggesting that

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:42.520
liking cars is uncool at all I think

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:44.590
it's super cool I just have never found

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:46.810
myself in that camp because I'm like not

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:47.980
handy at all so I'll just pay someone 30

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:53.590
bucks to change my oil

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:57.700
what like a sucker but anyway I you know

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:59.470
in high school was always like kids with

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.730
their lifted trucks and stuff like that

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:03.310
they'd be like check it out

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:04.390
put a NOS canister on my ford f150 that

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.460
never happened to the best of my

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:08.230
knowledge but had a lot of people in my

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:10.960
high school that had those cars that

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:14.470
were so low to the ground that you had

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:16.840
to take like a 45 degree angle on every

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:18.610
speed bump because if you hit it too

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.080
like perpendicular you you could

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:22.500
possibly excrete your muffler on the

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:25.290
ground or something right

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:28.450
once self-driving cars become a thing

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:30.550
and and a lot of people I think by the

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:31.720
way are way too and

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:32.500
might be an idiot on this but I think a

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.029
lot of people are way too optimistic

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.589
about when that's gonna happen think of

00:16:34.029 --> 00:16:38.080
you ask the average person on the

00:16:35.589 --> 00:16:38.860
internet when self-driving cars are

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:43.300
gonna be the norm

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:48.579
they're like January I'm thinking like

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:51.550
2030 2035 their big purchases you know

00:16:48.579 --> 00:16:53.680
you gotta you gotta test them like

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:54.880
extremely rigorously cuz people are

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:58.000
gonna be putting their lives and their

00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:00.610
families lives in their hands I can't

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.560
just roll it out of like 2021 it's

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:04.660
illegal to drive unless you have a

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:06.309
self-driving car right but once they

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.410
become the norm and hopefully you know

00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:13.449
sooner rather than later and it also

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:15.459
works wonder if people are gonna revise

00:17:13.449 --> 00:17:15.939
their opinions about cars maybe maybe

00:17:15.459 --> 00:17:18.130
not

00:17:15.939 --> 00:17:19.270
okay so this is very important we don't

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:20.290
need that item when I'm saving guys

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.809
shirt because I might want to do boss

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:24.850
rush um make sure you take the negative

00:17:22.809 --> 00:17:27.670
here extremely important make sure you

00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:30.040
take the negative anyway it's a big

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:33.220
driving oh you mean that thing my

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:36.550
computer does for me man you ain't even

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:39.100
felt power until you felt 600 horsepower

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:43.120
of American steel under your foot yeah

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:46.179
whatever grandpa I just let Watson drive

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:47.590
for me I'm doing my taxes in the back of

00:17:46.179 --> 00:17:49.360
the car right because that in the future

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:50.080
doing taxes is gonna be like a really

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:53.710
cool thing

00:17:50.080 --> 00:18:00.660
definitely heck it's really cool already

00:17:53.710 --> 00:18:00.660
I don't know maybe I'm out of touch

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:05.470
that's what and definitely I'm out of

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:08.169
touch I'm out of touch with both

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:09.820
generations you know both of the two

00:18:08.169 --> 00:18:14.200
generations on planet Earth

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:15.790
cuz I'm like I'm not handy you know I'm

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.410
definitely not part of like my parents

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:22.059
and grandparents generation to the sense

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:23.740
that like you know if if my pipes broke

00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:26.669
in my house I'd be like I'm not paying a

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:29.620
plumber I'm just gonna pay the plumber

00:18:26.669 --> 00:18:31.090
I'm not I don't trust myself I'll go on

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:32.740
YouTube and figure out how to fix it

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:34.990
it's probably a productive attitude but

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:36.640
I'm scared of you know what I what I

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:38.590
could do to our internal system probably

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.910
avoid the rental agreement with my

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.889
landlord as well so I mean there might

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:45.129
be a savvy decision not to do that

00:18:41.889 --> 00:18:47.179
but I don't know if I'm part of the

00:18:45.129 --> 00:18:48.590
upcoming generation either like

00:18:47.179 --> 00:18:50.450
generation people that are younger than

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:52.820
myself because I don't understand what

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:55.879
rappers are saying anymore and I feel

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:57.320
like like when I listen to modern-day

00:18:55.879 --> 00:18:59.330
hip-hop and this is not me being a

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:02.269
naysayer at all when I listen to

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:04.820
modern-day hip-hop I feel like it's

00:19:02.269 --> 00:19:07.519
incredibly progressive like I'm like

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:10.159
this is some weird like Lou Reed Metal

00:19:07.519 --> 00:19:11.149
Machine music stuff and then I look at

00:19:10.159 --> 00:19:14.299
it and it's like oh it went to number

00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:16.639
one in 18 countries it's actually like

00:19:14.299 --> 00:19:18.919
listening it's like going to an art

00:19:16.639 --> 00:19:22.789
gallery for me like I just I sort of

00:19:18.919 --> 00:19:23.690
lacked the ability to to judge it

00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:25.279
appropriately

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:27.200
and I think that's kind of cool but I'm

00:19:25.279 --> 00:19:30.349
also like it it's a sign of the times

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:36.739
for being out of touch I think can't we

00:19:30.349 --> 00:19:39.139
just go back to the Illmatic era should

00:19:36.739 --> 00:19:42.409
have taken that is there anything worth

00:19:39.139 --> 00:19:43.609
taking in here no well I mean halo of

00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:45.049
flies is pretty good but apart from that

00:19:43.609 --> 00:19:49.609
we're gonna dice chard look for

00:19:45.049 --> 00:19:54.950
something better these are all pretty

00:19:49.609 --> 00:19:55.970
bad I will never go to bat to defend

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:58.909
broken modem

00:19:55.970 --> 00:20:01.759
I think broken modem is like way more

00:19:58.909 --> 00:20:04.369
trouble than it's worth anyway we're on

00:20:01.759 --> 00:20:07.989
utero one year so I don't know I kind of

00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:10.249
feel like I'm like I'm unstuck in time I

00:20:07.989 --> 00:20:16.039
feel unique and that's good but then

00:20:10.249 --> 00:20:21.169
also I don't know dude sometimes I I

00:20:16.039 --> 00:20:24.379
wouldn't say I worry but I'm like I do

00:20:21.169 --> 00:20:28.369
I'm a weird ish dude I think or at least

00:20:24.379 --> 00:20:30.559
I am eccentric isn't even the right word

00:20:28.369 --> 00:20:31.220
I'm looking for what's the word I'm

00:20:30.559 --> 00:20:33.349
looking for

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:34.999
IDEO synchronic might be the word that I

00:20:33.349 --> 00:20:39.259
would use like I think I got a unique

00:20:34.999 --> 00:20:40.729
perspective on issues to begin with and

00:20:39.259 --> 00:20:43.070
I've always sort of been that way like I

00:20:40.729 --> 00:20:45.679
told the story but this is not the only

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:47.419
story but it's emblematic I think you

00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:50.119
know when I was a kid my parents put me

00:20:47.419 --> 00:20:53.869
in tennis lessons mmm to be part of the

00:20:50.119 --> 00:20:54.980
aristocracy but you know the tennis

00:20:53.869 --> 00:20:56.450
teacher who was a

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:58.610
a tennis player at least by our local

00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:00.110
standards was teaching us hey here's how

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:03.650
you grip it for forehand here's how you

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:05.510
grip it for backhand and I just said

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:07.340
internally to myself I don't need to

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:10.210
know the backhand part what's the point

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:13.850
for hands better why don't I just use my

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:15.530
less strong hand to do it you know that

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:17.870
was always the approach that I took is

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:19.700
like you know I'm gonna I'm gonna do

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:20.419
things my own unique way I think I come

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:24.230
by it honestly

00:21:20.419 --> 00:21:26.980
real talk I got kicked out of of kinder

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:30.740
gym or Gymboree and I forget which

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:32.630
proprietary physical education

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.950
after-school program it was when I was

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:36.620
three years old I kicked out a kinder

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:39.470
gentler what the teachers were telling

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:42.080
me despite being a cog in the corporate

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:43.669
machine in today's day and age you know

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.350
they'd be like hey do the bicycle kicks

00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:49.250
I do the bicycle kicks and then they'd

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:50.059
be okay now like do the stretches and

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:51.290
I'm like I don't want to do the

00:21:50.059 --> 00:21:54.380
stretches I just want to do bicycle

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:56.780
kicks why not right anyway the point is

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:59.690
I'm just saying this to illustrate not

00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:04.880
holds up spork you know I am too penguin

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:10.610
of dune of dune I'm Topanga of doom so

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:12.350
random da ela XD XD etc etc however like

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:15.620
I'm idiosyncratic to begin with and I

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:18.650
got a weird job I almost worry if I'm

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:22.700
like socially isolating myself beyond

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:24.919
the point of of recovery sometimes like

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:28.130
I think I'm still okay when I go out in

00:22:24.919 --> 00:22:30.440
public and I speak to normal people I I

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:33.679
can communicate with them effectively I

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:35.150
can you know get across what I want what

00:22:33.679 --> 00:22:40.700
I believe that they can offer me in the

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:43.580
situation hey can I get the shoyu ramen

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:46.730
and a green tea please

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:48.320
look at that easy enough right but I I

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:51.020
don't know I worry that you can get out

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:54.320
of touch after like 10 years of doing

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:56.179
this job it's something that's hard for

00:22:54.320 --> 00:23:00.799
people to relate to because it's still

00:22:56.179 --> 00:23:02.059
relatively rare and weird as heck and by

00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:03.799
what when I say at worry I'm not at

00:23:02.059 --> 00:23:06.429
literally the thought just occurred to

00:23:03.799 --> 00:23:10.090
me so let's not act as if it's a

00:23:06.429 --> 00:23:11.919
enormous problem we gotta check this run

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:14.049
is going so well by the way and in fact

00:23:11.919 --> 00:23:15.549
in the in keeping with the tradition of

00:23:14.049 --> 00:23:18.820
recent runs it seems like it's gonna be

00:23:15.549 --> 00:23:21.399
over like super fast which I don't

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:24.100
really eat you know I I like when an

00:23:21.399 --> 00:23:25.929
Isaac video ends up being like 28 to 40

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:27.039
minutes long that's my ideal and I think

00:23:25.929 --> 00:23:29.080
we're probably gonna be in there but

00:23:27.039 --> 00:23:31.090
anything less than that and I'm like

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:33.129
feels like I wasn't really able to sink

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:34.269
my teeth into the into the meat of the

00:23:33.129 --> 00:23:36.159
run like I'm missing part of the

00:23:34.269 --> 00:23:38.289
conversational aspect any longer than

00:23:36.159 --> 00:23:41.379
that my brain cannot hold it together

00:23:38.289 --> 00:23:44.889
I'll be like it's almost like every

00:23:41.379 --> 00:23:46.749
minute my you know internal temperature

00:23:44.889 --> 00:23:49.240
goes up by like two tenths of a degree

00:23:46.749 --> 00:23:52.929
Fahrenheit so I'm like downright

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:54.249
feverish by the end of a video which is

00:23:52.929 --> 00:23:55.929
what people want to see most of the time

00:23:54.249 --> 00:23:58.299
and I guess I can't understand that a

00:23:55.929 --> 00:24:02.440
good trainwreck run every now and then

00:23:58.299 --> 00:24:05.110
is fine where it gets really bad is when

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:06.549
you're like well you know I've got 45

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:08.169
minutes maybe I'll knock out an Isaac

00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:10.749
episode and then it becomes a train

00:24:08.169 --> 00:24:16.990
wreck run and you're like it's 11:40

00:24:10.749 --> 00:24:19.360
p.m. I just want to hug my cats but I

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:22.029
can't because I've got 1.8 damage and

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:25.869
yet somehow also my rate of fire is 8

00:24:22.029 --> 00:24:28.480
how does that even happen anyway it

00:24:25.869 --> 00:24:30.970
looks like we're building a lot of

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:36.070
momentum here it makes me a very happy

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:39.909
camper this is very important do not

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:41.289
forget to pick up well no we already

00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:43.869
have the negatives sorry do not forget

00:24:41.289 --> 00:24:45.549
to go probably to the hush fight but

00:24:43.869 --> 00:24:52.299
then after that you want to make sure

00:24:45.549 --> 00:24:54.309
that you're going to show because if you

00:24:52.299 --> 00:24:55.809
go to the cathedral you're gonna end up

00:24:54.309 --> 00:24:58.629
feeling real silly when this episode

00:24:55.809 --> 00:25:00.789
ends for now though it has been a while

00:24:58.629 --> 00:25:03.249
since we've fought hush tractor-beam I

00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:04.389
think is a pretty okay hush item nothing

00:25:03.249 --> 00:25:06.869
is hard to hit to begin with I suppose

00:25:04.389 --> 00:25:06.869
but

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:11.580
should take us back to full HP or close

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:13.530
to it be nice to generate a lot of

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:15.150
spiders don't pick that up yet they said

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:16.680
generate a lot of flies I should say

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:21.510
before we get going two of diamonds is a

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:25.650
lovely choice here you got their high

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:28.410
priestess not really necessary the Sun

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:31.800
not even good except in a mapping

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:33.810
context so let's pop the guys and then

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:36.480
that should purge curse of the blind use

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:39.870
the Sun as a map on the next floor we

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:41.490
actually we don't have permanent

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:42.780
polaroid invincibility we should look

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:48.390
for a black market that that would

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:49.650
change things like Guppies neither of

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:50.850
these items are gonna be relevant I

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:53.130
think we just have to accept that that's

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:55.830
the most likely outcome is that none of

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:56.730
those items are gonna be worth and none

00:25:55.830 --> 00:26:01.320
of these items are gonna be worth

00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:04.740
anything either but if we find a black

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:06.900
market nope

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:09.480
if we find a black market we could at

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:11.340
least get the HP to be worth something

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.720
so you can get a joker card we can get

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:14.670
the HP to be worth something this is a

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:18.990
it might be too little too late for

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:21.330
restock now that I think about it was

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:23.090
the Emperor I think you just keep the

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:28.170
emperor card and forget the sun card now

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:29.820
don't ever shoot at me please dim bulb

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:31.920
how much does dim bulb hook us up here

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:32.880
quite a lot actually okay I'll go with

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.560
that

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:36.960
we don't need to have diamonds in it

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:42.330
doesn't benefit us you might as well

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:43.830
become turbo guppy and then this should

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:45.600
be fine it's actually it's quite a

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:49.740
potent damage upgrade right off the bat

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:55.740
do we have is buddy in a box giving us

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:56.820
holy light shots in that case holy shot

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:59.130
that's good

00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:01.830
please don't do monetize my video it was

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:04.020
a pun you know what puns are amour d

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:06.030
monetizable offense in my mind then

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:08.180
swearing to begin with but I don't make

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:08.180
the rules

00:27:09.489 --> 00:27:12.529
all right so just keep it up here it

00:27:11.419 --> 00:27:15.289
doesn't look like they're holy shots

00:27:12.529 --> 00:27:24.289
unfortunately our Holy Light rather to

00:27:15.289 --> 00:27:25.940
be less ambiguous I sort of don't

00:27:24.289 --> 00:27:28.999
understand and this is going back to an

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:31.369
earlier topic of conversation the answer

00:27:28.999 --> 00:27:32.659
this might just be anxiety and if that's

00:27:31.369 --> 00:27:35.179
the case I don't want to appear ignorant

00:27:32.659 --> 00:27:37.639
you know I have my own brand of anxiety

00:27:35.179 --> 00:27:39.049
as well that I work through but you know

00:27:37.639 --> 00:27:44.109
I guess it's different for everybody to

00:27:39.049 --> 00:27:47.929
some extent uh I I don't understand

00:27:44.109 --> 00:27:51.249
being anxious to see a movie in the

00:27:47.929 --> 00:27:55.369
theatre by yourself it is mildly

00:27:51.249 --> 00:28:00.889
uncommon I think but like watching a

00:27:55.369 --> 00:28:02.330
movie at home by yourself not weird your

00:28:00.889 --> 00:28:03.590
here's the analog you that you might use

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:05.539
you might say well yeah but it'd be

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:06.799
weird to kind of like like eating a meal

00:28:05.539 --> 00:28:08.600
at home by yourself is not that unusual

00:28:06.799 --> 00:28:10.159
but going out to a restaurant to get a

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:12.710
meal by yourself is a little unusual

00:28:10.159 --> 00:28:14.450
perhaps but movies are different if

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:16.070
there's a movie I really want to see and

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:20.480
it just came out the only place to do so

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:23.090
mm-hmm is that the theater so you know

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.769
I'm it just came out it's not like I can

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:27.710
stay at home and watch it and I know

00:28:24.769 --> 00:28:32.210
Enel have you heard of a DA ela Torrance

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:35.989
but you know that's I'm in the media

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:38.359
business would feel weird for me to not

00:28:35.989 --> 00:28:40.429
support people making what appears to be

00:28:38.359 --> 00:28:43.100
good media you know there's no other

00:28:40.429 --> 00:28:44.629
option at that point if you want to if

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.850
you want to see the movie yourself I'd

00:28:44.629 --> 00:28:49.039
like it's been almost decade I guess

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:49.549
since I've done it well maybe like eight

00:28:49.039 --> 00:28:51.710
years

00:28:49.549 --> 00:28:53.419
it's almost a decade in many ways but

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:54.980
going to the movie theater by yourself

00:28:53.419 --> 00:28:58.399
is really nice I've told this story a

00:28:54.980 --> 00:29:00.950
couple times as well but one time well

00:28:58.399 --> 00:29:02.269
this is actually the Bruno story but my

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:05.389
friends were like hey you want to go to

00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:07.940
the theater and see The Hangover and

00:29:05.389 --> 00:29:12.049
this is not me being an intellectual is

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:13.669
oh the hangover mmm quite a juvenile

00:29:12.049 --> 00:29:17.629
film the thing is that actually already

00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:19.100
seen it twice in theaters so I was like

00:29:17.629 --> 00:29:20.809
I'll go with you but I'm not gonna watch

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:22.190
The Hangover so I walked to the movie

00:29:20.809 --> 00:29:22.909
theater and they are like four tickets

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:24.259
for The Hangover

00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:26.599
please and I was like one ticket for

00:29:24.259 --> 00:29:28.399
Bruno I hope the timeline on that

00:29:26.599 --> 00:29:33.429
matches up I might have forgotten but

00:29:28.399 --> 00:29:36.710
the trail has appeared in the basement

00:29:33.429 --> 00:29:37.940
down please like there's I don't think

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:39.259
there's anything weird about going to

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:44.720
the movie theater by yourself Plus once

00:29:39.259 --> 00:29:47.269
the lights dim who cares I'm just gonna

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:48.710
Emperor it up here you know nobody cares

00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:50.149
is the answer but they care less than

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:51.679
you think and anybody who cares you're

00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:56.179
going to see a movie by yourself as

00:29:51.679 --> 00:29:57.710
being a big weirdo about it but what if

00:29:56.179 --> 00:29:59.599
they think I have no friends what have

00:29:57.710 --> 00:30:01.369
you do have no friends you still gotta

00:29:59.599 --> 00:30:03.499
see movies dude we're all human beings

00:30:01.369 --> 00:30:07.970
here it's a necessary part of life okay

00:30:03.499 --> 00:30:09.229
that might be a little too far but by

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:10.700
the way if you're worried about eating

00:30:09.229 --> 00:30:14.690
by yourself in a restaurant

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:16.549
don't be whenever I see someone eating

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:20.389
by themselves in a restaurant I think

00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:22.249
more highly of them because I think that

00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:27.649
they're like a business traveler and I'm

00:30:22.249 --> 00:30:29.749
like dude not only is this man or woman

00:30:27.649 --> 00:30:33.799
you know flying around doing important

00:30:29.749 --> 00:30:35.749
business that meals probably getting

00:30:33.799 --> 00:30:37.580
paid for by their boss when they get

00:30:35.749 --> 00:30:41.269
back and fill out an expense report and

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:42.919
that's dope so that's it's my advice to

00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:44.690
you you ever want to feel weird about

00:30:42.919 --> 00:30:46.609
going to a restaurant alone nah Sun

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:49.159
people are actually gonna think more

00:30:46.609 --> 00:30:50.989
highly of you if you're eating alone and

00:30:49.159 --> 00:30:52.729
if you're eating with someone else just

00:30:50.989 --> 00:30:54.619
make sure that you be super weird about

00:30:52.729 --> 00:30:58.129
it and put on like the nicest suit you

00:30:54.619 --> 00:31:00.470
have then even if people think you're

00:30:58.129 --> 00:31:02.299
like a piece of garbage or even if you

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:04.340
are a piece of carpet I mean to say

00:31:02.299 --> 00:31:05.359
people will think you're a big shot and

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:09.909
to be honest with you that's more

00:31:05.359 --> 00:31:11.929
important like I said I'm a little

00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:15.499
idiosyncratic and I don't really care

00:31:11.929 --> 00:31:16.489
about getting the HP there I mean we

00:31:15.499 --> 00:31:18.320
could fill it up we're gonna win this

00:31:16.489 --> 00:31:21.039
run anyway I would this could be a

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:22.909
perfect run to also kill delirium on

00:31:21.039 --> 00:31:26.320
perfect might be a stretch but it's a

00:31:22.909 --> 00:31:26.320
very good run to kill delirium on

00:31:29.159 --> 00:31:37.509
thank you there's some things I like

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:41.289
like to do alone even though I'm married

00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:44.259
I love grocery shopping alone as weird

00:31:41.289 --> 00:31:46.509
as that might sound because I buy what I

00:31:44.259 --> 00:31:50.190
want and only what I want and I'm the

00:31:46.509 --> 00:31:50.190
kind of guy who rushes through things I

00:31:50.759 --> 00:31:54.669
you know many of you will probably

00:31:52.779 --> 00:31:56.499
relate to this it's a bad habit this is

00:31:54.669 --> 00:31:57.849
not something to be proud of and I want

00:31:56.499 --> 00:31:59.889
to make that clear because I think it is

00:31:57.849 --> 00:32:03.219
glamorized sometimes I probably

00:31:59.889 --> 00:32:06.070
glamorized it when I was younger I am

00:32:03.219 --> 00:32:09.429
still to this day the guy who like does

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:11.229
well in school but most of the marks I

00:32:09.429 --> 00:32:13.779
lose are from just like not reading the

00:32:11.229 --> 00:32:15.460
question fully I read like 40% of the

00:32:13.779 --> 00:32:18.969
question and go I know the answer I

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:20.799
write it down and then you know I get

00:32:18.969 --> 00:32:21.909
the test back and I lose a half mark on

00:32:20.799 --> 00:32:23.710
the question and I'm like oh I just

00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:25.659
didn't do the last thing they asked for

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:27.519
because I got overeager you know I

00:32:25.659 --> 00:32:29.529
rushed things a little bit but at the

00:32:27.519 --> 00:32:32.169
grocery store works out fairly well for

00:32:29.529 --> 00:32:35.409
me I can be in and out of the grocery

00:32:32.169 --> 00:32:38.440
store in like you know less than ten

00:32:35.409 --> 00:32:41.859
minutes including lining up paying

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:43.599
etcetera etcetera and there's a

00:32:41.859 --> 00:32:45.249
different dynamic you know when you go

00:32:43.599 --> 00:32:46.960
grocery shopping with someone else you

00:32:45.249 --> 00:32:49.659
go grocery shopping with your spouse you

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:52.779
probably in my case probably get better

00:32:49.659 --> 00:32:56.320
stuff get a more well-balanced diet for

00:32:52.779 --> 00:32:58.779
sure because when I go to the grocery

00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:01.809
store I'm buying matter and energy and

00:32:58.779 --> 00:33:03.729
and Kate is buying meals which is

00:33:01.809 --> 00:33:06.029
whatever it works better that way I

00:33:03.729 --> 00:33:08.229
think I'm just like yeah this is

00:33:06.029 --> 00:33:10.029
mathematically enough calories to get me

00:33:08.229 --> 00:33:11.440
through the next six days and she's like

00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:13.509
this would make a great chicken

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:16.059
cacciatore don't get me wrong I'm not

00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:17.950
admonishing my spouse there in fact I'm

00:33:16.059 --> 00:33:19.809
I'm building her up which is a smart

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:27.210
thing to do I don't really want the

00:33:19.809 --> 00:33:27.210
boomerang there oh I thought we had it

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:32.190
but I love grocery shopping by myself

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:33.660
because it's just it's bastard even if

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:36.090
you end up getting less out of it you

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:37.080
know you you can enforce your own values

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:39.090
on this situation

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:42.360
I'll take Black Lotus even though it

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:43.830
probably does not matter at all it

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:47.190
definitely does not matter at all

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:51.810
actually alright so the real game plan

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:53.970
here is it would be sick this is why I'm

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:58.950
not using the strength card if we could

00:33:53.970 --> 00:34:05.370
get the Delirium fight the void floor a

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:07.620
better way to describe it perhaps no not

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:09.770
yet we'll do that at a future date kind

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:11.610
of stinks though we got the unlock but

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:13.800
we're gonna have to do the victory lap

00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:16.950
later but we got the curved horn golden

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:20.970
God has been achieved I didn't expect

00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:22.470
that I guess we filled up enough

00:34:20.970 --> 00:34:24.140
post-its are like the first six
