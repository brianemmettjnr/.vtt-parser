##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:07.200
let's go we in this etc.etc welcome back

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.730
northernlion binding of issac afterbirth

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.320
plus we can't lose don't give us a loss

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.820
of the keeper don't give us a loss of

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:18.000
the key Oh give up hey Samson sorry a

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.740
little excitable right at the top here

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.449
ain't 0v my t 3p why excitable first off

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.490
could you phrase your question in the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.340
form of a question because why excitable

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.560
is not it's like the name of a MERS Bo

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.239
song I've never listened to MERS Bo I

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.100
just know that's referential mostly we

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.700
just finished a good at LSS it was hyper

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.440
it was excited you know I got to bring

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.079
myself down a level here get back to the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.180
rational level of discourse Samson is a

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.449
good boy he don't try to hide it

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.219
diamonds on the soles of his shoes he's

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.640
got the hair that makes me jealous and

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.079
one of the better starting active I'm

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.149
gonna call it an active/passive

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.329
that's not really sensible you know but

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.990
you get the idea dark Prince's crown is

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.830
usually basically irrelevant although I

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.140
will say that if we can make it work it

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.020
is a tears upgrade oh so one of these is

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.119
a library which a large muscle is that a

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.210
two-key room above the curse room or

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.189
next to the cursor room no that should

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.509
be just a straight-up library then if we

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.790
can get a key to make it pop that'll be

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.100
good um the thing with dark Prince's

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.750
crown is that if you get it for free if

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.820
you don't have to pay the ridiculous

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.439
premium for it then dark Prince's crown

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.850
is worth having please come this way

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.070
trying to bait them into going this way

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.360
so that the lost protector can actually

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.720
do some damage I think you got one of

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.220
them but then basically it's a chance

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.670
for you to get a Sears upgrade it's not

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.450
great obviously but you could do a lot

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.829
worse you could have gotten nothing from

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.320
that room for example that would have

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.000
done it but it's not a good item the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.290
thing that makes it really really bad is

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.549
the fact that it costs two hearts

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:09.390
despite being basically a tears upgrade

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.770
dude I'm in no no chance whatsoever of

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.180
getting you that library unless you want

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.140
to play the self sacrifice room which is

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.210
basically suicide

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.640
and no chance of getting to the arcade

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.850
on this floor but in the future perhaps

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.510
to sleep perchance to dream

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.460
the Samson always start with a an 11

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.460
rate of fire that seems unusual to me

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.890
now 5.19 damage I mean you could adjust

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.560
my rate of fire a little bit if you're

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.680
going to give me 10.1 no Sakia 5.19

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.200
damage 10.19 damage I'll go a long way

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.060
I'll take the long way home like super

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.550
tramp you guys ever watched that Disney

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.560
film lady in the super tramp lady's all

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.720
like I'm a dog and then super tramp is

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.959
like don't yell look at my dog friend

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.580
Mia she is a real dog what cocker

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.700
spaniel I'm not trying to make a dirty

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.200
joke I think it's been a while since I

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.610
saw a lady in the Tramp I feel like

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.260
everybody thinks lady in the Tramp is

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.950
really cute but as a child I thought it

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.600
was kind of gross two dogs are sharing a

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.670
spaghetti noodle I get it it's an iconic

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.840
scene but at the same time where's the

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.570
health department that seems like one of

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.580
those things where when it's Disney fide

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:23.430
it's not a real word it's right outside

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.900
your door now fizz nephi don't roam but

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.290
rage of Rage Against the Machine fans

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:33.150
here rage against the mouse fans here

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:36.000
okay we get meats and razor blade razor

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.440
blade with a luck downgrade not super

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.930
stoked but razor blade with Sampson it

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.239
seems like a multiplicative bonus look

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.470
on saying about lady in the Tramp is

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.170
when they have like the beautiful music

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.870
playing and you know that's amore and

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.000
blah blah blah everybody's like wow what

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.410
a cute story about two dogs in love if

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.209
you actually went to a restaurant and

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.860
then you went oh my god honey look down

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.959
the back alley and down the back alley

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.510
there's two dogs chowing down on a plate

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.130
of spaghetti just snarfing it up you'd

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.220
probably be like I'm not going to get my

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.660
bolognaise there am i a snob for not

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.310
wanting to give my Balinese of the place

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.410
that's feeding wild dogs plates of

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.510
spaghetti out the back maybe so you know

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.919
what I vote with my wallet I don't even

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.330
like spaghetti so I wouldn't go there in

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:23.360
the first place I know I'm a monster

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:26.240
just never I've never had a spaghetti

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.410
that that sold me

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.030
I've never had a spaghetti where I went

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.430
like oh that's great spaghetti

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.210
I've had some unforgettable pennies wait

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.700
let's try this again

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.080
I've had some prescient pennies I've had

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.740
some unforgettable fettuccine

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.770
I've had some luxurious Linguini's but I

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.810
haven't had a spectacular spaghetti I

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.240
wish that weren't the case you know I

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.530
want to know what the fuss is about but

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.440
I've not yet experienced it for myself

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.910
for at the present moment I wouldn't

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.670
consider myself that much of a spaghetti

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:01.110
man go hang a lasagna I'm a salami hog

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.330
so we managed to recover quite a lot on

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:07.260
this floor actually baby I love your way

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.760
look at that 15 cents a couple of doors

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.350
here which means I was going to say one

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.910
of them's a library telepathy for

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:16.650
dummies book of Belial book of secrets a

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.170
cup of Cris cup of goose that's Book of

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.390
Shadows giving us bookworm there so

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.480
we're going to keep the razor blade at

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:27.570
least for now and we can use this to

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:30.480
activate dark Prince's crown we can also

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.920
use it to activate the bloodlust bonus

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.290
so I'm pretty stoked about that okay now

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.030
we can fly this is like the best floor

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.740
on which I've ever gotten the golden key

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.040
especially with curse of the blind it's

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.200
all working out sharp plug now we're

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:48.840
looking for but you could do worse

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:50.670
and then we'll quickly go in oh you got

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.990
black beans so that wasn't a huge get

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.580
for us but everything else is coming up

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:59.580
millhouse here and that's four cents

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:01.050
hopefully five here not a secret room

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.160
are you kidding me man alright we're

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.900
down the next word we got time to

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.600
generate an IV bag anyway we might not

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.280
even need an IV bag with the razor blade

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.680
as long as you play our cards right you

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.980
know like we come in here place this

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:16.110
down use the razor blade so 1.90 damage

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.700
up and you can't make this stuff up you

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:21.030
couldn't write a script better than this

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.910
mystery sack and a head of the keeper

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.190
for one bomb that's the kind of value

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:29.610
you know you don't find in 2017 that's

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:32.130
like a 1981 dad bought his first house

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.260
you know working at 7-eleven for minimum

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.120
wage sort of thing yeah you discrim

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.920
panned save you could only you know go

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.490
down to the delicatessen a couple times

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:45.270
a week

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:47.340
but he had equity dang it our damage has

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:50.849
improved yeah it goes up 1.9 every time

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:54.090
we use it enemy lose one when when the

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:55.979
room ends we lose 1.4 so we get 0.5

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.080
every time we pop it right now so as

00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:00.300
long as we have red hearts will receive

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.560
now I'm a little concerned but as long

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.949
as we have a little bit of room to

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.870
maneuver we should we should consider

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:10.199
this pretty nice right now this is a

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:14.039
good floor you know stack up some HP if

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:15.330
possible enough to feel comfortable you

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:16.440
know going forward in the future you

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.330
should be able to have enough money to

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:23.880
get something from the shop keys might

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:25.409
be another story but head of the keepers

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:29.490
given us a lot of leeway here

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:36.180
financially speaking the financial

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:38.930
persuasion just keep yourself out of

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:42.180
harm's way

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:43.949
ace of clubs not relevant kind of

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:46.259
stalling out on commentary here but you

00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:47.520
know why it's only a stall if you can't

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:49.620
get out of it you never hear about a

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.030
stall if they if they pull the plane out

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.530
of the tailspin they just go you know

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:58.380
what a little bit of a harrowing flight

00:07:52.530 --> 00:08:01.729
today only makes the news once it

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:06.409
touches down if you know what I mean

00:08:01.729 --> 00:08:10.380
so very flippant joke about a terrible

00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:12.449
hypothetical disaster but you know

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.860
that's its gallows humor that's that's

00:08:12.449 --> 00:08:15.750
going to be my defense if I ever make a

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:19.380
joke that goes a little bit too far it's

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:21.300
just gallows humor people it's a

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:25.229
learning thing you wouldn't understand

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:26.880
okay we don't want love farts I don't

00:08:25.229 --> 00:08:28.349
really care about the bob transformation

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.969
so we're just moving our way through

00:08:28.349 --> 00:08:31.830
here we're not spending bombs we already

00:08:29.969 --> 00:08:38.219
got bookworm we're not spending bombs

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:39.479
because we get so much money by ahead of

00:08:38.219 --> 00:08:41.880
the keeper that would you know why would

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:44.400
I spend bombs now we got this money

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.860
coming our way so

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:50.250
that's not a secret room I feel like the

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:52.080
Bumbo pickup is actually huge if we just

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:54.360
go like if you know we're at five cents

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.370
that's the perfect amount to stay at for

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.080
now whenever we generate money and that

00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:00.960
should happen like fairly frequently

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:04.550
Thanks ahead of the keeper let Bumbo

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:08.250
pick it up you know get that buddy I

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:09.930
just picked up a penny but this you know

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.820
it's a big picture sort of thing is what

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:14.100
I'm trying to get at the more the

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.750
merrier though as long as you're not

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.390
eatin Lucky Penny so that's that's the

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.680
only thing that would bum me out

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:24.240
probably not going to be max-level by

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:26.339
this floor but that's cool good Dodge's

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:29.310
that's fine dude we don't need a new max

00:09:26.339 --> 00:09:30.900
level by this floor I also don't want

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:33.930
them to really spit out bombs on the

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:36.990
regular but you know you got to do what

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:39.690
you got to do Bunco don't let me ruin

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:41.460
your mojo baby good Austin Powers

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:43.110
impression that's good enough for like

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:48.150
eighth place in the best Austin Powers

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:51.330
impression yeah baby it's something

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:52.950
that's really and I use the word not

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:57.050
ironically but with some self-awareness

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:59.550
a bad Austin Powers impression is really

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:00.470
cringe-worthy it's just something about

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:06.000
it

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:07.560
do I make you horny baby yeah just it

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.959
doesn't feel right it's like I feel like

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:16.260
parker posey on juice those are your

00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:18.660
coins I'm sorry we don't need to use on

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:22.950
Zeus he's not yet I mean why sure I'll

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:24.630
take bah humbag making good time here so

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:27.180
this guy is just like it extraordinarily

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:29.070
dusted no deal with the devil always

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:32.850
bums me out a little bit and you know

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:35.970
what the same your granddad's NL we

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:40.950
remember that the North remembers and

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:42.510
now we got some eternal heart action

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:44.100
going on back here I want this HP

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:47.610
because I want more fuel for the blood

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:50.640
bank the razor blade admittedly probably

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:53.839
beats the IV bag so we might not be

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:56.850
looking for an arcade specifically but

00:10:53.839 --> 00:10:57.960
sort of like might as well give it a

00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:03.990
shot you know we're

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:05.850
catacombs one so we can't find a can't

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:07.530
find a greed fight and several just keep

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:10.040
moving on here and really we're in an

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:12.300
incredibly luxurious position right now

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:16.500
very happy with where we're at will on

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:19.320
Zeus and will save some keys we don't

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.940
need keys actually we'll save some just

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.130
some hassle getting into our special

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.360
room here these are for you bum bow if

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.160
you want to pick up these coins I'm

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.020
thinking like by the middle of this

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.640
floor you should be max level and I

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.470
should just be able to hang out over the

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.990
rocks you know and semi-retirement will

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:35.490
you do my job for me right now you're

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:38.040
just kind of like a your little Isaac

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:41.100
tadpole but you can evolve into a frog

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.360
one day that's not grow up into it's

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:46.560
probably the more sensible that's not

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:50.730
really an evolution thing ain't nobody

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:55.440
don't there's me I live in the sea wait

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:59.970
this this will work give it a second

00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:01.410
give it a second trying to think it so

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.700
this is so fresh and so clean but

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:06.060
written from the perspective of a fish

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:12.300
for some reason don't you think I am

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:16.980
Pisces I live my love in the sea don't

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:20.790
notice anywhere for this joke to go this

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:22.620
is like a bad science teachers idea of a

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:28.230
good list of Michael Scott as a high

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:30.870
school science teacher lesson I can't go

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:34.230
or at least cannot justify going to the

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:35.850
curse room just yet Mambo you don't need

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:38.870
this money anymore don't be greedy buddy

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:38.870
don't be greedy

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:48.970
it's not wow what a freeze up there what

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:50.560
a throw job not a throw job probably a

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:54.130
very different thing but how would I

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:55.090
know I'm a married man I don't know what

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:56.950
it's truck

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.780
what would a throat job they've already

00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:01.120
got one you do with your mouth all the

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.830
Millennials these days are doing it what

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.570
specifically would change about the

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:06.880
throaty version of it I don't maybe I

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:08.470
don't want to know we're getting dad you

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.990
don't understand they'll talk about this

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:16.560
kind of stuff I'm back in my day

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:22.900
now Oh can't you see I've got gimpy I'm

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:25.870
this Samson runs full of free damage

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:28.930
good thanks to razor B it's my spacebar

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:30.700
item please do Jimmy's gonna create half

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:34.930
red hearts for us we got we got a good

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:38.250
thing going it's a knock dad Oh can't

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:42.430
you see my dope synergy I'm okay let's

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:46.390
stop with that we do need to get luck

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:49.000
upgrades to really make it pop stop

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:52.870
taking my money dude it's not even like

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.820
you know I'm not being spiracle I would

00:13:52.870 --> 00:14:00.850
like you to not take my money anymore

00:13:54.820 --> 00:14:07.780
because I would like to use it myself if

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:10.540
we were truly brazen we could still use

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:12.250
a razor blade almost as if it's how to

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:16.510
jump and all I mean by that is we could

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:18.310
use it to trigger our time to

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:21.520
invulnerability from taking damage and

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:23.440
then not take damage from the enemy so

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:27.430
we could use it productively in that

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:28.990
regard is it a good strat I think if you

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:31.420
could get it off it's a good strat

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:32.860
there's no punishment to it except for

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:36.760
you'll take a lot of damage but you'll

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:41.020
get something out of it is the dream at

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:42.820
least we're going to be on pace for boss

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:45.089
Russian to be honest with you the

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:48.250
ability to use the razor blade often

00:14:45.089 --> 00:14:50.580
throughout boss rush is kind of a it's a

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.580
draw

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:56.980
we'll see how things work here

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:58.690
Bombo just keep chewing it's like a

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.160
finding Dory situation just keep

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.570
swimming except instead of swimming

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:04.120
because you know I don't want to sing

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:10.360
the song again will do just keep

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:11.649
shooting eat him up he's done what 18

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.269
percent that's because I froze up and

00:15:11.649 --> 00:15:17.380
took that damage I remember now

00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:19.480
belly button nose Goblin let's go say it

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:24.970
with me three two one let's go

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:28.510
we got this one okay so don't take

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:30.360
idiotic damage this time yo NL why are

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:36.339
you being an idiot here check this out

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:38.260
wait a minute I was just checking I I

00:15:36.339 --> 00:15:42.010
wanted to preserve the spirit heart but

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:43.690
I also like definitely did not want to

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:45.149
accidentally have that count as red

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:48.310
heart damage and just ruin our whole

00:15:45.149 --> 00:15:51.430
shebang here it seems like we got a good

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:53.970
set up though so we should use

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:59.740
especially what we've got protection I

00:15:53.970 --> 00:16:02.140
know we should use razor blade fairly

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:04.329
frequently because we get the permanent

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:07.269
bonus of the the bloody lust damage so

00:16:04.329 --> 00:16:08.649
sure we lose the razor blade bonus and

00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:10.240
being able to use the razor blade five

00:16:08.649 --> 00:16:11.649
times on one room would also be pretty

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:20.500
valuable depending on what room it is

00:16:11.649 --> 00:16:22.060
but we we do benefit from having more

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.380
opportunities here as well so we can

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.029
also create permanent polaroid

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.500
invincibility this way and now that I

00:16:25.029 --> 00:16:28.240
think about it we can also make dark

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:33.760
Prince's crown work which is not the

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:35.290
worst idea because we don't have any we

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:38.649
don't have any tears ups over the course

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:40.630
of this entire run so we should have

00:16:38.649 --> 00:16:43.089
dark Prince's crown now I mean our rate

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:45.910
of fire is only seven it's not like it's

00:16:43.089 --> 00:16:49.510
out of control and we ruined it

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:51.220
immediately but ignoring that you know

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:52.690
my heart was in the right place I think

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:56.459
all right let's light the boss we've got

00:16:52.690 --> 00:17:00.370
a 100 Evelyn and to be honest with you

00:16:56.459 --> 00:17:01.779
desirous of that because we got lots of

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:03.440
red heart containers we can afford to

00:17:01.779 --> 00:17:05.839
give away you know I'm stack

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.930
all this you know liquid asset I got no

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:11.540
need for it let's turn it into some

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:13.819
equity or something like that little

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:18.319
gears give me some devil equity the

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:20.510
equity Incubus decent choice I mean

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:25.130
great item to begin with but specific to

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:27.680
our synergies decent because it will get

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:28.820
all the bonuses from our heels so or

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.160
something up from our heels but from our

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:37.570
extra damage so this seems like a pretty

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:37.570
solid setup to me it was a luck upgrade

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:42.710
almost blew myself up with a bum bow

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:45.350
bomb there keep it going we got to be

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:48.200
smart here because we're light on keys

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:50.360
so just be aware of that

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.650
try to use bombs wherever possible s I

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:55.630
mean now what we're looking for to be

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:57.770
honest if you remote detonator but we

00:17:55.630 --> 00:18:00.050
this is going to be our secret room we

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:03.500
didn't have to use a key bag there that

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:10.760
was silly got some bombs out of it we

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:14.570
got 36 bombs though well this is fine

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:18.620
we'll take starter deck temper it's so

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:19.900
good two of spades buy it didn't have to

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.980
do it this way but that's fine

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:27.700
temperance how do you use temperance

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:30.650
well next floor is next floor is

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:32.540
possible arcade so I think you save the

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:34.190
temperance to try to use it there and we

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:36.440
can get mad bonuses out of it especially

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:38.420
if we get blood bag normally we want a V

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:40.010
bag but we kind of have it already so if

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:44.660
we can get blood bag I'm a very happy

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:46.130
camper here for now we'll just make sure

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.600
to pop this on the regular again the

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:49.460
longer we can keep dark Prince's crown

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:52.640
active the happier I am even though I

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:53.840
would say it's not mission critical is

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.080
there were that's the opposite of

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:59.300
critical but in an elegant fashion like

00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:03.740
it's not not important it's just not

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:05.060
that important yeah I'm going to give it

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:08.000
a try because I want a half red heart we

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:09.800
got two keys out of it anyway but wanted

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.410
something a little bit more then I ever

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:15.790
started for now I have this chance to be

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:17.510
all the things you saw in me NL was that

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:20.180
Clay Aiken

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:23.630
post American Idol song how did you know

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:26.450
I'm a big a can head i love his songs

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:28.340
something more if i were invisible akin

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:32.770
breaking heart has a really good one

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:35.800
till Stevie Ray Cyrus ripped it off

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:39.620
Stevie Ray Wonder I mean sorry

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:43.490
okay let's fruitcake a good pickup

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:45.830
usually like I don't think it's that

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:48.650
that good but I think in this case it's

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:51.470
completely okay you know I always take

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:55.340
it but sometimes I wish I didn't is the

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:58.100
way that it usually goes because we

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:59.600
oftentimes you know if you ever hurt

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.860
yourself with it you go well I'm an

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:03.110
idiot

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:05.150
so give me a spirit are we got zero luck

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:08.120
just give me a spirit hard lovers card

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:09.740
is even better actually so I don't think

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:11.630
we need the razor blade ourselves to

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:14.270
make this happen we're really trying to

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:16.190
create like the maximum number of Gertie

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:19.010
charges and then also if we can get like

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:20.630
blood bag I'm very happy I'll sacrifice

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:28.430
some spirit hearts here doesn't bother

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:30.860
me now we got mad plays here mostly I

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:36.890
mean the HP is fine but it's straight up

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:39.590
the the now we don't need it it's

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:40.880
straight up the extra read hard set that

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:42.560
matters the most to me so we have more

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.270
room to use the razor blade every single

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.590
floor now if we can find some way to

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:47.360
regenerate hearts a little bit more

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:50.630
frequently even better but apart from

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:52.580
that love and life dude I think we have

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:54.860
a pretty good case to actually like do

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:57.050
boss rush here but it's going to have to

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:59.900
be an item that's you know worthy of

00:20:57.050 --> 00:21:01.610
doing boss rush none of this like you

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:04.240
know strange attractor but we have a

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:08.200
sense of obligation nonsense you know

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:12.770
it's going to have to bring the heat

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:16.100
$0.03 states your war that's all I'm a

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:17.750
hard negotiator I walk in and I go you

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:19.370
listen sir you tell me how much I'm

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:21.050
going to pay for this and I'll write you

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:21.920
a check right here wait a minute that's

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:25.460
not what I meant

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:27.110
you drive a hard bargain sir but then

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.790
later you just default on your payments

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:30.800
that's how you get them everyone's

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:31.309
always worried about well how do you pay

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.720
for

00:21:31.309 --> 00:21:38.480
don't get the best price possible in

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:39.980
your car negotiations just don't make

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:44.509
the payments when they come in that's

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:45.860
the easy way note the creator of this

00:21:44.509 --> 00:21:47.870
YouTube video would like you to

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:49.730
recognize that this is satire and does

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:51.320
not represent the beliefs of him or

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:54.259
anyone on his production company which

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:57.499
doesn't exist all right let's see the

00:21:54.259 --> 00:22:04.809
deal what do you got for me here yeah I

00:21:57.499 --> 00:22:07.100
mean actually Deadeye is like fantastic

00:22:04.809 --> 00:22:09.460
so we're going to we're going to stack

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:09.460
it up

00:22:10.419 --> 00:22:18.499
hello oh there's one of you left and

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:21.740
we're we're going to do ridiculous

00:22:18.499 --> 00:22:24.409
damage like we're already at 40 to 40

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:27.740
damage it's really just going to get

00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:29.960
better because we can do it with the

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:32.710
razor blade without incurring like any

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.710
cost to ourselves

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:43.629
and we're getting so many red hearts

00:22:40.149 --> 00:22:45.369
back because of gimpy anyway and the

00:22:43.629 --> 00:22:49.330
spirit arts as well don't get me wrong

00:22:45.369 --> 00:22:50.919
um we should try to keep uh keep

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:53.289
ourselves going here when it comes to

00:22:50.919 --> 00:22:55.090
dark Prince's crown but you also

00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:58.029
probably recognize at the same time that

00:22:55.090 --> 00:23:00.429
it doesn't really matter you know the

00:22:58.029 --> 00:23:02.590
fact that we have sixty damage without

00:23:00.429 --> 00:23:05.259
epic act is like a whole new world for

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:11.139
me I don't know what is the red pooop'

00:23:05.259 --> 00:23:21.099
that hit me there it must have been red

00:23:11.139 --> 00:23:22.779
poop dude you don't want any part of

00:23:21.099 --> 00:23:25.479
this I sure I know we're only in 63

00:23:22.779 --> 00:23:26.979
damage but that will change man I know

00:23:25.479 --> 00:23:32.229
it keeps going like way up and then it

00:23:26.979 --> 00:23:34.899
comes back down oh you know what it is

00:23:32.229 --> 00:23:37.029
our fruit cake tears popping off and

00:23:34.899 --> 00:23:40.330
then you know switching from being

00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:44.529
popped off I understand we're at like

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:45.999
maximum usefulness more or less out of

00:23:44.529 --> 00:23:49.479
the razor blade right now if hearts come

00:23:45.999 --> 00:23:51.249
to me I'll grab them but I'm not going

00:23:49.479 --> 00:23:57.129
to walk too far out of my way to pick

00:23:51.249 --> 00:23:58.869
anything up here see though might be

00:23:57.129 --> 00:24:01.239
nice to have some HP left for the next

00:23:58.869 --> 00:24:03.099
floor just in case you know things might

00:24:01.239 --> 00:24:06.700
go a little off the rails at some point

00:24:03.099 --> 00:24:12.070
you never know it was very fast we might

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:13.539
be coming close to Beelzebub and we

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:18.340
definitely will make the hush fight as

00:24:13.539 --> 00:24:21.759
well if we if we have the desire and the

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:24.039
know-how to lead us to a new land I know

00:24:21.759 --> 00:24:29.049
I'm making that reference a lot alright

00:24:24.039 --> 00:24:31.139
it will do it um no no we need we need

00:24:29.049 --> 00:24:33.369
all of these trinkets these trinkets are

00:24:31.139 --> 00:24:35.200
about two percent of the reason we're

00:24:33.369 --> 00:24:39.249
winning right now which is a lot right

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:43.979
at the present moment it's a lot rate is

00:24:39.249 --> 00:24:46.290
what I'm not haha that's silly okay

00:24:43.979 --> 00:24:48.430
let's just

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:49.810
hurt ourselves a little bit with the

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:52.180
razor blade you know I'm not used to

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:53.590
dealing nine damage doesn't feel right

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:59.470
we got to crank that up as soon as

00:24:53.590 --> 00:25:01.210
possible nine damage is not what I was

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:08.650
built for on this run we were built for

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:10.330
60 like a Ford Fiesta now we can use the

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:11.890
razor blade I mean as like a destination

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:16.180
we can use it in a couple of different

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:17.380
ways one would be to stop at half a

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.940
heart so we get permanent polaroid

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.410
invincibility the other one would be to

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:23.680
stop at one full heart so we get the

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:24.820
tears up I'm usually the tears up is not

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.980
going to be as relevant as permanent

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:29.920
polaroid invincibility but with no tears

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:32.850
ups like with us at below average rate

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:36.610
of fire I do find myself kind of like I

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:41.050
value going to seven rate of fire maybe

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:43.360
more than is prudent you know from from

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:48.070
someone of my standing in the community

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:49.810
but I don't care what they say I love

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:56.260
this item no it's not sure I don't

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:58.900
really but for free it's fine

00:25:56.260 --> 00:26:02.320
I mean it's a free contingent tears

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:04.810
upgrade I'd rather have a much smaller

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:09.340
magnitude of Tears upgrade that is

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:11.800
always on but again all we paid with the

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:16.450
access fee for the curse room so I ain't

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:21.250
sweating it we're actually doing fairly

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:22.840
well with guppies tale you know

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:28.180
considering all the goals and chefs we

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:29.890
could be getting no deal along with 72%

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:31.480
chance that's a bummer considering all

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:33.130
the deals of the devil or considering

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:35.020
all the golden chests we could be

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:36.220
getting we're keeping ourselves pretty

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:42.370
key okay

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:43.600
key rich and now really but key okay not

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:47.190
karaoke okay

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:47.190
not the Kaioken

00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:54.399
that was euthanasia but like the best

00:26:51.789 --> 00:26:57.850
version of these in Asia is Folgers in

00:26:54.399 --> 00:27:00.039
your cup so it was like a euthanasia

00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:04.450
chain you don't see that too often also

00:27:00.039 --> 00:27:06.909
seems like a terrible expression I'm not

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:09.820
anti euthanasia moreover it's irrelevant

00:27:06.909 --> 00:27:12.940
for the purposes of this video I'm just

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:15.730
saying something icky when you say the

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:17.559
phrase use an Asia chain it's like the a

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:19.120
doctor would describe his workday as

00:27:17.559 --> 00:27:22.590
being like that and I'd be like you kind

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.590
of been sensitive right now buddy

00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:29.529
those are people doc I thought you got

00:27:27.879 --> 00:27:36.850
in this profession to help people not

00:27:29.529 --> 00:27:40.899
just to cash million-dollar checks you

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:42.639
got spirit hearts we got I mean I don't

00:27:40.899 --> 00:27:44.440
want to insult the run because the runs

00:27:42.639 --> 00:27:47.799
good and I could be using razor blade

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:51.159
more often we do have like six damage by

00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:52.929
default that's not that good we were at

00:27:51.159 --> 00:27:56.139
five on like the second floor so we

00:27:52.929 --> 00:27:56.769
haven't universally improved all that

00:27:56.139 --> 00:28:00.720
much

00:27:56.769 --> 00:28:03.190
okay don't walk into the red poops but

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:05.230
admittedly the razor blade child's heart

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:07.539
and gimpy basically give us the ability

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:09.460
to use the razor blade at least once

00:28:07.539 --> 00:28:15.700
every few rooms and that's good enough

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:17.080
to take us to like 12 damaged easily or

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:19.210
whatever the highest damage we can get

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:24.610
to is it I think it's doubles so

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:26.620
somewhere in the 12 range Wow we've

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:29.889
mom's key or is that just like a really

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:31.360
really lucky chest little Steven which

00:28:29.889 --> 00:28:33.299
is actually regular-sized Steven it's

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:35.139
actually I always forget that it's a

00:28:33.299 --> 00:28:38.970
decent damage levels it's

00:28:35.139 --> 00:28:38.970
proportionately a pretty nice damage up

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:44.110
okay so we have a little bit of an

00:28:42.639 --> 00:28:48.610
interesting conundrum when it comes to

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:52.710
this hush fight I'm going to do it but

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:52.710
we got a got to talk ourselves up

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:58.470
let's go we got a deal we really like

00:28:57.090 --> 00:29:00.000
struck out on deal with the devil

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:03.299
frequency on this run we don't want to

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.620
take it down trash out of here okay we

00:29:03.299 --> 00:29:10.250
got 99 cents so we gotta do this but and

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:12.659
sorry for your ears I'm sure that the

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:16.320
uncompressed ratio is probably not very

00:29:12.659 --> 00:29:20.669
pleasant right there you got two wheels

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:23.580
of fortune chariot temperance javi here

00:29:20.669 --> 00:29:26.130
and temperance chair here and temperance

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:30.299
do you remember the song from the 1990s

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:40.500
is actually the early 2001 mmm chariot

00:29:30.299 --> 00:29:42.750
and temper events one full heart

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:44.309
why don't I happen grab these bad boys

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:47.870
might as well get a little head start on

00:29:44.309 --> 00:29:52.049
the damage bonus is my philosophy here

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:56.880
of people these pills whoo there's not

00:29:52.049 --> 00:29:58.139
pills because of starter deck right

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.850
there's no secret rooms but sometimes

00:29:58.139 --> 00:30:01.919
there's a crawl space that's right let's

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:03.269
peep a potential crawl space and what do

00:30:01.919 --> 00:30:04.889
you want here dude they're both like

00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:06.690
pretty good but if we want to keep

00:30:04.889 --> 00:30:08.340
Samson's dream alive we should take the

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:13.049
fire rate out for a damage downgrade

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:14.779
that's a huge fire rate up but I said

00:30:13.049 --> 00:30:16.769
that that that that yeah that's solid I

00:30:14.779 --> 00:30:18.210
mean I was the one saying that that

00:30:16.769 --> 00:30:19.279
thought that but you get the idea let's

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:22.440
go

00:30:19.279 --> 00:30:27.690
it's a crawl space to crawl spaces Data

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:30.980
Miner let's go back you know what I'm

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:30.980
thinking it's like what do we do with

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:39.850
what do we do with Ace of Hearts

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:44.740
especially not knowing what our HP is

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:46.920
like a sort of feel weird like maybe we

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:53.440
should take a sub hearts into the fight

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:59.350
and then turn like a lot or as many as

00:30:53.440 --> 00:31:00.700
we can at least we got at least one play

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:02.260
there that's going to be fine and gimpy

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:03.910
hooked us up so you know what as a nice

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:07.930
thank-you to gimpy let's do it again

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:09.730
I was willing to pay the cost so let's

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:12.820
get double the benefit so I'm thinking

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:14.260
like we got a lot of hearts in there so

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:18.670
I just used ace of hearts and like

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:24.940
stacked it so we should pick up red

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:26.320
hearts until we can we can't pick that

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:30.790
one up we're taking a little bit of

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:34.890
damage here razor blade red heart razor

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:34.890
blade half red heart full red heart

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:47.590
razor blade grabbed it razor blade half

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:54.070
red heart might want to cool it a little

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:55.540
bit we are at 57 damage there's a decent

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:56.950
number of red hearts in there but I

00:31:55.540 --> 00:32:02.940
might not be able to access them as

00:31:56.950 --> 00:32:02.940
easily as I'd like this is a stomp dude

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:09.539
great hush fight easy is hush fight in

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:13.830

00:33:35.309 --> 00:33:38.100
you're making fun of the restaurant and

00:33:36.539 --> 00:33:39.809
in some ways you kind of poking fun at

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:41.700
them but it's because they have a super

00:33:39.809 --> 00:33:45.570
serious all I didn't kill everything in

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:47.250
there like a super billboard the hot 200

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:49.820
jingle for a restaurant that's about

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:55.169
making barbecue so it's a little

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:58.049
atypical but I think it's good give it a

00:33:55.169 --> 00:34:01.070
