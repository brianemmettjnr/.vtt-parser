00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.540
hey everybody welcome Aaron lampreys

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.130
finding about the Edwards Plus we're

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.760
making good progress having good runs

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.410
and I'm not ready for apollyon yet but

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.960
I'm also not ready for Azazel you know

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.190
we haven't done an Eve eyeline like

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.240
hitting characters where we can get

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:22.170
multiple things done in the same run k8s

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.900
kp2 jnt just sounds like a normal it's a

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.960
normal sentence that an alien might have

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.539
as Eve we can do bath rush we can do

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.669
Sheol and we or we I guess I should say

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.160
can do the Cathedral and it should all

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.480
work out eh okay for us hey especially

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.920
now that we've guaranteed ourselves the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.969
Whore of Babylon state by getting one of

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.399
the worst pills in the game so lets you

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.870
and I just pretend that instead of

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.640
getting a health down pill that annoys

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.160
the crap out of me what actually

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.050
happened there was we picked up a deal

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.969
with the devil where we traded one HP

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.430
for Whore of Babylon same exact criteria

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.170
however I feel so much better about it

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.780
because it's like we got something out

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.489
of it instead of just having something

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.299
removed from us with no possible

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.590
contingency we don't have it early I was

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.450
going to say the human mind but weird

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.159
how my mind works like that dude okay

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.330
first off I'm very disappointed by the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.850
fact that we got hit there but at the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.299
same time wait what is actually a 12 out

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.540
of 10 item for us right now I will not

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.790
pick up blister it's a garbage trinket

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.670
I'm sorry to say I hate to be the bearer

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.479
of bad news there but it really is

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.540
terrible I wish you weren't so emergency

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:42.409
contact IMO that's how we the internet

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.409
age say I'm merely a pining

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.320
it is uh what was I talking about there

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.780
I got so mind blooded into my joke that

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.480
I forgot to actually finish the coherent

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.590
threaded conversation of multi-threaded

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.180
my brain but one of the cores is busted

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.770
nice damage I was going to say emergency

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.940
contact something and I believe what I

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.610
was going to finish that with is the

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.430
autofill of emergency contact is sort of

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.300
overrated in my opinion like a glorified

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:15.280
teleport card a lot of kind of meme

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.260
cards and pills in the game I don't know

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.390
if this is necessarily one of them but I

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.130
think it's much much much more valuable

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.740
for us to hold on to two of diamonds

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:28.060
instead now we did kind of in in a way

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.280
we kind of screwed ourselves by

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.780
accidentally getting the halo it's

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.920
awesome that the stats upgrade and it

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.780
will be better now that we have a chance

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.550
to get ourselves back in or Babylon

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.260
Saviour thanks to a particularly

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.760
cooperative arcade that thankfully

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.310
doesn't just have a key beggar in it

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.720
which happens with more regularity than

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.550
I'd like to admit

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.900
yeah parents enjoy peers are lovely as

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.940
well this one's actually popping off I

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.160
got nothing to complain about I can't

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.590
complain about losing HP and then also

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.820
gaining HP like you just become a broken

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.380
record at that point you don't want to

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.440
get a reputation as a guy who complains

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.450
about absolutely everything when I

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.180
complain about social faux pas I want

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.590
you to know that it all outside I want

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.480
you to know that it's like it's intended

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.459
to be signed feldene it's usually a bit

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.050
do I get annoyed with people in public

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:15.790
it happens on occasion my number one pet

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.560
peeve in my life should tell you how a

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.450
shelter my life is but it takes us

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.300
forever to get into a lobby on the N LSS

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.030
I still to this day I don't understand

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.890
it some games are to blame but sometimes

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.630
I got to blame myself and my co-hosts

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.330
like there's only like four different

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.840
archetypes for Lobby server browser into

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.580
a join join on me send me an invite or

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.670
enter this code those are the only four

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.560
and yet it for a long time it's taken us

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.260
like eight or nine minutes to get into

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.670
any I digress at this point like I said

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.640
I mean at some point

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.110
like just grab a politician by the

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.190
scruff of their neck drag them out here

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.459
and say this is it

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.530
this scoop this is all we are that's the

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.780
famous quote from the astronaut anyway

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.010
not Buzz Aldrin there's other astronauts

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.940
I've heard what about Julie Payette

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:08.860
right next governor of Governor General

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:10.660
sorry of Canada choose an adage of

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.010
Canadian accent I don't know if anybody

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.080
else outside of Canada and those who'd

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.310
really Pietism the same so we might as

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.810
well take book of belial

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.700
and I'll give you one good reason for

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:25.330
that it allows us to very very easily

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:27.160
grab the yeah that was incredibly stupid

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.410
let's be honest but it allows us to very

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.590
very easily grab the blood bag which

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.229
allows us to get old 99 bombs it allows

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.180
us to get a speed upgrade which we may

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:40.930
or may not even need but why not grab it

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.639
while we have the chance right and this

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.950
way we don't ruin horror Babylon now we

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.300
don't get much out of book of a while

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.979
actually we might if we end up in the

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.990
library that only has two books here

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.640
then we got book form essentially out of

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.450
it instead we ended up on the library

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.620
with one book not quite as good so I

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.580
guess we're going to two of diamonds and

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:07.560
hold the Joker card the self damage is

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:07.560
so bad here now I will tell you

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.470
it's a good run I don't know where I was

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.630
going to go with that except for saying

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.460
it's a good run I got very little to

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.780
complain about parasitoids years is very

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.160
nice or a minute and a half ahead of

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.040
schedule with more damage than you'd

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.590
expect oh I remember what I was going to

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.990
say I was going to say that I'm not

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.190
super worried about not using two of

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.380
diamonds that effectively and that

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:36.390
actually just illustrated my point for

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:38.400
me which is that we normally as existing

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.660
blah blah blah blah especially recently

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.240
we've only been able to donate like

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.920
three cents to the donation machine

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.870
before it cracks and you know renders it

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.960
inoperable from that point forward so I

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.640
am not really worried about the fact

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.280
that we weren't able to get to 99 cents

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.600
there because of the fact that the

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.990
donation mystery machines have been

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.580
fairly uncooperative here unfortunately

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.520
for me and everybody else involved all

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.230
right

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.290
give this gone so I was just closing a

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:10.560
tab in the background that was probably

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:15.180
the worst use of wait what that I could

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:17.790
imagine and then we got I'm excited as a

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.500
result so it was like even worse than I

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:25.680
could even conceive of at first blush

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:28.200
but we aren't actually that stoked to

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:31.140
have waitwhat anymore because we already

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.910
have unlimited bonds so first off to

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:37.440
start dodging again this is getting a

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:39.600
little ridiculous but we going to Joker

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:43.170
it up here see if we can leverage our

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:45.480
existing HP it is mildly inefficient but

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.310
you know it's like you've working at the

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.540
plant for twenty years you can take some

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.310
mild inefficiencies

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.990
yeah the young pups are going to come in

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.790
and be like you know we're using speed

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.860
instead of industrial lubricant you're

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:57.420
going to be like look buddy this isn't

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:04.100
my first day in the San Fernando Valley

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:04.100
I know how to get the lawnmower started

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.190
if you know what I mean some kind of

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.770
gook all these guys up the benefit the

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.810
wait what is that it conceptually and

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.660
mentally kind of like removes the guilts

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.980
that I have about using bombs even when

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.120
I have ninety nine of them but that's

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.530
like a personal problem

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.210
you shouldn't suffer from that unless

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:26.290
you you know you're cut from the same

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:28.720
cloth that I am it just feels better to

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:30.730
use okay it just feels better to use

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.590
wait what once per room to weaken

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:34.690
enemies then to throw down a bomb and I

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:37.300
guess it's like an instant detonation no

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.020
breathing don't give an F if I cut my

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.900
arm bleeding

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:44.200
we got backstabber which I believe is

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:48.480
the first time we've had that in the

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.480
same file so it's not all for naught I

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.950
totally forgot by the way I mean I'm

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.870
going to do greed but I'm sure people

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:57.910
have started clamoring for it to some

00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:00.040
extent I totally forgot that we have to

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:02.260
not only do green mode we have to get

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.240
our greed mode machine in ninety nine or

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:10.660
sorry nine hundred ninety nine cents oh

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:13.180
my lord is going to take forever or two

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:15.910
inch in recall gives us a ton of cards

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:18.220
right yeah thread on temperance double

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:20.020
of those two here a fun dude taro cloth

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:21.820
is so good I use the world card just to

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:25.979
get it out of the way but it's pretty

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:28.990
silly actually Wow

00:08:25.979 --> 00:08:33.700
so we're kind of ballin out of control

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:35.909
here we got IV bag which actually has

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:42.940
some reason to use it

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:44.589
the big reason being that it will keep

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:47.560
us in the Whore of Babylon state if

00:08:44.589 --> 00:08:48.970
that's something we're desirous of hold

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.980
on to the full card for now yeah oh I

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:53.620
didn't mean to buy that we got a lot of

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:57.220
money in the process here as well so

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:59.410
moving box is no good in my opinion it's

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:01.540
it's got a certain weirdness that I

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:04.500
begrudge alieve respect but I don't

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:06.700
think it's particularly good

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.330
wasn't there a fool card in here that

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.220
yeah there we go

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:12.730
and then there was a two of hearts that

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:14.200
we don't want it would be really nice

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.580
not on this books we already know what

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.899
this work contains would be really nice

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:20.500
on the next word to get a deal with the

00:09:16.899 --> 00:09:23.050
devil because we are dangerously close

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:24.790
to being dangerously close to not being

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:26.140
able to create horror battle on we can

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:28.360
do it easily on this floor just by

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:30.520
walking back to that shop but on our

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:35.140
present floor we can't do jack about it

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:39.130
and that's a problem so the best course

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:41.260
of action here would be to not pick up

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:44.800
any red hearts which I have almost no

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:47.980
faith in myself to recreate but if we

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:49.180
can stick to that ideology we should be

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.770
fine otherwise we could find ourselves

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.330
in the same shoes that we were in on the

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:53.620
last run and if you're going what's

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.149
wrong with the last run you got to win

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.830
you need to go back and watch that run

00:09:55.149 --> 00:09:58.270
more closely because we were really

00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:00.580
really suffering from a damage

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:03.130
standpoint but to be fair simple we'll

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:05.860
save that as a problem for later you

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:07.660
guys on that song save it for later I

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:10.660
think this song by building which we

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:13.089
save it like it's not only used in

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:16.089
spider-man homecoming but I believe also

00:10:13.089 --> 00:10:18.250
possibly in Dumb and Dumber give me a

00:10:16.089 --> 00:10:22.420

00:10:31.939 --> 00:10:34.910
crack performed by circle the Wagen I

00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:45.199
don't think that's it

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:47.929
oh yeah it's from another movie like

00:10:45.199 --> 00:10:49.999
another Farrelly Brothers movie anyway

00:10:47.929 --> 00:10:51.459
I'm not look I only brought it up

00:10:49.999 --> 00:10:54.110
because I thought that I was going to

00:10:51.459 --> 00:10:56.540
make myself seem more intelligent by

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:57.949
remembering what movie it was from but

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.720
it doesn't matter that much I'm telling

00:10:57.949 --> 00:11:01.429
you it's a fairly brothers movie I don't

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.990
think it's the I don't think it's just

00:11:01.429 --> 00:11:06.220
something about Mary that's all Jonathan

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:09.829
Richman friends would say so Pliner

you got it you got a let me check I'm

00:11:12.199 --> 00:11:15.439
sorry that's very self-indulgent I mean

00:11:13.879 --> 00:11:19.660
what do you mean you gotta let me check

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:35.330
you see I don't think that I have a

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:38.930
special frame what I do think is that I

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:40.340
understand the ins and outs of my brain

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:42.500
I understand that deep within it is

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:44.450
locked some information and I for

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:47.330
whatever reason have conceived of the

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:50.900
tools to get it out I got my mind palace

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:54.430
it is a fairly brothers movie it's not

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:57.320
something about married woody harrelson

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:59.690
probably you know one of his top 20

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:02.360
roles where he rose he's one of those

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:05.360
guys who said it deceptively maybe not

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:08.780
even deceptively but a nice career with

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:11.500
a lot of critical successes the new

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:13.490
Planet of the Apes films Zombieland

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:15.050
you might turn up your nose at

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:17.720
Zombieland a little bit because it's got

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:19.220
a bit of a silly subject matter but it's

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:22.880
just a funny movie is what it really

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:25.070
comes down to and then you know recently

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:27.260
the edge of seventeen don't forget about

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:33.170
No Country for Old Men the People vs

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:34.850
Larry Flynt he was on shears Seven

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:38.200
Psychopaths he's been a lot of great

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:41.060
things and this is like you know

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.770
excluding kingpin which some people will

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:45.290
do in some people whoa I got to stop

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:46.940
I got a sawfish spot for kingpin it's

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:49.010
not like I don't think it's a nine out

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:51.440
of ten movie again there is a moment in

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:55.730
that and I've talked about this on the

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:59.240
LSS but it bears repeating now he's on a

00:12:55.730 --> 00:13:01.040
farm with a bunch of Amish people and he

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.720
shows everyone's like where's Rowley and

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.940
then I don't know we went out early this

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.560
morning to do some farm work and then

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:09.130
comes back and he's got a milk mustache

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:13.580
and a big bucket full of white fluid and

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:15.350
they go he goes like whoo you know tough

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:18.380
to find the otter but once it got going

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:19.460
it just didn't stop and then they're

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.720
like what are you talking about and he's

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.940
like well I just got finished milking

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:25.730
your towel and they go we don't have a

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:29.950
cow we have a bowl and as a kid I was

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:33.260
like that's funny just this idiot

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:37.160
accidentally like did a you know seed

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:39.020
extraction from a from a cow from a bowl

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.150
of thinking of as a cow it's not milk at

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:43.520
all and out of the same variety that you

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:45.400
were looking for at least as an adult I

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.630
was like this has troubling implications

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:49.940
it means that Woody Harrelson's

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:53.080
character is actually like he should not

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:55.370
be able to live by himself out in public

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:57.440
you're telling me you can't identify the

00:13:55.370 --> 00:14:00.950
difference between a cow and a bull

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:03.290
based on there's like literal sexual

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:05.240
organs strikes me as being a little bit

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:07.670
of a stretch for the joke plus I don't

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:10.970
want to ask but how did you get a whole

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:13.220
bucket he had like a glassful I might

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:15.940
understand but a whole bucket is a

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:20.090
little stretching that and people go oh

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:22.910
it's just a silly movie NL yeah okay but

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:27.230
they like set up the joke they didn't

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:30.920
just go hey your breath smells like you

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:33.170
know semen they set up the joke is if

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.870
there was like a logical progression

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:37.730
that made sense that this actually

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:40.250
happened which is why I call it into

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:43.970
question if they just said wouldn't it

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:47.270
be funny if he thought a bull was a cow

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:49.220
I wouldn't come at it on the same level

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:50.600
here but when you go for this set up and

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.280
you it's like when somebody tells you a

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.840
joke and it just goes on and it's like a

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.700
Norman Ahnold joke like it just goes on

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.720
and on and on through the opening

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.610
segment and you're waiting for the

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.290
punchline and then the punchline is the

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:02.710
fact that you tolerated the joke in the

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.710
first place

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.870
I'm not against that style if you but I

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:13.910
don't think that's what they were going

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:15.650
for nothing nothing I shouldn't say this

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:17.990
is nothing you never know if it was

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:20.210
nothing what we did you know what out of

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:28.730
all that we got two-spirit arts I'm

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:31.070
feeling good about that I do wonder how

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:32.570
I remember that kingpin scene I don't I

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:35.120
can't even picture the moment that it's

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:37.910
in in the movie in my head when I hear

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:41.930
when I heard say the phone later all I

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:44.060
could think of for some reason was like

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:45.920
them being in a car no I totally

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.840
remembered there is a time where they're

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.790
driving and they're teaching the Amish

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:52.010
guy had it's a montage as they make

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:53.600
their road trip to Reno Nevada to win a

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:55.490
million dollars in those bowling

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.400
tournament against Bill Murray's

00:15:55.490 --> 00:16:02.210
masterful turn as Ernie McCracken

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:03.320
history's greatest monster that's when

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:07.490
they play the montage

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:12.410
I totally recall now because if it's

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:14.030
never left my mind palace I'm going to

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:16.490
ask you I'm coming at this from an

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:19.370
honest perspective do you guys think

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:21.350
Darren Brown is a charlatan to some

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:23.900
extent here's where I'm coming at this

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:26.540
from okay and I'm seeing a lot of Darren

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:29.660
brown content is a British quote-unquote

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:32.090
Mentalist definitely magician I don't

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:34.220
think that he's a liar is what I'm

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:38.240
trying to get at I suppose but I think

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:40.430
that a lot of his tricks might be doing

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:42.770
and I don't know this for sure but might

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:44.630
be doing the very thing that he tells

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:46.340
you to be warned against because he's in

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:48.260
all of his series he want you to be

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:50.480
skeptical right he's always like you

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.770
know here's how people do like cold

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.180
reading to make themselves seem like

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:54.410
they're psychics I'm going to take

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.480
monsters too because we have so many

00:16:54.410 --> 00:17:00.320
bombs like wait what is just meaningless

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:01.760
places and you know you're here's some

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.890
tricks that people can pull to kind of

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.050
make themselves subdue confidence tricks

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:08.480
on you basically but I sort of think

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:12.459
that he might be doing the same thing in

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:14.310
a lot of his sketches that's just a

00:17:12.459 --> 00:17:16.440
moving box again

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:19.890
like for example there is a sketch in

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:21.720
which he supposedly in sets people

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:24.930
before incepting people was even that

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:27.450
thing with the idea to rob a bank and

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:29.040
then he plays like a musical cue and

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:31.710
gets them all to rob a bank and then

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.880
after it they're like oh man I don't

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:34.200
know what happened I don't know what

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.170
came over me I just felt an overwhelming

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:40.760
desire to rob the bank I'm not claiming

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:46.140
that necessarily you know hypnosis is

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:47.640
false the hypnosis is you know heavily

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:50.970
influenced by the power of suggestion

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.510
and how suggestible you are or even want

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.850
to be

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:56.430
that's my lay person's perspective at

00:17:53.850 --> 00:18:02.040
least but that strikes me as TV magic

00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:04.350
that's that's editing right I will take

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:08.360
this my actual favorite Darren brown

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:12.990
clip is one where he plays like 13

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:15.750
masters in chess at the same time and

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:18.690
for anybody all we picked up red house

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:20.580
for anybody who's not familiar being a

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:23.850
simultaneous chess player is very

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:27.630
difficult because it's not just about

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:30.840
like it takes mental processing power to

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:32.400
look at a board you know remember the

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.200
state of the board or reacquire the

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.060
state of the board and then you know oh

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.910
this is what my plan was here like chess

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:41.430
is all about adapting but also long-term

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:43.920
planning and execution so it's very

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:45.450
impressive to play thirteen strong chess

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:48.810
players and come away with a winning

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:51.930
record is incredible but anyway he plays

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:54.450
thirteen or nine or something the number

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:57.780
is important chess players at the same

00:18:54.450 --> 00:19:02.280
time and he comes away with a winning

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:03.450
record while the 50% record I think if I

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.520
remember correctly has been like 10

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:10.850
years since I see eight but he like wins

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:12.690
half or like 48 percent loses 48 percent

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:15.660
let me rephrase this because I'm

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:17.820
confusing myself here he wins like seven

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:19.740
games and loses six games

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:21.990
to come away with the winning record and

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:25.590
what he did at least what he claimed he

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:28.800
did was he just remembered the moves

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:30.960
that the person used against him when he

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:33.510
gets around to that side of the table so

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.010
you know he starts by playing black on

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:38.600
like the first six boards or something

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:40.920
like that and then he makes a move

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:43.200
remembers what they did for their move

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.820
his white and essentially he just copies

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.380
that move when he gets to the exact

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:48.480
other side of the circle on which he's

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:50.490
playing so he's basically I'm explaining

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.350
it poorly but basically he's serving as

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:53.880
a vessel for six chess players to play

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:56.250
six more chess players and then the

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.900
seventh guy or the the thirteenth guy I

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.310
guess he just has to be which is

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.660
impressive enough in its own right so

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:02.370
you try to I guess put the weaker player

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:05.580
there again I think there might be a

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:08.940
little bit of a movie magic there but I

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:12.780
found that clever although I guess it

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:14.520
only works once start looking at the the

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:16.620
notation after the game and be like uh

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.450
this looks very similar that's that's a

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:21.690
cool trick I like that but the stuff

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:25.410
where you like that the bank-robbery one

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:27.930
was like some Criss Angel stuff I'm not

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:34.560
saying it's necessarily impossible but I

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:36.390
I am a disbeliever that could be wrong

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.710
but I think you know it's like he's

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:39.630
telling people to watch out for these

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:41.640
tricks I think it's well within his

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:42.690
rights to also sneak in a trick like

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.640
that or something to see if you're

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:46.170
actually listening and paying attention

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:47.520
or if you're just you know watching the

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:50.220
show because you think he's a real smart

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:52.650
dude you know but it would it would be

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:54.780
the ultimate betrayal like you ever walk

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:57.120
into a lecture or a class oh my god

00:20:54.780 --> 00:21:00.170
really all you have to do is give me one

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:02.700
more plate and then you know your

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:04.890
professor goes like everybody knows that

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:06.390
fact is fact right and everyone looks

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:08.970
around they sort of nod at the other

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:11.940
classmates and they go yeah and then the

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:16.890
teacher goes well everybody's wrong

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:21.180
you're like what is this what higher

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:23.520
education is like no doesn't everybody

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:26.520
have that anecdote of like their teacher

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:28.140
in a grade I don't know what grade for

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:31.320
you but sixth grade for me and did

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:32.730
really happened to me and my sixth grade

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:37.500
teacher was kind of a dick so it's like

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:40.920
the perfect segue here or the perfect

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:43.260
believable story at least he gave us

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:45.660
that classic test where it's like you

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:49.980
know you goes everybody read until the

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:53.610
final questions make sure you read the

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:56.250
entire test before you take it okay and

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:57.930
then of course very few people read the

00:21:56.250 --> 00:22:00.000
entire test before they take it so you

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:02.190
finished the test and then you get to

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.050
the end and the final question is if you

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:05.820
read this first before doing any

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:08.190
questions just put up your hand I'll

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:09.900
come grab your tests and give you a 100%

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.430
you know it's supposed to be like we

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:17.280
should always read the instructions I

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:20.010
hate that lesson let's do it like this I

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:21.900
have a university degree I did extremely

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:27.090
well in high school that's so well in

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:31.500
college but you know distractions yeah

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:33.690
we'll take the mom's legs here and I'm

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:36.570
working on other credentials here in an

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:40.200
unrelated field going well is going just

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:42.360
fine I've never read the entire test or

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:44.250
exam before I take it like if that

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:46.230
lesson was supposed to have any kind of

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:48.000
enduring legacy except for my teacher

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:51.930
cannot be trusted anymore I don't know

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.030
what it is it has only been relevant in

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:56.430
that one circumstance to read the entire

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:59.100
test before you write is that you're

00:22:56.430 --> 00:23:00.900
never by the way and this is the story I

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:03.030
do not have a real anecdote for but

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:06.930
everybody is always like oh yeah in my

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:08.970
philosophy 101 class and university the

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:11.550
final exam was just one question and it

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:13.230
said why did that happen to you like

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:17.340
congratulations on living in like a

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:17.790
movie but I'm skeptical is all I'm

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.100
saying

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:22.590
I never had to happen you know every

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.790
every exam or test I ever act at that

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:27.690
point was like remember called

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:30.810
Bernoulli's principle and how do the

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:33.510
nephrons feed uric acid into the kidneys

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:35.070
it for filtration you know like didn't

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:39.330
get a biology exam it was just like

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:42.710
young describe how circulation works in

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:45.299
as great or vague detail as you'd like

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:46.710
certainly never had an exam where I got

00:23:45.299 --> 00:23:49.769
to the final page and then it said

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:51.869
congratulations we're going to give you

00:23:49.769 --> 00:23:53.580
a 100% on this test despite you not

00:23:51.869 --> 00:23:55.139
knowing everything simply because you

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:58.889
read through the entire thing

00:23:55.139 --> 00:23:59.999
you know to begin with now writing your

00:23:58.889 --> 00:24:02.610
name on the test

00:23:59.999 --> 00:24:04.080
that's like of course if you're not

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:06.269
doing that you gotta you got to build

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:09.149
that habit because you are going to get

00:24:06.269 --> 00:24:11.879
zeroes for that but obviously it's not

00:24:09.149 --> 00:24:13.590
necessarily a useless skill but what

00:24:11.879 --> 00:24:16.049
information are you hoping to glean by

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:17.970
reading the entire exam mule is before

00:24:16.049 --> 00:24:19.799
you take any part of it the only reason

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:21.269
I ever have done that is to see if

00:24:19.799 --> 00:24:23.609
there's a trick question at the end it's

00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:26.730
like the ultimate self propagating

00:24:23.609 --> 00:24:30.409
defense it's like you know a virus that

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:33.960
exists solely to self-replicate

00:24:30.409 --> 00:24:36.359
AKL viruses but I just don't I don't

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:38.129
respect that lesson I would never as a

00:24:36.359 --> 00:24:42.899
teacher give my children that lesson him

00:24:38.129 --> 00:24:44.820
you know like 99% of my teachers around

00:24:42.899 --> 00:24:46.769
the level with me they're just one dude

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:48.359
thought he was being real clever the

00:24:46.769 --> 00:24:51.359
same teacher that gave us a lesson that

00:24:48.359 --> 00:24:54.029
I actually think is very smart he just

00:24:51.359 --> 00:24:55.230
did it at the wrong time he gave us an

00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:58.409
assignment and this is another very

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:59.639
common one that was like all right write

00:24:58.409 --> 00:25:01.379
the instructions for how you put your

00:24:59.639 --> 00:25:02.970
shoes on and you'd be like well you take

00:25:01.379 --> 00:25:04.769
your foot you put it in the shoe and

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:06.659
then you tie it up and he would be like

00:25:04.769 --> 00:25:09.629
okay I'm going to follow your steps

00:25:06.659 --> 00:25:11.309
exactly to the letter I'll be like okay

00:25:09.629 --> 00:25:12.929
I took my shoe I put my foot in and you

00:25:11.309 --> 00:25:14.519
put it on like backwards so you put it

00:25:12.929 --> 00:25:15.749
on the wrong foot at least any be like

00:25:14.519 --> 00:25:17.759
no no you have to put it on the right

00:25:15.749 --> 00:25:21.440
foot and slowly you would like debug

00:25:17.759 --> 00:25:24.059
what is essentially an algorithm for us

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:26.549
for putting your shoes on and then tying

00:25:24.059 --> 00:25:28.409
them up I always wanted like as a kid I

00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:30.029
thought that lesson was genius and as I

00:25:28.409 --> 00:25:31.879
got older when he came up with the

00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:35.519
algorithm I always wanted to be like oh

00:25:31.879 --> 00:25:38.009
but what do you mean take the lace with

00:25:35.519 --> 00:25:41.009
my left hand you oh you mean you want me

00:25:38.009 --> 00:25:45.019
to use my muscles by sending a signal

00:25:41.009 --> 00:25:48.690
from my brain to shorten the tendon in

00:25:45.019 --> 00:25:49.919
my you know the metatarsal tendon I

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:51.539
think that's on your foot actually you

00:25:49.919 --> 00:25:53.399
get the idea is like if it's just a

00:25:51.539 --> 00:25:54.360
lesson in being pedantic sign me up

00:25:53.399 --> 00:25:56.970
because I can be put down

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:58.590
antek was the best time buddy but in all

00:25:56.970 --> 00:26:00.900
seriousness that's a stupid lesson I

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:03.990
actually think it's sort of actually

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:05.700
useful but not useful for a class full

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:08.370
of sixth grade kids it's really useful

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:12.030
for like introductions of programming

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:13.830
101 for explaining how stupid computers

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:15.990
are because computers are incredibly

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:18.300
powerful but they'll just do exactly

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:21.200
what you tell them and if you try to at

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:23.460
least in most languages if you try to I

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:25.050
mean even that's an understatement I'm

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:26.880
not going to get into it necessarily but

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:28.800
a lot of compilers are very very smart

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.720
and will correct your errors for you

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.190
like in lining and stuff like that

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:35.190
automatically but anyway I digress

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:37.680
the point is for the most part at least

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:39.090
on an early level computer is going to

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:41.100
do exactly what you tell it so that

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:42.360
could be an illustrative lesson or your

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:44.220
teacher goes like and this is how you

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.900
got to write your program but instead

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:48.810
our sixth-grade teacher just did it and

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:50.940
was like oh I'm smarter than you because

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:52.890
he was an idiot and I made him anyway

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:55.050
hope you're watching this I hope you're

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:58.260
a better person now that's really all it

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:59.820
comes down to is get down here I don't

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:02.040
hate him because it was a disciplinarian

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:04.950
he was just a jerk when you're 12 you

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:06.510
know who would jerk is right you might

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:09.540
also think you might get some false

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:11.970
positives from time to time but looking

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:19.230
back if it was just good I'm sure

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:22.230
anyway let us go wow we somehow did not

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:25.740
get hit there we won't have the chest on

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:26.820
lock either way so really the world's

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:28.980
our oyster where we choose where to

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:30.330
finish this run I'll just be straight up

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:33.900
with you I don't really want to do the

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:35.670
hush fight with a damage this run is a

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.810
little bit better suit I mean five rate

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:38.250
of fire is good and the shots are

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:42.440
piercing but that doesn't matter for the

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:42.440
hush fight so doesn't matter much Aziz

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:49.840
we were more well suited to a Cathedral

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:52.690
run it's a good item we're more well

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:54.940
suited to a Cathedral run but that could

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:58.229
change you know we're on the room too

00:27:54.940 --> 00:28:01.690
it's probably not going to change uh

00:27:58.229 --> 00:28:03.100
we'll think about it we do have 73 cents

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:04.570
that could change the game a little bit

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.909
and knocking out the hush fight means we

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:09.399
don't have to do the hush fight which is

00:28:06.909 --> 00:28:10.419
nice for me now it means that we've

00:28:09.399 --> 00:28:12.309
knocked something off the to-do list

00:28:10.419 --> 00:28:14.409
that might have been somewhat difficult

00:28:12.309 --> 00:28:15.909
but we got it taken care of so yeah

00:28:14.409 --> 00:28:17.729
maybe we'll give it a shot I've kind of

00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:19.659
talked myself into it

00:28:17.729 --> 00:28:22.720
I'm trying to think of this any other

00:28:19.659 --> 00:28:24.609
like boilerplate lessons that always

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.529
happen in school or at least schools and

00:28:24.609 --> 00:28:28.799
TV shows and movies but I can't take of

00:28:26.529 --> 00:28:28.799
them right now

00:28:29.519 --> 00:28:33.849
you know what's like the most thankless

00:28:31.599 --> 00:28:35.229
job in the world and there's probably

00:28:33.849 --> 00:28:36.340
people out there watching this video

00:28:35.229 --> 00:28:37.359
that are doing this so I want you to

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:40.840
know that I mean this from a place of

00:28:37.359 --> 00:28:42.639
sincerity it's already pretty thankless

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.830
to be like a high school teacher to some

00:28:42.639 --> 00:28:47.940
extent I imagine there's a lot of you

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:51.159
know value you can derive from the job

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:52.629
seeing seeing good students you know

00:28:51.159 --> 00:28:54.669
excel and exceed and enter the next

00:28:52.629 --> 00:28:58.119
stage of their life etc etc but you know

00:28:54.669 --> 00:28:59.979
there's also like still like a quarter

00:28:58.119 --> 00:29:01.269
your job at daycare that sucks

00:28:59.979 --> 00:29:04.179
but what I was going to say is

00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:07.749
substitute teaching it's actually like

00:29:04.179 --> 00:29:08.950
so much worse because it's almost like

00:29:07.749 --> 00:29:11.080
you know when you're a high school

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:14.999
teacher you're like a prison guard and

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:18.099
you've built up like a a certain

00:29:14.999 --> 00:29:19.149
familiarity with the inmates and if

00:29:18.099 --> 00:29:19.899
you're in high school right now you're

00:29:19.149 --> 00:29:21.549
going to be like well that's very

00:29:19.899 --> 00:29:23.289
offensive to consider as inmates I like

00:29:21.549 --> 00:29:25.119
to consider us collaborators when it

00:29:23.289 --> 00:29:27.039
comes to you know pursuing an

00:29:25.119 --> 00:29:30.789
educational goal yeah that's fine you

00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:31.960
know you sound like a good egg you know

00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:33.729
what you don't understand is that after

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.929
they teach your class AP Computer

00:29:33.729 --> 00:29:36.249
Science for people that are going to

00:29:34.929 --> 00:29:37.629
make 10 times more money than the

00:29:36.249 --> 00:29:41.109
teacher every year for the rest of their

00:29:37.629 --> 00:29:45.129
life they go and they teach you know

00:29:41.109 --> 00:29:47.710
knife sharpening skills to criminals you

00:29:45.129 --> 00:29:50.440
know we're not that's not really a good

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:52.359
way to look at it but you know they they

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:54.460
can teach them unruly classes what I'm

00:29:52.359 --> 00:29:56.919
trying to say I'm sure that's got its

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.560
own pluses and minuses but you know it's

00:29:56.919 --> 00:29:59.990
substitute

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:02.780
teacher doesn't have that built up level

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:04.520
of familiarity and they don't get that

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:06.500
assumed level of respect that they've

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:09.580
earned from the students instead there's

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:11.720
like a you know there's a theme of

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:13.930
messing with substitute teachers that

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:16.970
even as a child you're gonna think I'm

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:20.210
being a holier-than-thou even as a kid I

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:22.160
did not get it you know there was one a

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:24.740
substitute teacher that very frequently

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:27.470
came to our school district and I'm just

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:27.920
going to be honest she was not very good

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:34.670
at her job

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:36.320
and that's like not really okay but that

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:37.850
doesn't mean that people should have

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.380
treated the way they did like we had a

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:41.990
class that was on the first floor of the

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:43.940
high school and then like we would call

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:46.430
them I say we I'm being sincere I was

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:49.370
kind of like a I was a goody two-shoes

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:50.810
so I didn't do this but there were

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:52.070
people in the class they'd sit there for

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:53.660
attendance so they were counted as

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:55.070
having you know been present in the

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:57.110
class and then they would just open the

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:58.550
window and just walk out of the

00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:59.870
classroom when the teachers back was

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:03.080
crying so when she turned back around

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:04.400
they wouldn't be there but then she

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:07.850
doesn't remember their names

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:10.310
and nobody knocked on so you know that

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:12.500
she just sort of was like okay keep

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:13.850
teaching that's a blow to your ego right

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.110
you know they're getting away with

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:16.460
something they wouldn't otherwise be

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:18.860
able to get away with what she's

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:20.750
supposed to do you know disrupt the

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:22.310
whole class put herself on blast one of

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:24.230
my students escaped from the classroom

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:25.160
principal can you come here I don't know

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:29.810
maybe that would have been a better

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:31.820
option but substitute teaching is a

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:33.580
tough job I got mad respect for those of

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:35.630
you out there doing that grind

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:38.840
especially cuz that's like a tryout for

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:43.270
for real teaching right but teaching is

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:43.270
like the noble goal

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:49.820
did people always get on there well not

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:51.140
always a lot of people really respect

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:52.580
teaching at the job but a lot of people

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.560
are like well I wish I had a job that

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:56.090
gave me the whole summer off you ever

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.740
hear a youtuber a twitch streamers say

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:58.070
that just punch them raise where it

00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:59.030
hurts

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:00.380
that's right the twitch prime

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:02.570
subscriptions which you can use right

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:05.450
now and switch out BD / online in case

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:07.550
you haven't already that's that's

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:10.370
tone-deaf dude come on you're making the

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:14.200
rest of us look bad it's a combination

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:17.140
like taxpayer-funded daycare and free

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:19.190
intelligence boost

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:21.140
these people are you know they're

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:24.740
spending like more time with your kids

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:26.990
than you are getting paid peanuts and

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:28.940
then everyone goes all you know you get

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:34.040
so much vacation time and also you know

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:36.490
your unions too powerful not okay have

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:38.930
some compassion

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:41.660
the majority of adults work primarily

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:43.970
with adults ask them how they feel about

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:46.490
their co-workers all jennifer is so

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:48.680
stupid it's like has she ever use

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:52.280
Microsoft Excel before now take Jennifer

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:55.310
and then imagine that she's 15 so she's

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:56.740
stupid and you know I don't want to say

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:59.750
Jennifer scooped I've never met her

00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:01.280
she's an object made up for the purpose

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:03.890
so you don't mean that she's an object

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:07.750
that just we met with she is a tool used

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:11.930
for a purpose in this analogy anyway

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:14.110
we're going to totally win here take any

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:16.580
of your co-workers and have their age

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:18.230
unless they're a hundred it's not going

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:20.060
to make them any easier to deal with and

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:22.460
even then I think you've got to give

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:24.080
respect to the hundred year old man he's

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:28.670
out there doing some some stuff that

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:30.410
ain't never been seen before if I went

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:32.630
to Dairy Queen and there was a 100 year

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:34.240
old man making my Blizzard take as long

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:39.230
as you want

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:42.490
you're a credit to human biology I mean

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:42.490
that with the utmost sincerity

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:47.549
anyway I'm just marketing to my large

00:33:45.779 --> 00:33:50.279
teacher demographic

00:33:47.549 --> 00:33:52.799
I appreciate what you do which is why I

00:33:50.279 --> 00:33:55.760
haven't had kids yet done I want to make

00:33:52.799 --> 00:33:55.760
your life any harder

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:04.880
you the other one that bugs me is like

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:08.179
this well we pay their salary everybody

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:10.310

and police well I love you pay your

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:17.629

everybody plays everybody's salary where

00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:22.399
you buy like a can of coke once a year

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:22.940
we go into the CEO of coca-cola pay your

00:34:22.399 --> 00:34:24.950
salary

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:26.960
everybody is supported oh we can

00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:27.560
actually go to the cathedral now let's

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:31.850
do it

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:33.080
one day will do boy it again the thing

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:34.730
I've had people tweet me in their like

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.810
oh you know I I don't I wouldn't feel

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:38.240
comfortable working in a job that's

00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:39.860
taxpayer funded everything is funded by

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:43.280
the taxpayer it's just whether or not

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:44.360
you're being funded by tax money's got

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.070
to come from somewhere

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:48.530
what are you working a magical money

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:51.200
factory that nobody nobody pays you and

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:55.879
then somehow you get paid I'd be

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:58.100
surprised I mean like if you're ever a

00:34:55.879 --> 00:34:59.780
customer of anything if you pull out

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:01.940
that you know I pay your salary line

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:03.830
just hit him where it hurts that's right

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:07.220
to twitch Prime subscription it's not

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:10.580
the way the business works that's like

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:12.860
the business the way that economics in

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:15.020
our society is supposed to work you get

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:17.360
bad product to bad service or bad price

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:18.800
you can get better stuff elsewhere you

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:21.050
just don't go there anymore and then

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:23.570
their business suffers proportionally as

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:25.640
a result it's like you know what you're

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:27.260
doing is if you ever say like I pay your

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:29.210
salary I demand to be treated well is

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:31.610
you're going into the bank with a gun

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:33.950
and go and give me your money you're

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:36.050
upsetting the dynamics that we've fought

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:41.810
and agreed upon for your own personal

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:44.840
benefit I don't respect that the

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:47.120
somewhat ironically the only people that

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:50.540
think that are subject to that in a

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:54.320
valid way are like youtubers and twitch

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:57.350
streams if the problem is that I pay

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:58.760
your salary is like automatically as

00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:00.350
soon as you say that you're in the wrong

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:02.180
it's like pulling it don't you know who

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:03.620
I am sort of thing at the airport it's

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:05.450
never going to work out even if they

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:06.470
should know who you are and they're

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:08.390
treating you badly

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:09.240
like if they handed you your suitcase

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:11.010
and it clearly

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:13.320
then shot like it was riddled with

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:14.820
bullet holes and you were like don't you

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:17.750
know who I am people would be like I

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:20.160
gotta side with the airline on this one

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:23.750
George Clooney seems like he's being a

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:28.710

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:34.560
extent dictated by fan input if anyone

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:38.970

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:43.860
like I don't know I'm asking for a range

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:45.330
but it's still something worth

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:46.500
considering are we going into Chester we

00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:47.760
