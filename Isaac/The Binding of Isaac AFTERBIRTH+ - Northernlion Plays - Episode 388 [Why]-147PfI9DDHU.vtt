##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.920
everybody welcome back normal and plays

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.870
of binding of issac and plus we're doing

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.210
good stuff here we unlock Lilith on the

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.960
last run so we got like the easiest

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.540
money of all time here to just be Lilith

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:21.210
and do hard mode and accomplish like

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.920
literally anything z80 Palin Palin Palin

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.949
could be out it could be Sarah could be

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.970
Michael could be could be the final room

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.710
that we're going to do over the course

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.140
of this video is Lilith because we may

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.430
actually just we didn't die but we found

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.280
ourselves in a real tight spot there

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.379
okay I'm in a good mood today I know

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.000
always in a good mood when I get to play

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:48.690
Isaac I might leave didn't accuse me

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.750
when I get to play Isaac we had a great

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.730
as a zl-- run last time that essentially

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.390
is like the perfect world situation that

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.149
you want to have is a zl-- Lilith is

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.590
always a total crapshoot though you know

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.420
the best part about finishing

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.070
I mean first officeholders in your cup

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.520
but the best part about finishing that a

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.720
oh my god Azazel run on greeted that we

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.610
don't have to do in his nasal run on

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.240
green again we got to restart here which

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.950
is awesome

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.540
we didn't get a restart we got a cure

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.700
upon which is close to a restart enemy I

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.820
love is asel I really do like playing as

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:31.049
asel but having to not do easy mode

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:32.759
greedier aka greed mode as as Azazel is

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.380
ideal as the easiest character to make

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.180
it pop to the most part just by messing

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.920
it up once alright that's enough money

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.390
to make an arcade work and we would

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.119
really like to get a blood bag just to

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.740
amp up our speed in HP but really what's

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.320
the key is Lilith I'm going to be honest

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:54.000
with you I just don't remember certainly

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.329
getting like a high-value familiars like

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.420
another Incubus or a succubus would be

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.799
fine HP and damage tears you know these

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.799
are stats that are always appropriate

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:18.700
beyond this all we can really do is

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:21.130
focus on improve not taking damage

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.430
Deadeye den eye strikes me is like the

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.800
best worst item as lilith how in the

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.350
world am i going to maintain a

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.880
consistent ability to deal damage with

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.930
Incubus when it's flying around us you

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.840
know the speed of sound and by the speed

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.790
of sound I mean one verily it's a one

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.500
time something where something is the

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.730
speed of sound that's right I mean you

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.220
don't know how big these rooms could be

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.440
it could be 700 miles from one end to

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.510
the other and we could just be

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.720
extraordinarily large ourselves oh also

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.720
Dead Eye is actually just horrible as

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.480
Lilith because it doesn't work at all

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:03.610
that's busted stuff like a Dave Matthews

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.530
Band album please don't be bad are you a

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.950
wizard you know what let's take the good

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.110
with the bad

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.550
are you a wizard didn't impact us as

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.380
much as it would in a normal situation

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.610
because of the fact of our Lilith are we

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.290
even oh not even close

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.790
no but we are not in a in as bad of a

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.260
spot as we would be although we'd be

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.610
burning off most of our time here anyway

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.209
so I think we can play this three times

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.290
two three and we really need to leverage

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.209
everything that we can at this point

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:33.610
thirty cents is awesome so we got a good

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:38.260
chance to go to our we've got a good

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:40.330
chance to go to our shop and actually

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.620
get something useful okay that was the

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.510
worst we've handled that room in a long

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.519
time dude we got another item that just

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.130
does not work as Lillith all right I'm

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.570
starting to remember why she wasn't my

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.299
favorite character to begin with what

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:56.980
we're looking for now is like a d4 or is

00:03:52.299 --> 00:04:01.930
b100 so we could get to you know the

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.400
point where we're actually doing some

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.630
damage here with those items taking

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.959
advantage sorry I keep getting

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.580
sidetracked like mentally speaking here

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.750
so we can take advantage of the the

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.519
items that we've already gotten you know

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.049
we've got tickets in the lottery we can

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.280
get a full run reroll we could use them

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.560
although if you lose Incubus we could

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.180
also just not have any means with which

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.949
to shoot

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.570
so ever but maybe I've halitosis which

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:24.750
is substantially worse than Incubus

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.190
either way I guess you just got to

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.160
accept that these first couple of floors

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.330
not really that useful for us and work

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.850
from there and hopefully accomplish

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.970
something in the interim period throw a

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.530
bomb down here get a key it's extremely

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.320
valuable I did use our other key going

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.860
the item room which in hindsight not a

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.860
great idea

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.900
bit of a tough call to be honest with

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.250
you steam sales lovely and if we can get

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.320
a lot of money in the futures and that's

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:58.139
even better but for now this doesn't

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:59.699
particularly bode well for us we're

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.259
looking for I guess a deal with the

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:05.449
devil that's transformative I mean I'm

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:07.979
selfish here I'd love an easy Lilith run

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:09.780
because I fucked with Lilith to begin

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.449
with probably actually my worst

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.940
character not least favorite I don't

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:16.169
know I used to I've had answers that

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.669
have flip-flopped back and forth there

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.930
was a while where Cain was my least

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.370
favorite character which should tell you

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.229
everything you need to know about me

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.590
you know listing my favorite character

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:27.060
ie it doesn't mean altogether that much

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.530
we can get that bomb for free and there

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.990
is a hinted rock back there we're

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.440
desperate dude we could use small rock

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.880
without a doubt but even other spirit

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.460
hogs will be fine even a golden chest

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:44.389
could be good but we need a little bit

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:47.600
more just keep yourself rolling

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:53.100
backwards here

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:55.740
and this grant this and let's go all

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.180
right it's a difficult boss at some

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.110
point as lilith you have to play the

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:04.140
gamble of are we going to fight Krampus

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.020
because I'd like to have box of friends

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:09.450
available for Krampus but you know what

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.160
maybe this is important for us sometimes

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.990
you don't know the inner strength that

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.210
lies within you until you're forced to

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.680
actually use it this is not meant to be

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.720
like one of those moments in like an

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.700
anime where you know people pick on a

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.380
nerd and then he beats like 40 dudes in

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.780
a street fight using only a cardboard

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:28.650
tube or something like that more though

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:30.630
I think that you know we as human beings

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.670
this is where I get a little bit over

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.160
the preaching maybe you know we have an

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.070
evolutionary desire to make our lives as

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.330
comfortable as possible you know we

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.670
structure our lives to avoid discomfort

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:46.380
in a lot of situations but sometimes

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:47.970
challenges can be uncomfortable but by

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:53.700
doing them we can raise our comfort zone

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:58.260
terminator now this is a big I'm kind of

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:59.670
got to take both I think but it's kind

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.650
of you know big words to use about

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:05.820
playing a video game but I stand by that

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:08.670
you know in every I'm gonna say every

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.680
successful person I know it shares this

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.990
belief that's kind of like unfair

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.580
shorthand first up I don't know if I

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.350
know many people that are truly

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:20.310
successful and I'm talking about like

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:23.550
you know CEO level success it's sure

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:25.860
I've run a successful issue Tube channel

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:27.180
and twitch channel I work hard but I

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.610
don't really think about it too much

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.900
beyond that but you know most successful

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.460
people I know they constantly keep

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:36.090
themselves challenged to some degree

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:39.300
they're constantly seeking out you know

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:41.460
extra extra things that temporarily make

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.810
their lives harder but they do so in a

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.490
productive fashion you know of course

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:46.260
nobody's going to be like I wish I did

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.070
my taxes every day you know that's just

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.440
a little

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:51.360
that's needlessly reductive that's a

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.200
logical extreme but I just there's this

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:57.360
weird period in like young adult life oh

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.800
you need infestation to maybe it'll

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.200
happen when you're outside of college

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:04.550
maybe it'll happen when you're outside

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:07.760
a high school but you kind of just are

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:09.980
done you're like I've finished the plan

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:13.640
that I had for myself what the heck do I

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:17.930
do now and you know for a while that the

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:22.040
answer was dota 2 profile it was like

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:24.920
yeah you know I mean I wake up I do my

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:26.570
job and then I I can do whatever I want

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.240
with the rest of my time it is nice and

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:31.580
I'm being honest it's like a good way to

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:36.740
avoid burnout fulfilling potentially on

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:39.500
a recreational standpoint after a while

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:41.150
I kind of good not to say that I'm like

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.320
a model citizen necessarily but I kind

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:45.080
of got a little tired of it you know

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.250
like I need to like do something else I

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.500
played counter-strike and you play

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:51.470
counter-strike competitively you're like

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:53.270
simulating real progress you know you're

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:54.500
like I like this game I don't know if

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.850
everybody's like this I think I have

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:59.000
kind of a I have a competitive

00:08:55.850 --> 00:09:01.040
personality to some degree but when I

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.840
first start playing a game it's like hey

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.250
this game is fun buy a hundred hours

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.470
into that game I'm like I'm not playing

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:09.290
this game for fun anymore that's that's

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:12.370
bush league that's silver I'm playing

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:14.480
this game to simulate you know

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:16.580
destroying other people and taking their

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.070
resources as my like animal brain

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.900
desires or something like that I'm not

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.890
saying it's a good habit I'm just saying

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.630
you know maybe it's because there's

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.890
productive influences for that and we're

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.960
not living back in the caveman days

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:28.610
where inevitably I would get into a

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.870
fight with someone and try to bash them

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.370
over a head with the rock and then have

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:32.470
my arm twisted behind my back cuz I'm a

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:36.560
nerd

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:38.360
but either way you know I think there's

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.860
more productive ways to manifest that

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.410
challenge in your in your life I think

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.910
that's why I think there's like a few

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.200
reasons why people get really into

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:47.230
working out when they get into working

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.370
out one of them is like you know

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:51.530
progress is addictive and the other one

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.760
is it's a productive way to stimulate

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:55.280
challenge in your life and keep you on

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.810
the upswing instead of running the risk

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.400
of languishing a little bit which is a

00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:01.760
fancy word meaning kind of staying in

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.140
the same place I don't know it's it's a

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.940
balance you know there's there's also

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:07.760
nothing more insufferable than somebody

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:09.830
who's like I spend literally all of my

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.090
time doing productive things and if you

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.140
don't do productive things with

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:16.210
literally 100%

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:16.210
your time like you're really messing up

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:22.040
that's insufferable as well because we

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:23.840
leave no time for yourself you know

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.430
you're not a person that people want to

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.990
be around for the most part like what do

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.790
you it's kind of the thing I was like

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:30.440
what do you what are you doing so many

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:33.890
sit-ups for if you ain't ever going to

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:35.120
go to the beach I get it you know health

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:38.240
reasons that's why it's not really a

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.410
good metaphor but you've got oh you got

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:43.580
to enjoy the fruits of your labor at

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:45.350
some point as well right but I do also

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.910
things you know there's dangers on both

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:49.880
sides people who get like too addicted

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:51.710
to progress anyway mostly I just play

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.450
The Binding of Isaac and and I hope to

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:55.430
be funny I don't really try to be funny

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:58.700
because I don't understand how to do

00:10:55.430 --> 00:11:00.770
that sort of I just I turn on the

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.710
recording session and then I go um and

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:04.490
then I find a tangent and I just sort of

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:08.020
homed in on it

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:08.020
honing on it and hope for the best

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:14.990
anyway life's going well here and by

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.990
well I mean actually we're constantly in

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:19.820
danger of dying not another real life I

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:24.920
think you know in real life I think

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:26.690
we're doing relatively okay having

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.780
played shellshock live lately so my

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:31.520
blood pressure's in a pretty good place

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:35.780
I'm saying that as someone who has no

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:37.910
blood pressure monitor which sounds like

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:39.980
a great job you know you in case you're

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:43.280
sick of being a hall monitor why not be

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:47.450
a blood pressure monitor it's easy you

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:49.100
know you work ten minutes a day could

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:51.560
save you 15% or less on your auto

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:54.070
insurance fifty percent or more fifteen

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.070
percent or more

00:11:55.380 --> 00:12:01.240
this is actually a nightmare this

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:03.730
happens to us and Isaac runs from time

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:06.460
to time this is one of them we just have

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:08.890
nothing you know we're doing almost no

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.690
damage our best course of action is

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:14.710
definitely going to be to use bombs here

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:16.930
please don't disappear on me oh no like

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:19.420
we have the infestation too but if you

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:21.880
get if a spider kills the enemy you

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:24.220
don't get a spider out of the enemy this

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:26.380
is a nightmare run I do I'm going to

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.900
turn you know the gaze of reflection

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:31.390
outwards for once okay I actually think

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:33.700
that it's kind of BS that halitosis

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:36.180
doesn't work for us I think it's kind of

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:39.280
BS that Deadshot doesn't work for us

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:41.830
obviously Lilith has been like Gia's

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:43.570
custom functionality so that you know

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:46.600
when she gets to tears upgraded effects

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:48.820
Incubus sir you know when she basically

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.640
she doesn't fire Incubus inherits her

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:53.800
stats instead for that not to work with

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.940
Deadshot and you know how a toast is

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.650
giving you the chance to have kind of

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.060
like a pseudo orbital or at least you

00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:00.370
know like an aura around you that can

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:04.240
help you out kind of a bummer really

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:08.950
limits like the successful builds that

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:10.720
you can get with her obviously like this

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:14.650
is not a 10 out of 10 run right now

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:16.720
there's the time to make it not a 10 out

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:17.980
of 10 run or to make it a 10 out of 10

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.810
run or at least like a six and a half

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:23.350
some that we could conceivably win with

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:25.990
but we need DPS yeah okay

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:28.440
desserts pretty good here as fuel if

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.440
nothing else

00:13:29.999 --> 00:13:41.920
Wow meanwhile Krampus over here can

00:13:38.319 --> 00:13:44.740
freakin hit you without you having any

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:47.519
conceivable means to dodge it this will

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:49.689
be such a good time to have a bomb I

00:13:47.519 --> 00:13:52.300
know I need to get over there and hit

00:13:49.689 --> 00:13:55.329
him but the closer we stand to him the

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:56.800
harder it is for us to predict the the

00:13:55.329 --> 00:13:58.540
shot that comes out the harder it is to

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.860
dodge it as a result we can't take

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:01.420
Krampus as head so we're just headed

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.160
down to the next floor and this is a

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.749
straight-up nightmare fuel this is a

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:17.980
situation you do not want to be in

00:14:04.749 --> 00:14:19.420
whatsoever but I got high hopes oh that

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.769
was very close we don't need to preserve

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:24.490
at the old example all I got to do is

00:14:20.769 --> 00:14:26.800
preserve our own HP Lilith just fart off

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:27.939
okay we actually we have such good

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:34.420
potential on this run cuz we have

00:14:27.939 --> 00:14:36.850
infestation - an infestation - buys us I

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:39.309
wouldn't say a lot of time on zero HP

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:41.139
but ever is it's a force multiplier

00:14:39.309 --> 00:14:43.240
which is the term that I just learned

00:14:41.139 --> 00:14:44.980
recently and I don't really like it

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.269
because people always use it under the

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:48.399
guise of self-improvement

00:14:46.269 --> 00:14:49.839
the way I saw it used was you know

00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:51.699
learning programming is a force

00:14:49.839 --> 00:14:53.500
multiplier for everything else in your

00:14:51.699 --> 00:14:54.850
life and I was like okay if you want to

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.920
talk about it like it's some kind of

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:58.569
supply chain management term by all

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.250
means if that's helpful for you

00:14:58.569 --> 00:15:01.839
conceptualising but I find it a little

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:06.540
bit of a strange - anyway the point is

00:15:01.839 --> 00:15:06.540
it doesn't matter however

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:15.529
keep ourselves moving here it's a force

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:20.080
multiplier though because literally

00:15:15.529 --> 00:15:20.080
every upgrade that we get makes a

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:24.950
infestation - better sometimes only in a

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:28.940
weird like abstract and sort of way like

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:32.000
a rate of fire increase only makes only

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:35.240
makes it better because we can kill

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:40.400
enemy faster and get two more spiders

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:43.010
more quickly I sort of hate this we can

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:46.880
do this just make sure he goes down here

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:49.610
nicely done but a damage upgrade

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.960
extremely valuable hivemind extremely

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:53.570
valuable that's kind of more specific

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:57.710
and there it is lucky us I will

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:59.240
definitely pay two cents to pick up to

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:01.100
pick up by the spirit art that seems

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:05.180
layer a red heart at this point it seems

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:07.400
like a smart play so one hit will kill

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:09.920
us here what one hit from the champions

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:12.880
that is we can't afford you can't really

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:19.190
it's hard to prioritize it at the moment

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:21.020
we could take a hit from the the stat

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:22.760
not the statues but the you know the

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.140
turrets up at the top it's hard because

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.690
all these enemies you know they're like

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:36.410
the same thing okay we did take a hit

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:38.000
and we might be about the parish you can

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:40.339
just get one do I mean if you can just

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.970
get one might be better to prioritize

00:16:40.339 --> 00:16:46.360
the green one because when he dies he'll

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.360
explode

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:52.350
which is also scary for us because we're

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:57.660
fighting him in like this constrained

00:16:52.350 --> 00:17:05.819
arena it didn't kill him but we did kill

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:07.970
one justkeep spider spider beerus he's

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:09.990
done it

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:11.040
so I should tell you just about

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:12.569
everything you need to know about our

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.520
chances here I'm assuming tractor beam

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:16.110
is going to work and do that was really

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:18.240
good for like all of our stats oh my god

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:24.780
is this where things start to pop is

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:26.970
this where it all comes together we that

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.230
basically is every run should have one

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.580
room like that where you think you're

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:31.350
going to die but instead you end up

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:34.970
coming through with like in the clutch

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:34.970
and having a great experience

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:47.920
you know that's what I mean you gotta

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:49.330
sometimes you got to challenge yourself

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:52.240
to prove that you got the capabilities

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:53.560
but making it happen so we as of right

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.090
now I wouldn't say we've drastically

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.290
improved our chances of succeeding but

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:57.940
we're getting there

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:59.500
both of these are so valuable but I

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:01.420
think we got to invest in actually

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:04.270
making ourselves a little bit better so

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:05.890
I took coz sin robes there and also has

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:08.530
the added benefit of giving us extra HP

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:09.460
I'll admit I've got a buyer's remorse

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.990
like immediately

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:14.530
but buyer's remorse I don't always think

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:16.240
is uh is apt you know sometimes you just

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.860
get buyer's remorse because you spend

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:24.820
money or you spend you know an

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:26.350
opportunity hivemind spiders are going

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:28.090
to pull this out for us I'm not claiming

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:30.580
we got a guaranteed win on our stick

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:32.020
right now in true hockey terms but I'm

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.890
telling you that these these hivemind

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:35.890
spiders

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:39.700
I know limit hotland we try again I know

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:44.290
when those hive mind things they make

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:53.370
northernlion see now we're in actually

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:53.370
like good spot right now the downside is

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:58.360
despite being in a good spot things can

00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:00.430
still pave it pretty quickly and our

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.140
stats are not becoming of a run that's

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:04.450
on the Deaf's one I mean our time on

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:05.920
this run should tell you that but we're

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:08.980
a long way away from what I would

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:11.080
consider to be like a great situation we

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:13.140
need probably close to double this

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:15.130
damage and a much better rate of fire

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:17.020
anything that awed ments the amount of

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:20.740
times we can use or the frequency of use

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:23.970
of box of friends would also be a 10 out

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.970
of 10 suggestion here

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:33.430
great good good choice but I would also

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:35.770
settle for you know like anything that

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:36.820
actually works for Lilith instead of our

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.560
first two item rooms which were

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:40.060
completely dead this is where we put our

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.530
money where our mouth is NL you're

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:43.630
always talking about how good number two

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:46.120
is this is the perfect situation for

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:47.320
number two to save us we will probably

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:49.420
end up hurting ourselves with this from

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:51.340
time to time but it's also a 10 out of

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:53.710
10 get-out-of-jail-free card that you

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:58.870
know the likes of which we can't we

00:19:53.710 --> 00:20:00.460
can't ignore dude I still wonder about

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:01.990
Twitter sometimes I leave it open in the

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:04.360
background just because it's usually I

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:06.700
almost always have a Twitter tab open on

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:08.260
my browser not really a glowing

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.180
endorsement of the service more so just

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.500
like hey let's see what people are

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.040
thinking about me at this particular

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:17.680
moment in time

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:19.300
oh it's like a a mental compulsion for

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:22.030
self-destruction

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:25.390
but either way no people on Twitter are

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:27.490
largely relatively nice to me compared

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:29.200
to a lot of other content creators so I

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:30.580
really can't go plan just keep it up out

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.170
of habit basically the same way I know

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:34.240
like you know a lot of people keep like

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:39.130
a facebook tab open all day but it

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:43.480
always plays Bloomberg News at this time

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:48.010
in Bloomberg News is like basically a

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:50.200
news show about Silicon Valley I who do

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:54.340
you think is watching this what

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:57.310
percentage of Twitter users are like you

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:59.920
know investing heavily in the stock

00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:02.950
market in tech stock in tech stocks I'm

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:04.600
assuming a percentage I just don't think

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:06.460
it's high enough to warrant that being

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:11.050
on the screen all the time it's like I

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:13.240
you know I work in a business that is I

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:15.130
mean it in an abstract way it's the

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:17.080
entertainment industry right it's the

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:19.210
entertainment business I have to I have

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:22.330
an account I go see from time to time I

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:24.610
have like a person at the bank I go to

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:26.440
see time to time they'll we show up in

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:30.130
like a hoodie like oh hey I'm here to

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:31.510
see Nathaniel Hawthorne Esquire and they

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.770
go oh really like you have an

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:34.060
appointment and I'm like yeah I know it

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:36.790
might not look like it but I'm like an

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:39.040
adult and knowing I would just take a

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:40.690
seat in the in the lobby sir

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:43.650
we're gonna have security value within

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:46.180
hold make sure you're not you know

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:47.950
telling Elijah this is only half true a

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:51.760
huge growth is pretty good here as well

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:53.050
but let's take High Priestess um and

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.150
they're always playing this stuff that

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:57.160
makes me feel like I'm behind an adult

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:57.670
life man they're always playing like you

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.980
know

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:01.030
although Nasdaq has dropped six points

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:03.190
today what does this mean and I'm like

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:06.220
people know what this means

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:08.110
I don't understand like recently the

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:11.020
interest rates went up in Canada which

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:14.200
as I understand it is tied to mortgages

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:15.940
more or less so everybody and their dogs

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.920
was talking about you know the interest

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:19.090
rate you go to 7-eleven people are

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.830
talking about interest rates you go to

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:24.390
you know Harvard Law people are talking

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:26.590
about interest rates I can't I can't

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:28.390
I've never been to Harvard Law who do

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:31.000
you think I am Reese Witherspoon I was

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:32.770
just like I don't get it so I maintain

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.150
there should be and there might be now

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:35.860
but I maintain there should be like

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:38.350
should have been maybe as a better word

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:41.950
like a greater financial literacy class

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:43.500
when I was in high school took a yeah I

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:47.290
would argue that a financial literacy

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:49.540
class is more important than like you

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:51.040
think I'm gonna say gym but I'm not I

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:53.710
would actually say it's more important

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:55.840
than like you know geometry

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:57.310
I know geometry is important I'm just

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:59.200
I'm trying to illustrate how important I

00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:01.150
think a financial literacy class would

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:04.630
be understanding what you know interest

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:08.170
rates mean for the for the economy and I

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:09.850
don't know some us Americans don't even

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:11.110
have maps so yeah I'm making a joke that

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:12.970
I don't really know what I'm talking

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:21.100
about I'm glad I came here we have two

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:23.200
spirit Hearts number two is I mean first

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.620
of all who does it work for absolutely

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.360
nothing

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:33.610
say it again number two is doing fine

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:35.230
it's just a situation that it needs some

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:37.630
improvement like this would be a great

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:42.280
floor for us to get a deal with the

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:44.260
devil like I've actually forgotten the

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:48.160
name of it what's the one that gives you

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:52.450
a bunch of demon hearts and also a plus

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:54.190
1.5 damage bonus and fear shot I haven't

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:55.570
seen it in like a month of issac episode

00:23:54.190 --> 00:24:01.050
so it's been removed from my mental

00:23:55.570 --> 00:24:04.060
cache apparently justice is fine

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:06.460
got a spirit out of that which is nice I

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:08.680
think we'll go to the we'll go to the

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:11.020
special room here because the curse room

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:12.820
that is because we got to check you know

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:14.230
we need to leverage basically like every

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:20.950
available advantage we can at this point

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:22.000
I don't have a great answer for you

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:23.800
about how we're going to turn this one

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.120
around but if we can get that item that

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:28.990
is on the tip of my tongue but I've

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:31.510
apparently lost it for now then I got

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:32.980
high hopes on the depths to now a

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:34.240
battery is actually a pretty good pick

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:36.250
up as well so hopefully we can save

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:42.940
seven cents and the careful what you

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:44.710
wish for I suppose if we can get that

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.460
and then the polaroid we have some

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:47.260
invincibility

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:49.480
maybe feel a little bit better about our

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:51.250
chances we should have taken little brim

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.810
in in the hindsight that's actually a

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:54.820
decision that could damage because

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:57.370
little brim would kill these enemies so

00:24:54.820 --> 00:25:01.870
quickly that we would easily be able to

00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:03.520
get the spiders out of it and we get the

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:06.190
spiders out of it then like everything

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:08.470
falls into place from that point onwards

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:11.110
but for now admittedly this is like a

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:12.910
little bit of a tight spot and that's

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:15.060
fine you know we've been in tight spots

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:15.060
before

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:29.370
the inability to kill one of those hands

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:30.990
though not a very tanky enemy the

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:32.700
inability to kill one of those hands the

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:36.090
first time it comes down though is like

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:38.790
I'm not going to say unforgivable but if

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:40.410
it illustrates that we're inside here

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:42.000
but again you know how fitting is the

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:43.560
episode in which I tried to sound like

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.600
an authority on self-improvement now I

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:50.130
find myself in a struggle I I mean I

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.960
want the money I don't really care about

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:53.640
the money it's more the opportunity for

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:57.150
those to be luck upgrades I suppose that

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:59.160
I care about but oh come on

00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:00.600
that just burns me up you're going to

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:05.160
give me so many batteries here that we

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:07.770
should probably go for one of these did

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:10.260
thank you buddy is like they have a

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:12.600
great stick handling stat I ate it they

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:15.240
keep the to keep the business around me

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:16.740
at all times okay if I had to predict I

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.450
would say that that bad trip pill is

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:21.270
where we've crossed over from like this

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:22.920
run potentially being a win like more

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:24.660
more likely to be a win in a loss I

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:27.560
think we're now more likely to be a loss

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:30.150
than a win you know CNN is projecting

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:31.980
that this is going to be a loss but

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:33.420
they're still you know what they're not

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:36.600
projecting it yet they're just like this

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:38.070
is how the trend looks right now there's

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:40.530
still plenty of time we have to see some

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:45.180
of those you know districts with higher

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:48.540
electoral votes come through are we made

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:51.540
a mushroom are we made of mushrooms or

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:53.220
something I don't understand who is this

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:59.330
character this man who's made out of

00:26:53.220 --> 00:27:01.050
mushrooms I'm the man with the mush

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:02.700
do-do-do-do-do-do that's Alice in Chains

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:04.650
I think everyone's aware okay

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.940
forever alone does not get doubled in

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:10.110
size I got to check Skype because we're

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:17.030
in like Dockett territory give me a

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:17.030
moment here hey

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:29.350
Dockett ideas hit mom's xx suite um

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:31.179
let's move along here give me a sec give

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:33.309
me a sec give me a second okay I

00:27:31.179 --> 00:27:34.870
apologize for this but inevitably it

00:27:33.309 --> 00:27:37.690
happens I had a lot of time to record

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:38.919
today's a Isaac episode before the NL SS

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:41.620
and then the run turns out to be garbage

00:27:38.919 --> 00:27:43.660
it's not that it's the runs fault and

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:45.850
it's not that I'm like sad I did it but

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:47.370
you know sometimes Isaac runs go a

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:49.809
little longer than expected which is

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:51.190
really in particular a surprise this

00:27:49.809 --> 00:27:52.720
time because of the goat head you would

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:54.640
think that after five deals with the

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:56.799
devil wow this will be our fifth but

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:58.270
after four to five deals with the devil

00:27:56.799 --> 00:28:00.010
we either have killed ourselves

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:02.440
accidentally or be in a position where

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:05.710
we have like an easy win but it's not

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:08.130
the case we've had the goat head like

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:10.059
every single run recently as well

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:11.440
we're not even I guess we're just

00:28:10.059 --> 00:28:12.280
looking for spirit hearts here so like

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:17.500
go for broke

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:20.020
I love these puns the puns just get

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.100
better every time I still think they

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:22.600
should just be able to go up to the

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:24.940
donation machine and be like I'm going

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:26.500
to put in 40 cents and then if it would

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:28.809
have blown up on scent 10 then you lose

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.919
30 cents in the process everybody's

00:28:28.809 --> 00:28:31.840
going to be happy because of the

00:28:29.919 --> 00:28:33.850
convenience factor I think maybe I'm

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.690
maybe I'm misjudging that but that's I

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:39.130
would be happy because of the

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:41.110
convenience factor okay you got to use I

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:42.640
mean I think you use to one month yeah

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:45.610
you probably just use one on mom's heart

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:47.260
because we have we have the attack fly

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:49.030
and the attack fly with two attack lines

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:51.090
actually because of a box of friends but

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:53.770
that should chew mom up pretty nicely

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:56.610
not to mention our friendly spiders that

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:56.610
is not one of mine

00:28:59.729 --> 00:29:07.450
these money Polaroid we've got to try I

00:29:05.289 --> 00:29:09.399
hate to say it but we need the damage at

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:12.789
this point and spirit arts are probably

00:29:09.399 --> 00:29:16.690
less precious than then damage now we

00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:19.709
need to never get hit again so that's a

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:24.789
little bit of a downer

00:29:19.709 --> 00:29:25.929
what my own bomb no no no see this is

00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:27.339
the point where you have to win because

00:29:25.929 --> 00:29:29.320
now there's going to be a conspiracy

00:29:27.339 --> 00:29:31.149
theory that you lost to throw in time

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:32.799
for the NL SS and that's never like

00:29:31.149 --> 00:29:34.269
quite literally never been the case but

00:29:32.799 --> 00:29:36.399
let's do everything in our power to

00:29:34.269 --> 00:29:45.009
dispel that notion those are not spirit

00:29:36.399 --> 00:29:47.889
ours I am an actual hook I pulled my my

00:29:45.009 --> 00:29:49.839
controller down I got so mad this is the

00:29:47.889 --> 00:29:52.169
headphone cord so I just take the true

00:29:49.839 --> 00:29:55.359
learning smash it

00:29:52.169 --> 00:29:57.219
so I'm bad and maybe shouldn't have

00:29:55.359 --> 00:29:59.019
taken fear shop but that run also kind

00:29:57.219 --> 00:29:59.979
