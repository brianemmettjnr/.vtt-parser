00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.730
hey everybody welcome back to the line

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.830
bellezza but anyways again to root Plus

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.200
yesterday's daily was fun we didn't rank

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.460
that well 308 overall 326 nine percent

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.130
with the score of forty six thousand

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.679
zero seven zero and apparently our fatal

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.990
flaw was not using forget-me-now which

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.640
mean that video hasn't gotten up yet but

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.949
I've talked to some victim he's like I

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.359
use forget me now after mega Sade and

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.880
then you can fight mega Satan again and

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.800
I was like I thought that you couldn't

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.930
fight mega Satan the second time and

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.810
thus caused myself a few thousand points

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.750
but that run still served its purpose it

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.130
was important it got my confidence back

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.840
there's no way for you to know this yet

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.219
but I've been playing better I'm over I

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.899
think my temporary insanity thinking of

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.340
the game somehow got ten times harder

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.079
overnight or something like that it will

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:53.120
Kane we're going all the way I'm not

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:57.809
sure as of yet whether we're going to

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.370
the lam one of these days I gotta

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.100
remember it but you got a you know

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.809
please yourself in my own shoes here and

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.309
but you can put yourself in your own

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.810
shoes as well because honestly we're

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.240
probably not the same size I'm not

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.010
bragging but I do have a size of foot

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.280
that is probably one standard deviation

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.530
above the norm I typically wear at 12 to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.970
a size 13 shoe and then people say well

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.619
if you actually wore that you'd know

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.040
your shoe size and I say well you take

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.780
that up with the manufacturers for whom

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.509
I don't underst eight sometimes I'm a

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.000
twelve sometimes I'm a I'm a twelve and

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.540
a half sometimes I'm a thirteen not

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.009
bragging sometimes people always they'd

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.549
when they hear you have a shoe size

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.990
that's like slightly above average and

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.670
that might be more than slightly above

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.750
average but you know Austin's got the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:49.049
same size shoes that's all I'm saying

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.659
people go oh yeah sure what kind of six

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.490
social circles do you run in where

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.979
people are constantly bragging about

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.509
their shoe size you got to stop hanging

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.369
out with those weirdos here's the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.140
benefits of have by the way why do I

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.710
have spectral tears I don't know but I'm

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.840
stoked

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.459
it is Victoria Day in Canada which is

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.129
the day when we celebrate you know our

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.330
land having been conquered and then you

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.790
know

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.010
enormous air quotes civilized but I'm

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.730
here as a result of it so maybe it's not

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.200
all questionable either way I don't

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.360
think this has anything to do with Queen

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.550
Victoria today's daily that is first off

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.410
because Nicholas is an American company

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.760
and the only time American companies

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.440
care about Canada is when they're

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.570
dealing with softwood lumber or they

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.160
want to make a joke about South Park the

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.930
people more clever than themselves made

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.280
in the first place and secondly I'm

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.740
pretty sure Queen Victoria didn't wear

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.650
an eye patch but you know I'm not that

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.450
familiar with my with my United Kingdom

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.830
history so I may be mistaken on that

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:53.640
general front of things yeah it's like

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.550
it this is our Memorial Day but a

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.900
Memorial Day is like my right Memorial

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.110
Day is a day when you honor the veterans

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.650
we have that November 11th in Canada

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.420
it's called Remembrance Day the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.610
anniversary of the Armistice from the

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.010
first world war then you guys also have

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.960
Veterans Day which follows I believe on

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.900
the same day as remembering States so

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.670
it's all you know topsy-turvy is a tough

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.990
call because we could go to the shop and

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.640
buy a spear and our to protect our deal

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.380
with the devil interest but I'm going to

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.209
stick with what we got going on here try

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:29.190
not to take damage and hopefully get a

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.510
blood bank as a result of coming down

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.709
here with more money or at least maybe

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.330
get a chance to buy something from the

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.760
shop as a result of having more money or

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.950
worst case scenario oh my god I almost

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.580
ran right into that at least have saved

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.040
more money so we get 0.7 damage up from

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:48.270
dogtooth and access or at least

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.550
awareness of where our secret rooms are

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.980
so first bomb probably goes to that

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.700
secret room second bomb probably goes to

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:59.220
give a shop access we'll see nor the

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.480
frames here at two-speed already dude

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:08.780
that is madness that gives us a battery

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.780
charge we cannot use but

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.090
and nothing else okay so I was looking

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.470
forward to the butt bang off there they

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:22.410
do in a Minot and yeah anyway

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.290
yesterday's daily I felt like was like

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.450
the beginning of of almost an awakening

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.000
for me in some ways okay I'm gonna close

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.960
Skype is frame rates getting a little

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.660
absurd um close this down people talking

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.920
about injustice too

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.270
nothing wrong with that you know you're

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.910
talking about industry happenings

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:46.080
doesn't doesn't return me at all I'm a

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:49.830
sensible man it wasn't it was the

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.800
one-armed man I did play like I think

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.510
now even though champion belts great for

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.280
three cents let's cash out and give

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.230
ourselves the best chance possible to

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.340
get a deal with the devil here and then

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.400
if we have a deal with the devil that

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.340
cost two hearts or one that is you know

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.360
to one our deals rather or either for

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.330
that matter

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.710
we can use our spirit art as leverage to

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.930
be able to take those without dying

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.910
I played injustice one I can't remember

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.340
if I beat the story mode there was like

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.500
a really cheesy combo and injustice one

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.940
that I mean I was time terrible at

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.700
fighting games in general most of the

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.410
time but and I don't mean when people go

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.300
like oh I'm a scrub you know I'm in the

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.430
DT or something like that I mean there

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.440
is no tier I don't know what my tier is

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.140
I mean an undefined tier I was pretty

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.760
good at persona 4 arena but it's only

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:41.940
because they added this awesome feature

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:45.150
for scrubs gotta pay attention on this

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:48.840
room this is like low key high key off

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.310
key mom's key like one of the hardest

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.130
rooms you can face on this floor the

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.960
spirit art was well worth it

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.700
unfortunately resident fighting the boss

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:01.110
I'm going to go quickly check out our

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:03.150
last room here presumably but yeah they

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.500
added an awesome feature for idiots like

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.940
myself where you can just press the

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.220
light attack button then it would string

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:12.630
together like a suboptimal but still

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:14.580
pretty impressive combo we do have one

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:19.460
luck we probably should not have taken

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.460
it but I figured I'd I'd take my chances

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:26.440
we spend three cents on a on a spear at

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:30.460
Howard so as of right now we would not

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:31.900
have been able to get champion belt we

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.759
need one more penny to be able to get

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:37.389
champion belt so maybe if we shot oops

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:39.070
and fires we can make it happen but yeah

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:40.720
what I was going to say though before

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:43.600
the injustice stuff there's a cheesy

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.620
combination as Aquaman what you did is

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.080
first you to a quarter-circle forward

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.479
then a light punch and then you like

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.660
fish the summon fish's initial though I

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:53.740
like to chicken wait how does it sounds

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.030
like I'm having a stroke I'm just trying

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.449
to recall the lyrics to one week by the

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.490
Barenaked Ladies yeah you got to think

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:01.990
about that

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.550
let's go angel deals I don't want ghost

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.539
baby that badly angel deals are better

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:11.020
now I'm willing to give them a shot

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:14.110
let's go umm I like fish I love I like

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:16.750
this shell a swish a summon fish to the

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.130
dish although I like the shell a Swiss I

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.740
like the sushi because it's never

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:22.750
touched a frying pan yeah that was going

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.090
to be a great barenaked ladies into

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.840
aquaman reference you know or vice versa

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.840
but it's okay

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:31.680
the point is I'm back baby and

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:35.020
yesterday's daily catalysed it in a way

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.460
you know I had an extremely easy time of

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.110
things as everybody who did yesterday's

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.180
daily did and now I feel like I've got a

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:45.490
little bit more confidence underneath me

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:47.110
and I'm not consistently as bad as I

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.759
have been over the past few episodes at

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:51.039
least in the bevy that I recorded

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:53.830
yesterday not to you know spoil things

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:56.470
out of turn but it feels better now it's

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:59.440
nice it's nice to feel like you know

00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:00.789
your life's work has an D materialized

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.919
in front of your eyes like some kind of

00:08:00.789 --> 00:08:07.650
weird getting by a Star Trek gun or

00:08:02.919 --> 00:08:07.650
something like that I don't know oh geez

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:14.440
it also helps to be Cain who has 4.20

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.930
damage from the start might not seem

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:19.930
like a huge upgrade but 4.2 damage

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:22.389
versus 3.5 it starts to matter pretty

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:25.620
quickly and we do have dog tooth for a

00:08:22.389 --> 00:08:25.620
you know a slightly improved

00:08:25.949 --> 00:08:29.849
damage-dealing potential on top of that

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.719
as well kind of you know whiffed on

00:08:29.849 --> 00:08:33.150
deals with the devil

00:08:31.719 --> 00:08:36.650
boss items to some

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:42.120
as well what is this technology zero

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:46.080
okay this seems was this added in the

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:49.740
booster pack holy crap he dodged it so

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:53.660
this seems like really cool almost all

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.660
the technology items are worth something

00:08:54.740 --> 00:09:00.390
it seems like kind of a a muted version

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.340
of Jacob's Ladder but I've really only

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.630
used it for like two rooms here so and

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:06.990
I've used it for two rooms with the

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:09.660
default rate of fire so it's plausible

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.890
that you know if we could ramp up our

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.240
rate of fire it seems like something

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.380
that would scale with a number of tiers

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.150
that we're putting out here because it

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.970
it draws an electrical line between

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:22.260
every tier that we've shot maybe I'll

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:23.790
hear me out with two-speed is that the

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.650
these are the keys to the kingdom right

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.690
here you know what I know exactly what

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:30.090
we need to test this what I was trying

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:32.400
to do is shoot like a big old laser trap

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.660
across the map here and catch every

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.210
enemy in it but in order for that to

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:39.870
work we're going to need piercing tears

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:41.430
if we can get piercing shots my thinking

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.930
is especially if our rate of fires high

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:46.050
enough we know our speed is high enough

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:47.640
cute one shot at the the top bound the

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:49.290
upper bound of a level and shoot a

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:52.040
second shot at as close to the lower

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:55.620
balance you can get before the top shot

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:57.840
is destroyed and see if you can just

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.850
create like a line of electrical traps

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.470
assuming that enemies who are touching

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:02.520
that electricity take a similar amount

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:07.170
of damage that they would have they've

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:11.210
been struck by the tier x repeating of

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:17.360
course and what I mean to say is uh if I

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:24.290
don't like analysis analysis is stupid

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:27.510
did I blow that up or did I did the

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:29.400
vomitorium man blow that up because I

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:31.290
should not have blown it up before using

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:34.740
wheel of fortune to get something out of

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:36.000
it I mean nine volt is good doesn't do

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:38.390
anything for us immediately but it's

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.770
probably worth holding the Sun card

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:46.290
beats the wheel of fortune card and we

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:49.920
have a bomb so we should probably

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:54.690
I use this to find the second secret

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:57.350
room combined with dogtooth which should

00:10:54.690 --> 00:11:01.320
be over here somewhere

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:03.060
as always I'm surprisingly on picky

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:05.519
person I have the reputation for being a

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:08.190
picky eater which is actually hilarious

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:10.860
to me because I was a picky eater as a

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:13.440
kid I was I didn't eating rice I like is

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:15.269
too many of food that's not a

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.810
grammatical misspeak it's just too many

00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:20.970
food I didn't like soup add too watery

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:25.680
you know I'm quite the I'll eat anything

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:27.509
now not a second secret room I must have

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.709
missed it for breakfast this morning I

00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:33.149
had cold leftover

00:11:28.709 --> 00:11:36.509
roti which is like a North Indian done

00:11:33.149 --> 00:11:38.639
leaving flatbread dipped in the curry

00:11:36.509 --> 00:11:40.259
leftover do without being heated up and

00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:42.420
it's probably not that rare but cold

00:11:40.259 --> 00:11:44.190
curry and bread you know that's a good

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:46.290
breakfast for me as far as I'm concerned

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:47.759
you know probably not as far as my

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:53.940
cardiologist is concerned but what is

00:11:47.759 --> 00:11:55.860
that idiot know anyway no the second

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:58.709
secret room I don't want to spend too

00:11:55.860 --> 00:12:01.230
much time looking for it here okay let's

00:11:58.709 --> 00:12:03.029
just go let's just go um but yeah I

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:04.860
think it's because I on the NL SS I'm

00:12:03.029 --> 00:12:06.510
like you put spaghetti on a sandwich and

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:09.300
ate it you're an adult and then people

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:12.089
go oh well this guy's a picky eater no I

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:16.170
just have self-respect

00:12:12.089 --> 00:12:20.069
I suppose um just wait for this to pop

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:23.160
off grab these let's go and throw some

00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:25.230
bombs because if we don't I do worry

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:28.430
about our pace and finishing this fight

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:32.250
say one just for the next floor but you

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:33.569
know sometimes Kate will order in lunch

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:35.370
or she'll go out to get it while I'm

00:12:33.569 --> 00:12:36.750
doing like the NL SS and she's like what

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.519
do you want here's how you know I'm not

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:40.860
a picky eater I don't even know where

00:12:38.519 --> 00:12:43.230
she's going I say just give me one of

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.720
anything no matter what she comes back

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:47.430
with I'm not going to be like oh no I

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.019
don't like chickpea flour is this fried

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:52.620
and chick you see the thing is like I'm

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:54.329
not a picky eater I never meant to do

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.630
those things to you a we can do that

00:12:54.329 --> 00:12:59.370
again

00:12:54.630 --> 00:13:00.150
that's simple plan's untitled open

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.660
parentheses

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:06.990
could this happen to me but I'm not a

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:09.720
picky eater I don't know what happened

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:12.030
to my diaphragm there I had all sorts of

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:25.550
vegetables to rue

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:29.790
I need that golden balm see a roux is a

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:32.700
flowering liquid based on emotion that

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:34.830
helps you thicken up a sorceress - okay

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:36.930
grab this grab this we're two minutes

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:38.490
behind schedule that slow as molasses

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:40.530
but we did get a deal with the angel we

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:42.840
probably did not deserve so what we are

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:45.210
going to do is speed up here and if we

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:48.150
take a little bit of damage it's less

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:50.310
consequential because nice it's less

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.900
consequential because the odds of us

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:53.880
getting a deal with the devil on this

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:56.040
floor are lower to begin with so we do

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.690
have deal with he ate all that was froze

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.070
I dodged out of the way and then back

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:03.150
into the way that's okay

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:05.040
I also should never have been hit so

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:07.710
easily by the angel statue to lose the

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:09.240
spirit art to begin with but ah easy

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:12.690
choice easiest choice in the world

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:14.280
you take both because you can but no

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:17.940
it's it's still the easiest choice in

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:22.310
the world you never would have taken we

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:24.990
can't get that we never would have taken

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:26.490
strange attractor over unicorn corn

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:31.380
even though unicorn horn is not

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:33.060
particularly amazing we have no space

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:36.300
bar item and we have the nine volt so

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:38.010
you know it's my endeavor to use this

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:41.630
properly this floor would be a really

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:44.760
good one to get a deal we don't deserve

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:46.500
as we are a little underpowered and as

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.820
always it's worth noting that strange

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:51.330
attractor probably is not going to make

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:55.170
that much better kind of hoping there's

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:57.420
some weird text zero synergy that I've

00:14:55.170 --> 00:15:00.000
never thought to experience here before

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:04.400
now I did use and I don't think it's

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:07.850
episodes gone up yet but I did use a

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:10.680
glowing hourglass recently and I

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.059
understand it on a deeper level now than

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:15.739
I have

00:15:11.059 --> 00:15:21.499
have before but is it the right choice

00:15:15.739 --> 00:15:22.819
for right now I don't know I'm not

00:15:21.499 --> 00:15:26.509
really looking for item right I'm

00:15:22.819 --> 00:15:27.829
looking for item right now this guy was

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:31.329
howling like crazy so we know that

00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:31.329
that's going to be a second secret room

00:15:33.909 --> 00:15:40.759
so the principle drop the glowing

00:15:36.139 --> 00:15:42.949
hourglass is to I mean let's put it this

00:15:40.759 --> 00:15:44.419
way take a bad pill go back in time

00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:45.619
don't take a bad pill all of a sudden

00:15:44.419 --> 00:15:49.999
we've spared ourselves from the tears

00:15:45.619 --> 00:15:51.049
downgrade take damage on the boss and

00:15:49.999 --> 00:15:52.549
compromise our deal with the devil

00:15:51.049 --> 00:15:57.679
chances go back in time fight the boss

00:15:52.549 --> 00:15:58.969
this time don't take damage and you know

00:15:57.679 --> 00:16:00.859
maybe you get your deal with devil as a

00:15:58.969 --> 00:16:03.079
result it could change the entire scope

00:16:00.859 --> 00:16:04.909
of the run but much as I hate to admit

00:16:03.079 --> 00:16:07.669
it I think occasional invincibility is

00:16:04.909 --> 00:16:09.889
probably more valuable remember as well

00:16:07.669 --> 00:16:12.319
that glowing hourglass also runs out as

00:16:09.889 --> 00:16:14.389
much as I am loath to admit that it's

00:16:12.319 --> 00:16:18.649
useful it does run out let me drink a

00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:20.619
little coffee here you kill a little

00:16:18.649 --> 00:16:24.339
bossom then you drink a little coffee

00:16:20.619 --> 00:16:30.819
what I got you gotta give me deal angel

00:16:24.339 --> 00:16:35.959
nothing really rhymes with angels range

00:16:30.819 --> 00:16:39.099
y'all Mariah Carey got that three octave

00:16:35.959 --> 00:16:40.999
range y'all something like that okay

00:16:39.099 --> 00:16:43.939
it's probably got more than a three

00:16:40.999 --> 00:16:45.589
octave range what's an average singers

00:16:43.939 --> 00:16:47.209
range I'm not talking about like Oh an

00:16:45.589 --> 00:16:50.059
average singer you mean like Adele right

00:16:47.209 --> 00:16:51.919
now I'm talking about you know Adele

00:16:50.059 --> 00:16:57.169
Barnes your fourth-grade teacher

00:16:51.919 --> 00:17:00.139
what's her range because I think I might

00:16:57.169 --> 00:17:02.749
actually and I say this not just to

00:17:00.139 --> 00:17:04.100
lampoon myself as if I'm having a laugh

00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:06.499
in the court of the king

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:09.139
think I might have like 2/3 of an octave

00:17:06.499 --> 00:17:13.129
range I'm really comfortable right

00:17:09.139 --> 00:17:18.499
around here and I can get up here

00:17:13.129 --> 00:17:21.619
without straining too hard but I do lose

00:17:18.499 --> 00:17:25.450
it it's like I'm pretty sure that if

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:29.260
there is a song with eight notes in it

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:31.660
I can't hit all of them like

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:34.000
biologically I don't think I contain the

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:35.530
bodily structure that's okay this is we

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.110
have to go mama mega it's the easiest

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:40.150
choice in the world

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:44.650
we were I would say we're probably a

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:49.110
mild favorite to make boss rush but

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:52.420
certainly it was far from guaranteed ah

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:54.160
so my game plan there was get behind the

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:56.760
spikes and give yourself to deal with

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:59.200
the devil chance but it fell apart

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:01.210
that's I thought that this thing was

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.430
saying we're ready to go here uh-oh

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:06.370
that's the secret room I just when I

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:09.940
hear the Oh like it gets into my head

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:11.590
but I don't remember what room it was

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:14.740
used on it's just like it triggers a

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:16.540
flag in my minor illogical programming

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.860
that goes like there is a secret room on

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:27.010
this floor it's not very meaningful

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:29.020
sadly let's go so I'm going to slow down

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:32.050
a little bit here probably because the

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:33.310
thing is the hush fight if we choose to

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:37.600
do with the boss rush the hush fight

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:39.240
basically is is so unlikely because

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:43.360
we're going to be late for boss rush

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:45.730
which means that we're going to assuming

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.680
words about you know just not too much

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:49.570
stronger than this by the time we do

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:51.580
boss rush which is an assumption I would

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:53.830
prefer not to have to make but you know

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:55.210
given our 18 percent deal with the devil

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:59.290
chance the writing might be sort of on

00:18:55.210 --> 00:19:03.340
the wall with respect to that we will

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:08.140
probably not be performant enough to

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:09.640
make it to the the hush fighting time

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.800
because boss rush could take us ten

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:14.760
minutes and I hate to admit that because

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:19.450
it's so annoying

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:20.620
this is I mean it's the metagame of the

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:26.680
dailies that keeps me coming back

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:30.520
because the the actual like hey you're

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:33.700
forced to do boss rush kinda stinks

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:35.260
I mean I know you're not forced to do

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:37.480
boss rush but let's be honest if you're

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:39.640
doing dailies you're trying to make boss

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.559
rush that's okay just go to the masters

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:46.170
and try your best know you're there to

00:19:41.559 --> 00:19:51.340
do well you know there's no shame in

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:55.990
embracing that competitive aspect we're

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:58.780
competitive beings were driven by you

00:19:55.990 --> 00:20:01.600
know competition I guess would be the

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:04.630
obvious word and it feels good to

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:09.010
succeed at something it's a reward for

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:12.420
the time spent in learning I value that

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:15.910
highly but what I do not value is a

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:17.350
12-minute boss rush with 4.90 damage but

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:20.820
I'm not salty yet I think we've actually

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:25.990
played relatively fine on today's daily

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:28.720
to this point it is fair to suggest that

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:31.800
we probably slowly knock that one out

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:36.820
huh it's fair to suggest that probably

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:42.420
we maybe shouldn't have taken strange

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:45.490
attractor I'll say it I got no one I

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:47.350
know uh you know familial history with

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:48.910
strange attractor that leads me to

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:51.790
defend it or something like that it's

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:54.640
just it's an item that look I saw an

00:20:51.790 --> 00:21:00.610
item room with two items so an item room

00:20:54.640 --> 00:21:04.059
with two items you know decided that I

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:06.309
would take it I think it actually makes

00:21:04.059 --> 00:21:09.490
technology one mildly worse

00:21:06.309 --> 00:21:12.370
not enough to actually like cry about or

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:15.340
anything but because our shots are just

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:18.040
they're hitting enemies faster and thus

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:22.240
the electrical field is being destroyed

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:25.240
faster so where is our secret room so we

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:27.790
want to I guess grab this we might not

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:29.320
want to have used a bomb might not want

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:31.900
to have to use the bund we could have

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:34.030
just used the spikes and then picked up

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.590
our red hard elsewhere but we got enough

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:40.090
bombs as well so we know that that's

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:41.410
that way this is no way if we come down

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:43.650
here we might find it's my way or the

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.650
highway

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:50.289
nothing secret room access some tie

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:52.059
would say there's a mild preference for

00:21:50.289 --> 00:21:54.309
a shop for an item room to border a

00:21:52.059 --> 00:22:00.100
secret room but it's anecdotal and it

00:21:54.309 --> 00:22:01.419
might just be wishful thinking so yeah

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:05.530
it appears that I don't know what I'm

00:22:01.419 --> 00:22:06.820
talking about I do want to go to a shop

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:10.210
oh we've already been to the shadows

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:12.610
where we bought mama mega of course we

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:15.549
should buy this 2 of clubs actually

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:17.530
matters not not bad at all

00:22:15.549 --> 00:22:20.919
and the secret room borders here so

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:23.380
hopefully like a black heart or five

00:22:20.919 --> 00:22:30.330
rooms is also pretty sweet to be fair

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:34.240
here speaking broadly an eihwaz rune

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:36.940
conceivably could give us the ability to

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:39.039
get to the hush fight we could also skip

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:41.409
false rush with it but that's I mean

00:22:39.039 --> 00:22:44.169
boss rushes points so it's tough to

00:22:41.409 --> 00:22:47.400
justify and I think I should rather do

00:22:44.169 --> 00:22:50.980
boss rush than hush if we can get a

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:53.230
better item so oh man we got blank room

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:55.590
to pay out with a Waze it was give us a

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:58.870
crawl space with a bunch of shit in it

00:22:55.590 --> 00:23:00.580
sorry for the S word YouTube / throw

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:02.110
okay well / throw is an obvious one

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.360
right now again we're not tight on time

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:06.580
now it's all about maximizing leveraging

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:08.530
our advantages there's options is quite

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:10.480
good because we want to mill four stat

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:13.030
upgrades hog allows doesn't matter but

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:14.980
there might be like mushrooms skulls

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:16.270
shirred just an easy way to use that we

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:18.159
even got a black card out of it we use

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:19.450
Bert Cano and then we got yarrow and we

00:23:18.159 --> 00:23:22.140
got to a clubs I think you used to a

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:28.510
clubs get 11 bombs out of it

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:32.559
take ierra and then there's there's a

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:35.230
chance that really really great things

00:23:32.559 --> 00:23:37.690
happen right here I think we did the

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:39.220
right thing on this floor full stop

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:41.559
remember we can't take a deal with the

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:43.120
devil on the next floor unless it shows

00:23:41.559 --> 00:23:44.860
up as a result of the Joker because the

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:50.409
boss rush door will close behind us with

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:55.270
mama mega if we go to the deal with

00:23:50.409 --> 00:23:57.640
devil first so give me tears or damage

00:23:55.270 --> 00:24:00.940
or a multiplier or some combination of

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:02.590
all three and then give me a deal I

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:06.130
don't care if it's angel or devil it's

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:07.330
more likely to be angel but the most

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:11.080
likely outcome is that we don't get

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:15.010
anything at all so I'm fully committed

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:16.780
to not going to hush instead going to

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:18.760
boss rush the last thing that would

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:20.320
really tie this together and make my

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:24.070
life a little easier as if we were able

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:25.780
to get rid of mama mega on our next

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:28.510
floor for a spacebar item that actually

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:29.590
benefits from having the nine volt

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:32.260
because right now we're not at that

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:35.020
level of course so and this is sad but

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:45.370
we take HP it's not sad but it's just

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:47.590
not it's not good bad situation because

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:49.510
I would prefer to be able to know where

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:51.309
we stand here we can't spend we know

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:53.200
we're going to blow this guy up grab

00:24:51.309 --> 00:24:55.390
whatever he's got can't spend until we

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:57.730
go to the shop the demon judgment offers

00:24:55.390 --> 00:25:00.610
a lot of potential value so this floor

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:02.980
should be you know mere moments

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:03.700
depending on how we wanted to be combat

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.100
should be quick

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:09.040
the problem solving on this floor might

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:10.570
take slightly longer because we are

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:14.320
going to really give this one our all

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:17.140
because having sacrificed our chance to

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:18.700
get to hush more or less which by the

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:20.410
way I mean I know I'm talking a lot of

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.760
issac stuff in the dawn written rule is

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:25.510
we don't talk about Isaac during Isaac

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:27.250
but I also you know I talked about

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:32.770
injustice for a while so I think it's

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:35.500
time to you know talk about the game for

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:36.940
a second um I think if we had chosen not

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.920
to take mama Mega we wouldn't have made

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.300
either but if you make either on today's

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:42.160
daily or sorry if you make both on

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:43.000
today's daily you're a god and there are

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.610
people that have done it because I've

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.540
seen scores in the 60 thousands today on

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:53.730
greed but so 60,000 is huge unbelievably

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:58.030
good score lockups continue to bring a

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:59.590
little bit of hope that we got the

00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:01.540
possibility against something special

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:03.100
here dude Steam sale is a huge pick up

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:05.020
of course makes me want to go to hush

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.730
but it's kind of irrelevant you know

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:08.470
those are going to make me want to you

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:09.360
know fart in front of the Queen

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:10.770
Elizabeth the

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:16.470
that doesn't mean it's any more likely

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:19.580
becoming a reality what a strange choice

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:26.299
of metaphor there you found our shop and

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:29.820
the shop is very good in fact it it's

00:26:26.299 --> 00:26:31.530
it's like really really good but it also

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:38.150
comes with a question and the question

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:40.920
is is it worth blank card Yara here and

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:43.880
the answer is yes because there's a

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:47.880
battery so now you take blank card Yara

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:49.740
you double everything and then you go

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:52.160
pick up the battery charge which did not

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:55.679
double excuse me

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:57.870
it did double it just doubled on top of

00:26:55.679 --> 00:27:00.120
itself so this is how you get infinity

00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:01.799
points on today's daily notice and you

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:05.340
know what we're going to let it ride

00:27:01.799 --> 00:27:07.040
today we're going to go for it and you

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:12.419
know why we're going to go for it

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:14.130
because we have key begger weirdly

00:27:12.419 --> 00:27:16.620
enough that's that's going to be the

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:18.150
be-all end-all here so I'm just you know

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:19.830
clearing the room out slightly because

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:22.260
it's gonna it could crash the game

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:24.240
basically if things start to go awry

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:26.880
here so we're just going to bounce the

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:29.760
bomb needs to explode so we need to move

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:31.380
around here we've there's no point to

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.460
you know keeping all these eternal

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:35.750
hearts on the ground we might as well

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:39.090
knock them around a little bit here so

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:40.410
we need to pick up the era again I don't

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:43.740
know how we're looking for HP but it's

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:46.890
got to be good and then there's battery

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:50.250
charges forget about doubling the lovers

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:53.820
cards I don't care okay we do have I'm

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:57.600
hoping that now that we've broken the

00:27:53.820 --> 00:28:02.480
the tricky nickels all of the nickels

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:05.630
that you get for doubling them become

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.630
pick up

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:10.780
so as long as you don't use the era I

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:11.860
don't see why you wouldn't pick up

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:14.620
everything you see here we're going to

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:15.910
be a full-hp regardless so you might as

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:19.180
well just clear out the room as best as

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:21.430
you can I think and then we're going to

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:23.380
go back to the era we didn't pick up a

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:25.150
battery charge in the melee there which

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:30.460
is amazing to me we're going to double

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:31.600
it up again because of points and we're

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:34.000
just going to work our way through here

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:36.130
we can't afford to lose the yarrow rune

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:44.110
but we do want to pick up like every

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:48.460
bomb available we've gotten them so now

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:51.880
take care of the exit okay so we know

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:56.500
we're at full HP 12 HP and we have blank

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:59.680
card Yara so points now are fairly easy

00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:01.450
to come by but we don't have damage is

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:03.070
the thing we also we could use more keys

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:06.850
but blank card Yara makes that pretty

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:08.920
easy to create but we need more keys

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:12.340
pardon me for more points anyway

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:15.900
the soul is I mean not so useful from an

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:18.220
HP standpoint anymore but still nice

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:21.310
we'll continue to use blank card Yara

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:24.190
for now we should probably continue to

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:28.330
use blank card Yara like forever

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:30.520
on this run but not fully convinced that

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:32.980
that's we compromise our deal with the

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:35.110
devil champ because we lost our spirit

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:39.160
our pardon me a little spring allergy

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:40.390
congestion going on here hmm it's a

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:42.340
better room to double because we get

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:44.170
more bombs which equals more points but

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:46.660
we could start doubling the keys as well

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:48.130
and get something there but not super

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:52.930
concerned about it as you might expect

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:59.170
now so assuming we get at least like a

00:29:52.930 --> 00:30:01.030
red heart that drops on boss rush we

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:03.190
shouldn't die on boss rush despite the

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:07.800
fact that we're not necessarily crushing

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:07.800
it from a an HP standpoint I mean

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:16.520
seemed like an okay choice we do have to

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:18.200
worry about not having any knowledge of

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:19.910
what our HP looks like right now and we

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.890
do also have to remember that the run

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:27.160
feels powerful but we're 26 minutes in

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:29.870
on the depths and not particularly

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:32.000
strong like we still have the same

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:34.550
damage that we had in like our caves 1

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.620
item room we are doing better than usual

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:42.770
from a point standpoint though and we

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:45.080
conceivably could make up for the for

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:49.640
the lack of a hush fight by just

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:52.429
doubling up here I don't think maybe

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:58.820
we're in the somewhat special scenario

00:30:52.429 --> 00:31:00.080
here because we actually kept our yarrow

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:02.330
rune but you didn't have to keep it for

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.800
very long my expectation is that a lot

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:05.420
of people are probably going to find

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:07.760
themselves in a similar boat today blank

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:15.890
card Yara is like a classic combination

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:18.110
for for making a breaking run work so I

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:20.929
think you know we need damage above all

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:22.630
else so forget the eternal heart forget

00:31:20.929 --> 00:31:25.040
two blood bank

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:29.360
grab this instead okay so that's our

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:32.330
second syringe it's a start I don't know

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:36.910
if we even want to go to the boss trap

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:40.840
room it just strikes me as a little -

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:40.840
not good basically

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:47.000
you want the battery charged we don't

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:48.140
need the battery charged now that I

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.810
think about it what do we need the

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:52.460
battery charge for we're going to get a

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:54.500
battery charge after we kill mom and

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:55.580
pick up another item so just remember we

00:31:54.500 --> 00:32:00.530
can't get a deal with the devil here

00:31:55.580 --> 00:32:04.250
anyway so once you kill mom do not pick

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:05.960
up the deal with the devil hopefully if

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:07.850
there's a deal and then surprisingly

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:11.180
high chance actually but if there's a

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:16.370
deal hopefully it'll stay open that was

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:21.260
terrible after we finish boss rush so

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:23.600
what we need to survive on on boss rush

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:26.780
and I think that survival is a mild

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:28.760
concern we have a lot of HP but you know

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:33.920
we're not crushing enemies at all from a

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:35.810
damage standpoint although euthanasia

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:41.440
does give us a nice little bit of burst

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:44.480
damage on occasion um what we need is

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:46.520
like a single red heart to drop and then

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:50.090
every time blank Cartier it comes off we

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:55.460
just use it I would also love to get

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:57.830
like a devil card we would probably

00:32:55.460 --> 00:33:00.260
blank card gara it and then use the

00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:01.940
devil's once we had like at least two of

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:04.400
them available so we could constantly

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:07.880
dupe one I think they do we found out

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:09.380
recently they do a stack don't know if

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:10.910
they always do so we didn't get a deal

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:14.120
with the devil the portal to the void

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:17.030
floor is irrelevant what we want is the

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:20.060
polaroid and then we got betrayal rune

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:21.890
bag is lovely fire mind we got to go for

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.940
spun so rune bag is great but we already

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:26.990
have blank card Yara

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:30.590
we have to go spun the damage upgrade is

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:32.300
too valuable and then it's going to be

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:37.670
like kind of a nightmare for a little

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:40.510
while here but at least the first wave

00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:40.510
here is pretty easy

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:45.600
and dude this is it tech zero starting

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:47.970
to make it happen we didn't get it Sears

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:49.620
upgrade sadly we did get we must have

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:53.070
gotten a damaged upgrade before spun

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:58.250
kicked in because in case it's not

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:59.910
abundantly clear I would suggest that

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:02.280
9.14 damage

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:06.180
from our previous damage stat of five is

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:08.130
a fairly unlikely boon to get from like

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:10.650
a single play placenta just healed us a

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:13.890
little bit I shouldn't probably be as

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:16.320
concerned about HP as I am but I've had

00:34:13.890 --> 00:34:17.820
some poor luck and poor performances

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.170
lately and I don't think this run should

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:21.420
be countered amongst them you know we've

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:23.640
taken some bad damage and it's probably

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:25.140
always a bad idea you know if you want

00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:26.880
to make a rule of thumb around strange

00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:28.620
attractor the rule of thumb would

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:31.530
definitely be don't take strange

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:34.170
attractor but I continue to be the home

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:36.840
for misfit toys to some extent in this

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:39.570
game there are situations in which it's

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:41.430
nice my dream of creating you know an

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:44.420
electrical black hole is probably not

00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:49.470
going to come true but you never know

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:52.410
still a lot of game left the hush fight

00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:56.040
in a way it's very freeing now but it's

00:34:52.410 --> 00:35:00.240
a loss to the sands of time so the only

00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:02.670
way that we are going to get an amazing

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.960
score yeah just walk right into it what

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:06.270
could be the problem the only way we're

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:08.460
going to get an amazing score is a via

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:10.050
our own ingenuity and then use of blank

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:12.240
card Yara which is thankfully very

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:14.280
obvious like well how do you get a lot

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:16.290
of points with blank card Yara um just

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:18.390
double everything you see that provides

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:20.460
you with like any benefit whatsoever so

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:22.380
unfortunately that doesn't apply to our

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:26.760
lone consumable on this run so far which

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:30.930
is on this room so far which is a an I

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:32.850
found pills pill but it's going to

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:34.560
happen dude you're watching this and

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:38.400
you're going this is a long boss rush

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:40.500
just remember we had about half of this

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.880
damage like three rooms ago and that was

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:43.940
that was the world that it looked like

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:46.520
we were going to have to live in a

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:50.450
cylinder the electricity does a

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:50.450
comparable amount of damage to our

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:57.610
yeah that was I mean anyone could have

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:58.540
predicted that happening I still don't

00:35:57.610 --> 00:35:59.860
know if our electricity does a

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:02.890
comparable amount of damage to our

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:09.190
existing tears but certainly has a much

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:10.810
wider spread so scent is doing just

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:13.900
about exactly what it dude we have

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:16.000
unlimited bombs I mean they're not

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:18.340
special bombs they're not like cool

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.460
bombs I'm not a normal bomb I'm like a

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:23.380
cool bomb so we should have been using

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:24.310
those earlier to be fair a lot of the

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:27.580
earlier enemies

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:35.290
we fought were actually like completely

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:37.480
fine really

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:42.430
Dingell of all the enemies Dingles the

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:46.290
one rattling me right now so there's

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:46.290
this is my master plan right here I

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:50.950
don't think it's working too well not

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:52.840
yet anyway but I believe in the power of

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:56.490
Tec cero tech zero has been fine for us

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:56.490
so far might even be amazing later

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:11.350
we're not quite ah there yet so perfect

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:17.560
thank you you just fell into my trap you

00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:18.640
yeah absolute idiot get outsmarted by

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:21.580
the best of them son

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:23.170
I need like a topic to converse about

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:23.770
because these boss Russians are getting

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:26.680
ridiculous

00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:28.960
it could be 40 minutes into the run by

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:32.260
the time I leave boss rush this is we're

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:34.330
on a normal that was not very good on a

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:36.880
normal daily I'd be like ask him for

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:39.030
mercy right now there's no mercy to ask

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:45.940
for because the run is great it's just

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:47.980
incredibly slow I'm like losing my mind

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:56.380
that we have had no other consumables

00:37:47.980 --> 00:38:00.070
drop as well like none it doesn't seem

00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:04.150
plausible that we could have nun

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:08.680
consumables drop this deep into a boss

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:10.240
rush with a 5 luck stat as there's no

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:13.630
negative sign in front of that right

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:18.060
this is a this is a 5 luck step okay

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:21.070
well that pretty much is 100% reservist

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:22.510
hmm so we are going to the chest that 5

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:24.310
Lux that should serve us pretty well

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:25.390
down there I'm getting sloppy I'm losing

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:28.650
a few hundred points I don't need to

00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:28.650
lose time to reel that in

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:40.050
we've got to be closing in on on the

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:42.000
finish here and the runs actually like

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:43.790
from a damage standpoint it's actually

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.350
fine

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:48.690
nine damage with a default rate of fire

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:52.130
is not anything to write home about but

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:54.420
it's not horrible we should be okay to

00:38:52.130 --> 00:39:01.740
survive and do okay on the rest of the

00:38:54.420 --> 00:39:04.910
run like this but I would really really

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:07.230
like a sears upgrade I feel like that's

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:09.290
kind of the key to the kingdom for us

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:13.860
when it comes to making at X zero

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:18.540
flourish any damage we do with tech zero

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:22.140
is pretty much accidental right now but

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:23.850
I believe that you know careful and

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:26.970
considered use of this could turn out to

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:32.730
be a large positive please tell me we

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:34.530
are done now please tell me we're done

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:37.980
after this you know I'll compromise I'm

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:39.750
a man of a reasonable man most of the

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.950
time if you get more than two meets at

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:43.470
the deli counter where there's a line

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:44.820
behind you I think you should be thrown

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:46.890
in prison but apart from that I'm a

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:51.900
reasonable man if you don't use your

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:53.400
turn signal capital punishment but apart

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:55.410
from that I consider myself a reasonable

00:39:53.400 --> 00:40:00.660
it does nobody else paid attention to

00:39:55.410 --> 00:40:04.730
the rules it's all it separates us from

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:04.730
the animals dude is our turn signals

00:40:07.929 --> 00:40:14.839
I'm going to die of old age before we

00:40:10.849 --> 00:40:16.249
finish this boss rush that one heard me

00:40:14.839 --> 00:40:22.429
because I should have dodged it about a

00:40:16.249 --> 00:40:23.929
million times but I'm gonna I'm losing

00:40:22.429 --> 00:40:26.179
my resolve that's me in the corner

00:40:23.929 --> 00:40:28.299
that's dead literally in this case

00:40:26.179 --> 00:40:32.150
that's me in the spotlight freaking

00:40:28.299 --> 00:40:35.179
losing my will to live on this daily run

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:41.299
that's not what michael skype it michael

00:40:35.179 --> 00:40:47.150
stipe there's got to be something it's a

00:40:41.299 --> 00:40:49.910
voice over IP program it's a voice over

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:53.829
P because his name is Michael Stipe but

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:53.829
I call them Michael Skype is the thing

00:40:56.410 --> 00:41:05.269
and you sound fine wait there's there's

00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:07.969
something good in here

00:41:05.269 --> 00:41:12.709
where is Skype originally from I think

00:41:07.969 --> 00:41:15.410
it's like Estonia now I'm trying to work

00:41:12.709 --> 00:41:17.269
like the story of the founding of Skype

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:18.979
into if the end of the world as we know

00:41:17.269 --> 00:41:21.920
it there's zero percent chance of this

00:41:18.979 --> 00:41:25.969
working out pattern in Vilnius bought by

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:32.689
Microsoft right right hmm it's a voice

00:41:25.969 --> 00:41:38.150
element P protocol it's okay it's oh my

00:41:32.689 --> 00:41:39.739
god it actually never ends you should

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:41.779
know that when I said we'd be out of

00:41:39.739 --> 00:41:44.900
here by 40 minutes of course in my head

00:41:41.779 --> 00:41:47.509
I'm going 40 minutes come on we'll be

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:52.939
out of here 33 we'll be home by

00:41:47.509 --> 00:41:56.089
Christmas we are not home by Christmas I

00:41:52.939 --> 00:41:58.069
keep taking bad damage just like this is

00:41:56.089 --> 00:42:00.199
not a run for which boss rush made any

00:41:58.069 --> 00:42:04.789
sense apparently despite our newfound

00:42:00.199 --> 00:42:07.249
damage holy crap it's done and we got

00:42:04.789 --> 00:42:09.289
like you want to go razor blade if we

00:42:07.249 --> 00:42:11.229
get both now we can't get both so razor

00:42:09.289 --> 00:42:13.009
blade is the right colleges piercing

00:42:11.229 --> 00:42:14.719
occasionally I don't know it's just

00:42:13.009 --> 00:42:17.170
really been like a month since I had

00:42:14.719 --> 00:42:17.170
this item

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:22.170
what I do know for certain is that

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:26.940
poison is just not that good okay it's

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:29.090
only occasionally piercing but still so

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:31.740
blank card Yara that's important

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:33.000
starting to build a decent run here we

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.950
should have heared that to be honest

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.300
with you

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:37.320
the faster you start the doubling the

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:41.280
more important is you ever see that

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:42.930
graph by like compound interest you know

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:44.930
it's like if you start saving now versus

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:48.200
if you start saving in ten years with

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:51.740
dramatic effects that can have on your

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:54.300
on your bank account

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:56.450
it's basically blank card er you know

00:42:54.300 --> 00:43:00.180
you get that first double out of the way

00:42:56.450 --> 00:43:08.580
got a lot less to worry about we still

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:10.260
have a chance to die I'm just going to

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:13.950
use the judgment we still have a chance

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:15.570
to die but if we handle things properly

00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:17.250
on this floor don't take too much damage

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:18.599
like we have we have a tolerance we can

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:21.890
take a little damage but we just can't

00:43:18.599 --> 00:43:23.790
take too too much then we should be

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:25.470
sitting pretty and I actually think

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:26.490
there was if I remember correctly and

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:27.990
we're getting to the point where that

00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:32.520
was like an hour ago so I don't know if

00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:34.619
I do but there was a pretty wide gulf

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:39.660
between scores on today's daily and

00:43:34.619 --> 00:43:44.490
we're at like a competitive level not to

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:48.470
be number one probably was a secret room

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:48.470
here yes

00:43:53.170 --> 00:44:00.080
problem-solving not to be number one but

00:43:57.650 --> 00:44:02.440
to be in the running for maybe like you

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:05.360
know top 200 is something like that

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:06.740
because the the top score is like 60

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:08.480
something which is really good but the

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:10.400
scores on the front page I think you

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:14.000
know range down into the maybe like

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:16.520
mid-40s which is dated which is

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.050
completely within our grasp

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.850
considering the tools that we have right

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:21.710
now and our existing score which despite

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:24.980
being you know normally we'd be down

00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:27.320
here twice as quickly but oh no it's

00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:32.750
definitely above oh wow it was both

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:38.380
actually disregard yeah despite being

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:41.930
like way behind or ahead of schedule

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:46.700
wait not or ahead literally just being

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:49.190
behind schedule like we're in a very

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:50.420
good spot here point wise you'd expect

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:52.160
our points to be lower given the

00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:55.730
circumstances is what I'm trying to say

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:58.010
and failing so what we're going to do

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:59.750
here is double again and we're going to

00:44:58.010 --> 00:45:02.690
pick up all the keys before key beggar

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:04.190
gets them because this guy is a jerk and

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:07.310
you're going to take a lot of them

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:08.560
unfortunately but that's the cost of

00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:10.970
doing business

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:15.050
at least he gave us absolutely nothing

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:16.550
okay less than nothing actually

00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:18.800
compromised our deal with the devil

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:20.390
chance drastically and paralysis okay

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:22.580
thanks for your help as always high

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:24.320
quality item this is people are so happy

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:32.960
with that items in the game key bagger

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:41.210
man when you think you're strong pick up

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:42.670
this item and lose your own whoo it

00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:48.560
won't be long

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:54.560
two key bagger kills your overpowered

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:56.900
run key beggars most embarrassing thing

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:58.910
I can admit is not my singing but the

00:45:56.900 --> 00:46:00.590
fact that as soon as I start singing in

00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:03.670
an episode I lean on the keys like I'm

00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:03.670
fuckin Stevie Wonder

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:11.340
seriously I started like milking the

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:16.140
arrow keys for notes dude

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:20.970
euthanasia with the I mean I gotta go

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:24.180
but euthanasia with the tech zero effect

00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:27.810
is actually really sweet let me get a

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:29.970
ring of electricity we should start

00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:32.070
doubling something else we got battery

00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:34.530
charges I just don't know what I mean we

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:35.850
should double more keys really you don't

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:38.720
need to double bombs although we could

00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:41.010
probably still get some points out of it

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:45.000
we don't need to double money either so

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:48.900
it's again kind of unnecessary at the

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:51.270
very least oh okay well that makes my

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:57.530
decision a lot easier or does it or does

00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:59.190
it took one you jerk you know what dude

00:46:57.530 --> 00:47:02.400
just go for it

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:05.940
don't let me stop you oh you don't want

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:09.420
these we still get some points when ki

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:11.510
beggar picks them up I guess well worth

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:16.020
it

00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:18.230
just call on ki beggar when you need a

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:25.560
hand

00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:27.090
we need to get a keys gone that time I

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:30.810
didn't lean like Stevie Wonder and my

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:32.700
voice was much worse so you know you do

00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:36.510
the math Wow

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:41.390
that is embarrassing I really want the

00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:41.390
second key piece

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:48.280
now

00:47:48.339 --> 00:47:57.309
you can't be killed this is where you

00:47:53.769 --> 00:48:04.180
hurt him please do that attack more than

00:47:57.309 --> 00:48:05.589
once per millennium it's so funny

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:08.259
because like I'm looking at it's a forty

00:48:05.589 --> 00:48:10.239
seven minute video at this point could

00:48:08.259 --> 00:48:11.829
take an hour before we finish people are

00:48:10.239 --> 00:48:13.809
going to be in the comments like must be

00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:15.549
a speedrun you know wow like you're

00:48:13.809 --> 00:48:17.890
going to go into this one thinking it's

00:48:15.549 --> 00:48:19.690
a loss and actually you're going to find

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:22.719
yourself in this weird like David Lynch

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:25.900
Ian completely one run but exceptionally

00:48:22.719 --> 00:48:27.729
slow version of it that I I mean I can't

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:30.819
really fathom myself to be honest with

00:48:27.729 --> 00:48:38.259
you these three didn't fight Bighorn on

00:48:30.819 --> 00:48:39.460
this one so you definitely want to just

00:48:38.259 --> 00:48:43.150
take the tiers upgrade and that's

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:51.999
actually extremely good might as well do

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:53.559
our last room here right if you got

00:48:51.999 --> 00:48:54.339
speed and balls of steel you can make

00:48:53.559 --> 00:48:56.140
that room work

00:48:54.339 --> 00:49:03.969
I took damage I probably touched a red

00:48:56.140 --> 00:49:07.660
pooop' put a shot yeah we're down to the

00:49:03.969 --> 00:49:09.489
next floor 45 minutes in here maybe I

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:11.829
touched a spike there's no red poops

00:49:09.489 --> 00:49:14.109
there I don't know what I don't know I

00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:17.469
don't know phantom damage happens to the

00:49:14.109 --> 00:49:21.160
best of us dad was not phantom damage

00:49:17.469 --> 00:49:22.869
that was very legitimate damage turn

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:27.819
into Peter Falk from The Princess Bride

00:49:22.869 --> 00:49:31.509
there temporarily says card bloom to

00:49:27.819 --> 00:49:34.989
scott womb that I wish you saw 50 minute

00:49:31.509 --> 00:49:37.479
daily ROM close your eyes and those

00:49:34.989 --> 00:49:42.609
words rhyme with the with the binding

00:49:37.479 --> 00:49:50.829
device spare me from this madness no you

00:49:42.609 --> 00:49:55.349
I took one why do you insist vilifying

00:49:50.829 --> 00:49:55.349
yourself it's a bad look buddy

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:07.200
okay okay okay let me explain that

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:10.390
damage because it was terrible um I

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:13.540
walked on the spikes because I went too

00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:15.400
fast just no better explanation as far

00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:17.260
as I'm concerned ki beggar at this point

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:21.340
take all the keys you find keys take

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:23.710
them you know why because I want you to

00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:26.800
give me an item that to at least let me

00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:31.390
crap on this run for all floor we're

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:33.040
doing fine like it's good it's just not

00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:34.540
quite great and it feels like it should

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:40.690
be great because we got you know

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:42.430
everything the body needs here not

00:50:40.690 --> 00:50:43.869
really inspiring a lot of confidence

00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:44.980
with my own play to be fair and our

00:50:43.869 --> 00:50:49.800
damage penalty is going to be through

00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:53.020
the roof but just go for it do take it

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:55.180
he's done it - pills way let me guess

00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:57.340
speed downgrade and the pill that loses

00:50:55.180 --> 00:51:00.550
you the game instantly retro vision and

00:50:57.340 --> 00:51:04.480
okay perks is actually good dat elavil

00:51:00.550 --> 00:51:07.030
zero room so we lose our Yara rune tell

00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:11.920
appealed error room so we lose our gear

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:15.640
Arun tell of pills as wait yeah woo woo

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:21.030
this is a double secret no it just went

00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:24.960
twice for some reason wait that it

00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:24.960
called it on that room as well

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:37.610
so forgive me but I am going to this

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:39.500
very sensible play I'm going to first

00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:42.950
I'll just can you say three arrows are

00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:44.090
you out of your mind I am going to well

00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:46.300
now I don't even need to get here I'm

00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:48.770
just going to go because I'm done I

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:52.430
think we're going to do fines on today's

00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:54.650
daily but I'm going to kill my enjoyment

00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:57.080
of this game like a hundred percent

00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:58.460
single-handedly on this daily it's not

00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.660
even that it's bad I don't how many

00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:03.470
times I've said this over the course of

00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:06.800
the past 50 minutes or so but it's just

00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:08.690
taking forever it's like it's like two

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:11.810
standard deviations longer than the

00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:13.280
average Isaac run and then the extra

00:52:11.810 --> 00:52:17.300
annoyance on top of that is that it's

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:19.100
actually good no I'm not going to the

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:20.510
void floor you might catch other idiots

00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:22.820
but I've made that mistake enough times

00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:26.060
to know that you know it's not the right

00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:28.940
way to go so we're a little lighter on

00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:31.880
points now than we'd normally be on the

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:35.320
cathedral I accept this a million

00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:38.240
percent as a result of taking damage I

00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:44.240
also accept that if I didn't take this

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:46.340
damage I would be going so slowly and

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:48.590
carefully that I would altair-4 the run

00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:50.630
so I didn't self trepan eight at some

00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:54.740
point in order to you know relieve the

00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:57.610
pressure of being the slowest dang daily

00:52:54.740 --> 00:53:00.080
of all time despite the damage of gross

00:52:57.610 --> 00:53:02.930
give me a reason dude just give me a

00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:05.090
breeze there we go double it up why not

00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:11.800
the real draw here of course is two

00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:13.910
double chests on the chest so the

00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:18.130
suffering that we've incurred up to this

00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:23.150
point on a mental level is all worth it

00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:25.660
if by the way let me point out I

00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:27.830
squandered every deal with the devil

00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:29.870
that we ever kill I squandered every

00:53:27.830 --> 00:53:31.690
deal chance that we came across except

00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:34.010
for the one on the third floor which

00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:35.540
hilariously was probably the hardest for

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:36.620
us to actually keep it alive because we

00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:37.710
didn't have a spirit I was left at that

00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:40.140
point but

00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:42.420
we had low chances but anyway I digress

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:44.880
we could have saved ourselves some some

00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:48.510
pain and heartache by just not taking as

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:51.450
much awful damage or not awful but

00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:53.070
inopportune and then of course once we

00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:55.950
got all those eternal hearts we no

00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:57.510
longer had the ability really to uh to

00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:59.099
protect ourselves with a spirit heart so

00:53:57.510 --> 00:54:01.890
we had to kill rooms extremely quickly

00:53:59.099 --> 00:54:02.820
to get a deal with the devil because if

00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:04.770
we didn't kill them quickly they could

00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:11.460
hurt us but obviously that didn't

00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:18.660
necessarily come to pass yeah cuz it

00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:20.910
told you that but it's all worth it it's

00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:23.640
almost inconceivable that eight luck

00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:27.480
could lead to anything but a bountiful

00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:34.740
chest eight luck you know we might as

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:36.950
well at this point ten luck okay I'm

00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:39.990
going to check that might be magic mush

00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:42.060
or you know a full health

00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:44.070
pill it's not a bed full white pill full

00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:51.420
health pill they all know the little

00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:54.000
ditty we blank card Yara ten luck we

00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:55.650
should be getting chefs you know every

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.660
every time we step foot into a room it

00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:59.640
should be like excuse me sir you've been

00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:01.320
through a lot here's what you get you

00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:03.650
know Oh Polyphemus you shouldn't have

00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:07.550
put it on the pile with you no Godhead

00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:09.480
brimstone now I'm not naive enough to

00:55:07.550 --> 00:55:12.109
expect that that's likely what's going

00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:12.109
to happen here

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:20.840
have we ever before in our lives had a

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:25.610
good train wreck this might be the first

00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:28.190
of its kind king of the Andals you know

00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:34.760
first of its freakin name good train

00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:40.490
Wrexham daenerys train wreck e'en

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:42.470
something like it almost works there's

00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:45.980
more than I can say about the mush that

00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:47.540
my brain is turned into after this you

00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:49.340
know I always started out as like a plan

00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:50.690
for my days mostly Sun doesn't record a

00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:52.520
little eyes examined got the analyst

00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:55.790
says take a little break after the LSS

00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:57.410
eat some lunch I'm unique we're too late

00:55:55.790 --> 00:55:59.210
in the run for me to get into you'll be

00:55:57.410 --> 00:56:01.250
a mad at me for even lunch at 6 p.m. by

00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:03.470
the way you know give different people I

00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:10.640
wake up late let's just be it's call it

00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:12.530
you know as we see it here today I

00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:14.270
started with more than enough time I was

00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:16.760
like I might even be able to fit in to

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:18.670
average length isaac runs before the

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:23.360
analyst SL give me a lot of momentum

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:26.180
productivity wise for today nope we will

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:27.830
definitely be able to fit one thankfully

00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:31.100
I did get a little bit of an earlier

00:56:27.830 --> 00:56:32.450
start to you know when Isaac recording

00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:34.340
and sometimes I do because if I had

00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:37.190
given myself the normal like 50 minutes

00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:39.950
although we would have been scrambling

00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:43.520
to make the docket and it would have

00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:45.080
been a disaster piece man but let's go

00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:47.930
we're on the chest if I get an ever

00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:51.770
recorded I'm out of this bitch as fast

00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:55.550
as possible so I hear that's eight items

00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:56.750
we have the 9-volt I don't think we

00:56:55.550 --> 00:56:59.420
should go for eight items because we

00:56:56.750 --> 00:57:01.880
should get we should get you know we

00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:05.120
should get enough items to keep us you

00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:06.950
know busy for at least another doubling

00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:08.840
and every doubling is worth more than

00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:10.550
the one that preceded it so it will cost

00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:12.980
us a lot of points to use all of our

00:57:10.550 --> 00:57:16.820
keys to do this but it'll also restore

00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:18.860
my sanity I am approximately zero

00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:21.440
percent worried about my ranking today I

00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:24.220
know that we're going to be in the top

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:24.220
1000

00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:33.440
and that's all rights I think we might

00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:35.480
have a worse relative rank but a better

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:37.390
overall rank because anybody not

00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:40.970
recording this daily I think has about a

00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:42.620
+ 95 percent chance to just press alt f4

00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:44.540
once they get to that boss rush that

00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:46.580
takes a hundred minutes unless maybe the

00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:48.530
deal with the devil contains a beautiful

00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:50.810
bounty that I had missed as a result of

00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:54.250
the squandering I accept that as a as a

00:57:50.810 --> 00:57:55.610
possibility of course so we got to be

00:57:54.250 --> 00:58:03.580
smart here

00:57:55.610 --> 00:58:08.140
that's 16 this is 32 this will be 64

00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:08.140
which is enough to take all of our keys

00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:14.360
so we're going to take every passive of

00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:16.460
course and I'm just going to like leave

00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:19.300
periodically to cull the chests that

00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:19.300
we've already taken

00:58:19.810 --> 00:58:27.590
dude there's some amazing stuff there I

00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:30.020
mean as is already pretty solid monstros

00:58:27.590 --> 00:58:33.170
lungs doing some solid work here 8 Inch

00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:35.410
Nails is killing it so let's go pick up

00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:38.450
this amazing stuff Hoshi tractor beam

00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:41.030
adrenaline course Holy Light is awesome

00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:42.230
parasitoid also awesome repairs straight

00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:45.170
tears I should say

00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:46.160
Rawdon baby very good but most enemies

00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:47.620
are going to die before we touch them

00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:51.310
the real meat here is of course

00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:53.240
proptosis and then spoon vendor as well

00:58:51.310 --> 00:58:55.190
but we're going to take everything this

00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:59.390
should give us conjoined maybe getting

00:58:55.190 --> 00:59:02.450
close at least relic is worthless so

00:58:59.390 --> 00:59:05.390
what we don't want to do is take dr.

00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:12.050
fetus I also don't really want to take

00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:15.020
marks I do want holy mantle I do want

00:59:12.050 --> 00:59:16.550
that I do want the halo I do watch

00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:18.260
chocklit milk thank you I don't really

00:59:16.550 --> 00:59:20.450
care if we get cursed I because I don't

00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:21.830
expect to ever take damage again I will

00:59:20.450 --> 00:59:24.110
take the weight I'll take a speed

00:59:21.830 --> 00:59:25.310
upgrade take the songs that remind us of

00:59:24.110 --> 00:59:26.660
the good times I'll take the freaking

00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:30.080
songs that remind us of the best times

00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:32.750
I'm not ignoring swallowed penny I'm

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:36.160
just going to choose to simplify my life

00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:36.160
by not taking it

00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:42.970
this run is already absurd and we're out

00:59:41.590 --> 00:59:47.099
of keys okay in a way that's actually

00:59:42.970 --> 00:59:49.359
kind of nice we know okay

00:59:47.099 --> 00:59:54.160
photosensitivity warning may be coming

00:59:49.359 --> 00:59:56.290
in a little late here but this in a way

00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:58.690
it almost makes it worthwhile although

00:59:56.290 --> 01:00:00.040
that time that we spent being mad at

00:59:58.690 --> 01:00:02.340
this run is dead to us and we'll never

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.340
return

01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:08.640
dude you serious

01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:08.640
35 damage

01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:23.000
what's done is done it was an excellent

01:00:17.119 --> 01:00:26.030
run for about 45 seconds apart from that

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.680
a little annoying but check it out 306 I

01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:28.700
can live with that our damage penalty is

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.540
out of control but for now thanks for
