##

00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.790
everybody welcome Eckener on the land

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:09.360
please binding mascara plus basically

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:12.269
yesterday's run is so bad

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.849
it really was pretty terrible I'll just

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.270
go through the seat here first VJ 0 CA h

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:22.760
ax sorry a h XX with money equals power

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.990
sprinkler good damage great rate of fire

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.990
adequate speed this seems like an

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.340
acceptable start to things here as long

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.160
as we don't take damage against this guy

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.500
I feel pretty good about our chances but

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:39.300
yeah self-inflicted or not yesterday's

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.649
run was a little scary and as a result

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.140
we found ourselves in a position where

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.210
we conceivably could have died instead

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.800
we came away with a victory that it

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.960
leaves you thinking like why were you

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.480
ever scared you know you got guppy and

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.789
you were generating like an HP upgrade

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.780
every three rooms and it became kind of

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.449
like like a joke by the end of it but

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:04.850
why did we get 0.15 damage for picking

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:11.119
up a penny

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:14.330
normally you receive point zero for

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:17.250
damage per penny and this is like I

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.960
recognize that I might be strike has

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.060
been congruent with my personality I

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.670
said not to be that detail-oriented but

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.439
at the same time I'm like we got like it

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.880
to me it seemed like we got quadruple

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.880
damage out of picking up a single penny

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.320
I'm trying to take like maybe we've

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.630
smelted a trinket or something by the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.040
way a sprinkler is a really really cool

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.780
space bar item that I have not given

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.250
it's it's adequate praise I think the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.600
better our damage gets the better

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.890
sprinkler is going to get and it also

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.909
picks up all of our tear effects

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.409
including like peer shape to your size

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.990
obviously things like status effects as

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.790
well but you know if we get brimstone a

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.500
homing tears all of a sudden we got like

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.850
a brimstone and I believe homing

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.640
sprinkler as well that could be really

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.209
really strong for us so I'm extremely

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.810
proce Brinkley wag get as a pop which is

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.940
occasional

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.560
I'm just going to head down I want to

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.360
keep as much money as possible because I

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.860
want to first off money goes power is

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.360
important to me in this situation

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.640
secondly if we can get an arcade we can

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.760
get even more money and possibly more HP

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.790
and use that to make our dreams work

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.900
here now we don't have any other items

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.980
so I don't know what happened there I

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.980
was like I was just confused we have a

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.980
library where we don't really get any

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.690
benefit out of using Book of Shadows

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.980
because we have no map so we can't

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.769
really see where anything is I don't

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.959
believe that it unveils like the actual

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.650
entrance it's just on the map it shows

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.569
us where we should go but I digress

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.459
relatively irrelevant what we're looking

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.560
for here is just exactly what we just

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.180
found so with this and a little bit of

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.620
tolerance in terms of the amount of

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.120
spirit arts and demon arts you got here

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.330
I think we're sitting pretty like this

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.069
run is going to potentially pop off like

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.190
if we get 20 cents that's almost like

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.200
picking up dark matter more or less so I

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.489
don't know I think the stat screen I'm

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.950
not going to say it's bugs but I don't

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.470
think it's working as I don't think it's

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.380
updating continuously with each pick up

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.150
that we get yeah okay so it changes

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.370
based on each penny that we get some of

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.329
them are point zero six the nickel was

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.640
like 0.14 maybe here's what I'm thinking

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.859
happened maybe there were four pennies

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.370
on top of the first penny we picked up

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:42.870
I'm probably overthinking it money

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.690
equals power by the way is actually a

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.739
really good with IV bag however we're

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.670
going to stick with sprinkler the

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:53.609
sprinkler is a newer item and IV bag

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.590
probably is my default choice on like 10

00:03:53.609 --> 00:04:00.329
percent of my runs so I don't

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:02.970
necessarily feel like we need to take it

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.410
in every single situation you know in a

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.750
lot of situations we're going to do so

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.150
especially as Samson it's like a 10 out

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.209
of 10 item but not in every situation

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.220
here we've managed to get very very

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.209
strong quite early on this run so I'm

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.209
thinking that we got the tools

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:25.360
we'll see I don't know 202 a clubs not

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.460
that fantastic right now I'm actually

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.569
hoping and I think I have a good excuse

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.490
to get like a super overpowered run

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:35.949
ideally not mom's knife but this is like

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.960
I'm it's like it's my super sweet 16 and

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:43.449
I'm like I don't want an Audi Dada I

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:46.690
wanted a Lexus outies are so last year

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:48.870
I wanted a Caterham 7 classic that's

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.340
right I played Project Gotham Racing

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.810
familiar with the Nurburgring we took

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.590
way more damage than we should have but

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.500
the speed upgrade is nice and handles ok

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:08.229
so be smart here actually we could die

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:12.159
I just wanted to essentially ruin his

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.820
chance to push me into the fires that

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:15.009
could kill me

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.990
Krampus is head we cannot take at least

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:18.789
I feel like we cannot take I'm just

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.039
looking for obviously the item room in

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.419
the shop at this point but yeah it's a

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.039
little dicey ER than it had to be and

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.830
I'll take responsibility for that

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:29.889
although we did fight a fairly difficult

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.139
boss but you know I also accept that we

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.030
haven't faced consequences for this yet

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:36.849
but I might just be off today like my

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.590
first my first run of the day was the

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:41.940
run that we just did and it was fairly

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:44.500
bad in terms of my personal performance

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.099
for a lot of that run it was like a 5

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.300
out of 10 run with like a 5 out of 10

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:51.009
performance stacked up next to it

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.530
like I think I actually should skip

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:56.320
Bob's brain I know it's anti Zayn to do

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:59.380
so but I'm scared dude I took Bob's

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:03.070
brain in our last run and I loved it

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.870
because I understand it it's a valuable

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.370
item as long as you don't put yourself

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.139
in a position where he can screw you but

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.469
I think I might have put myself in a

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:12.330
position where you can screw me we'll

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:17.650
see

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:19.810
check the shop first no spirit heart but

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.310
that's not that bad we'll take buddy in

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.340
a box which I always get confused with

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.229
moving box I will take ownership by the

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.360
way for getting confused about a lot of

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:30.340
items in the game like moldy bread and

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.720
halitosis you've seen the side-by-side

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.400
shots those don't look that similar

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.520
that's my brain being like a little

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:39.639
weird in that department but buddy in a

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:42.340
box and moving box are the same freaking

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:47.169
icon side-by-side you're like okay there

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:48.639
are differences but come on I get it you

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:51.070
know it's a box how many different ways

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:53.470
can you draw a cardboard box right but

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:56.620
we have the cardboard box buddy in a box

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:59.410
and the moving box we need to institute

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.610
like slightly different visuals for

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.979
those if we're going to get mad at

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.479
people for for getting them confused

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:07.930
from time to time it's just a

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:11.110
complicated situation in terms of that

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:14.280
so we did spend like other damage

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:18.220
upgrades worth of damage do you think

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:21.880
can it be up here it could be up here

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:26.440
the second secret room that is I doubt

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:28.930
it's down here yeah let's just leave but

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:31.350
I digress you know cuz I doubt anybody's

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:34.389
working on that to be honest with you

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:37.270
this is a lot a lot of items that very

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:44.440
similar visuals is all I'm sad get it

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:48.099
you know so it's like a sprite hoarder

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.840
sort of situation you're like oh we

00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:51.340
don't throw out that sprite if we just

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.650
put another coat of paint on that it

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.120
could be worthwhile but and for the most

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:57.370
part it doesn't bother me except what

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.440
I'm trying to it there's actually

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.550
exactly one situation which is bother it

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.500
bothers me and that's when I trying to

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.419
buy buddy in a box because I would like

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.010
a familiar and instead I end up getting

00:08:04.419 --> 00:08:10.830
moving box which is like a chore that

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:15.970
can sometimes pay dividends evil eye is

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:17.229
totally fine I mean it how you know what

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.810
we shouldn't I was going to say I'm

00:08:17.229 --> 00:08:22.169
going to try and like buy the card see

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:24.940
what the card has for us but with them

00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:27.370
money equals power we probably should be

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:32.329
a little bit more conservative about

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:35.389
things all admit I'll admit

00:08:32.329 --> 00:08:37.669
I don't know this run seems like it's

00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:38.989
it's going just fine although we found

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:41.539
ourselves in that same situation on the

00:08:38.989 --> 00:08:45.619
last run as well I'll have you know by

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:47.989
the way look I'm not saying all heroes

00:08:45.619 --> 00:08:52.489
don't wear capes but I could be watching

00:08:47.989 --> 00:08:57.679
the NHL draft right now aka one of the

00:08:52.489 --> 00:08:59.779
most boring sporting related programs in

00:08:57.679 --> 00:09:01.910
Earth's history but dude you never know

00:08:59.779 --> 00:09:04.579
we could be witnessing the selection of

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:06.939
the next Sidney Crosby or the next

00:09:04.579 --> 00:09:10.009
Patrick white you know they're both

00:09:06.939 --> 00:09:12.019
superstars in their own unique way okay

00:09:10.009 --> 00:09:16.910
I'm gonna need you to stop trapping me

00:09:12.019 --> 00:09:19.129
in the corner here ideally I'm joking of

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:23.089
course I mean I have watched the NHL

00:09:19.129 --> 00:09:25.009
draft on on many occasions I always

00:09:23.089 --> 00:09:27.139
every year is it by the way if for some

00:09:25.009 --> 00:09:29.389
reason this is a foreign concept I don't

00:09:27.139 --> 00:09:30.920
know if it's done in every other sport

00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:33.350
but I know it's done in most Western

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:35.540
sports or most most sports in North

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:37.009
America let's say Western is a strange

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:40.459
term to use in that situation and I

00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:42.949
don't fully understand it's like when

00:09:40.459 --> 00:09:44.899
players reach a certain age everybody

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:46.279
born in that age group or within that

00:09:44.899 --> 00:09:47.989
age group is a chance to be selected by

00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:49.549
a professional team with the better

00:09:47.989 --> 00:09:50.660
players or the players who are presumed

00:09:49.549 --> 00:09:53.119
to be better going first

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:56.209
so you know we basically just watch for

00:09:53.119 --> 00:09:57.230
like eight hours well like old men are

00:09:56.209 --> 00:10:00.019
increasingly brought up to the

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:03.949
microphone with the fifth selection in

00:10:00.019 --> 00:10:06.949
the 2017 NHL draft the Vancouver Canucks

00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:08.749
select colemak are colemak are and then

00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:11.360
there's like polite golf claps and then

00:10:08.749 --> 00:10:13.819
this kid comes up and he goes like you

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.290
know I'm from the Finnish countryside

00:10:13.819 --> 00:10:19.179
I've never heard of Vancouver do they

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:22.279
have saunas there nothing personal kid

00:10:19.179 --> 00:10:24.350
they do not they do have saunas here and

00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:26.689
I'm assuming at least I've never been to

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:28.549
one myself but assuming it happens he

00:10:26.689 --> 00:10:32.600
can get a definitely Korean style saunas

00:10:28.549 --> 00:10:35.439
without a doubt but anyway I'm I've

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:39.499
watched it many a time in my life and

00:10:35.439 --> 00:10:42.350
pretty much always been like bored out

00:10:39.499 --> 00:10:44.760
of my mind despite actually I wouldn't

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:47.190
say I'm a hockey superfan but I'm a

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.020
I'm an educated hockey fan I keep myself

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:51.630
abreast of the prospect pool situation

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:53.040
and you know development and to name a

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.630
couple of people in the vancouver

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.100
canucks administration beyond the head

00:10:54.630 --> 00:11:01.320
coach and general manager I'm just

00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:04.590
saying it's not the most exciting event

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:07.530
in sporting history but I'm here

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:09.510
selflessly doing my job

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:13.050
instead of taking time off to watch

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:14.760
something I don't like that much and you

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:19.040
know what I am saying all heroes don't

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:23.070
wear capes or not all heroes wear capes

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:24.510
in fact there's quite a lot of heroes

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:28.050
that don't wear capes a it's a strange

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:29.880
expression to begin with spider-man

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:31.530
doesn't wear a cape that's the most

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.700
obvious example I think of not all

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:34.800
heroes wear capes you ever seen

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:38.970
spider-man sure Doctor Strange wears a

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:40.890
cape Superman and Batman wear capes the

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:44.100
concept of a capes to begin with is like

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:47.550
is that like kind of a back fedora at

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:55.500
least in real life but in a superhero

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:58.830
context no problem I suppose dude I need

00:11:55.500 --> 00:12:01.650
something more on this run ooh I kind of

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:05.960
like this especially against Bighorn are

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:08.190
you we got double active item effect

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.200
which apparently when you double the

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:13.350
sprinkler of one sprinkler times two

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:17.910
equals one sprinkler as news to me man

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:20.220
is news to me we have no deal with the

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:24.630
devil president so I mean we have no

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:26.340
bombs as well I would love to see a deal

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:28.940
with the angel but I would you know 8:00

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.940
to watch you leave

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:33.450
Enel are you just distracting us from

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.830
the fact that you can't think of a

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:38.070
second hero that doesn't wear a cape

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:39.960
look I didn't come here to be grilled I

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.790
came here to brag about not watching the

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.440
NHL draft and then to get my brownie

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:46.700
points for it twitch.tv slash

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.700
northernlion slash subscribe

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:52.370
soare wears a cape black widow does not

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:56.180
wear a cape there you go

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:59.270
Captain America sometimes wears a cape I

00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:00.500
don't know I'm speaking specifically

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:03.670
from a Marvel Cinematic Universe

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.670
standpoint here

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:12.590
Captain America sometimes wears a cape

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:13.330
I believe I'm thinking back to the The

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:18.290
Avengers

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:19.730
Super Nintendo game as well I think

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:23.680
capes are just going out of style

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:27.890
because it's not like the 1700s anymore

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:29.660
you know of course I'm not I'm not

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:30.860
making fun of these people but it's

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.540
going to be hard for me to relay the

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.250
story without it seeming like I'm making

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:36.920
fun of these people there's a couple

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:38.570
that lives in and I genuinely am like

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:41.660
dude as long as what you're doing does

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:44.300
not harm me I do not care at all and I

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:46.730
could not be more literal with my

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.960
application of that as long as what

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:50.660
you're doing does not harm other people

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:52.340
but at the same time to some extent my

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:54.170
brand is making fun of things that are

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:55.130
socially a little strange despite doing

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:57.050
a few of them myself

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:58.940
although definitely not this one so I

00:13:57.050 --> 00:14:01.010
reserve the right to make fun of this to

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:03.950
some extent I think with the notion that

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:06.680
it's also good natured there is a couple

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:08.780
in Washington state I believe it's

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:12.320
Washington State anyway that live their

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:17.780
lives as if it's the Victorian era which

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:21.980
first off why on a logical level that is

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:24.580
actually borderline idiotic and I'm not

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:28.010
trying to be offensive here but like

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:30.950
never heard of like the Spanish flu oh

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:33.650
dude that was my hermit card I think I'm

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:35.720
just going to bounce wiped out like you

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:38.300
know 8% of the world's population

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:39.980
nobody freakin washed their hands you

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.810
know that's just a microcosm sure okay

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:45.050
some things were better in the Victorian

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:47.780
era I'm sure but you know explain to me

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:50.660
what in 500 words or less but they went

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:53.090
to they went to Victoria British

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:54.980
Columbia which is super close to upstate

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:56.600
Washington New York or Washington I'm

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.580
State Washington New York you see I'm a

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.390
very learn at individual I went to the

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.450
University of

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:03.980
in New York maybe you heard of it now

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:07.220
it's very close to like the northern

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:09.500
part of Washington State and it's you

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.550
know a city of a certain size so there's

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.960
stuff to do there there's a place called

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:14.440
butchered Gardens which is like a

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:16.820
botanical garden that's probably

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:19.100
Victoria's number one tourist thing and

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:21.950
they were wearing like their Victorian

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:24.020
era clothes by the way the reason this

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:25.490
became a thing is because despite living

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:27.560
as if it's the Victorian era they also

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:29.450
run a blog about what it's like to live

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:33.190
as if you're in the Victorian era which

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:36.950
seems to me a very convenient compromise

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:38.140
it's like oh yeah I live as if it's the

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:41.600
1900s

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:45.050
in every aspect of my life except I do

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.530
also run a blog that has advertisements

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.780
on it

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:49.160
luckily they I assume that they don't

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.720
use the internet for anything else so

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.120
they shouldn't be able to understand

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.140
that this articles coming to pass now

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.000
this is where I find out they have

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:58.790
Twitter accounts with like triple my

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.470
followers or something but anyway so

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:02.000
it's kind of like a monetizable thing

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:03.080
for them which is fine you know I'm not

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.880
going to I'm not going to hate on your

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.110
internet household look at me here

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.210
playing Isaac instead of watching the

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:11.240
NHL draft but the point that I'm trying

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:16.580
to make here they went to butchered

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:19.970
Gardens dressed as if it's a 1900s oh so

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:22.220
theoretically worth it and butchered

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:25.760
Gardens was like you can't come in here

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:28.580
you dress like weirdos and then they

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:30.490
were like well that's very you know

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:33.350
offensive of you to suggest and they

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:34.940
were like acting as if it was

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:38.230
discrimination and you know why here's

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:41.480
the twist and the story to an extent I

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:43.280
sort of agree with them I understand the

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:45.350
business arrangement from butchered

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.580
Gardens there is a dress code to some

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:50.090
extent like you can't just show up

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:52.070
wearing no shirt and you can't just show

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:53.840
up you know you probably can't show up

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:56.150
an assured that says like you know

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:59.360
something super offensive or racist or

00:16:56.150 --> 00:17:01.490
something on it I believe that they

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:03.830
would reserve their right to deny you

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:07.310
access to the establishment but in this

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:10.370
case do I think that these guys are a

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:11.449
couple of you know granola bars I don't

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:12.689
know what that's supposed to mean I

00:17:11.449 --> 00:17:16.199
think that they're acting

00:17:12.689 --> 00:17:19.589
strange absolutely I don't know it does

00:17:16.199 --> 00:17:20.879
seem to be a little bit outrageous to

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:23.159
suggest I agree it would be a

00:17:20.879 --> 00:17:24.959
distraction to patrons but you know if

00:17:23.159 --> 00:17:28.679
you're going to but a Botanical Garden

00:17:24.959 --> 00:17:33.840
you know look at this Sud it's an azalea

00:17:28.679 --> 00:17:35.460
from the 19th Oh strata of the Holocene

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.779
epoch you know it doesn't matter it was

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:39.629
what I'm trying to suggest because it's

00:17:36.779 --> 00:17:42.210
stupid plants but no no what I'm trying

00:17:39.629 --> 00:17:45.029
to suggest is that who cares they're

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:46.259
dressed a little funny I really went

00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:48.269
into this bit thinking I was going to

00:17:46.259 --> 00:17:51.389
rail on these people but it just seems

00:17:48.269 --> 00:17:53.039
like punching down to some extent for

00:17:51.389 --> 00:17:54.059
for butchered Gardens to be like you're

00:17:53.039 --> 00:17:55.710
not allowed in here

00:17:54.059 --> 00:18:00.149
but that's maybe it's because that's

00:17:55.710 --> 00:18:07.350
also my anxiety sometimes like Kate and

00:18:00.149 --> 00:18:09.899
I Kate is stylish genuinely and it would

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:11.250
like when she dresses up she dresses up

00:18:09.899 --> 00:18:12.720
I don't really dress up on my okay I

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:15.330
take off the hoodie put on a button-up

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:16.289
shirt still only got sneakers I'm not

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.940
going to get my dress shoes out of

00:18:16.289 --> 00:18:20.429
storage unless it's for like a special

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:24.179
event it's not like I have this like you

00:18:20.429 --> 00:18:25.769
know Steve Jobs I only wear one outfit

00:18:24.179 --> 00:18:27.509
sort of thing going on for productivity

00:18:25.769 --> 00:18:29.820
sake it's really just laziness and

00:18:27.509 --> 00:18:31.559
comfort which I you know treat those

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:33.659
very important values in my life to be

00:18:31.559 --> 00:18:37.019
honest more so comfort than laziness but

00:18:33.659 --> 00:18:39.419
anyway so sometimes we'll be going

00:18:37.019 --> 00:18:42.750
someplace fancy and I'll be wearing like

00:18:39.419 --> 00:18:44.730
a button-up shirt and jeans and I'm like

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:46.730
I really it would be embarrassing if

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:48.779
they were like you can't come in here

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:50.190
wearing that like you got to put on a

00:18:48.779 --> 00:18:53.250
suit jacket but I don't know that sort

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:55.440
of thing happens that much anymore I've

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:57.330
never been denied access to an

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.309
establishment for my dress I guess is

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:01.639
what I'm trying to say for the way I was

00:18:59.309 --> 00:19:01.639
dressed

00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:08.720
I think let's go with counterfeit penny

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.340
that probably allows us to buy more

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:13.190
stuff and let's use our bombs to

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:15.139
actually stack up our damage here by

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:17.269
blowing our donation machine up which I

00:19:15.139 --> 00:19:18.950
feel like no guilts about trying to make

00:19:17.269 --> 00:19:21.769
our donation machine pop at this point

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:23.509
cuz we got it back to 999 so I don't

00:19:21.769 --> 00:19:25.970
know I guess I'm interested to see how

00:19:23.509 --> 00:19:28.850
other people feel about the the

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:31.190
situation as well because although I

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:33.499
think that they're very strange

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:37.220
adherence to a Victorian era of life is

00:19:33.499 --> 00:19:40.429
a little silly I think for three cents I

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.899
will basically for three cents we're

00:19:40.429 --> 00:19:46.480
going to get a value of five cents or

00:19:41.899 --> 00:19:49.610
more so yeah I feel okay about that I

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:50.450
think that it's it's strange it's very

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:54.649
strange to me

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:58.700
I see no I don't know why you'd want to

00:19:54.649 --> 00:20:03.580
you know wash your clothes in a freaking

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:06.320
wooden barrel with a wash a washboard

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:08.269
instead of using a washing machine I

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.879
mean it seems very strange to me to deny

00:20:08.269 --> 00:20:12.230
that level of human convenience but at

00:20:10.879 --> 00:20:14.269
the same time I think that is your right

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:18.529
and admittedly when you start pushing

00:20:14.269 --> 00:20:20.149
that as a message outwardly with your

00:20:18.529 --> 00:20:22.369
with your dress I suppose you are open

00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:24.740
to judgment to some extent but I'm just

00:20:22.369 --> 00:20:26.749
saying if I was manning the ticket booth

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.200
or if I was the management it all that

00:20:26.749 --> 00:20:28.909
sucked

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:32.240
in charge of butchered guards that day I

00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:37.190
probably would have said let them in it

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:40.519
just seems like a petty thing to be to

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:42.049
be up in arms about I do want to ask

00:20:40.519 --> 00:20:44.029
them some questions though about the

00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:46.009
whole we live as if it's the Victorian

00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:47.779
era but we also have a blog because I

00:20:46.009 --> 00:20:49.369
got there's there's something to tease

00:20:47.779 --> 00:20:53.059
out there I also want to know more about

00:20:49.369 --> 00:20:54.619
why the Victorian era but let's be

00:20:53.059 --> 00:20:59.179
honest I'm probably not the right kind

00:20:54.619 --> 00:21:02.960
of guy to treat this with respect given

00:20:59.179 --> 00:21:05.379
given my track record on the NL SS it's

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:07.789
the same thing like there are people who

00:21:05.379 --> 00:21:09.409
dress off

00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:12.559
pretty bad there's people who dress up

00:21:09.409 --> 00:21:16.299
in like steampunk clothes all the time

00:21:12.559 --> 00:21:19.299
and like I don't get it

00:21:16.299 --> 00:21:22.009
I'm not actively against it but like

00:21:19.299 --> 00:21:23.960
whatever you run think that's Excel if

00:21:22.009 --> 00:21:26.720
we've been to both item rooms I actually

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:29.419
have no recollection whatsoever we've

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:31.009
definitely been to the shop but I think

00:21:29.419 --> 00:21:35.479
I'm just going to go because I have no

00:21:31.009 --> 00:21:36.259
idea the other let's get out of here

00:21:35.479 --> 00:21:40.009
this is weird

00:21:36.259 --> 00:21:43.729
um but like if you wore a top hat and

00:21:40.009 --> 00:21:45.649
some you know a weird set of monocles or

00:21:43.729 --> 00:21:47.509
something like that out to the Botanical

00:21:45.649 --> 00:21:49.279
Gardens whose business is mine is it of

00:21:47.509 --> 00:21:52.609
mine or it sorry what business is it of

00:21:49.279 --> 00:21:53.840
mine is what I mean to suggest it's it

00:21:52.609 --> 00:21:55.609
just seems like a little bit of pearl

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:58.629
clutching to me now if you're wearing a

00:21:55.609 --> 00:22:01.129
shirt that says like I don't know I

00:21:58.629 --> 00:22:02.690
don't even want to suggest the kind of

00:22:01.129 --> 00:22:05.779
vile thing that I was going to suggest

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:06.249
but something hateful yeah I understand

00:22:05.779 --> 00:22:08.779
that

00:22:06.249 --> 00:22:10.249
this is not thank theps Excel it's just

00:22:08.779 --> 00:22:14.450
ink that's one your brain is broken

00:22:10.249 --> 00:22:16.519
right now at least we've got um at least

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:18.470
we've got devil precedent so we can

00:22:16.519 --> 00:22:21.470
stand to get a little over the top soon

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:23.299
hopefully anyway I digress I think I've

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:26.899
come across sort of more milquetoast

00:22:23.299 --> 00:22:29.239
than I expected in this in this example

00:22:26.899 --> 00:22:31.700
I'm kind of on their side in that

00:22:29.239 --> 00:22:33.379
example in that specific example alone

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:35.840
because for the most part I'm like

00:22:33.379 --> 00:22:39.710
that's mad weird but don't let me stop

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:41.509
you I hope also those this is not one of

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:44.179
those things where I kind of come in

00:22:41.509 --> 00:22:45.710
support of them and then later you're

00:22:44.179 --> 00:22:47.859
like hey here's an awful thing that they

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:53.299
said or did and then you're like oh

00:22:47.859 --> 00:22:55.279
right that happens but in this specific

00:22:53.299 --> 00:22:57.229
situation even if they do have some

00:22:55.279 --> 00:22:59.029
antiquated in archaic beliefs I still

00:22:57.229 --> 00:23:01.460
think unless they were outwardly

00:22:59.029 --> 00:23:03.229
offending patrons with their appearance

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:04.639
on a reasonable level they should have

00:23:03.229 --> 00:23:07.309
been allowed to go to the establishment

00:23:04.639 --> 00:23:10.070
but also it is kind of funny that's it's

00:23:07.309 --> 00:23:16.070
a funny injustice which is maybe not the

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:17.389
the most you know sympathetic way to

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:19.220
phrase something but you get the idea

00:23:17.389 --> 00:23:21.170
you're like yeah I mean they were in the

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:24.500
wrong but also sort of would you

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:26.390
Specht what I'm getting at is that if

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.890
you sympathize with me for any point

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:30.410
during this conversation what I've now

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:34.720
done is just eroded that sympathy I'm

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:42.470
gonna say symfony it is an arrow did

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:44.870
Symphony is life that's basically the

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:48.740
gist of it that's that's the bit that I

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:52.360
had built at run-time here ooh I do like

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:57.070
golden bombs older than the Bible

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:57.070
certainly Golder than the Bible as well

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:02.690
at least most of the ones that I've seen

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:04.930
I don't have much biblical experience

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:07.700
that will not surprise you at all

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:11.990
my biblical my most recent biblical

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:17.140
experiences at least are I keep parents

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:19.340
are like a little religious they go to

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:20.870
they go to church and then they go to a

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:23.020
Korean Christian Church but I don't know

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:25.190
they go like every Sunday but there's a

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:27.460
important holiday in the Korean calendar

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:30.140
well we know that's moving box called

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:34.160
Chuseok which is basically like it's not

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:35.810
you suck that's that's offensive which

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.590
is why I fell on the grenade of saying

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:38.890
it

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:41.180
no but it's called Chuseok which is like

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:43.550
American Thanksgiving sort of but it's

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.930
also a time to honor you you eat a lot

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:48.350
of good food but you also honor your

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:50.630
ancestors that have passed away so it's

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:53.450
like probably the biggest holiday in the

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:55.010
Korean calendar next to maybe even ahead

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:57.860
of Seoul now which is like Lunar New

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:59.600
Year but I know we spent a lot of money

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:03.680
there we got a lot of value so I'm happy

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:07.070
the way that that went down and when I

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:08.360
go there you know it's it's a little bit

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:12.590
of a culture shock like they have

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:15.710
pictures of their parents who are

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:20.650
deceased up on like the dinner table and

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:20.650
you kind of like eat you you like pour

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:26.360
so do maybe I can't remember what it was

00:25:23.809 --> 00:25:28.429
you poorly might have been tea and I

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:31.549
think about it you pour like food and

00:25:28.429 --> 00:25:33.140
drink for the ancestors and I'm just

00:25:31.549 --> 00:25:35.750
kind of sitting there like this is I

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:37.880
feel like I'm intruding on uh on

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:39.679
something that I shouldn't be here for

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:42.650
but they're very like inclusive about it

00:25:39.679 --> 00:25:45.110
which is nice and very nice of them to

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:47.240
do of course but it's just it's so

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:48.950
foreign from like my the way that my

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.270
family does things that it really feels

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:52.400
like I'm there as like some kind of

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:55.760
undercover journalist or something and

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:57.350
then they sing hymns and they're in fact

00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:00.740
they're accommodating to the point of it

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:02.299
being like awkward for me to some extent

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:04.780
which is not about me

00:26:02.299 --> 00:26:07.220
is it's their day I'm just saying

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:08.960
because they'll sing the hymns in Korean

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:12.020
and then they'll sing them again in

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:14.419
English and I don't sing either time so

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:17.419
I'm like you really don't have to do

00:26:14.419 --> 00:26:19.280
that just just singing in whatever

00:26:17.419 --> 00:26:20.919
language you prefer and we'd be good to

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:25.220
go

00:26:20.919 --> 00:26:29.390
but I do appreciate being so don't don't

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:32.179
take my my listing of it as kind of

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:35.809
strange my describing of it is kind of

00:26:32.179 --> 00:26:39.440
strange to be a negative thing it's

00:26:35.809 --> 00:26:40.880
extremley beyond thrilled that they've

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:46.220
welcomed to me into their family like

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:48.080
that at the same time it is it sometimes

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:51.590
a bizarre event so I'm going to go like

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:53.419
it I'm gonna go ham here basically I'm

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:54.580
very frightened about the way that this

00:26:53.419 --> 00:26:58.370
looks

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:59.450
we took piercing shots and we took demon

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:01.549
baby because if we're going to take

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:03.320
piercing shots we basically get demon

00:27:01.549 --> 00:27:05.299
baby for free so I would rather have it

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:08.809
now we have Bob's brain as well which is

00:27:05.299 --> 00:27:11.120
very scary to me we're not going to die

00:27:08.809 --> 00:27:15.980
in one hit but we can pretty easily die

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:17.929
in two hits also feels so valuable here

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:19.460
so what is this card I've been holding

00:27:17.929 --> 00:27:21.919
on to strength strength is actually a

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:23.630
very important card as well you can use

00:27:21.919 --> 00:27:26.780
that for survival but more likely for a

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:29.179
deal with the devil access later really

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:30.740
wish I had not come to this room but we

00:27:29.179 --> 00:27:33.049
managed to make it out I think we're

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:34.279
going to be fine provided we get out of

00:27:33.049 --> 00:27:36.830
this floor in a good spot

00:27:34.279 --> 00:27:39.469
I think we're going to be okay this

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:40.700
feels like obviously the exit here might

00:27:39.469 --> 00:27:41.929
be a good time to get rid of sprinkler

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.999
but honestly I'm still waiting for it to

00:27:41.929 --> 00:27:46.099
pop out of control we haven't quite hit

00:27:43.999 --> 00:27:49.899
that level yet I won like much faster

00:27:46.099 --> 00:27:54.739
rate of fire and good tear effects and

00:27:49.899 --> 00:27:56.239
cough cough burns down as well but we're

00:27:54.739 --> 00:27:57.649
going to get Cuba meat instead we don't

00:27:56.239 --> 00:27:59.809
have there's options despite buying like

00:27:57.649 --> 00:28:02.029
a lot on the last floor so this floor

00:27:59.809 --> 00:28:03.649
has been insanely good to us the problem

00:28:02.029 --> 00:28:07.669
is that it can look as good as they want

00:28:03.649 --> 00:28:10.279
but if we if we get hit we're going to

00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:11.839
be in a tight spot although balls of

00:28:10.279 --> 00:28:14.239
steel saved us a lot of that indignity

00:28:11.839 --> 00:28:15.710
so I think maybe we're probably fine but

00:28:14.239 --> 00:28:18.710
we're going to move onwards nonetheless

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:22.759
and and do so with caution because I'm a

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:24.950
little scared here you should also take

00:28:22.759 --> 00:28:28.369
it from me like I'm uncomfortable at my

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:31.609
own family gatherings not like my close

00:28:28.369 --> 00:28:36.679
family like me and my parents totally

00:28:31.609 --> 00:28:38.779
fine no concerns but I'd like extended

00:28:36.679 --> 00:28:41.239
family gatherings I'm uncomfortable and

00:28:38.779 --> 00:28:43.009
I say this not to act like it's the

00:28:41.239 --> 00:28:45.830
right way of doing things if anything I

00:28:43.009 --> 00:28:47.989
think it's a personal flaw that I can't

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:50.599
I don't find it easy at least to like

00:28:47.989 --> 00:28:53.719
open myself up to people who I'm related

00:28:50.599 --> 00:28:55.549
to although really we don't hang out

00:28:53.719 --> 00:28:57.139
socially much beyond the you know

00:28:55.549 --> 00:29:00.229
Christmas Easter and Canadian

00:28:57.139 --> 00:29:02.779
Thanksgiving but anyway like it opening

00:29:00.229 --> 00:29:06.169
especially as I got like to my teenage

00:29:02.779 --> 00:29:07.849
years opening Christmas presents not

00:29:06.169 --> 00:29:09.559
really complaining but opening Christmas

00:29:07.849 --> 00:29:12.379
presents from people that you see like

00:29:09.559 --> 00:29:15.139
twice a year and you're like you didn't

00:29:12.379 --> 00:29:18.999
have to fly me this this is just weird

00:29:15.139 --> 00:29:24.469
you are you know you're like my dad's

00:29:18.999 --> 00:29:26.330
brothers third child we never we have

00:29:24.469 --> 00:29:28.609
like a ten-year age difference between

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:31.219
us and we never talk

00:29:28.609 --> 00:29:33.169
we don't can we stop the charade of

00:29:31.219 --> 00:29:34.609
buying each other gifts that we just

00:29:33.169 --> 00:29:36.669
asked someone to give us a

00:29:34.609 --> 00:29:40.009
recommendation for what you want is like

00:29:36.669 --> 00:29:42.320
we don't it's not the Stone Age family

00:29:40.009 --> 00:29:44.359
is very important I think you know if

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:46.840
you've got a great family that's awesome

00:29:44.359 --> 00:29:48.490
I'm very happy with my family

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:52.840
like even my extended family they're not

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:56.110
bad people we just don't we're not

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:58.179
necessarily friends like I consider

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:59.919
myself basically appear to my parents at

00:29:58.179 --> 00:30:01.779
this point which is like the most

00:29:59.919 --> 00:30:04.450
robotic and awkward way to phrase that

00:30:01.779 --> 00:30:05.830
but like we're adults and we can hang

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:06.639
out and have fun together and that's

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:08.740
super cool

00:30:06.639 --> 00:30:10.990
you know I'm extremely grateful for that

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:12.570
but like you know the cousins in my

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:16.990
extended family we're not really like

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:18.700
we're not kindred spirits right so we

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:20.710
it's not the Stone Age I don't have to

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:22.749
rely on you to bring me grapes and then

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:24.399
you give me a bushel of grapes and I

00:30:22.749 --> 00:30:26.139
give you you know some peanuts

00:30:24.399 --> 00:30:29.440
from my peanut fields or something like

00:30:26.139 --> 00:30:30.909
that we can all exist and you know keep

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:34.059
in touch but at the same time we don't

00:30:30.909 --> 00:30:35.590
have to exchange the gifts that's it's a

00:30:34.059 --> 00:30:38.409
tradition but it makes no sense to me

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:39.730
we're just waste I would rather that the

00:30:38.409 --> 00:30:41.950
people buying the gifts instead of

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:42.940
spending like the hour something that it

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:44.649
might take to go out and get it just

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:47.679
spend time with your own close family

00:30:44.649 --> 00:30:49.149
and you know grow closer to them that'll

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:51.429
pay more dividends in the end and like

00:30:49.149 --> 00:30:56.740
oh I gotta buy this guy haven't seen in

00:30:51.429 --> 00:30:58.690
two years a gift you know but as I've

00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:00.639
gotten older I'm not really complaining

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:02.559
because we've sort of stopped buying

00:31:00.639 --> 00:31:05.440
gifts for my extended family which is

00:31:02.559 --> 00:31:07.059
nice but only because we're in this

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:11.039
weird like all my cousins and I are

00:31:07.059 --> 00:31:11.039
within like 10 years of each other's age

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:18.460
which is good because we grew up like

00:31:14.619 --> 00:31:23.429
being almost peers but we've entered the

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:26.259
phase in which the whole family are all

00:31:23.429 --> 00:31:29.200
adults so right now is the luxurious

00:31:26.259 --> 00:31:31.749
period where we go we should or beyond

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:33.639
buying gifts for each other we don't

00:31:31.749 --> 00:31:35.889
need to buy each other gifts we're all

00:31:33.639 --> 00:31:37.659
adults here we've all got jobs you know

00:31:35.889 --> 00:31:39.429
let's just enjoy our each other's

00:31:37.659 --> 00:31:43.480
company and that's great it's been fun

00:31:39.429 --> 00:31:45.789
but any year now we're going to show up

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:48.429
to the Christmas dinner and someone's

00:31:45.789 --> 00:31:51.129
going to be like I'm pregnant and then

00:31:48.429 --> 00:31:53.619
we've introduced one child into the

00:31:51.129 --> 00:31:56.169
Christmas atmosphere and then you gotta

00:31:53.619 --> 00:31:58.960
buy like your first niece and nephew

00:31:56.169 --> 00:32:01.299
gift your cousin just had a baby you

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.799
know you can give them a $30 gift you

00:32:01.299 --> 00:32:04.809
know this they give two hours of sleep

00:32:02.799 --> 00:32:06.129
at night it's only fair and then you

00:32:04.809 --> 00:32:07.539
give the first child because you got to

00:32:06.129 --> 00:32:10.059
give every child that gets them and

00:32:07.539 --> 00:32:11.889
every child has to give you know get

00:32:10.059 --> 00:32:15.009
ready to give gifts to that their own

00:32:11.889 --> 00:32:16.809
cousins later in life existences I'm

00:32:15.009 --> 00:32:23.200
enjoying the lull I guess is what I'm

00:32:16.809 --> 00:32:26.200
trying to say you died but you weren't

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:33.609
even on the screen I I actually don't

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:35.529
know what happened there and you might

00:32:33.609 --> 00:32:36.549
think I love that we have the mind here

00:32:35.529 --> 00:32:38.889
by the way you might think that I'm

00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:41.070
saying this in an effort to come across

00:32:38.889 --> 00:32:45.039
a superior like oh oh I don't need

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:47.619
tangible uh you know material

00:32:45.039 --> 00:32:49.749
possessions mean nothing to me rather

00:32:47.619 --> 00:32:51.489
I'm bringing this up because it's

00:32:49.749 --> 00:32:52.960
awkward for me to get gifts because I

00:32:51.489 --> 00:32:54.519
find it difficult to be sincerely

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.859
emotional around people I'm not that

00:32:54.519 --> 00:32:58.600
comfortable with so - and I'm not saying

00:32:56.859 --> 00:33:00.580
sincerely emotional like crying but even

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:02.350
just sincerely pulling back the veil of

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:04.090
millennial irony and going thank you

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:04.899
this is a gift I'll genuinely use and I

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:06.909
appreciate it

00:33:04.899 --> 00:33:09.309
makes me feel uncomfortable I don't know

00:33:06.909 --> 00:33:11.320
why there's a there's a hole I doubt

00:33:09.309 --> 00:33:13.869
it's unique to me but there's a whole

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:18.609
you know dissertation to write on this

00:33:13.869 --> 00:33:22.330
I'm sure this phenomenon but I do I find

00:33:18.609 --> 00:33:26.279
it difficult to be to be genuine with

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:26.279
with with people that I'm not close to

00:33:26.409 --> 00:33:32.289
very strange and it look a little sad

00:33:29.799 --> 00:33:34.509
more melancholic than anything else but

00:33:32.289 --> 00:33:36.370
that's why I like the gift-giving and

00:33:34.509 --> 00:33:39.070
well the gift-giving is also a little

00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:41.440
awkward because I put myself in the gift

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:43.299
receiver shoes and go well I would be

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.620
awkward receiving this right now so I

00:33:43.299 --> 00:33:46.389
think that they might be a little

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:47.799
awkward receiving this and then we're

00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:48.970
both like they'd like they're like thank

00:33:47.799 --> 00:33:50.019
you I really like it and I'm like oh you

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:51.850
didn't have to say that no like no

00:33:50.019 --> 00:33:53.139
really I do it you know you know it's

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:54.880
okay you know you don't have to say that

00:33:53.139 --> 00:33:56.769
but you know we just wordlessly

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:58.629
exchanged like three nods and we're like

00:33:56.769 --> 00:34:00.269
our contract is complete for this year

00:33:58.629 --> 00:34:03.340
see you next year

00:34:00.269 --> 00:34:06.330
fellow weirdo you know how does

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:11.950
sprinkler Ludo work the answer is it

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:14.079
doesn't okay dude unsung hero balls of

00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:18.669
steel without balls of steel we probably

00:34:14.079 --> 00:34:20.679
die and we probably die Wow pyromaniac I

00:34:18.669 --> 00:34:25.109
forgot we probably would have died way

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:28.470
earlier than where we are right now so

00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:32.069
thank you for giving me the ability to

00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:34.599
talk a lot of nonsense in this episode

00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:37.089
balls of steel because we're not for you

00:34:34.599 --> 00:34:39.129
I think we would be in a much scarier

00:34:37.089 --> 00:34:43.200
position so thank you so much for your

00:34:39.129 --> 00:34:46.300
service helps me out an enormous amount

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:51.190
see I can be more genuine to a line of

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:52.720
code in this game mimic the other thing

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:56.349
is that if I if I was honest when I

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:58.060
received gifts about the level of use it

00:34:56.349 --> 00:35:01.750
would reveal too much about my lifestyle

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:03.010
like if somebody gave me socks I would

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:04.930
be like you don't understand this is the

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:06.690
greatest gift I could considerably ever

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:09.609
receive because I would never

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:11.530
deliberately ghost sock shopping for

00:35:09.609 --> 00:35:14.140
myself really the only opportunity I

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:15.490
would ever have to buy socks

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:17.560
apart from this would be if I was

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:20.200
somehow in a Sears which is now going

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:22.119
out of business in Canada and was like

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:26.020
you know well we're here I should get

00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:28.270
some socks so you have saved me not

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:29.800
necessarily from sock shopping but more

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:31.599
likely from being in a position where I

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:33.430
open up my hamper and go there's no

00:35:31.599 --> 00:35:35.320
socks and then I got a like piece

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:37.180
together to unmatched ones or something

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:40.630
like that so when a way you have enabled

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:43.000
my sub-optimal domestic existence from a

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:44.710
laundry standpoint to go onwards and for

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.060
that I sincerely appreciate your gift

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:47.020
but hey for now thanks for watching hope
