##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.400
everybody welcome back to know the line

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.650
please binding mascara the plus we've

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.540
lost I thought we lost last run it was

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.160
in greedier maybe that doesn't count for

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.599
some reason but why wouldn't it that

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.039
doesn't make sense anyway

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:24.090
mega Satan's pretty much all around

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:26.189
negative negative hush delirium negative

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.340
hush delirium that's probably like I

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.810
mean obviously as Lilith we've got a lot

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.270
to take care of his evening we actually

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:42.260
have a lot to take care of as well yeah

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:44.789
okay we can do cathedral negative hush

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.520
delirium lots of different options with

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:53.010
Lilith here now I'm no biggie goo fan of

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.000
Lilith overall here Toth gqw for and and

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.829
that's well known I don't need to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.270
retread that old grab but I'm trying to

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.789
learn genuinely I got my thinking cap on

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.320
and I'm trying this was absolutely not

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.400
all big rooms are created equal actually

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.890
you know what I was gonna say this

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.600
wasn't worth using our box of friends

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.869
but now that I see that it's a little

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.939
bit more dense it might well be I'm

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.259
trying to learn you know to maintain to

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.119
be bad at something is okay to maintain

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.409
willful ignorance is a little bit less

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.420
okay I suppose so

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.110
we're gonna try to improve our overall

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.000
performance as Lilith you know by

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.320
whatever means necessary and usually

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.659
that's practice I didn't mean to make it

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.049
sound any more dramatic than that please

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.700
okay that's a bomb this is worth it if

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.710
we end up getting like a spirit heart

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.329
out of a tinted rock somewhat later but

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:48.680
for now kind of a a whiff on my part so

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.909
we're looking for awesome familiars a

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.490
little brim in this item room would be

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.990
like twenty out of ten another Incubus a

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.909
succubus I don't even know if succubus

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.380
is unlock unlimited bombs is pretty

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.649
great

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.079
sack of pennies it might get double done

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.969
box of friends and thus occasionally

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.390
payout with twice as much but like come

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.670
on it's a bit of a pipe dream to be

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.470
honest with you we're not gonna blow up

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.820
absolutely every rock or anything like

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.600
but we'll probably blow up every pot

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.520
that we find we'll probably use bombs

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.030
for combat not really applicable on this

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.620
room but and certainly against a lot of

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.480
these early game bosses you know if

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.210
we're in a kind of a questionable spot

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.740
on offensive capability having the

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.870
ability to shoot unlimited bombs of like

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.240
a hush or a champion Ragman or something

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:41.130
like that is a pretty big bonus

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:47.070
potentially hey big bonus come out and

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:49.110
spam a little bonus with me so I mean

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:58.890
like minecrafters is just not a good

00:02:49.110 --> 00:03:00.420
item unfortunately we will still try to

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.140
make use of these cuz like a single

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.180
quarter is worth a ton minecrafter is

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.040
just basically garbage tier to be honest

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.000
not to be rude but to be honest it's

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.410
it's just no good unlimited bombs you

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.270
can use a once per room I guess but then

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.340
you gotta shoot the TNT and that's what

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.380
really makes it substantially less

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.880
usable than than anything else in that

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.160
same vein like I'd rather have mister

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.420
boom ten times out of ten mostly cuz it

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.480
also gives me an opportunity to go

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.840
mister boom boom boom boom I want you in

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:35.550
my room give me the car battery and we

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.110
will have the better mister there was

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.580
gonna be a double boom joke in there so

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.830
but I couldn't get the Vengaboys like

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:47.489
you to line up quite right dude now that

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:52.230
was a dodge and a half right there so

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:53.850
Cuba me acceptable not an amazing item I

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.280
know what you're saying well if you you

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.910
know give car battery or just like a sec

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.549
a second level cuba meet all of a sudden

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.280
you got a lot of potential you know you

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:07.340
can get a third level meat boy end or

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.000
bandage girl yeah but that's not like

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.860
that good I know you might be thinking

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.410
you go Necronomicon here but I kind of

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.900
disagree just take the guppy item with

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.519
like zero negative consequences

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.440
whatsoever I just we can take the

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.639
Necronomicon but it'll cost us three

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.050
spirit hearts

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:30.120
I'm gonna try this or we could not take

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.639
the Necronomicon and keep three spirit

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.570
arts which strikes me as a much grander

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.990
idea

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.840
so our HP is gonna be amazing we got

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.430
guppy potential out the wazoo sorry I've

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.900
been playing la noir so my diction has

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:48.830
changed a little bit I'm about as sharp

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:53.520
as a bag of wet mice but I got no idea

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:55.410
what our dps holds for us on this no

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.590
idea what our dps holds for us on this

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.760
run right now and neither do you unless

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.990
you've played through the seat already

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.520
in which case you're some kind of like

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.900
Isaac God I mean you were like ball most

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.950
borderline breaking the laws of

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.000
thermodynamics or something so that was

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.610
arguably worth it probably shouldn't

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.250
have taken so much dumb damage we're

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.270
still going to explore just a little bit

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.280
we do want to be out of here by like six

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.890
minutes and it's probably still gonna be

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.780
plausible but we also want to find

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:29.010
tinted rocks should they exist

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:31.110
dude you're too fast I don't like it we

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.970
could make do with a black market no

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:37.530
question that's decent chunk of change

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:39.210
there as well I really have been playing

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.650
la noir if I think five cents is a

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.850
decent chunk of change but in Isaac

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:46.440
terms it actually is okay so stop using

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.970
Cuba meat as recklessly you can still

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.950
use it just don't use it like an idiot

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:53.310
which is what you're doing right now

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.870
no tinted rocks on the whole floor it's

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.120
not like it made golden bombs useless

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.860
they were still excellent but kind of

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.080
hoping for a little bit extra right and

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.479
here I just don't like what we got yeah

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.400
I guess we can go for a reroll maybe

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:08.280
hope for like a 7 cent item dull razor

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.900
can be fun but not really for us shoot

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.100
for 2 of diamonds lucky 2 of diamonds

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.320
didn't get it

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:17.430
we got golden bombs so we really like

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:19.169
might as well car battery would be nice

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.240
there's no conceivable way for us to get

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:25.500
it goodbye a spirit heart but nobody

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:29.970
cares 7 cent battery I'll try that and

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:31.710
also try this it's an ace of clubs donor

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.199
down two down two down

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.820
see it's the ace of spades but instead

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:40.470
of being basis pains it's the ace of

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:45.570
clubs I do want to check this now I can

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:47.130
use some bombs we've only got six let me

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.289
get the five cents it also gave us a

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.479
luck upgrade turn those all into bombs

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:52.680
sure we spend a lot of keys to meet love

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:54.210
we spend our only key to make this

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:58.699
happen but this is still like a good

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.699
deal for us now we're at 16 bombs

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.840
probably as many as we'll need if we're

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.990
being honest for like almost the entire

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.130
run the more golden bombs the merrier I

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.009
would die would kill for some more of

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.330
those but this is shaping up okay the

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:13.830
real dream would be to get the guppy

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.630
transformation don't even need

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.310
essentially anything else after that

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:22.080
point if we can make that come to

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:25.020
fruition the Cuba meet is not to be

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:29.220
trifled with it's a genuine offensive

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:31.560
dynamo but we're still doing base damage

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:35.400
base damage not anything to write home

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:37.409
about unfortunately especially when

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:41.460
we're missing like fully half of our

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:42.960
shots this is what I get for trying to

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.880
take the easy way out though by going to

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:48.389
the the short path instead of going the

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:52.139
big room a bomb and a battery charge so

00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:54.960
at present I would say that our our

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:57.870
battery is not that good but what it

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:00.090
allows us to do is on easy rooms we'd

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:01.620
never have to use the reroll and then on

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:04.380
hard rooms not real sorry the battery

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:06.509
charge and then on hard rooms we can use

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:09.240
a charge which gives us a nice benefit

00:08:06.509 --> 00:08:10.830
while still having another charge left

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.199
over in case too hard rooms get stacked

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:14.759
back-to-back or if a room is like if we

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:16.830
think it's gonna be really really

00:08:14.759 --> 00:08:20.849
difficult then we can use it twice but

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:22.110
that's more of like vas City I think so

00:08:20.849 --> 00:08:23.699
for now I think we use it to mitigate

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:25.110
risk you know we might have eighty easy

00:08:23.699 --> 00:08:28.320
rooms in a row and then two hard ones in

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:29.340
a row in which case we get to save up

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.630
all of our charges

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.250
we don't feel compelled to use them in

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:34.409
garbage situations then we pop them all

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:38.190
off as necessary so it's really just

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:41.579
like risk rollover right now I'm gonna

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:44.659
use this not yet but we're gonna get use

00:08:41.579 --> 00:08:44.659
out of it no question

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:49.040
now the real question becomes what if we

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.990
get 12 easy rooms in a row well at that

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.120
point I think I'm gonna be a little less

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.920
worried about the fact that I'm maybe

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.720
inefficiently using my item and way more

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.250
worried about the fact that you know

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.360
what have I done to deserve getting 12

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:01.340
easy rooms in a row

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.050
you know the runs probably set at that

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:05.180
point so we never should have dodged

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:06.920
like that I got lucky to almost not get

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.840
hit it's a weird statement cuz we did

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.790
get hit in the end but you get the idea

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.380
so let's just go over once more what we

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:14.960
need we'll probably do a light side run

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:17.720
because we need it we could also do hush

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.950
we've already done boss rush mega Satan

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.450
would be nice as well but we took our

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:26.690
deal with the devil which renders mega

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:31.190
satan unlikely it's probably our secret

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:32.960
room at this point like why double there

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:33.200
well we got the battery oh that's really

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.420
bad

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.100
we got the battery charge but it's

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:41.420
hoping maybe we'll get two cents we did

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:47.300
it works two cents out of the the double

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:49.730
duh oh no that's fine two cents out of

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:52.130
the doubled sack of pennies unexpected

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:55.430
but I did that cited that as a potential

00:09:52.130 --> 00:10:01.070
benefit an extremely niche potential

00:09:55.430 --> 00:10:06.070
benefit do we need damage why because I

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:11.570
do okay

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:13.339
The Joker card so I mean that's a reroll

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:16.160
and a half kamikaze is also like

00:10:13.339 --> 00:10:19.190
essentially horrible not even gonna use

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:21.720
it once don't trust it

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:27.750
yeah good enough anything that gives us

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:29.750
a step towards spun is positive I think

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:31.890
this is decent enough in its own right

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:37.470
we're looking for red chess cuz if we

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:38.940
can get more guppy items that would be a

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.350
positive thing for us you know what I'm

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:43.380
gonna I'm gonna be a little bit of a bad

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:48.180
boy so I was consider myself a bad boy

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:49.589
the Isaac community absolutely don't

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:57.390
even question it mothers hide your

00:10:49.589 --> 00:10:59.910
daughters or as ac/dc says lock up your

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:01.440
daughters lock up your wives lock up

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:04.100
your back door and run for your life

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:08.220
this guy must be a very aggressive

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:14.700
suitor the man is back in town don't you

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:16.350
mess around coz he's TNT okay I'm losing

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.910
it here I can feel myself like my

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:20.070
enjoyment of this run is slipping away

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:21.570
and it's up to me it's not the game's

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.520
fault necessarily it's up to me to bring

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:25.680
it back the fact that we got Krampus his

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:28.890
head is bad lump of coal would have been

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.180
way better and I'm probably gonna deal

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.310
with the devil anyway so it's gonna feel

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:34.560
like a little bit of a waste of our of

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:39.200
our Joker car because it was a waste of

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:41.460
our Joker card it did get us out of the

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.970
we haven't seen the shop yet either okay

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.700
that's good

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:48.540
it did get us out of the mob trap room

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:49.770
but you know if we didn't want what was

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.839
in the mob trap room he should have just

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:54.089
not open the chest that would have

00:11:51.839 --> 00:11:56.550
allowed us to save that Joker card okay

00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:58.490
just drop some bombs in there like the

00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:01.260
thing with Lilith and it might be

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:03.450
psychological psychological from on my

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.800
end here oh we got sake bostrom came in

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:07.980
conception disregard we probably just

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.360
won the run um I just don't get enough

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:16.130
damage output quickly enough sometimes

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:16.130
and it makes me ornery so I'm gonna keep

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:24.520
I'm gonna keep box of friends even

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:26.110
though red candle has some value if used

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.340
almost all of our bombs remember I said

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.210
we had all the ones we need for the

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.160
remainder of the game

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.870
I'll take mini mush okay I'll take a

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.920
Liberty Cap I think it's the juice is

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:36.820
worth the squeeze for the most part

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.500
remember we don't need to make it to

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.030
boss rush it'd be nice to make it to the

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.320
hush fight but we need to have a run

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:43.620
capable of making that work to begin

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.620
with

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.690
mostly worth it

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:56.800
highly not worth it okay pop justice

00:12:54.280 --> 00:13:01.930
grab these bombs I want the key as well

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:03.460
no deal with the devil please so now

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:06.100
that the ten out of ten items are very

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:09.120
simple I mean obviously little brim is

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:11.980
huge eat regular brim mom's knife

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:15.640
extremely high value another succubus or

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:17.260
Incubus also grape but we can get BFF

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.200
that that does a lot for us right off

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:22.990
the bat belly button hold a second

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:24.880
trinket we could buy something take him

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:27.040
forever here but go back and get the key

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.750
this is good and candy and conception is

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:31.240
positive I should remember that we can

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:32.590
actually use that to play a blood bank

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.870
which is why I got the five cents on

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:36.640
this wait it would never mind I just

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:37.840
realized I got the five cents on the

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.310
second floor but the second floor was

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.540
actually an even though sorry an

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:42.010
odd-numbered floor because we were on an

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:45.960
Excel floor to begin with got it got it

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:49.290
got it got it good hmm

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:52.000
okay well worth it already

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:54.300
keep these other ones just one key

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.580
that's all we need

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:59.310
didn't get it I'm gonna pop both cuz

00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:00.779
like I think it's it's the kind of room

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:02.399
where we can justify it we might get a

00:14:00.779 --> 00:14:04.370
battery charge at some point anyway well

00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:07.200
get some charges for finishing the room

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:09.060
and using two of these actually enables

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:11.220
a much more frequent third level meatboy

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:15.050
not that that's a game-winner as we saw

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:15.050
in our last greed mode run but still I

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:26.010
would I would kiss boss rush goodbye on

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:28.610
this one did you see that three coins

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:32.250
paid out from three sacks of pennies and

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:34.920
all three of them were luck upgrades you

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:36.000
can't coach that we also have an eternal

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:40.550
heart today I must have gotten that out

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.550
of one of the golden chests key please

00:14:41.899 --> 00:14:45.209
now HP is not in a great spot we got

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:49.080
nine lives

00:14:45.209 --> 00:14:50.910
don't sweat it too much yet but begin to

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.230
consider sweating it for the future here

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:54.209
it's probably a second secret room we

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:56.600
got to use our bombs to try to parlay

00:14:54.209 --> 00:14:59.910
them into other resources anyway

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:01.600
particularly keys so be a great time to

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:03.560
beat the odds on a deal with the devil

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:06.360
[Music]

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:08.190
yeah okay you got me all right my

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:12.540
impatience led me to a situation in

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:15.120
which I'm saddled with the slightly less

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:16.380
likely win here or less likely pay out

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:19.170
on the deal with the devil at the very

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:20.760
least you got me all right I'm a human

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:22.740
being sometimes human beings you know

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.690
you wouldn't know this cuz your robots

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:26.610
but we make suboptimal decisions in the

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:30.089
name of convenience you ever heating up

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:30.750
like a TV dinner it's a perfect example

00:15:30.089 --> 00:15:34.170
right there

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:37.410
so the Halos of a lovely item rate of

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:39.000
fires drastically improved no rate of

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:40.589
fire has mildly improved I just got

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:46.230
liberty cap immediately after getting

00:15:40.589 --> 00:15:48.570
this Liberty Kant paid out weirdly I

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:49.709
should say we get a lot of money and you

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:52.320
know I'm gonna keep pressing here

00:15:49.709 --> 00:15:56.360
because we're getting a little bit

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.360
closer to being on pace so

00:15:56.710 --> 00:16:01.390
if you get on pace to make it to the

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:04.720
hush fight you're gonna want the money

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:07.960
we're also gonna want keys but sissy

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:11.529
longlegs is actually okay maybe even

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:13.450
better can you drop I am bad can you

00:16:11.529 --> 00:16:15.070
drop a bombs or key pill please it's a

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:17.080
tough call here because I really want a

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.670
key and I think a key could be more

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.050
valuable in fact several keys would be

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:23.140
even more valuable than that obviously

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:26.740
but I also don't want to lose this

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:28.959
eternal heart but I think I think we

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:32.140
could justify continuing to sort of try

00:16:28.959 --> 00:16:33.130
here I'm not gonna be able to make it

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:36.570
into that cursed room though and the

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:38.709
cursed room is very very valuable as

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:40.630
someone trying to pursue this guppy

00:16:38.709 --> 00:16:43.000
dream so you know you get a key we buy a

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:44.140
spear at art we get to roll over half a

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.339
spear at art even after going to the

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.270
cursor because we don't take damage on

00:16:45.339 --> 00:16:50.440
the way and due to our ability to fly

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:52.899
money's looking like real nice right now

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:55.959
luck please look look look look so I'm

00:16:52.899 --> 00:16:57.459
not really a purveyor of fine plays like

00:16:55.959 --> 00:17:02.260
this for the most part but I'm gonna sit

00:16:57.459 --> 00:17:04.270
here and try to get the fire exploded

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.470
because a single spear at art kind of

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:07.900
bust the case wide open

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:09.420
got all these bombs it's like 10,000

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.770
spoons when all you need is a knife

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:17.260
Queen Alana said that bombs are key

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:20.589
please it's like wanting to play a board

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:24.900
game and the host pulls out life well

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:24.900
isn't it ironic don't you think

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:38.279
hang back key no key good lord well it's

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.840
a great run for a donation machine if we

00:17:38.279 --> 00:17:42.509
get lucky enough to be able to donate a

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:43.980
decent chunk but we need a key to access

00:17:42.509 --> 00:17:51.870
that donation machine in the first place

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:54.330
I am stunned did the whole floor no keys

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:58.259
exist excited use three on that one room

00:17:54.330 --> 00:18:00.059
but come on even found both secret rooms

00:17:58.259 --> 00:18:00.570
we're moving on boss rush not gonna

00:18:00.059 --> 00:18:02.309
happen

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:06.330
implausible would be the way that I

00:18:02.309 --> 00:18:07.740
would describe it that's an apt word for

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.570
the situation at least you know what we

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:12.450
should have checked this thing on the

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:15.080
last floor it's like immediately bombs

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:17.399
are key relax

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:20.000
paralysis well maybe I shouldn't have

00:18:17.399 --> 00:18:22.769
cuz that's earned out to be trash oh

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.120
okay well we're gonna go left to start

00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:26.820
with we don't care about boss rush at

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:29.009
all at all at all I mean that's not true

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:30.570
every time I say that I immediately I go

00:18:29.009 --> 00:18:32.850
I just said that in a fit of passion

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:35.190
don't be mad at me baby you know I can't

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:36.990
quit you who loves you baby let's see it

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:41.940
I can say that because it's Kojak he's a

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:44.070
bald brother but we don't care about it

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:46.450
as much as we care about making it to

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:49.130
the hush fight

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:50.840
we also like really want to get a spirit

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:53.780
art ASAP preserve this deal with the

00:18:50.840 --> 00:19:04.510
devil chance because this is a it's our

00:18:53.780 --> 00:19:06.950
highly weighted floor for that you idiot

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:08.780
we also get a free item from the shop

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:10.250
immediately I forgot about that I walked

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:17.690
right into that guy dude

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:18.830
no no whatever

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:21.680
let's roll with safety scissors they

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:28.160
give me fun sometimes counters some

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:29.960
bosses total opportunity costs loss of

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.420
like three cents there I was looking for

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.890
luck upgrades ideally keep in mind there

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:38.390
is a luck downgrade there so if we get

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:41.620
the PhD that's free stats oh I'm I'm

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:41.620
losing my mind

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:48.590
your luck is not high enough to just be

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.910
running into enemies that's more along

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:51.280
lines of what I'm looking for right

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:53.240
there okay and I'll take this time

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.910
recalibrate yourself cuz you're playing

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:58.100
like garbage there's no real need for it

00:19:55.910 --> 00:20:00.950
sure your damage is still pretty bad all

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:06.050
things considered your rate of fires

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:07.970
nothing to write home about but there's

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:10.610
no reason to die you know we still have

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:13.220
like good future potential here we got a

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:15.290
great familiar the succubus payout from

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.370
camión conception was 10 out of 10 when

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:20.690
you guys thought it was taking damage

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:22.430
cuz I'm bad I'm sorry I thought I was

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:24.830
talking to a group of intellectuals here

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:26.270
I was taking damage to proc came being

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:28.850
conception so I could get another

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:30.050
familiar that you wish you thought of

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:31.520
that excuse to get me out of that

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:33.920
situation where I took a bunch of damage

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.360
by playing like an idiot yeah exactly

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:40.450
should have picked up a red heart before

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:40.450
we got that dual heart there

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:45.140
I actually think I should have been hit

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:47.870
there

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:51.560
now we got 10 keys no bombs a one

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:56.150
gauntlet 10 keys few bombs then we're

00:20:51.560 --> 00:21:00.200
gonna get a payout so let's try it easy

00:20:56.150 --> 00:21:02.480
room but still no payout whoo but a two

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:04.160
of Hearts card which is actually the way

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.750
I'm playing and by the way I'm playing I

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.610
mean of course my brilliant came being

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:12.380
conception place you might be able to

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:16.790
use this I'm gonna actually just pop the

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:19.190
Stars give me vision uh charm of the

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:20.660
vampire it does great wonders for your

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:22.580
hairline in this game but apart from

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:24.950
that just gonna look at that as like a

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:36.520
saved key not a big benefit but

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:39.980
certainly not terrible we're gonna

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:43.420
basically slow roll this entire floor we

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:46.280
need to get to the shop if the shop has

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:48.590
greed in it I'm gonna be very unhappy

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:53.150
but it serves me right for opening those

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:53.900
golden chests that agreed I suppose how

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:58.430
ironic

00:21:53.900 --> 00:22:01.030
wouldn't you say detective okay this is

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:01.030
where we want to be

00:22:01.309 --> 00:22:08.629
I hate the wall masters

00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:11.990
I'm sorry Ruka shouted woke you up

00:22:08.629 --> 00:22:13.940
I know you need your beauty sleep 18 to

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:17.029
22 hours a day so I'm gonna apologize

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:25.460
that was not an adult reaction on my

00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:28.249
part there I should have just moved but

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:30.620
because my damage is not great I find

00:22:28.249 --> 00:22:32.840
myself wanting to use Cuba mediate is a

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:34.429
classic and L refrain isn't it

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:37.249
my damage isn't that good so I want to

00:22:34.429 --> 00:22:38.899
use Cuba me to deal as much damage as

00:22:37.249 --> 00:22:40.730
possible and as a result I end up taking

00:22:38.899 --> 00:22:43.429
more damage or even like getting

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:49.119
teleported because I you know my

00:22:43.429 --> 00:22:51.679
placement is bad Virgo is fine sometimes

00:22:49.119 --> 00:22:55.539
and we do have greed so that's like

00:22:51.679 --> 00:22:57.830
enormous leap annoying

00:22:55.539 --> 00:22:59.179
we can't even donate to the donation

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:04.460
machine unless we go to the hush fight

00:22:59.179 --> 00:23:06.820
now there is a curse room I think we

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:08.869
should try for it was it up here I

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:11.480
thought there was a cursor moment oh

00:23:08.869 --> 00:23:13.100
there's one of these I see um we really

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:15.080
want any room that could give us a red

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.999
chest or a golden chest I guess but

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:18.980
mostly a red chest or I'll accept the

00:23:16.999 --> 00:23:20.179
stone chest really any okay you know

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.509
what I've decided I'm not gonna be going

00:23:20.179 --> 00:23:22.509
that way

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:29.570
that's the donation key you always throw

00:23:27.409 --> 00:23:34.399
one of those in there for good luck okay

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:39.559
this guy no problem we Cuba meet him and

00:23:34.399 --> 00:23:41.029
then we we only use one play on mom of

00:23:39.559 --> 00:23:44.629
the spacebar item because we're gonna

00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:46.549
get to use Cuba meat all the time anyway

00:23:44.629 --> 00:23:47.720
unless it's gonna take forever so we're

00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:49.730
hoping to beat the odds with our

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.639
relatively close to 1 in 5 chance of a

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:57.110
deal with the devil it's relatively

00:23:51.639 --> 00:23:58.549
pessimistic I think we're gonna be it's

00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:00.679
relatively optimistic to think we got a

00:23:58.549 --> 00:24:03.380
shot I guess it's pessimistic the chance

00:24:00.679 --> 00:24:05.390
itself to begin with

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:07.010
cuz my mom told me I could do anything I

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:12.049
put my mind to we add another familiar

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:15.020
to the collection fighting just a

00:24:12.049 --> 00:24:16.970
regular old version of mom here the

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:19.789
double succubus is amazing we're taking

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:23.450
the polaroid and hoping against hope for

00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:25.840
this completely undeserved a deal with

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:25.840
the devil

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:35.440
appreciate that the foot never comes

00:24:32.049 --> 00:24:39.340
down makes my life pretty easy no deal

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:40.960
and again no deal deserved as we head

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:43.840
down to the next floor our stats are

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:47.289
still like pretty awful but we do have

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:49.360
an okay chance of making the hush fight

00:24:47.289 --> 00:24:51.519
and even though our stats are bad you

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:54.759
probably don't want to do the hush fight

00:24:51.519 --> 00:24:57.639
on you know this little HP for damage

00:24:54.759 --> 00:24:59.860
rate of fires basically at this point

00:24:57.639 --> 00:25:08.139
average probably we'd still do it cuz

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:09.639
we've got 99 cents so as unfortunate as

00:25:08.139 --> 00:25:12.250
the situation might be the best chance

00:25:09.639 --> 00:25:15.820
for us to make it through here might be

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:16.750
to actually punish ourselves a little

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.159
bit you know it's like it when you're

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:19.299
going through hell keep going you know

00:25:18.159 --> 00:25:21.279
there's the reason it's called the easy

00:25:19.299 --> 00:25:22.690
way in the hard way well the reason is

00:25:21.279 --> 00:25:24.070
because one of the ways is easier than

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:25.990
the other one I guess implicitly that

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:27.730
doesn't necessarily mean that either way

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:29.200
is better I mean there's a hard way to

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:31.629
get to work that doesn't mean that you

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.649
know doing the crab walk for 12 miles is

00:25:31.629 --> 00:25:33.730
the right way to do it is probably

00:25:32.649 --> 00:25:37.360
better than just hop into your

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:40.980
reasonably priced american-made compact

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.980
sedan and drive but still

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:49.879
but both ways have their merits because

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:51.289
I mean like your rotator cuffs would

00:25:49.879 --> 00:25:52.789
probably be real strong after that

00:25:51.289 --> 00:25:55.759
crab-walk see all I'm saying is that

00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:58.120
sometimes there's benefit in that in the

00:25:55.759 --> 00:25:58.120
hard way

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:07.279
there's always benefit in the easy way

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:09.200
it's easier more comfortable but

00:26:07.279 --> 00:26:12.529
sometimes if you go the hard way often

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:14.059
enough it turns the hard way into the

00:26:12.529 --> 00:26:17.289
easy way you didn't think about that did

00:26:14.059 --> 00:26:19.519
you Poindexter so we still have the

00:26:17.289 --> 00:26:21.350
store credit as well so if we could ever

00:26:19.519 --> 00:26:23.870
actually get into a shop on the hush

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:25.639
fight for example we could buy an item

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:28.460
for free we're hoping that there's a

00:26:25.639 --> 00:26:29.750
reroll machine or you know actually I

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:32.269
think it's even a little too late for

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:33.529
restock unless we got it in one of our

00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:41.269
item rooms which I don't even know if

00:26:33.529 --> 00:26:42.289
it's in there maybe yes maybe no as is

00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:43.519
right now that we shouldn't be too

00:26:42.289 --> 00:26:45.529
worried about the hush fight because I'm

00:26:43.519 --> 00:26:48.019
pretty sure that the universe is

00:26:45.529 --> 00:26:49.519
conspiring and by that I mean I'm making

00:26:48.019 --> 00:26:51.769
the kind of mistakes where we're

00:26:49.519 --> 00:26:54.440
guaranteed to see as many Lilith runs as

00:26:51.769 --> 00:26:56.000
as plausible because this one's looking

00:26:54.440 --> 00:27:01.519
like it might have a pretty good chance

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:05.360
to make it to to make it to the the

00:27:01.519 --> 00:27:11.960
chest but I don't love our chances right

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:13.820
now of making it to the the hush fight

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:15.409
that's certainly not worth it so what do

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:16.519
we need here well we're gonna we're

00:27:15.409 --> 00:27:18.169
gonna get a taste of what we need

00:27:16.519 --> 00:27:19.879
honestly because we're definitely going

00:27:18.169 --> 00:27:22.700
to get a deal with the devil if we can

00:27:19.879 --> 00:27:24.769
get a good item or two guppy items all

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:27.110
of a sudden the worlds are burrito the

00:27:24.769 --> 00:27:28.730
worst outcome would be to get two great

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:31.279
items but still be too slow to somehow

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:34.220
make it to the hush fight but we can

00:27:31.279 --> 00:27:39.129
still try to push it at that point this

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:39.129
is tough because like we certainly

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.590
it's still tough

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:46.860
we certainly want to preserve the deal

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:47.660
with the devil chants play this guy we

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:50.340
got the cash

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:54.780
give me a spirit heart and then give me

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:58.280
I don't even know more HP there's a play

00:27:54.780 --> 00:28:00.570
with more HP actually clever play so

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:01.680
thanks for the not exploding bombs

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:07.340
although I guess we have safety scissors

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:10.290
anyway not very good

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:12.000
potentially pretty okay all right I see

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:18.810
where you're coming from look at you

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:21.570
I would give up on hush honestly your

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:24.450
damage is so busted

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:29.270
you make me laugh with your fight with

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:34.010
hush you'll never make the Blue Room

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:38.040
about your ambitions please just shush

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:39.960
and it was that a reference to the 2010

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:44.280
Vampire Weekend song given up the gun

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:50.730
yes it was what can I say I come by it

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:54.150
honestly is this its utero won this is

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:56.490
absurd the floor is too large the real

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:59.900
floor needs to be at least three times

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:59.900
smaller what

00:29:05.929 --> 00:29:15.330
the floor is too long every single Villa

00:29:13.529 --> 00:29:18.509
thrown by the way I blame myself

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:23.129
at least overtly in private I absolutely

00:29:18.509 --> 00:29:24.809
blame the run but I blame myself for the

00:29:23.129 --> 00:29:27.720
fact that we seemingly find ourselves in

00:29:24.809 --> 00:29:28.619
this nightmarish situation like surely

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.999
there's something else I could have done

00:29:28.619 --> 00:29:32.399
getting the deal with the devil on the

00:29:29.999 --> 00:29:33.690
last floor perhaps coming in here

00:29:32.399 --> 00:29:35.309
earlier realizing then we have tell

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:37.080
appeals grabbing two spirits hearts and

00:29:35.309 --> 00:29:38.909
you know leveraging those to take us a

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:40.649
little further into the run while still

00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:41.940
having spirit our protection see where

00:29:40.649 --> 00:29:46.710
were you like five minutes ago when I'm

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:51.509
but I needed that advise itself we could

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:56.820
use the battery charge okay I'll use a

00:29:51.509 --> 00:29:58.559
bomb trying to be a little too clever we

00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:01.009
could still get a deal with the devil

00:29:58.559 --> 00:30:07.859
we're just in unlikely territory now

00:30:01.009 --> 00:30:11.190
sloppy play I'll admit sloppy play an

00:30:07.859 --> 00:30:13.649
arts student we're still pretty tough to

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:18.359
kill and if we make it to the chest you

00:30:13.649 --> 00:30:22.019
know for luck is awesome tella pills me

00:30:18.359 --> 00:30:23.220
tell the pills me please saying the last

00:30:22.019 --> 00:30:25.519
thing we can do here we can still make

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:27.929
hush if we get very lucky hematemesis

00:30:25.519 --> 00:30:29.549
power pill we're gonna stick with power

00:30:27.929 --> 00:30:31.919
pill even though you're probably gonna

00:30:29.549 --> 00:30:33.450
be like dude hematemesis well we can

00:30:31.919 --> 00:30:35.489
actually take him into Mises now but

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:39.529
what's the what's the hematemesis play

00:30:35.489 --> 00:30:39.529
making a second secret room work well

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:45.970
or giving us a bunch of red hearts if

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:48.010
we're about to die which if I'm being

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:49.630
honest is probably like much more likely

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:51.730
to be the right outcome I'm mad at

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:55.000
myself but at the same time a man's got

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:56.580
to know his limitations like how was

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.630
that guy not dead

00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:01.030
you know how he's not dead because we

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:06.340
have 4.08 damage on the freakin womb

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:11.860
dude okay life is a highway we got to

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:13.120
ride it all night long here we

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:14.620
squandered our deal with the devil

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:17.650
chances I believe that deep within this

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:19.390
run there's a guppy we've lost it I

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:21.130
believe that it existed at one point for

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:23.590
somebody else though dude okay that's

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:25.690
the Virgo I'm looking for Virgo plus

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:28.600
luck plus Cuba meat wins this run I

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:31.530
don't mean Lux Ted although that helps I

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:33.940
mean like getting lucky with Virgo procs

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:36.790
sounds like a public access show about

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:41.410
professional gambling getting lucky with

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:43.420
Virgo crux hey everybody rocks here to

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:45.100
show you my ironclad rule eTwinning

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:46.930
technique here's the thing you just put

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.640
money on every single number you can

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:56.710
lose it's been getting luck into the

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:58.720
Virgo proc see you next week just algae

00:31:56.710 --> 00:32:01.180
so algae's I want to use it to open this

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:03.580
chest because I'm an idiot instead we're

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:05.110
gonna hold it because I have smarter

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:08.530
people watching me that'll call me an

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:10.900
idiot it's much better I mean there's a

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:13.600
about a 1% chance we can make it into

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:15.340
the hush fight if we absolutely chose

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:20.620
the right directions like every single

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:26.260
time here which we didn't and now that

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:29.770
dream is probably gone mighty shout and

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:32.620
NL stop using oh I think we got a second

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:34.870
Incubus with Kane being conception lucky

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:37.900
us I'm saying NL stop using Cuba meat

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:39.730
you don't understand Cuba meat is the

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:42.040
it's the Alpha and the Omega there's no

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:46.370
game for us without Cuba me cuz our

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:48.260
damage is like Cain starting damage

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:52.010
so we have to use Cuba meat that's

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:54.260
actually a huge improvement we still

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:57.830
have to use Cuba meat but less so now

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:58.490
this is a good upgrade not too little

00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:01.750
too late

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:01.750
close to it though

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:15.080
really our HP is is holding us in here

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:16.700
please sir by the way double Incubus

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:19.850
also just makes it a lot easier to hit

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:23.060
enemies it's lucky for me money is out

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:26.080
of control can't make it in there unless

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:29.090
no that's a bad idea I wouldn't suggest

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:38.330
willfully almost murdering yourself to

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:40.640
make this dream come true I'm a little

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:42.410
upset that you spawned two enemies out

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:47.300
of this portal in what felt like one

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:48.770
earth split second we're gonna make this

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:53.830
domani dude

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:57.200
and also Lebowski like save your money

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:59.750
we have a deal with the devil chance not

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:01.550
that that matters but well if you got

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:06.410
Megamall we might be able to open the

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:12.380
hush door at least we could donate a

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:16.840
bunch but we still have a win it's just

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:18.380
a it's a grinding win we're going out oh

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:20.090
my lord

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:22.370
so algae's the the best play with

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:25.400
algae's right now is you just hold on to

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:28.070
it until you need it and that sounds

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:30.110
obvious but the last possible second to

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:32.540
use algae's is usually the best possible

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:35.450
second to use algae's so you're like

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:36.830
45-degree angled brimstone man so best

00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:38.300
play against you and my opinion is just

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:41.770
making sure you never get a chance to

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:45.650
shoot I'll go out on a limb and say that

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:48.679
it's hard to imagine us losing if we're

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:50.720
able to make it to the the chest with

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:54.140
for luck would be expecting lots of

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:56.270
extra items there's not enough mediocre

00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:59.450
items in the game under normal

00:34:56.270 --> 00:35:00.950
circumstances to lead to a situation in

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:02.810
which we're not doing like half decently

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:05.360
and I'm it might throw an HP away yeah

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:07.190
you know why we got red hearts it's not

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:11.450
a good strat I'll level with you there

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:12.620
but it's gonna probably work completely

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:14.540
fine

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:16.580
and it allows me to use Cuba me to

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:18.440
actually damage enemies so you know I'm

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:19.730
not getting geeked out by five point six

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:21.170
damage at this point in my career I

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:23.180
don't even get out of bed for less than

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:25.070
double digit damage especially with an

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:26.720
eight rate of fire you got it you know

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:29.120
you got to WoW me in the negotiating

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:30.560
room with an isaac run the cuba meets a

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:36.230
nice little perk here so i'm gonna use

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:37.850
that as much as i can but you're not

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:42.320
gonna get me to play like a Boy Scout on

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:48.080
this run thank you this is very helpful

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:49.640
actually that's enough we don't need any

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.170
more than that so we should just use

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:53.300
power pills kind of like an aggressive

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:56.590
algae's should play this guy cuz even

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:59.210
more HP is still good for us even though

00:35:56.590 --> 00:36:01.010
it's a the most boring of all potential

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:03.170
upgrades he's not necessarily fated to

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:04.930
give us HP he's just most likely to give

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:09.770
us HP as compared to anything else

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:12.880
little chest what's in the box my new

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:12.880
what's in the box

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:22.850
that was pretty stupid I don't feel very

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:25.340
smart about that but we're kind of like

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:27.080
I mean the run does get harder like the

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:28.730
cathedral is not the hardest of all

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:32.660
floors the chest is obviously more

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:34.070
difficult but we're kind of past the

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:36.560
point where I expected to get to much

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:38.210
more difficult so I don't mind losing a

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:41.900
spirit heart to gain some invincibility

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:45.010
there make it through the second phase

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:45.010
without even breaking a sweat

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:51.590
and again we can okay that suck we could

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:55.060
pop algae's but I think that would

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:57.800
actually be like a pretty major mistake

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:59.030
like Sheryl Crow's favorite mistake I

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.470
would actually be like her second

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:01.820
favorite mistake which is way worse she

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:03.680
didn't write a song called my second

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:05.480
favorite mistake she had other hits

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:10.400
after that like soak up the Sun and you

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:12.260
know she has more what's up

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:18.710
she's got soak up the Sun my favorite

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:21.530
mistake and Sheryl Crow songs what else

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:23.330
does she owe if it makes you happy all I

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:25.280
want to do is have some fun I got a

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:29.420
feeling I'm not the only one absolutely

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:33.370
every day is a winding road that's true

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:35.990
okay she's good she's got a few songs I

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:39.230
forgot about that sorry Cheryl I didn't

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:42.350
mean to suggest that you only had the

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:44.330
few bangers there so I'm actually pretty

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:47.260
pleased with getting the miter and the

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:47.260
wafer here

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:57.880
I'm okay with Sheryl Crow I'm not a I'm

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:59.320
not a crow head but there's a couple of

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:02.140
Sheryl Crow songs I wouldn't turn off

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:04.300
they came on the radio some of them I'm

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:06.580
did you know soak up the Sun I think is

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:09.040
actually a bad song this is just too

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:10.869
it's too easy listening you know it's so

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:12.460
easy listening you forget your is so

00:38:10.869 --> 00:38:18.360
easy to listen you forget you're even

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:20.830
listening to anything wasn't such a I

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:22.450
always feel weird about saying this cuz

00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:23.619
I know that maybe not on this video but

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:25.480
somewhere I'm planet Earth there's

00:38:23.619 --> 00:38:27.460
people out there that are like soak up

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:28.930
the Sun is my song like that's the song

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:31.360
that pulled me out of a dark time in my

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:33.550
life or at least gave me that gave me

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:38.800
the motivation to pull myself out of a

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:43.960
dark time in my life but mmm gonna soak

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:49.480
up the Sun I've got my 40 it's literally

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:53.619
like enjoy life but maybe I'm being

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:55.090
overly overly pretentious every day is a

00:38:53.619 --> 00:38:56.590
winding road that's got a little it's

00:38:55.090 --> 00:39:00.790
got a little rock to it I mean there's

00:38:56.590 --> 00:39:02.260
no Mission of Burma it's no replacements

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:04.200
but it's got it's got something so

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:07.000
you're gonna say qui I can respect that

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:10.450
okay we're not respawning so stop taking

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.760
damage getting a lot of bombs here

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:22.930
that's a I mean it's a potential

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:25.270
positive but not really I got very lucky

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:27.010
to regenerate a little there so I think

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:28.690
we're actually closer to death that I'm

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:31.990
giving it credit for right now probably

00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:38.980
because I can't resist using the meat

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:40.540
cube oh there we go Capricorn an actual

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:42.850
improvement I was gonna say let me guess

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:44.220
like a bunch of guppy items and a little

00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:46.600
delirium he's delirious

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:50.530
even more statistical upgrades I'm not

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:52.630
mad I'm actually very happy that we're

00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:54.700
now in a careful we're now in a

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:58.030
situation in which we have like some

00:39:54.700 --> 00:40:00.520
stats although still don't want to be

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:02.590
too offensive not crushing it for the

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:06.690
stage of the game which rat try to snag

00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:06.690
a second nine lives for humors sake

00:40:10.789 --> 00:40:16.489
that was very bad it's just you I think

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:17.660
yeah there's our second nine lives you

00:40:16.489 --> 00:40:19.009
might say look at how good safety

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:21.410
scissors is now you got thirty five

00:40:19.009 --> 00:40:23.989
bombs yeah so what you know you give

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:25.609

00:40:23.989 --> 00:40:26.689
certificate to TGI Fridays that doesn't

00:40:25.609 --> 00:40:27.949
mean it's worth anything to him it's a

00:40:26.689 --> 00:40:29.839
little too little too late to be

00:40:27.949 --> 00:40:32.059
particularly excited about getting

00:40:29.839 --> 00:40:38.150
infinity bombs now I'm like the third

00:40:32.059 --> 00:40:39.859

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:23.050

common thread in every single floor

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:55.610
we've had so far and that's just being

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:58.460
incapable of finding the exit without

00:41:55.610 --> 00:42:01.310
seeing every single dead end on planet
