##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.750
everybody welcome back and rely on

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.660
plates of mining about skenfrith plus

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.379
and the last two challenges were like a

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.700
joke

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:16.500
WAKAWAKA is like a pacman or side game

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.779
kid not to infringe on copyrights only

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.060
failed to on the way okay so it's game

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.710
kid and maybe like a bunch of battery

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.630
charge items yeah totally

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.980
7k IP v v3 have nothing that matters I

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.170
guess it's actually oh because we make

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.969
like power pellets I see

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.590
I was just incorrect so this is actually

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.329
like a fairly tough challenge I don't

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.539
remember how we did on this the first

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.030
try but I do seem to recall saying the

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.410
words Wacka Wacka a lot and I'm not the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.149
kind of guy who starts the challenge and

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.320
then just goes along Calaca you know

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.600
that's the Fozzie Bear sort of thing so

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.219
I think that probably means that it

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.079
might have been a little bit of a you

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.049
know touch-and-go situation the first

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.140
time I cannot say for certain I will say

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.409
I could completely understand how a run

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.970
like this would go south my hope is that

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.640
we can avoid that

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.580
so we'll see what do we need to make

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.619
this pop piercing shots high damage high

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.119
rate of fire freezing tears or another

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.990
tear effect that has like you know

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.790
similar sort of value or like a lot of

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.259
HP would also be pretty good I'm a

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.240
little embarrassed of that damage we

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.159
took there but you can always go back

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.009
for those other red hearts as is

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.950
necessary I'm kind of uh I'm trying to

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.960
play the games game right now but if we

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.189
can find alternative ways to win that's

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.140
fine by me as well I don't know why that

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:51.540
sounded so suspicious we could find

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:54.420
alternative ways to win wink wink if we

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.520
could defeat mom and win the challenge

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.710
for example I don't know what these

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.509
voice is but it hurts me a great deal to

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.890
continue doing it really that's Paula

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.360
fucking toys so I'm not going to

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.979
claimed ownership of that death card

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.370
very nice

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.260
or should I say I'm going to use it

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.420
right away better for rooms like that

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.630
than for bosses so feel like that was

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.780
incredibly justifiable pin is actually

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.200
probable disregard pin is a nightmare

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.170
and love is a battlefield I was going to

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.700
say pins like our ideal choice for this

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:38.150
present situation that is ignorant of me

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.650
apparently pin is actually awaking

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:46.549
existential threat because he is

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:49.760
incredibly affected by the anti

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.709
gravitational field of our tears so we

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.620
really only want to shoot when he's in

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.180
that situation right there luckily we

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.560
made it we got to tears upgrade we've

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.239
got some extra HP we've got enough money

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.360
for an arcade which we really want in

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.010
order to get blood bag is the big one

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.540
there let's see what else you can pick

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.690
up here though that was a decent finish

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.310
to that floor at the very least so the

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.489
right way to handle this is to get oh

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.609
the bombs actually attracts as well I

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.920
didn't know that um might seem a little

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:20.870
weird but I don't think well I didn't

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.040
see the tips drop but until then I was

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.859
like I don't think we should use the

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.299
bomb to get a key necessarily because

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.220
we're going to use very few keys over

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.459
the course of this run and bombs on the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.540
other hand could be extremely valuable

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.280
the screw is a little bit of a

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.480
double-edged sword but not really like

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.670
it's still valuable

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.109
the downside to it it's still very

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.290
valuable actually it almost doubled our

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:43.370
rate of fire but the downside to it is

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.420
you know the more tears that are on the

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.980
map the more things we have that

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.310
influence the gravity I really thought

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.079
that was not going to hit a bit of a

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.670
bummer there but actually it's an

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.650
extreme bummer because there's a lot of

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.910
deal with the devil items that could

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.639
work out really well for us we've still

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:05.109
got a chance just a worse chance I

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:08.459
actually thought you were a stone man

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:10.230
from old Valyria but

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.930
luckily we got out of it without being

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.489
too afraid for our lives if you can find

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.459
a secret room that'd be nice for doing

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:20.639
well on consumables dude knows goblin is

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.820
potentially extremely good in most

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:28.229
situations it's pretty good but if this

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:30.000
leads to us being able to stick enemies

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.300
especially if our damage improves just

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.070
stick enemies and then run away I'm a

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.430
happy camper I think we'll check for one

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:41.430
secret room and then after that we'll

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.570
just leave it's not that I don't want to

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.810
go to the shop instead I want to

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:48.180
preserve our bombs so Larry jr.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.810
presumably also somewhat affected here

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:56.729
he's a cool little like you know

00:04:50.810 --> 00:05:00.180
hyperbola going on there hyperbola is

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:02.400
actually like a mathematics thing right

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.729
I know that parabola is as well this is

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.560
now I've got a like test my nerd cred

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.449
hyperbola a hyperbola is the symmetrical

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.620
open curve formed by the intersection of

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.360
a circular cone with a plane at a

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.180
smaller angle with its axis than the

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.560
side of its cone yeah will you stupid

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.380
idiot you didn't know what a hyperbola

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.789
is it's a symmetrical open curve formed

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.500
from the intersection of a cone with a

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:24.270
plane there's an angle with its axis

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.510
lower than the side of the cone are you

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:36.900
just like if we we learned that in

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:38.660
second grade I didn't learn that in

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.640
second grade

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.220
I was poked that was them to pull the

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.920
veil back was making a joke about the

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.050
internet and how like if you ever talk

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.820
about anything related to school it's

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:56.240
always like didn't learn that until then

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:58.460
look I am NOT a genius but I'm somewhat

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.460
bright I'm you know I've lived in this

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:04.280
brain and body for 28 years I know I

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.410
know my limitations I know my strengths

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.130
and I know my limitations verbally think

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:12.830
I'm pretty strong a verbal reasoner

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:14.510
spatially idiotic just actually like a 1

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.870
out of 10 on the on the text reading the

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:20.390
skill tree there used to be illogical as

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.950
well but programming has helped you know

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.830
short-circuit that a little bit which is

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.600
nice but anyway I'm going to tell you a

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.250
bunch of things that that will make you

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.350
think that the educational system in

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.570
Canada is broken we didn't learn about

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.310
the existence of negative numbers until

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.290
we were in ninth grade now whenever

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.660
people hear that they always go ninth

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.610
grade that's crazy we learned about it

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.190
in 6th grade and then somebody from you

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.690
know Beijing comments we learned about

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.130
it in second grade and then somebody

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.110
from the planet Zebulon goes well we

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.540
learned about it earlier negative 20

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.880
which would be I guess somewhat ironic

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:58.130
but you know in the end I don't think it

00:06:52.880 --> 00:07:00.200
matters all that much you know the whole

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.570
point while that's not totally true I

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.300
think the reason I'm a staunch proponent

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:07.460
of math education by the way I think the

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.370
way we treat you know I'm not Salman

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:13.880
Khan but the way that we teach maths and

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.800
talk about math in North America is very

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.200
strange we teach it as if it's something

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.940
to be afraid of and people go Oh Mac you

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.890
know that's like some you're either born

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.200
with an ability to do math or you're not

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.970
like then if you do if you're not born

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.090
with it then don't even try right but

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.680
that's stupid it's just it's math the

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.540
reason I think the math education is

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.590
important is because it teaches logical

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.900
steps doing things

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.950
it teaches processes you got two numbers

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.840
you want to multiply them together

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.700
here's what you do you got two equations

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.550
you want to solve them by substitution

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:45.440
here's how you do it it's just like

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:48.140
increasingly complex processes to learn

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:50.270
but they are all built on each other so

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.540
you know if you take them piecemeal it's

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:56.100
not that difficult but

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:58.710
anyway I don't think the point of math

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:00.540
beyond like fourth grade is to like hey

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:02.370
if you don't memorize the quadratic

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.750
equation and you're 28 and you can't

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:05.100
recall it immediately then we've failed

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:08.820
you as a math teacher I think it's more

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:11.730
you know who I you to respect logical

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:13.080
processes then that's they've succeeded

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.610
in their goal then but I'm getting a

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:17.940
little bit on my own but I will admit

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:19.710
the same thing like I always I get made

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.920
fun of and deservedly so because I have

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:25.560
a degree in biology and I never use it I

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:28.800
worked for it I have the transcripts to

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:30.630
prove it but it is fair to say I don't

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.890
have that much offhand knowledge that

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.060
would blow your socks off when it comes

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.540
to biology but you know what it's like a

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:39.419
bachelor's degree in biology teaches you

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:43.580
added no respect primary sources respect

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:46.620
stats the confidence interval of

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:48.870
statistical significance and how to use

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:50.580
the library basically those and how to

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:52.560
culture egg are on a plate I'll give you

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.850
that one as well dude a same could be 10

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.070
out of 10 here now you might have wanted

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:59.850
to take the nail but anyway I digress

00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:01.140
I am of the opinion that education is

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:05.100
more about learning how to learn at

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:08.940
least in this point in time maybe not so

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:11.940
when you're lower so set maybe not so

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:13.890
when you're you know in first grade

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.300
they're teaching you some very vital

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:18.090
skills that almost everybody's going to

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:20.490
use at that point here's how to read for

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.320
example you know here's how to add two

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:25.350
numbers together here's how to subtract

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:29.220
two numbers together or from one another

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:30.960
rather you know here's how to construct

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:33.510
a sentence those are valuable but I

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.340
think like that stops being applicable

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.780
like in your first year of high school

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.130
you stopped learning skills that

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:40.410
everybody's going to use on a regular

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.970
basis and instead they're like well we

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:45.180
can't trust you to live on your own yet

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:46.530
because you're 14 so you kind of got to

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.360
keep you in this daycare we're just

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:51.660
going to kind of like over learn you for

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.340
most professions but it'll it'll lead to

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:56.600
you doing something that hopefully you

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:58.890
enjoy later in life

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.600
like I took two years of high school

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.540
physics I'm not saying that makes me

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:05.910
kneel smoke deGrasse Tyson but you know

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:09.540
learn about lots of stuff optics fluid

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:14.610
dynamics thermodynamics how to use a

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:15.510
calorimeter inelastic elastic collisions

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.970
and setter etcetera

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:19.590
I remember none of it I could I could

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:21.180
probably tell you what the Heisenberg

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:24.690
uncertainty principle and that's it but

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:26.820
doesn't mean it was bad to learn I'll be

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.250
on the last run the last two floors so

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:30.810
here's how we win this

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:33.810
worst case scenario by some spirit

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:37.620
hearts hopefully coast apart from that

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:40.110
the the ideal for us is essentially why

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:46.860
do I pronounce it like that essentially

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:49.380
baby I can't fast as much longer I can't

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:54.300
hit that note he's getting stronger and

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:56.190
stronger need a sensual healing okay

00:10:54.300 --> 00:11:01.110
don't take two hits you can never afford

00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:03.000
to take two hits in that situation our

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:05.760
luck stat is also garbage by the way but

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.250
um if we can just buy enough spirit

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.060
hearts to keep ourselves doing okay here

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.500
we should be good

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.480
I recognize it looks like I'm playing

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:15.510
like trash right now part of the reason

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:20.540
for that is because it's a hard run and

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:24.780
this is not an easy one it's WAKAWAKA

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:26.460
nonsenses tear me apart here I'll pay

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:28.440
seven cents for a card because if it's

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:32.520
like a teleport card it would have been

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:35.640
amazing Wheel of Fortune is just okay

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:37.080
it's not terrible we can get some value

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:40.560
out of it will we get seven cents of

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:42.600
value out of it probably not we're also

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:45.420
dealing with base damage we're largely

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:48.800
unconcerned because our rate of fire is

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:53.250
better than base as a result of the

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:58.650
Wheel of Fortune as a result okay well

00:11:53.250 --> 00:12:01.290
so I'm a little mad because the slot

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:03.030
machine would not let me pass I'm not

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:04.980
going to belabor the point all that much

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:06.810
but I'm like a little upset about that

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:08.170
one I really thought we could just push

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:12.040
past it but it decided

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:13.149
that would not be tenable but I think if

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.370
we knock this one out

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:17.620
are we actually on 20 if we knock this

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:19.660
one out like we're on challenge 20 is

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:23.680
what I mean to suggest there well this

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:26.050
is a bit of a nightmare just stick them

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:29.399
with as many knows goblin tears as you

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:31.930
can as you can muster there

00:12:29.399 --> 00:12:34.899
it's like compound interest it's like

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:38.550
slowly Oh some of the more I couldn't

00:12:34.899 --> 00:12:38.550
tell they look like they got sort of

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:43.720
unintentionally going to work them

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:45.730
together here I was really expecting to

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.620
just walk into them and take a couple

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.329
hits and use the same to kill them but

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:51.339
we crush them like the new fashioned way

00:12:49.329 --> 00:12:53.860
so that's ideal definitely should have

00:12:51.339 --> 00:12:56.199
gotten the red hearts there but dude

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.820
we're probably as a result of this going

00:12:56.199 --> 00:12:59.320
to win old bandage is fine as well it

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:02.709
doesn't need to pay out very much for us

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:04.959
to win guaranteed so smart money blow

00:13:02.709 --> 00:13:11.829
this thing up get some cards

00:13:04.959 --> 00:13:13.959
High Priestess moon kind of open for on

00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:16.000
Zeus a little bit of a garbage set up

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:17.380
here but well moon it up might take us

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:23.709
closer to the boss we're kind of just

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:30.550
racing against time at this point damage

00:13:23.709 --> 00:13:35.560
is still I mean base though you've got

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:37.720
my challenge run slipping away can't

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:40.779
think of the words to make it patter

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:43.570
walk up fucker flame I still can't say

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:46.000
it can't you see that boom boom boom

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:49.120
boom boom-boom damage got that super

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.980
bass man it's okay you know one of these

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.310
days one of these days are going to get

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:57.760
another thirsty level parity the thing

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:59.920
is you got to throw darts at the board

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:02.940
they hit a bull's-eye you guys ever

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:07.930
think that darts is like the ultimate in

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:10.120
games that lied to you why is the

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:11.800
bullseye so special on a dartboard if

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.720
the real thing that you want to hit the

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:16.779
vast majority of the time is triple 20

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:20.250
of all of things like I've I was taught

00:14:16.779 --> 00:14:21.500
to play darts by my father it's not an

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:26.720
exceptionally

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:28.370
implicated game to learn but definitely

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.750
like the first question I ended up

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:33.490
asking is like what it would so you

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:39.140
actually are not aiming for the bullseye

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:40.790
in every piece of media like in it just

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:43.610
weird reactors in archery the aim for

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:45.350
the bullseye why is darts like darts is

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:47.410
like hey we're like little archery but

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:49.520
by the way we're completely different

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:51.080
this is where I shouldn't even talk

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.700
about sports that are popular in the UK

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.320
because I can't wait for the comments

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:57.490
like that called darts

00:14:54.320 --> 00:15:01.490
they're called dart sports called dudes

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:05.630
look at the silly uh colonial calling

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:09.980
the game snooker it's snooker head on

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:12.140
down to the draught house pick up a

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:15.770
lager if you wanted look I don't

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:17.570
actually hate the UK I just find it the

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.860
thing is frustrating about the UK is

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.180
that they're us but just slightly

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.770
different which just makes the

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:24.410
disagreements that much more annoying

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:26.930
because they're closer to home like we

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:28.730
went to the UK for like a paradox thing

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:32.300
four hearts of iron for two years ago

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:33.950
two and a half years ago now and I was

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:36.290
like I came back and I was like I

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:36.650
haven't really had I gotta be honest

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.089
with you

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:39.650
Europeans are always talking about how

00:15:38.089 --> 00:15:41.630
good their beer is relatively North

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:43.430
America they always go oh lol North

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:46.270
American beer Andy well actually I'm a

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:49.670
virgin in crafts even though hahaha I

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:51.980
only buy beers brewed by Trappist monks

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:54.230
from the 13th sent anyway so I came back

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:55.610
and I was like you know what I'm not

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:57.589
trying to insult the whole country

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:59.030
because I I was going inside on scene

00:15:57.589 --> 00:16:01.180
but I didn't have that many good beers

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:03.500
in the UK and I was trying to mix it up

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:05.600
you know we went to some some places

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:08.540
that had you know is outrageously large

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:10.460
beer lives bare lives and then people

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:13.010
went well did you get beers or did you

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:14.390
get AIDS and I said well I they're the

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.940
same thing and they said oh you stupid

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:20.500
colonial no they're not well here they

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:24.680
are you don't get if you don't go to a

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:26.900
bar and you go eh I'll take you know a

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:28.850
beer and they go sorry this is an ale

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.589
house you know ale is a type of beer

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:32.230
here it's just why don't we just all get

00:16:30.589 --> 00:16:34.930
on the same pages when I'm trying to

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:39.130
Jeff very worried about this high

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:43.440
priestess card don't get hit by the

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:43.440
things that hurt you for one full heart

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:49.180
we should have it okay I'm never

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.570
touching boss rush I'll tell you that

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.480
much

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:54.220
get me out of this one we finished it

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:56.320
again I feel like okay first off death

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:58.150
touch great on lock I feel like whenever

00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:01.210
people go on this mean they always go

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:03.010
like Oh things are stupid over there

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:04.750
that's not what I'm saying just that the

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:06.370
fact that they're so close and yet so

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:09.790
different is what makes things confusing

00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:13.030
although I will say the fact that you

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:14.560
know tails and beer are different things

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:16.060
like if you go to an ale house there's

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.950
not going to be beer there this actually

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.810
doesn't make any sense to me but this is

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:22.180
because it's colored by where I grew up

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:24.780
as well admittedly I'm not without my

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:29.920
own biases that is a little silly though

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:31.660
in my opinion I and I will say there's

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:34.000
probably some you know the snooker thing

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:36.280
I'm in the minority at least the people

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.480
who are aware of it okay there is the

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.850
proper way to pronounce it and I

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:42.250
pronounce it incorrectly relative to the

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:46.000
majority you know guilty

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:48.880
however the ale and beer thing I think

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.280
you know let's let people not from the

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:52.600
UK and not from Canada answer that and

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:57.390
we'll see who's in the majority because

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:57.390
I'm telling you ales a type of beer

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:01.530
it's like going to with it I went to a

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.760
whiskey place so they didn't have

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.470
whiskey with an e they only had a

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.180
whiskey with a Y and you're gonna say

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:09.030
it's different and I'm like yeah no I'm

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:11.760
with you but it's not so much different

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:14.010
that I'd be like I'd expect to find a

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.600
place that was that you know up its own

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.770
but about it I guess is what I'm trying

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.810
to see look I'm not trying to make

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:22.710
anything all right so we're doing the

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:25.650
host on this challenge it also just goes

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:27.420
to mom and it starts with three HP in

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:29.660
the Mulligan I'm not going to even talk

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:32.190
about spider Valley like it exists

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:34.350
spider babby is basically like getting

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:36.780
one extra bad item room in terms of its

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:38.610
expected value so at least in my opinion

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.350
so I don't think that's particularly

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:43.710
strong but starting with the Mulligan is

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:45.390
like an actual 10 out of 10 start so if

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.860
we lose an Isaac run where we

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:48.420
essentially trade the d6 for the

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:54.300
Mulligan we don't deserve to be this

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:56.150
challenge first try anyway all I'm

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:58.980
saying is can't we all just get along

00:18:56.150 --> 00:19:02.250
I'll start calling it's snooker but

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:04.740
you've got to admit first off it sounds

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:07.710
Dutch and secondly maybe Swedish

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:11.970
secondly you got to admit an ale as a

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:16.980
beer like if I ask you what what kind of

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:18.960
drink is Newcastle Brown and you said

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:21.330
it's an ale and I said so it's a beer

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:23.940
and you said no it's an ale I mean

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:26.490
around here them's fightin words is all

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.930
I'm saying because if you you know it's

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:30.270
like why you trying to be better than me

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:32.940
it's a beer it's just it's swill that we

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:36.000
put into our gullet you know it's the

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:38.580
opiate of the masses to distract us from

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.360
our inevitable see the thing is you're

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:45.000
being pedantic is we try to get at okay

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:47.540
dude that we can cement our victory like

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.540
right here

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:56.650
I don't know anymore like I don't have

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:58.660
more UK any more UK metaphors going to

00:19:56.650 --> 00:20:01.870
the UK was very strange for me and I'm

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:03.940
going to explain why see that's how you

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:05.290
introduce your essay topic while also

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:08.070
giving yourself a few minutes to think

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:10.810
about what you're going to say it's not

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:12.640
exotic to go from Canada to the UK

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:14.380
because we're kind of like as much as

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.450
we're close to America as well we're

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:21.880
like a little amalgamation up here we're

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:25.000
half UK half u.s. we're like the US but

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:27.010
we have HP sauce and I've like been in

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.450
households that have Bo bro you know I

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:30.610
understand now that one I might

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:35.560
genuinely be mispronouncing okay don't

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:36.940
squander this one too soon you know I

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:40.810
understand where you're coming from on

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:46.360
that one it's beep T u P not bad

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:47.530
actually but you know you go to the UK

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:51.070
and you're like what am I going to eat

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:52.960
okay fried meats and potatoes or meats

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:55.750
baked into a pie it's not that exotic

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.190
you know if I went to like Indonesia I'd

00:20:55.750 --> 00:21:00.460
be eating some weird stuff

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:02.230
and that's apparently how I judge my you

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:04.330
know how exotic a holiday is is do I

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:05.350
speak the language and what the heck are

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.620
those people eating over there

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:10.600
everything there's some validity to that

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:12.460
but at the same time Kane I you know

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:15.520
we've made a habit of going to Japan and

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:18.790
people think it's exotic and it isn't

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:21.010
not exotic but it's also like to get to

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:22.840
Japan from Vancouver it's like hopping a

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:26.890
bus it's like a hopping on a nine-hour

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:28.630
bus it's long it's I mean that's long as

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:30.910
far as flights go but you know I've been

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:33.070
on longer for example flying to the UK

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:34.420
that was like an 11 hour trip we were

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.740
lucky to get as a wrecked flight but

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:37.750
anyway nobody cares about flying you

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:40.300
know we've been over this 20 times but

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:41.980
then you go to Japan you're jet-lagged

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.759
you take a sleep you wake up at 6 a.m.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:45.669
and you're good for the

00:21:42.759 --> 00:21:47.919
I'm there I never got over my jet lag

00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:51.489
being in the UK so it was weird I was

00:21:47.919 --> 00:21:54.729
like I'm in accented Canada except I

00:21:51.489 --> 00:21:58.449
feel like my brain is broken for 11 days

00:21:54.729 --> 00:22:02.019
straight anyway more props to you over

00:21:58.449 --> 00:22:07.269
there keep it up double-decker buses the

00:22:02.019 --> 00:22:08.679
London Eye and accidentally going to the

00:22:07.269 --> 00:22:10.659
wrong pubs that are all owned by the

00:22:08.679 --> 00:22:13.329
same management group apparently anyway

00:22:10.659 --> 00:22:16.619
let's let's go for broke here we have no

00:22:13.329 --> 00:22:19.119
space bar item so we'll take book a sin

00:22:16.619 --> 00:22:20.829
take sister Maggie just as a way to deal

00:22:19.119 --> 00:22:22.919
extra damage I think sister Maggie may

00:22:20.829 --> 00:22:25.979
also serve as a mulligan engine for us

00:22:22.919 --> 00:22:30.099
she just smiled gave me a mulligan

00:22:25.979 --> 00:22:30.669
engine my favorite British song how

00:22:30.099 --> 00:22:33.069
strange

00:22:30.669 --> 00:22:35.349
nlf's an Australian song is it Colin

00:22:33.069 --> 00:22:36.819
Hays from Scotland did I just double

00:22:35.349 --> 00:22:39.519
back on you did I just pull a John

00:22:36.819 --> 00:22:39.969
McClane pistol duct tape to my back sort

00:22:39.519 --> 00:22:44.799
of move

00:22:39.969 --> 00:22:48.099
I think it's conceivable I really think

00:22:44.799 --> 00:22:49.690
like we should rethink condoms like it's

00:22:48.099 --> 00:22:51.839
got to be honestly okay I love you if

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:54.819
you're watching this in your American I

00:22:51.839 --> 00:22:56.589
respect you okay I really do

00:22:54.819 --> 00:22:58.749
your country's done some amazing things

00:22:56.589 --> 00:23:01.059
it's going buck wild down there right

00:22:58.749 --> 00:23:04.959
now you guys are like everything's on

00:23:01.059 --> 00:23:07.179
fire everybody hates each other it's

00:23:04.959 --> 00:23:10.389
manifesting itself in some of the ugly

00:23:07.179 --> 00:23:11.679
ways it's just a mess we got our own

00:23:10.389 --> 00:23:13.859
problems up here I'm not gonna say that

00:23:11.679 --> 00:23:17.319
we don't but I'm like I'm out America

00:23:13.859 --> 00:23:19.269
enjoy you know stick with Mexico Bermuda

00:23:17.319 --> 00:23:20.949
the Caribbean etc etc all those

00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:24.159
countries in Central America you can

00:23:20.949 --> 00:23:29.739
have North America I want to form like a

00:23:24.159 --> 00:23:31.179
northern continent it's us the UK and if

00:23:29.739 --> 00:23:33.309
the UK doesn't want to you know get back

00:23:31.179 --> 00:23:34.809
into relationship that quickly I guess I

00:23:33.309 --> 00:23:36.009
can understand but you know we'll take

00:23:34.809 --> 00:23:38.379
Scotland and Ireland

00:23:36.009 --> 00:23:39.539
I want Iceland in the Faroe Islands as

00:23:38.379 --> 00:23:41.979
well

00:23:39.539 --> 00:23:44.709
we're very culturally different but I

00:23:41.979 --> 00:23:46.479
think that'd be sick dude we get like

00:23:44.709 --> 00:23:49.449
hey check out my friend

00:23:46.479 --> 00:23:50.730
he's from Iceland or rather he is

00:23:49.449 --> 00:23:53.460
Iceland

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:54.960
that would be cool not just in the

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:56.580
status Nebula I'm going to take a trip

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:59.730
to my friend's house he lives in a

00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:04.110
Carrera anyway not ukulele different

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:06.810
different things keep moving here you're

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:08.760
doing okay now still need to up our

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:12.600
damage though 3.5 damage is making me a

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:15.300
salty boy uh you know I wouldn't mind

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:18.420
having Sweden Norway Finland up there we

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:21.480
can get Denmark why not Estonia you're

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:23.510
welcome Latvia Lithuania welcome we're

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:27.020
forming a new northern continent okay

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:27.020
you're invited

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:31.920
I'll put aside my differences with the

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:34.230
rest of Canadians as well as far as I'm

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:36.000
concerned you're cool you know we got to

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:38.340
stop making fun of each other though you

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.780
know Alberta I'll stop calling you Texas

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.730
as long as you stop making fun of the

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:44.460
fact that my province is on fire can we

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:46.950
like it's on fire all that yeah I know

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:50.430
it's expensive here and it's on fire and

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:52.140
people are snooty okay but like at least

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:54.870
we don't have truck nuts see we can put

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:58.260
these differences behind us if we could

00:24:54.870 --> 00:25:03.690
we got a band together okay I've just

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:04.260
saved northern continent 2020 I feel it

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:07.260
coming

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:08.280
think of the concerts do break the

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:12.720
weekend

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:17.610
Bjork sigur rós various Danish artists

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:19.260
Peter Bjorn and John Abba various

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:23.640
Finnish artists of which I'm sure there

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:27.980
are many Robin probably she strikes me

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:31.890
as being up here

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:34.080
Jen's Lakme other Swedish artists

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:36.909
probably some euro pop is what I'm

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:39.159
thinking there anyway

00:25:36.909 --> 00:25:41.559
I know what you're thinking I'm in

00:25:39.159 --> 00:25:42.820
northern Germany can I be invited I'm

00:25:41.559 --> 00:25:44.859
sorry we gotta draw the line somewhere

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:47.019
it's nothing against you guys but you

00:25:44.859 --> 00:25:48.789
know we started letting northern Germany

00:25:47.019 --> 00:25:50.559
in and then all the sudden France is

00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:52.690
like hey we get in and then America's

00:25:50.559 --> 00:25:54.899
like but we're on the same latitude and

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:57.879
we got to be that's awkward

00:25:54.899 --> 00:25:59.590
and we'll rejoice it's like breaking up

00:25:57.879 --> 00:26:03.039
with your high school sweetheart for a

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:05.950
bit in college you know America we're

00:26:03.039 --> 00:26:07.899
like until previous like very recently

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:09.729
we were each other's number one trading

00:26:07.899 --> 00:26:11.799
partner I'm not even saying you're on

00:26:09.729 --> 00:26:13.539
the wrong path although I think it's

00:26:11.799 --> 00:26:17.229
implicit that's that's basically what

00:26:13.539 --> 00:26:18.759
I'm saying but I just I think it would

00:26:17.229 --> 00:26:21.330
be better if we worked our stuff out

00:26:18.759 --> 00:26:24.489
separately for a while and then maybe

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:27.129
reconvene in a set period of time and

00:26:24.489 --> 00:26:34.059
see how things look then perhaps I think

00:26:27.129 --> 00:26:37.200
maybe anyway alright this is kind of a

00:26:34.059 --> 00:26:42.639
moment of truth here to be a little

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:45.129
scared about this situation that that

00:26:42.639 --> 00:26:46.899
worked out the way it did because

00:26:45.129 --> 00:26:52.269
contract from below could be good for us

00:26:46.899 --> 00:26:53.739
here either that or I'm still down I

00:26:52.269 --> 00:26:55.179
mean I don't know the logistics of any

00:26:53.739 --> 00:26:57.580
of this because I'm just telling a joke

00:26:55.179 --> 00:26:59.470
so believe in the Geneva Convention it

00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.909
says you don't need to have a reasoning

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:02.169
for every single one of you jokes but

00:27:00.909 --> 00:27:03.759
it's been a while since I've read the

00:27:02.169 --> 00:27:07.869
comedy section of that war crimes

00:27:03.759 --> 00:27:12.509
tribunal ruling but I'm still down for

00:27:07.869 --> 00:27:15.070
the West Coast as well you know Cascadia

00:27:12.509 --> 00:27:16.929
so just hit me up I'm probably the guy

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:20.759
you need to talk to if you're like the

00:27:16.929 --> 00:27:24.009
leader of Washington Oregon California

00:27:20.759 --> 00:27:26.859
then get me up we'll work something out

00:27:24.009 --> 00:27:29.950
you know I don't want to secede from the

00:27:26.859 --> 00:27:31.299
rest of Canada necessarily but I've got

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:33.639
to admit it will be pretty cool

00:27:31.299 --> 00:27:37.239
Canada's like you're at like a pretty ok

00:27:33.639 --> 00:27:39.159
party right but then there's like four

00:27:37.239 --> 00:27:40.299
people there that you really relate to

00:27:39.159 --> 00:27:41.529
and you're like you guys just want to

00:27:40.299 --> 00:27:43.539
like go somewhere quieter we can play

00:27:41.529 --> 00:27:45.489
like a board game or something yeah that

00:27:43.539 --> 00:27:48.549
would be Cascadia if we could just be

00:27:45.489 --> 00:27:51.099
like a sub country in Canada

00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:52.749
or in North America I suppose we could

00:27:51.099 --> 00:27:53.979
be like we could be like Greenland

00:27:52.749 --> 00:27:56.889
Greenland's like a country that's not

00:27:53.979 --> 00:28:00.129
really a country I'm trying not to

00:27:56.889 --> 00:28:01.959
offend my like you know single green

00:28:00.129 --> 00:28:05.529
landish viewer here but you're like a

00:28:01.959 --> 00:28:06.339
country but you're also dead and I

00:28:05.529 --> 00:28:11.589
respect that

00:28:06.339 --> 00:28:15.089
I kind of admire it in many ways you

00:28:11.589 --> 00:28:18.009
know you're like a derived class country

00:28:15.089 --> 00:28:20.769
the base class is Denmark and then

00:28:18.009 --> 00:28:22.329
you've inherited its laws and taxes but

00:28:20.769 --> 00:28:24.549
then you got your own you override your

00:28:22.329 --> 00:28:26.440
own methods in your own unique way

00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:28.089
yes that was a joke about inheritance

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:30.339
and programming and then there's a pun

00:28:28.089 --> 00:28:32.499
because the capital of Greenland is a

00:28:30.339 --> 00:28:35.529
city called nook and am i proud of

00:28:32.499 --> 00:28:39.669
myself I want to say no but the truth is

00:28:35.529 --> 00:28:40.899
I am so we're gonna leave here you know

00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:43.450
what let's go to the curse room we need

00:28:40.899 --> 00:28:45.869
some we probably don't need it but we

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:48.940
would like some curtain power we're not

00:28:45.869 --> 00:28:51.009
really crushing it right now this is a

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:56.859
great situation surprisingly great

00:28:51.009 --> 00:29:00.039
situation in that if two years dude look

00:28:56.859 --> 00:29:02.379
at this it was already a great situation

00:29:00.039 --> 00:29:04.659
but then it became even greater one

00:29:02.379 --> 00:29:06.609
internal heart is worth nothing here one

00:29:04.659 --> 00:29:09.429
internal heart with four years our two

00:29:06.609 --> 00:29:11.440
year of ruins is worth two full HP

00:29:09.429 --> 00:29:12.909
upgrades considering we only got two

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:16.179
more floors to go after this we're

00:29:12.909 --> 00:29:19.899
starting to pop why did I come back in

00:29:16.179 --> 00:29:21.789
the district anyway I'm not trying to

00:29:19.899 --> 00:29:23.829
insult the place that anybody else lives

00:29:21.789 --> 00:29:25.269
again I can't stress enough Canada's got

00:29:23.829 --> 00:29:27.399
its own problems average price of a home

00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:29.409
Vancouver is like 1.4 million dollars or

00:29:27.399 --> 00:29:30.909
something right now whole province is on

00:29:29.409 --> 00:29:32.440
fire when camping can't even have

00:29:30.909 --> 00:29:34.779
campfires of the whole province is on

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.369
fire air pollution was like among the

00:29:34.779 --> 00:29:37.869
worst in the world because of the fires

00:29:36.369 --> 00:29:39.729
most of the time it's like quite

00:29:37.869 --> 00:29:41.849
gorgeous but you know you're breathing

00:29:39.729 --> 00:29:45.309
in like smoke from all over the freakin

00:29:41.849 --> 00:29:47.739
province here anyway the point is not to

00:29:45.309 --> 00:29:49.899
mention you know Vancouver in particular

00:29:47.739 --> 00:29:52.929
within Canada within British Columbia

00:29:49.899 --> 00:29:55.349
has its own nexus of drug abuse and

00:29:52.929 --> 00:29:59.289
mental health problems and you know

00:29:55.349 --> 00:30:01.850
burgeoning racism and etc etc and also

00:29:59.289 --> 00:30:04.010
those snooty Millennials with their

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:05.870
dollar coffee's probably the biggest

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:09.110
problem out of all of those ones that I

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:13.130
just mentioned and I am not telling a

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:19.030
joke I am that millennial anyway I'm

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:21.140
just saying dude it's why the laziest

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:24.320
Capstone's any joke ever

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:28.850
it's wild yeah man it's wild I mean like

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:32.350
cool what's going on there I mean it's

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:35.570
crazy out there other such comedian

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:38.420
interstitials inserted as such anyway

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:39.860
speed down I mean I'm pretty close to

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.810
taking that as a joke but I don't know

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:44.720
if this runs in joke territory yet

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:46.610
we're like one piercing shots upgrade

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:50.180
away from being able to afford taking a

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:54.410
speed downgrade at which point I'd be a

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:56.990
happy boy but right there yet please

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:58.700
give me a teleport card the lovers not

00:30:56.990 --> 00:31:00.470
as good as a teleport card but still

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:02.210
very good

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:04.190
we might I mean you saw how close wakka

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:06.110
wakka came to death this shouldn't be

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:08.240
nearly as bad because this run is

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:11.480
actually great it's pretty much

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:16.310
exclusively because of the addition of

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:18.380
the Mulligan but still we could also be

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:20.540
using acid baby like a little bit more

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:22.370
effectively I'd be the first person to

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:25.310
tell you that so you know it's best to

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:26.810
be using pills on rooms with enemies

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:28.690
when you have acid baby especially now

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:33.320
that we probably identified many but

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:36.230
Sophia what I'm asking for here ideally

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:38.990
is if I could pick up like a tears or

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:42.140
damage upgrade because we could win this

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:44.870
one all the way to mom all the way to

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:47.900
Reno buy REM be some songs I mean it's

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:50.180
not it's no man on the moon it's no

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:52.820
stand and I mean it's definitely no

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:55.190
Radio Free Europe talk about the passion

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:58.760
etc etc you know from the college radio

00:31:55.190 --> 00:32:02.720
days but the songs all right I mean it

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:04.550
made it onto the best of automatic for

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:07.310
the people era you know double-sided

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:12.059
classic night swimming deserves a quiet

00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:14.009
night etc etc Michael 5 stripe gum

00:32:12.059 --> 00:32:15.840
talking about dude it's a damage upgrade

00:32:14.009 --> 00:32:17.249
that's the kind of commentary you get

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:20.299
when you got to fight a champion version

00:32:17.249 --> 00:32:20.299
of dirty for like 20 minutes

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:29.909
we should we really should actually and

00:32:26.989 --> 00:32:32.340
straight-up we're burning like the

00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:35.009
midnight oil right now so I am going to

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:36.899
be using bombs to kill enemies I'm going

00:32:35.009 --> 00:32:37.769
to be using cards to get whatever I can

00:32:36.899 --> 00:32:39.929
get out of them

00:32:37.769 --> 00:32:45.779
which you probably should be doing on a

00:32:39.929 --> 00:32:49.139
regular basis but we really were in a

00:32:45.779 --> 00:32:50.969
race against the clock at this point not

00:32:49.139 --> 00:32:55.019
a great use of a full health card if I'm

00:32:50.969 --> 00:32:56.820
being real with you but that's okay but

00:32:55.019 --> 00:32:59.460
you know we got a newfound sense of the

00:32:56.820 --> 00:33:00.989
importance of this run because we're

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:02.369
getting that much closer to the end this

00:33:00.989 --> 00:33:03.869
might be one of the few challenges by

00:33:02.369 --> 00:33:09.839
the way where we don't have the ability

00:33:03.869 --> 00:33:12.059
to actually to actually even try to do

00:33:09.839 --> 00:33:13.409
boss rush we were kind of on pace but

00:33:12.059 --> 00:33:15.269
like every room that we do without

00:33:13.409 --> 00:33:15.899
getting substantially stronger is just

00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:17.399
slowing us down

00:33:15.899 --> 00:33:22.559
who would have thought this would be a

00:33:17.399 --> 00:33:24.239
slower run than waka waka which I'm now

00:33:22.559 --> 00:33:26.099
realizing I probably will never have

00:33:24.239 --> 00:33:31.379
occasion to say again so you know what

00:33:26.099 --> 00:33:34.859
cheers to you like a lack ins and you're

00:33:31.379 --> 00:33:45.599
a Tolkien esker cellar-door that's a

00:33:34.859 --> 00:33:48.239
phrase that's convenient to say hey what

00:33:45.599 --> 00:33:51.570
are you guys like more as far as the

00:33:48.239 --> 00:33:55.070
movies in this duology go the graduate

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:57.389
or postgraduate starring Alexis Bledel I

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:59.190
don't know because the sequel it

00:33:57.389 --> 00:34:01.289
answered a lot of questions about the

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:04.909
original like you know what does he do

00:34:01.289 --> 00:34:06.960
in the plastics industry um see that's a

00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:08.549
mantra narrow wait wait wait I can use

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.960
the soundboard in Issac videos I just

00:34:08.549 --> 00:34:12.000
realized give me a second to not get

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:15.270
killed on this room and be something

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.919
like it really didn't like what they did

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:18.919
with the sequel starring Alexis Bledel

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:33.320
well you know good-good gurus you say

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:37.130
you Gilmore Girls alum from The

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:38.930
Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants she

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:40.030
was in that you can check an IMDB if you

00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:43.670
don't believe it

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:45.590
that's like my ideal you know Lindsay

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:48.170
Lohan the limit does not exist Mean

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:50.060
Girls climax probably have weird awkward

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:52.640
order for that sentence to go into but

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:54.680
anyway you know question that wins me

00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:56.930
pub trivia at the end of the day name

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:59.000
all four of the members of The

00:34:56.930 --> 00:35:03.200
Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants was

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:07.270
Alexis Bledel Amber Tamblyn America

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:12.740
Ferrera and who is the fourth sister

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:13.460
hood of the Traveling Pants let me just

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:18.620
look at a picture

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:20.180
it's a blonde lady but Blake Lively yo

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:22.880
that's the that's the second movie

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:24.500
though is she and the Blake Lively was

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:29.210
the other one who would have thought

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:33.740
Blake Lively like by far I would say the

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:38.120
most famous of those uh of those

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:40.190
actresses now I didn't even realize she

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:42.560
was like an also-ran I knew everybody

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:44.480
else I never read The Sisterhood of the

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:46.130
Traveling Pants books or watch the movie

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:48.260
but I was aware of its existence

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:52.850
that sounds nefarious but you know you

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:57.200
just nod just happen to be on earth when

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:59.000
it came out we should probably go to the

00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:00.320
shop and look for like blue candle or

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.500
something like that but you should also

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:07.160
probably like mind your own business

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:10.610
getting real nosy lately hypothetical

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:12.650
straw man waiting in the skinny he'd

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:15.940
like to argue with you muddy this

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:20.440
construct of your mind he's a strong

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:22.510
and dude we got the ability to fly we're

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:23.950
going to get some damage this is a win

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:26.200
it's not only this has been a marathon

00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:28.990
episode we're like 36 minutes in but

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:31.150
it's been like a little bit of a long

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:37.660
one as far as like this challenge goes

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:39.670
to full health pills worth set and may

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:42.040
actually still be able to get to boss

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:45.010
rush although we should pretty much just

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:46.840
not care being at 7 damage is so good

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:49.540
now I say it every time we got like a

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:54.190
fly setup but like for real I mean that

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:56.590
stings a little bit sir but the more

00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:57.760
damage you have the better off you are

00:36:56.590 --> 00:37:00.160
for so many reasons

00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:03.190
one of which is just that your flies do

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:08.980
more damage so you know it's really like

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:11.440
a rich get richer sort of situation the

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:13.510
better your flies are the more efficient

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:14.800
your flies become as a result of the

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:20.890
fact that you need less of them to kill

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:23.620
an enemy either way even with the recent

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:27.730
tiers downgrade there should be pretty

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:29.320
much no cause for alarm here if we if we

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:33.940
break it up something's gone terribly

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:37.450
wrong I think we should probably just

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:43.510
Coast this one into the the gold post

00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:46.150
here be like Arsenal try to walk it in

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:47.680
something something that it crowd VA een

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:50.400
you know I've never seen I'd probably

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:53.110
seen like two episodes of the it crowd

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:54.700
I'm more familiar with Garth Moran G's

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:57.580
dark place even though I haven't I've

00:37:54.700 --> 00:38:02.170
seen it it's kind of it's come to more

00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:04.120
media attention lately maybe not I'm not

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:05.680
trying to hipster it up and be like well

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:07.570
I knew better before was five legs it

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:09.340
was recommended to me by someone who

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:11.320
knew about it before it was popular I

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.700
knew about it when it was popular but

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:15.250
I've been seeing more Darth Marais or

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:18.190
Gardner and Eve Darkplace reverences pop

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:21.900
up recently so what happened with you

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:21.900
and this renwick customer

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:28.670
anyway it's a good good good show

00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:30.560
recommended you're interested in shows

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:33.950
if you like watching entertainment

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:37.040
programs it's a good one I would

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:38.780
recommend watching it you know what I

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:40.250
wouldn't recommend watching Thor the

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:42.860
dark where I'm no K I'm not going to go

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:45.980
back down that tan it's just unnecessary

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:50.750
at this point poor Chris Hemsworth he's

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:52.130
been through enough ok we're done I'm

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:54.470
pretty flies we're set

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:56.510
it's over keep full health because we

00:38:54.470 --> 00:39:00.020
can use that to poison mom if necessary

00:38:56.510 --> 00:39:02.090
oh my god at this point this is if

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:03.980
there's one problem with Isaac this is

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:05.270
it right here where you're just like at

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:08.090
