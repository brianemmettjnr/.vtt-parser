##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.959
everybody welcome it here on the land

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.980
please The Binding of Isaac after birth

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.139
plus we finished with the posted side of

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.450
grid mode at least absent the secret

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.910
characters on the last episode and I'm

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.390
happy about that we got a lot of dark

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:23.880
room stuff to do though we have a lot of

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.920
dr. boom stuff to do okay who is going

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.289
as asel is an option but we just had a

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.710
fast run I'd prefer to avoid that for

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.610
now

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.530
um I mean Maggie has some garbage ones

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.239
lined up I hate to do it cuz we just

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.360
played as Eve recently and I think

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.510
Samson just before that but it's - a

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.070
Samson run hard mode dark room we got

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.289
this we got this we're making progress

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.760
dude we've been ticking off the post it

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.180
note much like we tick off people when

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.800
we miss tinted rocks HZ SN c SW k it's a

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.930
curse run you know the rules no numbers

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.840
in the seed if you get a seed that's all

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.500
letters you know you're in for a tough

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.270
one the letters control the same the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.850
numbers control good items we gonna see

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.200
that's all numbers show me I've never

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.150
seen it happen before I don't even know

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:18.540
if it's plausible I think the answer is

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.100
probably no but well it might be

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:27.180
possible try to think this I think they

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:29.400
use numbers only to know that's stupid I

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.470
was gonna say they use numbers only to

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.360
make letters unambiguous like using a

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.460
zero for an owl but I don't believe that

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.290
that's the case because what the heck is

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:44.720
seven is there a T is it an L is it an

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.490
si tu r da y night

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.939
it isn't Saturday night here it's Sunday

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.939
afternoon

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.650
nonetheless as much relevancy but I

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.229
needed some air to fill while we were in

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.880
that room with the most annoying enemies

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.650
on planet Earth because they're not even

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.030
difficult they're just annoying it's

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.380
like fighting the lost in XCOM

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.520
apparently my eggs come game is bugs I

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.020
know you might be watching this going I

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.950
don't want Jax come don't belabor the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.380
point but okay

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.500
basically next come to war the chosen

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.700
there's a new faction zombies I got this

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.990
bug well I got first the enemies

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.970
completed a quote-unquote dark event

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.940
that makes it possible to have these

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.800
zombies show up on every mission then I

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.020
got a bug that never purged that event

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.720
from the queue so apparently I've just

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.420
stuck with like 80 zombies permission

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.130
forever it's like fighting a room full

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.840
of corn flies everything dies in 2 hits

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.820
they're not that much of a threat but

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.230
every once in a while one squeaks

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.880
through and makes you like lose all

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:49.810
self-confidence in your ability to play

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:53.900
video games we shall see though okay

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:57.010
there's a long trip to get to this item

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.440
room and it cost us it cost us big

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:05.840
Taurus is kind of bad right now but it

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.489
could be amazing in not too long yeah

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.160
yeah I can live with this this is

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.510
actually extremely good dark bummed from

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.829
our first deal with the devil we still

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.120
have a great chance of getting a deal

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.120
with the devil on the next floor ooh

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:24.160
don't get hit things are a little scary

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:33.440
there we go yeah we might need our next

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.840
red heart it's not really much we can do

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.690
on the shop we could always shoot fires

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.670
but in fact I think I'm going to but the

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.160
first red hearts I think belonged to me

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.800
four point five damage with an eleven

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.210
rate of fire definitely plausible to

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.840
defeat the boss without you know too

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:53.210
much hassle there but it depends on the

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.630
boss cuz our speed is also quite low as

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:59.330
well so uh honestly Ragman is normally

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.500
kind of a bad draw and our speed is low

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.030
enough that it's gonna be hard to dodge

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.100
the homing shots in a lot of situations

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.180
I think but our damage is high enough

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.710
that I think most of the time we're

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.630
gonna be taking out the spiders before

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.250
we can really do much to us and we take

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.630
out the spiders you know that it does

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:17.450
damage to him as well I think we got a

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:19.540
relatively okay draw and the halo is

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.470
just you know thought that creme de la

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.180
resistance that's not how it works the

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.320
piece de resistance the creme de la

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:31.430
creme alamode big good Oh fromage that

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:34.730
good baguette Alfre Maj like I said I'm

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:39.200
sort of french-canadian but like in name

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.460
alone but that's enough right many

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.300
people are probably gonna say no but

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.120
I've seen you

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.070
whenever the Olympics happen I went to a

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.920
school that was like the most

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.200
monocultural school you could possibly

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:56.510
imagine and we lived in the middle of

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:58.940
nowhere everybody was like from fourth

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.420
generation Canadians World Cup comes

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.770
around

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:06.050
oh all of a sudden you know I don't know

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.400
all of a sudden you know people are

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.190
wearing jerseys for like the Dutch

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.450
national team and yeah oh hey Nick I

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.680
didn't know you were Dutch and he's like

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:17.450
oh yeah my great great great grandfather

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.250
spent a weekend in Ghent once

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.520
oh isn't that in Belgium yeah but like

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:25.190
you know close enough right the national

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.840
pride always comes out when it's a it's

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.850
a sporting event internationally

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.320
especially if you have a tangential

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.780
relationship to a country that's

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:36.379
actually good

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:39.289
it's funny I saw a lot of people you

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:42.710
know we got a very thin familial thread

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:44.900
to like you know the Italian national

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.250
soccer team and I'm not insulting

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:53.180
anybody that fits in this boat by the

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:55.400
way oh jesus a problem like if Canada

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.599
went out in the Olympics on the hockey

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.310
side of things who would I cheer for

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:59.870
probably like Sweden I got no

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.300
relationship to Sweden just kind of

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:06.319
Sedin twins play for the Canucks I'm a

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:08.150
that's that's my level of of knowledge

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:10.909
they're my level of international

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.349
connection I suppose let's give this a

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:15.770
shot and see how it goes this should

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:17.810
also be completely fine we don't see a

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.240
lot of people who are like yeah it's the

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:23.569
World Cup and I'm like all of a sudden

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.250
I'm cheer for Cote d'Ivoire not that

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:29.599
they're even a bad team all of a sudden

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:31.009
I'm cheering for you know Albania it's

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:32.930
always the best team you got some

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:36.110
connection to maybe I'm overly

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.460
generalizing I don't know it's not like

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.469
they can wear a Canadian Jersey during

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.719
the World Cup will qualify for a world

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:46.940
cup of soccer since a year in 1986 also

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:48.740
it's called football I don't really want

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:55.009
to buy a red heart though I was hoping

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:58.250
to buy bombs oh it was a better value at

00:06:55.009 --> 00:07:01.419
least we can always we can always hold

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.419
that close to us but

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:06.300
sadly Jarrah flies would have been great

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.540
as well I mean we just literally cannot

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:11.340
afford it but now if you could drop a

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.919
red heart I'd be fine with it I don't

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.729
know we're kind of in a weird spot like

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:17.460
it's not bad

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:19.650
we got the Halo or stats are good dark

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:23.699
bums fantastic our speed isn't even that

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:26.280
bad considering we have considering we

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:27.479
have tourists fortunately or

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.460
unfortunately we're probably doing

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:31.290
enough damage that tourists will very

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.900
rarely see the light of day unless our

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:35.100
speed gets a lot higher and plus we're

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.139
probably gonna see it on this room cuz

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:40.050
apparently I was just wrong about that

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:46.020
but get dusted and there's of course our

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:48.169
bomb basically I go from like an 80 to a

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:51.900
98 percent chance of winning this run

00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:53.699
wow that was so bad in my head if we get

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.110
a red heart to drop so we can get a deal

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:56.039
with the devil on this floor now you

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.270
might be saying that's not plausible

00:07:56.039 --> 00:08:00.479
next you've already taken red heart

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:03.780
damage you're not wrong I just I started

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:05.970
that dialogue before I had taken damage

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:10.280
on that room as much as it pains me to

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:12.720
say a bit of a whip there where are the

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.729
don't don't add me okay cuz I just

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.260
realized I am an actual moron

00:08:14.729 --> 00:08:18.060
why don't you just use the lovers card

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.919
and get the spirit hearts you dummy

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.330
you're just holding on to it like it's

00:08:19.919 --> 00:08:22.440
gonna appreciate in value what do you

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.539
think it is a player unknowns

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:27.110
battlegrounds crate there you go let's

00:08:24.539 --> 00:08:30.120
let's talk about judging other people

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:32.039
more talk about like performing well I

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:35.190
don't want to blow up our donation

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:35.760
machine even if it might seem like the

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.169
right idea

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:42.570
I don't want to blow up our donation

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:46.320
machine it is an institution until it

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:49.160
gets to 999 it's innocent bad trip

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:52.350
that's not good cheers up is lovely

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:57.120
range up is lovely the tower is garbage

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:58.680
full help yeah okay dad hurt me deep in

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:02.690
my soul but at least we got two spirit

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:04.740
hearts out of it again not necessarily

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:07.740
knocking it out of the park on gameplay

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:09.060
here but due to the quality of our first

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.100
items it looks like we're probably gonna

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:13.110
be okay regardless so don't forget about

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.030
bombs why didn't you just I'm so linked

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.440
I'm out of touch in Isaac

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:20.910
right now why didn't we just use one of

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:22.950
our unlimited bombs to knock the the red

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:25.110
chest out instead of risking a spirit

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:27.810
heart the answer risk is I I forgot that

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:31.200
I had it which is not good it's really

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:33.330
banking on a speed upgrade there he said

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.340
we got a pretty sizable speed downgrade

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:38.340
so Taurus will continue to be a little

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.920
dubious in its usefulness but honestly I

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:42.150
think the fact that I've recognized

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.100
relatively early that I'm playing badly

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:46.500
will hopefully lead to me playing better

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:51.240
and that's not an excuse it's it's a cry

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:52.830
for help but think that hopefully we can

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.060
turn it around here we probably do want

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:57.000
to go back for blank card

00:09:54.060 --> 00:10:00.000
you know garbage speed or not garbage

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.870
speed great bit of damage right there a

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.160
very productive use of our limited

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:07.760
resources although we got a lot of red

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:11.030
hearts on this floor excuse me sir

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.030
thank you

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:23.050
well we could always use the pony please

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:25.449
to walk backwards to the shop and

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:26.980
that'll help us out in terms of giving

00:10:25.449 --> 00:10:28.660
us a little speed but actually now that

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:31.870
I think about it what's our speed with

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:38.769
the pony it's gonna start at 1.2 I'll

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:42.850
take it it's so much worse than blank

00:10:38.769 --> 00:10:47.410
card but it does give us a leg up on

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:49.600
making unmaking tourists pop so I'm

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:52.269
gonna go with it and you're gonna say

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.850
this is an idiotic decision and you may

00:10:52.269 --> 00:10:56.500
well be correct in your assessment it

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:59.860
also gives us the money or at least

00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:01.779
saves us the money that we already had

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:03.670
kept there and I think if we can get

00:11:01.779 --> 00:11:06.339
like to speed upgrades and just get

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:07.899
tourists to pop constantly this will be

00:11:06.339 --> 00:11:09.269
worth it as of right now it looks like a

00:11:07.899 --> 00:11:13.209
terrible decision though I'll admit

00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:14.740
hermit card a blood bank is of course

00:11:13.209 --> 00:11:16.870
another important thing and if we get a

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:20.319
an IV bag we'll probably just end up

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:22.089
rolling with dad as long as we can keep

00:11:20.319 --> 00:11:24.130
our red hearts up there at least but

00:11:22.089 --> 00:11:27.269
let's just give it a second but pop

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:33.310
probably a demon judgement is the first

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:36.040
priority here okay there's our first

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:40.000
speed upgrade and a health upgrade along

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:42.850
with it as well that's really good

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.529
that's another speed upgrade all of a

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:46.839
sudden this Pony decision is actually

00:11:44.529 --> 00:11:49.029
sort of worked out there's another speed

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:50.800
upgrade that one didn't count for some

00:11:49.029 --> 00:11:55.290
reason oh just Taurus like cap your

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:57.399
speed or maybe our speed got capped by

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:59.019
experimental treatment being kind of bad

00:11:57.399 --> 00:12:02.649
for us I don't know get out of there it

00:11:59.019 --> 00:12:04.240
was worth it well worth it actually sure

00:12:02.649 --> 00:12:05.850
hermit is like free boss rush so it's

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.089
not a huge deal right now though

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:14.870
[Music]

00:12:08.089 --> 00:12:16.999
come on dude come on this is getting a

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:19.339
little absurd I'm actually just using

00:12:16.999 --> 00:12:26.209
the chariot because I want to get it off

00:12:19.339 --> 00:12:28.639
the grounds you got me you got me I knew

00:12:26.209 --> 00:12:32.120
he had me he didn't have me you never

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:37.129
even had your car so we did miss out on

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:39.499
the boss trap room as a result but very

00:12:37.129 --> 00:12:41.480
little to complain about there I'm gonna

00:12:39.499 --> 00:12:43.009
complain about my brain being like

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:46.819
wicked slow right now for whatever

00:12:43.009 --> 00:12:48.170
reason but again hopefully once we work

00:12:46.819 --> 00:12:50.059
the cobwebs out here we can have a

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:52.399
stronger run cuz I'm pleased with where

00:12:50.059 --> 00:12:55.790
the run is standing I'm not that pleased

00:12:52.399 --> 00:12:57.439
with the way that the the damage has

00:12:55.790 --> 00:13:02.209
come in so far it's been very very

00:12:57.439 --> 00:13:04.579
sloppy play in the same way like I don't

00:13:02.209 --> 00:13:06.680
mind a loss as long as we play well I'm

00:13:04.579 --> 00:13:08.660
not that titillated by a win even when

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:11.689
just because we played like garbage so

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:14.240
I'd prefer to kind of get it all under

00:13:11.689 --> 00:13:16.009
control here I'll go deep on this deal

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.740
with the devil I mean we just got to HP

00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:20.689
from the floor so start working on the

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:23.870
gup-e dream still got three HP left as

00:13:20.689 --> 00:13:30.740
is the pact is well we're thinking in

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:32.059
the worst of times and I'll accept as

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.889
well blank card would have been pretty

00:13:32.059 --> 00:13:36.319
interesting with that dice shard

00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:39.350
so take telepathy for dummies oh we

00:13:36.319 --> 00:13:42.009
don't need the pony anymore it's better

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:44.720
than telepathy for dummies so we'll

00:13:42.009 --> 00:13:46.970
that'll lower our rate of fire but I

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:50.300
think we can afford to get a little more

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:53.029
audacious with our plays here now that

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:56.209
we're capped at 1.5 speed we can pretty

00:13:53.029 --> 00:13:59.019
much go with whatever we want for a

00:13:56.209 --> 00:13:59.019
space bar item

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:03.880
sure why not

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:14.570
so the glowing hourglass will eventually

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:17.149
become the hourglass what if we used

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:19.420
glowing hourglass for in the past to

00:14:17.149 --> 00:14:21.200
rewind time so you don't get hit by

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.730
enemies and lose your deal with the

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:26.930
devil chance probably not too likely to

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:29.959
happen here to possibly have a different

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:32.089
item show up after a boss fight although

00:14:29.959 --> 00:14:33.529
I'm thinking to myself right now that's

00:14:32.089 --> 00:14:36.910
not how this works the items are

00:14:33.529 --> 00:14:41.390
actually programmed by the scene so I

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:43.580
don't know well we'll figure it out I do

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:47.570
remember that after like three uses it

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:54.500
becomes the normal hourglass again which

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:56.029
is pretty silly but that implies there

00:14:54.500 --> 00:15:02.779
must be some kind of like incredible

00:14:56.029 --> 00:15:04.250
power contained within it right I knew

00:15:02.779 --> 00:15:04.670
that at one point I had a handle on this

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.500
item

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:08.450
mm maybe we should have gotten mom's

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.740
perfume because that would have maybe

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.240
allowed us to benefit a little further

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.160
from the torn photo although I don't

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:18.800
think so it's a danger when you hit like

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:20.750
the stat caps really quickly as I think

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:23.360
we have here because now I find myself

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:24.709
like looking like a moron and I'd should

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.170
look like a moron for some of the plays

00:15:24.709 --> 00:15:29.089
that I made earlier but I want to be

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:31.130
rightly held as a moron for the moronic

00:15:29.089 --> 00:15:32.810
decisions I've made not wrongly held as

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.430
a moron for not understanding the finer

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:37.300
points of you know stat caps and the

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.300
details therein

00:15:38.499 --> 00:15:44.109
I do enough stupid things in this game

00:15:42.039 --> 00:15:46.089
then I can oh that's pretty good

00:15:44.109 --> 00:15:52.059
although the tears up might not affect

00:15:46.089 --> 00:15:54.869
us again well it does this time although

00:15:52.059 --> 00:15:59.349
your mileage may vary on that discourse

00:15:54.869 --> 00:16:01.839
did a range downgrade might be either

00:15:59.349 --> 00:16:04.359
way though uh pretty solid I mean again

00:16:01.839 --> 00:16:06.099
it's it's a run that whether or not it

00:16:04.359 --> 00:16:07.959
deserves it it's in a very very strong

00:16:06.099 --> 00:16:12.579
position right now and we should really

00:16:07.959 --> 00:16:14.259
try for everything unfortunately

00:16:12.579 --> 00:16:16.929
everything in this case basically comes

00:16:14.259 --> 00:16:21.699
down to definitely make sure that you go

00:16:16.929 --> 00:16:24.789
to the dark room and if you see dad's

00:16:21.699 --> 00:16:28.959
key take it apart from that we don't

00:16:24.789 --> 00:16:30.339
really need anything else or we can't

00:16:28.959 --> 00:16:35.109
really benefit from anything else on the

00:16:30.339 --> 00:16:36.729
post-it note at least what if you could

00:16:35.109 --> 00:16:38.019
use it now we're not gonna get dad's key

00:16:36.729 --> 00:16:39.219
on the chest because we're not going to

00:16:38.019 --> 00:16:40.329
the chest I was thinking if you could

00:16:39.219 --> 00:16:41.289
use it to rear all the items in the

00:16:40.329 --> 00:16:43.179
chest but I'm assuming they're

00:16:41.289 --> 00:16:46.929
controlled by the seat as well so I

00:16:43.179 --> 00:16:48.879
don't know maybe maybe if Krampus gives

00:16:46.929 --> 00:16:51.089
us Krampus his head will try to re-roll

00:16:48.879 --> 00:16:51.089
it

00:16:53.110 --> 00:17:00.399
I know myself too well I am gonna be

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:02.440
holding on to this item with full

00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:04.720
charges until the end of time let's go

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:07.000
back for a second you know this is where

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:10.110
I'm gonna let myself stand on the

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.559
shoulders of giants blowing our glass

00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:13.559
Isaac okay

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:22.209
notes synergies pawn usage Isaac will be

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:23.319
returned to the previous room and

00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:27.010
everything that happened in the current

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:30.400
room will be undone certain consumables

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:34.620
do not get rescored health bombs coins

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.620
keys items and trinkets will be restored

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:43.220
donations to the donation machine are

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:45.410
not reverted and they can be reset into

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:53.120
working state once jammed okay that

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:55.100
seems interesting 48 hour energy pill

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:59.570
allows for infinite usage as the pill

00:17:55.100 --> 00:18:01.010
gets refunded upon use sharp plug allows

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:03.790
for infinite usage as long as you have

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:03.790
more than two hearts

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:08.900
kirsta the tower if used quickly after

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.790
taking damaged

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:13.400
troll bombs will spawn in the previous

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:16.040
room if you have safety scissors these

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:18.860
will be harnessed as normal dude I don't

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:20.930
know I feel like I'm in over my head

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:22.550
here how about this with curse of the

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:23.990
blind glowing our glass can be used to

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:25.280
pick up or purchase an unknown item to

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:27.680
see what it is then decide whether or

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.960
not to undo picking it up that's more my

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:32.810
speed you know you guys are giving me

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:35.000
these PhD lessons in the binding of

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:36.410
issac afterbirth Plus and I'm choosing

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.150
to willfully remain ignorant and then

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:43.640
turn it back on you as if somehow it's

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:49.850
your fault but to be honest with you who

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:52.340
needs to harvest infinite bombs one in

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:53.960
like 1500 runs when the synergy is

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.820
possible it might happen dude here's our

00:18:53.960 --> 00:19:00.890
chance

00:18:54.820 --> 00:19:03.710
odd mushroom it's actually a good idea

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:05.180
not to take it because it just lowers

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:08.150
our damage because our rate of fire is

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:09.920
already at the camp dude look at that we

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:14.510
actually used it effectively thanks

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:16.340
binding of issac wiki I never would have

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:17.690
expected that immediately after learning

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.880
what it does we would be able to put it

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:22.520
to the test it's like it's too much of

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:24.590
an engineered environment I'm very happy

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:26.380
ok so it's extremely important by the

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:28.700
way don't get distracted

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:32.300
something-something you know the

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:34.280
Undertaker mankind etc etc but in our

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:37.040
notes most important thing take the

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:39.470
negative when you beat mom which is the

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:41.299
item on the rights you don't need to

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:45.030
overthink it

00:19:41.299 --> 00:19:46.559
this room if you give me shoopdawhoop

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:48.150
all tanky because we just as far as I'm

00:19:46.559 --> 00:19:52.260
concerned I just made my best glowing

00:19:48.150 --> 00:20:01.200
hourglass play ever thank you you're a

00:19:52.260 --> 00:20:03.090
gentleman and or a scholar let us go we

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.169
got the time honestly I would take IV

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:11.280
bag then we can make good use of it

00:20:06.169 --> 00:20:16.010
pretty good if nothing else at least

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:18.330
we're getting more damage for this floor

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:19.730
which if we end up doing boss rush is a

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:24.000
big how because you've already done hush

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:29.490
yes we could also do delirium I guess I

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:33.330
I acted as if nice also pretty good but

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:34.860
I acted as if only mega Satan was a

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:36.390
possible outcome for us but we have

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:39.559
never done

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:41.789
delirium on this character Samson so

00:20:39.559 --> 00:20:44.159
we're able to get the portal which is

00:20:41.789 --> 00:20:45.600
largely luck although we could will it

00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:47.900
into existence by going to the hush but

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:54.419
I don't want to do that I want to defeat

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:56.070
I want to defeat the lamb so I can get

00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:59.720
the post-it note filled in and then go

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:59.720
down to the Delirium floor but

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:09.210
I digress how in the world are you not

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:11.460
dead tanky as bosses in the game would

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:13.020
be dead from a treatment like that at

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:17.070
this point by the way we got 14 damage

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:21.450
four rate of fire shoopdawhoop it's a

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:25.230
pretty ideal time to try - wow it's a

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:28.890
pretty ideal time to try to go to greed

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:31.710
mode in my brain what is you doing it's

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:32.910
an ideal time to go to boss rush I think

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:35.580
even if we don't know what any of the

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:40.020
items are so I'm actually gonna era this

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:43.590
right here got a two of clubs basically

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:52.710
we got a tool club's not particularly

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:55.080
strong take the item on the rights go to

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:57.780
boss rush take the item in the top left

00:21:55.080 --> 00:22:04.020
linger beam this was not worth the time

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:05.220
investment but life goes on who knows

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.630
the item at the end of this could be

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.920
worth the time investment sure we could

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.660
have used glowing hourglass to avoid

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:12.150
this but shoopdawhoop is gonna like

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:14.460
stomp on so many of these enemies that

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:15.929
you know what it's going fast enough

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:17.550
that linger beam may well have been

00:22:15.929 --> 00:22:19.470
worth the time investment I may have

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:23.120
been incorrect in my assessment even if

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:23.120
it's not a particularly strong item

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:29.790
turns out 14.8 damage times two times

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:31.950
the number of ticks in the duration of

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:34.890
shoopdawhoop is a relatively good

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:37.890
motivator for bosses to get the heck out

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:40.880
of the way of this astral plane before

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:40.880
they go insane

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:49.930
more enemies that spawn in at the same

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:52.730
time and then stand still please

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:57.170
turns out that's a pretty easy strat for

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:59.090
us to take advantage of we haven't had a

00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:00.830
huge stop like this on boss rush in a

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:03.050
while like you need it there's only a

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:05.630
few items in the game that really really

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:07.130
allow you to poop on enemies during boss

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.580
try shoopdawhoop is definitely one of

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:10.940
them

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:12.860
I mean shoopdawhoop actually just

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:15.800
obliterated the fallin before it even

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:17.930
entered its second stage which to be

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:19.310
honest with you I actually didn't know

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:20.600
was possible even though I've probably

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:27.590
seen it like 20 times

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:32.080
I don't feel too bad about getting rid

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:32.080
of blank card we could have had 99 bombs

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:36.320
what if we gave you 99 of these it's me

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.640
holding up my middle finger I'm just

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:40.040
joking I would never do that I'm a

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:41.360
respectful boy I'd wait til you had your

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:44.890
back turn and then I do the sucka

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.890
gesture from the Generation X

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:57.279
Wow

00:23:52.889 --> 00:23:59.080
Taurus it's doing business for us I'm

00:23:57.279 --> 00:24:00.190
never sad to pick up Taurus well that's

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:03.249
not true there have been a couple of

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:05.110
times it's cost me when I run I still I

00:24:03.249 --> 00:24:07.539
do it knowingly you know there was a

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:12.549
period probably like two years ago even

00:24:07.539 --> 00:24:14.590
where I didn't even realize that Taurus

00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:16.419
was a speed downgrade now I'm well aware

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:18.639
of the consequences I just usually

00:24:16.419 --> 00:24:20.499
choose to try to absorb them instead of

00:24:18.639 --> 00:24:22.419
just abstaining

00:24:20.499 --> 00:24:24.820
I like the invincibility from Taurus and

00:24:22.419 --> 00:24:26.789
if we can get to two speed which again I

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:29.049
don't really understand why we can't I

00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:35.409
don't understand why we're camped I

00:24:29.049 --> 00:24:39.549
guess I'd be I'd be a little happier but

00:24:35.409 --> 00:24:40.869
you keep taking those tears like instant

00:24:39.549 --> 00:24:42.279
invincibility is really good although

00:24:40.869 --> 00:24:44.049
you know as soon as I got instant

00:24:42.279 --> 00:24:47.110
invincibility I'd probably be like my

00:24:44.049 --> 00:24:50.799
tears there's more damage our actual

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:54.940
damage is not that good on any floor

00:24:50.799 --> 00:24:56.740
where we're able to find a blood bank we

00:24:54.940 --> 00:25:01.299
can get to a very dominating strategy

00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:02.919
you know we can get to 14 damage plus if

00:25:01.299 --> 00:25:04.629
we can't find a blood bank and we're not

00:25:02.919 --> 00:25:07.149
in the business of taking unreasonable

00:25:04.629 --> 00:25:09.580
amounts of damage it's a little bit more

00:25:07.149 --> 00:25:11.649
of a stretch you know I think we've been

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:13.960
hit once here so we probably have five

00:25:11.649 --> 00:25:15.820
damage it's well over based damage but

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.559
not that good for the womb it's our rate

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.940
of fire that's carrying us to be honest

00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:20.289
with you and then you know lump of coal

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:22.799
probably doesn't hurt crickets body

00:25:20.289 --> 00:25:22.799
doesn't hurt

00:25:25.159 --> 00:25:38.029
and dark bum giving us five spirit arts

00:25:30.799 --> 00:25:43.610
per floor doesn't hurt either help me

00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:46.549
help me there we go um chariots perfect

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:47.899
for a blood bank and there's a chance we

00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:49.130
could get one on the next floor I might

00:25:47.899 --> 00:25:52.190
just use it on the boss though we got a

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:54.080
good deal with the devil chance two

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:55.820
items away from becoming guppy already

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:59.149
fought Krampus it's like the golden zone

00:25:55.820 --> 00:26:05.029
for us to to get a quick deal with the

00:25:59.149 --> 00:26:07.450
devil and then just steamroll my knock

00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:10.460
back actually knocked that enemy into me

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:14.899
it's like some mr. bean level nonsense

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:17.899
okay teratoma get absolutely dusty will

00:26:14.899 --> 00:26:22.490
save chariot we got our own built-in

00:26:17.899 --> 00:26:24.620
chariot if we need it No Deal you insult

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:29.620
me sir at least we have a hundred

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:29.620
percent on the next floor but it hurts

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:34.850
it's hard not to be offended is in my

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:45.440
head sixty seven percent might as well

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:47.120
be a hundred explains my GPA you know

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.409
what kid it is sixty seven percent is an

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:51.470
a now I'm becoming like a self

00:26:48.409 --> 00:26:56.419
caricature sixty seven percent is not an

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:57.769
A in Canada but we also don't internet

00:26:56.419 --> 00:27:00.230
been over this a hundred times we don't

00:26:57.769 --> 00:27:02.059
use the GPA system that much we tend to

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:04.039
use that we can make it we tend to use

00:27:02.059 --> 00:27:05.960
numerical averages because I don't

00:27:04.039 --> 00:27:07.580
understand America's always got to

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.870
complicate things now we can't have the

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:11.840
metric system we got to have our own

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:13.549
system Oh what's what's your GPA I don't

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:15.019
know what an GPA is you know we just use

00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:17.450
the numbers that we get out of a hundred

00:27:15.019 --> 00:27:20.389
you use the numbers what are you convert

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:22.009
the numbers to a an arbitrary series of

00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:24.679
letters and then convert the letters

00:27:22.009 --> 00:27:26.210
back into an arbitrary ratio of numbers

00:27:24.679 --> 00:27:28.460
it's it's just too much I don't

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:30.810
understand it

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:32.430
nothing said can't be that simple it's

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:35.640
like we got someone on the inside trying

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:38.360
to you know be a job creator someone's

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:41.220
got to be at work at the GPA calculator

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:43.710
what's your GPA oh I've got a three

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:46.170
point nine nine nine one three four five

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:48.780
because although I got a b-minus in

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:50.460
freshman year Jim I did take an IB

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:52.380
quantum physics class

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:54.060
so hopefully Harvard doesn't hold it

00:27:52.380 --> 00:28:01.650
against me I don't get it okay

00:27:54.060 --> 00:28:03.630
it could be so much simpler I'm getting

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:04.770
on my soapbox I don't even understand

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:10.790
what I'm talking about

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:14.280
I just get cheese cuz I'm like in Canada

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:17.850
at least in yeah well let's make it

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:21.780
exciting right in in the province where

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:25.710
I grew up at least an a you pass it

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:28.050
fifty and an a is eighty to ninety nine

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:31.320
an a-plus and ninety six or whatever but

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:33.090
um and then everyone goes well you went

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:35.190
to like a bad school how do you know

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:37.800
it's the number one most presumptuous

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:41.030
thing I've ever heard in my life yeah we

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:43.170
got bad doctors cuz they pass in fifty

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:45.240
I'll tell you one thing if we got bad

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:46.710
doctors you got terrible doctors cuz all

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:49.350
our doctors go over there cuz they can

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:53.360
make more money you're inheriting our

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:53.360
bad doctors don't sound so smug about it

00:28:56.710 --> 00:29:01.420
thing is you're competing against people

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:02.950
not who have AIDS come on you're

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:06.940
competing against people who have you

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:08.980
know 86 is there 90 ones it's not a GPA

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:10.360
based system I think all almost went

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:12.370
down to the wrong floor but I've been

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:14.290
over this so many times I don't care to

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:18.510
talk about it again even though I've

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:21.250
wilfully chose to nothing there so we're

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:24.160
mildly diced up right now we don't need

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:25.840
that anymore because we're out of we're

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:28.840
out of red hearts but we're mildly

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:34.000
spiced up I should say this run

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:36.610
shouldn't be too hard and keep in mind

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.800
you know child's hard dark bomb good

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:42.580
combination the first floor

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.740
teleportation of the deal with the devil

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:49.270
is paying dividends for us wrapping

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:52.510
around here I guess I couldn't I

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:54.520
wouldn't help myself though if I was if

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:56.260
I was a young whippersnapper still to

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:58.540
this day and I was talking to someone

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:59.830
that was from like you know Finland and

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:01.990
they were like in Finland a

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:05.650
forty-percent is a pass I'd be like you

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:07.840
guys must be stupid up there in my head

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:09.340
outwardly I'd be like that's an inferior

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.740
system because I've grown up on this one

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:14.170
my whole life and I'm used to it it's

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:15.190
not like you know if someone gets a 50%

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:17.530
in ninth grade

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:20.590
you know geography we go oh that guy is

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:22.960
a smart guy you still go that guy got a

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:25.840
50 that's not a good mark they just

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:28.330
happen to get course credit I have taken

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.470
some college classes that I find

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:31.270
hilarious if you want to make fun of

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:33.160
something about the Canadian education

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:34.720
system and I think there's something to

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:36.250
be made fun of them probably in every

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:41.970
country's education system

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:44.890
oh no but the thing that's funny is that

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:47.220
so I'm in like I don't know if you knew

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:51.340
this but take some classes in the

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:54.520
computer science field the classes some

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:56.980
of them have a 50% passing grade but if

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:59.040
you don't get a 60 or higher you can't

00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:02.740
take the next course in the track so

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:04.740
conceivably you could pass a class but

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:07.630
not have passed it well enough that the

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:09.520
the Dean could just be like well you get

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:12.100
the credit but you also have to trance

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:13.390
or to some other program which i think

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:16.810
is hilarious

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:18.760
now I don't dispute the idea that you

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:21.670
know if you don't understand computer

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:23.050
science 101 at a 60% or greater level

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:28.090
you're probably gonna struggle in

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:29.770
computer science you know 463 however I

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:32.500
do feel for the people who find

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:36.730
themselves in that awkward you know 50

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:39.850
to 59 range got to retake the course

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:41.980
especially cuz like this is not to say a

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:43.600
lot of the people watching this don't

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.790
stand there a lot of the people watching

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.510
this are younger than myself and you

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:48.310
know if you're going through college

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:49.900
you're going through universities for

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:51.910
the first time you know you're like 18

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:53.530
to 22 I'm not saying you got nothing

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:56.050
going on in your life that could

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:57.730
possibly take interest over school but

00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:59.950
I'm in night classes now and sometimes

00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:02.230
I'll talk to like my lab partner and be

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:03.490
like he'll be like oh hey I didn't do so

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:05.560
well on the lab and I bet Oh what

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:07.090
happened he's like oh you know my kid is

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:09.310
sick and I'm like yeah well that's a

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:12.070
great excuse I feel for the people that

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:13.690
get mega burn like that but you know

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:16.210
it's also what are you gonna do you do

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:19.150
have to test people give me dad's keys

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:20.200
somehow when I was in college

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:22.750
oh why didn't you do well on the

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:30.700
assignment didn't feel like it when it

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:33.900
saw a movie instead I can relate to that

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:33.900
I've been there

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:40.200
why didn't you come to class yesterday

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:42.090
it was early I've been that guy I'm not

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.470
looking down on you that's why my number

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:45.090
one advice to you whenever you know

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:46.560
every August September I start being

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:48.510
preachy about school which apparently

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:51.360
you know is happening literally right

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:53.250
now I bring up the fact sometimes people

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:55.200
you know tweet me or even send me an

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:57.210
email and goal again LM starting college

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:58.590
in September what advice would you give

00:32:57.210 --> 00:33:02.550
me number one piece of advice go to

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:03.840
class you or someone you love is paying

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:05.100
for it even if you got a full

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.240
scholarship what you don't love the

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:08.610
government they're paying for your

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:09.870
college you better love them it might

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:12.530
not be the government paying it might be

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:16.590
the kind round foundation for all I know

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:18.870
anyway the point is go to class you're

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:23.610
paying for it but you know have fun as

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:25.050
well find yourself cultivate a good

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:27.480
sleep schedule so you don't end up to

00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:29.580
being a youtuber not sure if that's

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:33.870
enough if that's a threat or a benefit

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:35.670
but well let's do a s wot analysis to

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:39.840
figure out yeah I've taken intro to

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:42.960
marketing what of it I'm pretty much a

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:46.110
financial genius check it out

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:48.380
I took econ 101 the first year

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:51.300
introductory economics class by

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:56.150
correspondence that's right I got my

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:57.960
online credit in first year economics

00:33:56.150 --> 00:34:04.430
you ever hear of a little thing called

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:04.430
supply and demand me too

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:14.310
a bit of a sloppy run here I got it I

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:18.210
gotta admit let's finish this bad boy

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:21.270
off I actually at this point that's

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:24.450
gonna I kinda hope we're not gonna get

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:27.570
delirium because I don't trust ourselves

00:34:24.450 --> 00:34:32.910
to make it through it that was just a

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:35.880
terrible missplay right there um maybe

00:34:32.910 --> 00:34:38.850
we should just Bank the fact that we're

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:41.669
likely about to win not do a victory lap

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:43.169
yet no delirium exes do you only get

00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:44.790
delirium after the chest I don't know

00:34:43.169 --> 00:34:47.550
anyway we all like blood rites in

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:49.530
Samson's lock both useful items blood

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:50.040
rights I don't respect as much as I

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:52.140
probably should

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:54.929
Samson's lock kind of in the same boat

00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:56.040
but one more thing ticked off the

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:57.240
