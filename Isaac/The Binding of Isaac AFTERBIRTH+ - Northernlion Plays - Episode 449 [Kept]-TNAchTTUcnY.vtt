00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.410
hey everybody welcome back and reliant

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.760
plays The Binding of Isaac and for the

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.440
Plus did we do greedier we did just do

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.880
greedy or didn't we one likely order oh

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.929
wait maybe we did maybe we didn't but

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.730
either way we got to play the keeper

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.619
it's just it is what it is we got to get

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.449
some keeper punishment done I'm excited

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.960
it's been forever here's our keeper boy

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:26.420
g1n pd3 OD oh my god we don't have the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:30.929
Wooden Nickel unlocked how do you unlock

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.369
the Wooden Nickel as the keeper I got to

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.110
refresh my memory here so the keeper

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.000
gets two cents every time he picks up a

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.670
coin it can either give him money or

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.320
heal them the only kind of thing we want

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.030
out of a tinted rock is small rock

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.719
because we can't get any form of HP

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.250
without having the Wooden Nickel I

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.690
wouldn't say it's impossible but it's

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.770
extremely unlikely that we'll succeed

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.000
which is exactly why we have to try

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.109
because it would be hilarious for us to

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.010
accomplish essentially anything on a on

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.049
a run without having the Wooden Nickel

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:10.619
I'm gonna try probably here for a secret

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.479
room probably not there so I'm gonna

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.070
save our other bombs we don't even again

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.450
like really care about using bombs to

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.979
open tinted rocks but you never know

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.210
when these bombs are gonna be valuable I

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.119
bet that being said I'm gonna use them

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.900
to open tinted rocks cuz if we get small

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:32.220
rock that would be pretty big can't take

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:35.189
that we gotta have a certain affinity

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.689
for for risk to enjoy playing as the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.880
keeper I think you got to respect the

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.909
fact that you know we can pretty much

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.909
die two bedrooms we're dead

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.400
leave that coin there for now and

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.030
without anything that gives us extra

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.830
money we're in a very strange spot like

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.940
normally wouldn't occur would give us a

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.979
good chance but then we got the piggy

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.210
bank that could have shown up in the

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.790
shop that could have helped us out as

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.290
well to a clubs not necessarily bad I

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.900
think I'm just gonna go I know we're

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:09.610
leaving behind a few coins doesn't

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.410
bother me too much thanks to the map we

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.810
can actually see where we're going at

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.770
all times we might not want a deal with

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.870
the devil that's the other thing I'm

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.640
just reminding myself you know what the

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.620
best practices are when you play as the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.170
keeper for right now it doesn't matter

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.350
too much I think the best practice is

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.080
stay alive as pithy as that might sound

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.900
yeah I think you just pop it as Pythias

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.820
that might sound it's it's also darn

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.360
true come on

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.350
do I have Guppies tail or something I'm

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.230
not saying you should have give me small

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.060
rock but you know give me give me flies

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:48.670
don't give me a lock that being said I

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:52.660
will open it money and bombs we should

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.850
probably start throwing or leaving money

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.930
on the ground instead of always picking

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.330
it up because it's gonna create a

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.040
situation that's untenable for us pretty

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.959
quickly eventually we're gonna get hit

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.459
the runs not that strong I mean if we're

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.799
gonna have no spacebar item shoopdawhoop

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.720
is actually a pretty good one to to get

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.720
saddled with early on

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.050
oh dude that's amazing so we can

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.920
actually take a one hard deal we'll take

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.350
dark matter

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.640
we'll take magic mush to buff us up we

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.770
could have taken the pill in the interim

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.020
period but this run actually is looking

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:30.820
okay right now and again we don't need

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:33.430
to beat every floor we don't need to win

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:37.270
the whole run I should say to make this

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.910
run worth doing we only need to beat mom

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:43.930
or boss rush well I guess you have to

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.820
beat mom to beat Basra we only have to

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.580
beat mom to unlock something I don't

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.570
know what it'll unlock but we'll it

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.680
would be the Wooden Nickel probably not

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.630
eventually we're gonna need that but

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.489
dude this is I I relish these

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.620
opportunities because this is like

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.510
nothing ventured nothing gained right

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.630
like we're actually not taking a big

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.220
risk by my opinion at least we're not

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.620
taking a big risk and playing the keeper

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.630
without a Wooden Nickel because if

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.820
nobody expects us to win so if we win

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.100
it's gonna be remarkable and if we lose

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.570
while giving it a good try

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.410
most people will be like you know what

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.300
good try he threw it at the wall to see

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.940
what would stick and maybe it worked

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.430
maybe it didn't but either way I think

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.940
that's it boo grudgingly admire it might

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.270
be a good way to describe it but we'll

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.800
see

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.860
right now we are like the the run is

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.410
overpowered the only problem is getting

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.660
it twice renders me like actually

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.050
completely dead so we'll take this and

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.600
open no cram pose no Krampus copy

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.729
transformation would be pretty big an

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.979
update is available for Adobe Creative

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.840
Cloud I know you were like where's the

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.110
Creative Cloud notifications it's still

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.110
there

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.140
one day we'll take care of that well is

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.330
it probably like hundreds of kilobytes

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.740
in that update I don't have time for

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.740
that okay I'm a busy man

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.300
might take mere seconds to download and

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:24.060
implement thanks to the hard working

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:27.180
software engineers at Adobe more like a

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.240
don't ask me if I want to update anymore

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.100
please

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:36.110
we could probably earn a free key out of

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:38.699
that without getting ourselves too hurt

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.350
but the puzzle has potentially

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:43.320
catastrophic implications if we mess it

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.540
up um I'm just you know I'm gonna

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:49.919
exercise my right to not take an item

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:51.900
I'm not gonna take my reflection and the

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:55.740
reason for that is because I think it's

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:57.300
probably not very good at least right

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.010
now we're gonna head down to the next

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.060
floor it's kind of hard for me but kind

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.190
of hard for me to believe that five

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.370
minutes in we're actually on the fourth

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.370
floor

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.770
don't flatter yourself but it's five

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:12.570
minutes at eight seconds I also think I

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.000
I think I have a bad habit in Isaac I

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:17.460
think I play up to or down to the

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.450
quality of my run I don't know if it's

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:24.510
sports psychological or what but think

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:26.250
the better or run the worse I play the

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.620
higher the stakes are the better I play

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.970
I could easily you know I could be

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.530
trying to spin that into a positive

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.389
plays well under pressure

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.300
yeah but it also you know you could spin

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:37.530
it into a negative takes good runs for

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.440
granted puts himself in a dangerous

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:43.710
situation I'm gonna try to abuse it for

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:46.650
my advantage right now if I do indeed

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:49.380
have that kind of tendency but you know

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.820
it's with the knowledge that you know

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.240
it's sweet now but it could be sour

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.240
later

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.440
I don't like that sweet is the de facto

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.200
oh my lord

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.390
little Chad obviously irrelevant I don't

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:08.080
like that the sweet is that sweet is the

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:11.800
de facto like number one this tastes

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:17.470
good sort of tastes you know I'm a fan

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:19.330
of bitter I like beer I like coffee I'm

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:21.270
not that much of a fan of sweet I mean

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.650
everybody's a fan of it to some degree

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:25.930
sweet doesn't just mean cookies for

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:27.010
example but still was I scared that we

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:31.360
would die there yeah I didn't want to

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:34.110
let on though can't get that

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.190
unfortunately um we're gonna explore

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:40.440
looking for a second secret room maybe

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:44.010
you think that little Chad can drop

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:48.400
coins for us he probably drops flies

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:50.530
come on are you gonna rip me off on

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.720
secret room access like this we can't

00:07:50.530 --> 00:08:00.700
actually go in here now we got a check

00:07:52.720 --> 00:08:02.800
right turns out that no we did not have

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:07.720
to check so we came very close to death

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:10.900
there who's our other boss come on just

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:14.700
a single coin that's all we need not

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.700
that bad but could go terribly wrong

00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:25.499
actually the fear shot is a liability

00:08:22.439 --> 00:08:29.009
here be really nice to kill him before

00:08:25.499 --> 00:08:35.130
he shoots again we're alive and we're

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:42.360
still alive okay like cool but I need

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:45.449
the coins dude okay those are those are

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:48.300
flies as mentioned coins please good

00:08:45.449 --> 00:08:49.920
lord I am okay that's fine it worked I

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:54.000
was gonna say I've never worked this

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:56.070
hard normally you want items that give

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.600
you coins this situation we want coins

00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.889
they give us items we're just very lucky

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.889
I guess that the item was a coin

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:07.019
we've still only been hit once on this

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:08.579
entire run though I mean stats wise it's

00:09:07.019 --> 00:09:10.350
a high-quality run don't get me wrong

00:09:08.579 --> 00:09:12.930
you know what we could really use is a

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:15.899
tears upgrade our damage can get us out

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:18.209
of a pinch monsters tooth some bad item

00:09:15.899 --> 00:09:20.600
for us right now our damage can get us

00:09:18.209 --> 00:09:23.880
out of a pinch but it would be better oh

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:28.850
that's not bad actually it would be

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.850
better if we could shoot more frequently

00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:37.230
should have blown myself up all of that

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:38.730
one hurts that hurts a lot cuz we

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:41.519
absolutely could have had it we just

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:43.319
walked into a room that was oh I felt a

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:44.639
sinking feeling in my stomach as soon as

00:09:43.319 --> 00:09:46.860
I took that first bit of damage there

00:09:44.639 --> 00:09:50.420
could've just blown ourselves up would

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:52.589
have probably been fine um Wooden Nickel

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:54.949
Isaac how do you unlock this garbage

00:09:52.589 --> 00:09:54.949
item

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:06.380
how do you how do you unlock it donate

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:08.630
30 coins to the greed machine this is a

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:11.180
starting item for keeper after he beats

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:12.470
Isaac okay so we kind of squandered that

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:16.029
because that was like a really good run

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:18.500
you gotta beat Isaac with the keeper and

00:10:16.029 --> 00:10:20.450
then you get it still you know it's not

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.930
like we had a 12 out of 10 running

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:23.240
failed

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:25.760
we had a momentary brain fart on a room

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:27.170
that is actually probably the number one

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.990
room that people complain about in this

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:33.110
game so although I still think that

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:35.810
maybe room that almost every time I get

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:37.400
hit on with the freaking the blue spiked

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:39.140
turrets is probably a little bit more

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:42.529
annoying cuz I'm on that room you can

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:44.480
get away without taking damage I pretty

00:10:42.529 --> 00:10:48.800
much just stood in place I decided to

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:51.589
let in action you know decide my fate we

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:55.940
still would like petrified poop even

00:10:51.589 --> 00:10:58.250
regular poop is okay here sorry I'm just

00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:01.490
Dee hood eing cuz it's getting quite

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.810
warm in here even a regular poop we can

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:06.830
do okay with if it gives us the

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:12.760
occasional coin but yeah we're really

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:12.760
looking out for like if possible

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:19.640
petrified poop is a trinket that was

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:21.920
really bad damage don't eat see relax

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:24.140
you're not in a bad spot we're looking

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:28.339
out for petrified poop as a trinket

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:31.070
swallowed penny as a trinket anything

00:11:28.339 --> 00:11:32.270
along these lines helps us out it looks

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:35.660
like we got a spirit art out of that

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:37.339
poop so we got flies okay there's our

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.570
coin we will pick up the other coins

00:11:37.339 --> 00:11:44.089
because if we get an arcade we can get a

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:46.420
speed upgrade or IV bag from from the

00:11:44.089 --> 00:11:49.010
arcade you can pretty much play the

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:52.970
blood bank until it pays out one way or

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:55.190
the other for now we're back kind of in

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:56.480
the garbage pile we're gonna get out of

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.920
this floor as quickly as we can

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.209
I'm not that worried about having five

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.970
cents even though I said an RK to be

00:11:59.209 --> 00:12:04.910
useful because sometimes the blood bank

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:07.270
or IV bag it maybe both don't pay out as

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:09.620
greed I remember that specifically and

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:10.510
it's extremely annoying when you have

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.550
very limited HP

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:14.230
play around with I mean that's really

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:15.850
good would have been nice to leverage it

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:25.000
for a deal with the devil but so be it

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:29.200
still good seller too touchy room very

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.960
very touchy room trying to use the poop

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.940
on the room most of the time because

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.610
that way if it pays out with poop or

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:38.050
sorry if it pays out with a coin

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:39.730
we'll have that coin on the room that we

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:41.230
get hit on it kind of insulates us very

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:45.700
slightly from getting it twice on the

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:47.320
same room but again it continues to be a

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.210
delicate situation and all these greed

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.830
runs are gonna be a keeper runs are

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:57.040
gonna be a delicate situation to be fair

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:59.290
let's try it okay we basically have to

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:06.340
use poop as if it's the world's worst

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:08.440
Wooden Nickel it's gonna pay out like

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:10.360
you know once every 10 times with a

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.620
penny and we have to shoot it to get it

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.030
to pay out but we don't really have much

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:15.370
choice in the matter we kind of got a

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:16.720
swing for the fences and even if we miss

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:19.210
you know will land in left field and

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:22.660
they could bobble that errors happen to

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:25.090
me in the MLB all the time often times

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:29.440
once per game one player will make an

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:32.110
error all the time

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:33.340
maybe a speed upgrade useful for dodging

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:37.290
exact situations like the one we just

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:37.290
had and this might be for the best

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:48.760
just watch out for that exact situation

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:51.460
you're guarding the coin is the thing we

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:55.570
made it we made it we made it uh.okay

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:58.780
free bomb you got a go Krampus his head

00:13:55.570 --> 00:14:00.460
so like on paper we still gotta find our

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.840
item room as well on paper you're gonna

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.830
look at that and go but Krampus is head

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.590
can't give you coins

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:07.330
yeah but indirectly you can save us

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:09.460
coins by essentially killing every boss

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:13.530
and probably one other nasty room per

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:18.720
floor so you like this one for example I

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:18.720
feel like this is the right decision

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:28.900
it's fine the odds of the poop saving me

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:31.440
are relatively low I think I think we're

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:33.610
I think we're in the clear to do this

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.900
plus we still the deal of the angel

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.610
potential now and I don't know if

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.960
there's many angel deals that are tenant

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:42.100
attend for the keeper specifically

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:44.890
obviously you know Sacred Heart could be

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:46.750
awesome trying to think of what else

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:49.230
would really work but it doesn't matter

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:51.580
too much right now we got good damage

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:54.850
spider bite is actually a pretty solid

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:56.770
tear effect for us here and we got two

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:58.090
extra flies for doing that way slower

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:59.350
than the last run but I mean that's

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:00.970
because we had ship to a braid off the

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:03.610
bat on the last run and ship the loop is

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:05.290
like god mode even when we had

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:07.210
relatively not that great damage

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:09.850
shoopdawhoop was was getting the job

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:14.050
done quarter please had a feeling of a

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:16.840
secret room at least but wow oh it's

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:21.040
swallowed penny disregard this is lovely

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:22.950
okay so now every time we get hit we're

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:26.020
gonna drop some coins

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:29.130
it doesn't render us on killable but it

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:29.130
makes us difficult to kill

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:41.450
at least more difficult to kill these

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:43.010
enemies are still nonsense luckily our

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:44.720
range is good though and I mean luckily

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:46.040
we got swallowed penny or potentially we

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.170
could have died right there was that

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.970
worth using Krampus is head probably not

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:52.580
in hindsight but you know what they say

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:56.690
about hindsight I didn't want to tell

00:15:52.580 --> 00:16:00.970
you I told us so but I did i freakin a

00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:09.170
toda so had to sense that a little bit

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:13.880
for the new YouTube age okay Tripta move

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:16.340
just give me shifted don't cut off my

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:19.430
head P down my neck and tell me it's

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:22.750
raining okay that's not a very nice

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:26.600
thing to do we definitely do not want a

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:28.480
friendly ball Krampus is said not the

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.350
best item in the game

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:32.720
remember when Krampus his head used to

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:35.800
be was it for charges instead of six

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:39.590
those were the days man

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:41.060
it was a big relative to the the size of

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:47.150
the scene that was a big controversy

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:49.610
when it was reverted it did make it a

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:51.860
much better item which might have been

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:55.810
the problem considering it shows up you

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:57.740
know every second run more or less

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:59.900
actually we're not that much slower than

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:01.460
we were on the last run mostly because

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.870
this floor has been a lot stronger for

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:06.040
us this will be a great time to get the

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:08.120
world's luckiest deal with the angel

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.199
even though we don't have any bombs but

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.209
it's not like we're gonna really try to

00:17:09.199 --> 00:17:14.660
fight mega Satan on this run anyway torn

00:17:11.209 --> 00:17:16.310
photo is twenty out of ten huge tears

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:18.589
upgrade for us the shot speed I don't

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:25.310
know if it's good or bad but the tears

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:26.930
upgrade is very very valuable we asked

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:29.050
for it on the last run and we got it now

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:32.350
that's fine by me okay so we're on

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:32.350
catacombs to

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:39.630
what do we need now I mean I hate to say

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:42.210
it but a little deal with the devil + HP

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:44.190
action wouldn't be that bad that's what

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:46.590
we used to give us that leverage to pick

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:47.760
up dark matter in the last run I

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:49.020
apologized by the way I'm gonna be a

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.210
little bit more focused on the game

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:52.620
version of the commentary in this

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:56.640
episode just cuz it's a little bit more

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:57.780
you know it's a pressing matter when

00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.030
you're playing Isaac you can mess around

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:03.870
a bit it's like the difference between

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:06.150
driving in a you know long country road

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:07.850
and driving in downtown Manhattan you

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:10.020
got to keep your head on a swivel here

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:17.040
things can change in an instant

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:18.780
Oh like there for example almost got me

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.010
we don't want petrified poop like we

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.660
could shoot the poop and get money and

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:23.340
that wouldn't be the worst thing but we

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:26.910
definitely want to keep swallowed penny

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:28.230
it's actually the ideal trinket and I

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:31.200
mean that literally

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:32.760
it's not unattractive it's the ideal

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.740
trinket I would take it over curbs horn

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:40.760
which I almost never will do for

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:40.760
anything else okay so we're just saving

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:46.940
Krampus is head cuz the boss fight could

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.940
be around the corner

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:53.220
we still need to get to our item room

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:56.350
but this is kind of a big moment for us

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:57.540
lovely deal with the angel we might as

00:18:56.350 --> 00:19:00.730
well just take this right off the bed

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:03.760
stats aren't very relevant now we got to

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:05.800
think the wafer does nothing and mitre

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.780
is just gonna I mean is gonna do nothing

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.400
it's gonna turn red hearts into flies so

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:12.010
sadly I think we end up having to take

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:14.470
circle of protection which means when we

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:19.120
shoot the circle of protection reflects

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:20.560
shots be gone shots so I think that

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.180
that's I don't know what begone thoughts

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.280
is it's a meme that I'm not familiar

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:27.130
with I know what thot stands stands for

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:31.350
I don't know what it is I just know this

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:33.850
sound it makes me takes a man's life so

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:35.740
if I remember correctly oh it doesn't

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:38.770
even have to be us shooting so it's just

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:42.160
at specific intervals that are unknown

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:43.900
to me at the present moment if a shot

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.400
hits the circle of protection it becomes

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.140
a homing shot that works against the

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:49.150
enemy so we gotta be careful about these

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:50.710
to be honest all right maybe we don't

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:55.090
actually now that we have IV bag or a

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:56.430
swallow penny sorry similar ends very

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:58.690
different means

00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:01.090
how could none of you be dead at this

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:02.770
point you're all one hit away

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:07.440
that's it makes me mad but we're gonna

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:10.000
move through it cuz now swallowed penny

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.920
should help us out here it should always

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.420
give us a penny in fact that should

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:16.690
allow us to play this demon judgment as

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:19.780
well so we're looking for like maximum

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:22.210
luck increase I'm sure gonna pick that

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:25.080
up necessarily we're looking for maximum

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:25.080
luck increase

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:29.299
[Music]

00:20:30.009 --> 00:20:36.559
and if we can get the speed upgrades as

00:20:33.259 --> 00:20:39.200
well that'd be nice I'm just I'm trying

00:20:36.559 --> 00:20:40.850
to not pick up the coins that are in a

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.889
dangerous spot just in case it leads

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:44.600
itself to disaster we're probably gonna

00:20:42.889 --> 00:20:46.669
be spending a lot of time on this floor

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:49.070
though it's not like we're worried about

00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:51.019
boss rush just avoid accidentally

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:51.950
walking into the blood bank or the demon

00:20:51.019 --> 00:20:54.370
judgement for that matter

00:20:51.950 --> 00:21:04.759
it's alright cuz we're gonna clear it up

00:20:54.370 --> 00:21:13.399
as time goes on here please this is a

00:21:04.759 --> 00:21:15.139
very very good arcade for us and it

00:21:13.399 --> 00:21:17.899
could also turn into a myriad of great

00:21:15.139 --> 00:21:19.789
shops as well but we would really like

00:21:17.899 --> 00:21:20.960
this to pay out like as soon as possible

00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:24.230
because it's getting quite silly there

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:25.399
we go so we get I we started get blood

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:27.139
bag as a result so we're gonna play a

00:21:25.399 --> 00:21:29.029
demon judgement and we could play the

00:21:27.139 --> 00:21:35.750
demon judgement twice on one play but my

00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:38.090
philosophy is why risk it you know one

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:40.850
wrong move and all of a sudden were dead

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:43.429
from our greed essentially we get

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:46.240
missing page two not particularly strong

00:21:43.429 --> 00:21:46.240
to be honest with you

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:53.720
apparently it's doing work for us did I

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:55.700
never remember what are we looking for

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:59.570
here honestly I'm kind of torn because

00:21:55.700 --> 00:22:03.230
we're looking for blood bag but we don't

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:06.620
really need to speed as ludus said in

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:11.539
crs magnum opus oh I don't even need to

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:15.019
speed we don't need 2.00 speed what we

00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:18.639
could use is more money for the shops IV

00:22:15.019 --> 00:22:18.639
bag is not the right call I think

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:23.070
sure it might allow us to get infinite

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.120
money in fact I mean as soon as you say

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:26.400
that you go what do you mean it's not

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:28.560
the right call well the problem is it

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.880
does hurt us as well so although it

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:33.810
gives us infinite money I kind of

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:38.730
consider that like secondary to the to

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:42.690
our safety but like do we get two cents

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:44.100
or more every time we use IV bag now we

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:47.340
just get one cent so we're really just

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:49.380
laundering obviously you can't make much

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:53.130
use of that still that was pretty good

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:56.640
we could use IV bag to get us into like

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:58.830
boss trap rooms for example I suppose we

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:00.000
got some speed we got missing page two

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:04.230
whatever the heck that's actually gonna

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.700
do for us remains to be seen we don't

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:07.950
need a one makes you larger pill so we

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:10.440
can turn it into a card is to teleport

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:11.820
cards pretty solid actually let's donate

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.100
five cents which you normally would

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:18.360
never do on a you know keeper run just

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:20.580
to get us to 500 nice round number still

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:22.800
on pace for boss rush which is kind of

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:24.690
hilarious boss rush is very secondary

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:26.010
I'm gonna use our stars cards in the

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:28.920
most conservative way possible

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:31.710
essentially just to take us you know

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:33.900
into the item rooms in all likelihood

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:38.550
possibly to teleport out of like what

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:40.620
looks to be a particularly juicy boss

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:43.590
trap or mob trap room depending on what

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:45.030
we qualify for but for now we're really

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:50.130
just interested in getting through these

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:52.800
floors without without dying sounds a

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:54.120
little basic but run like this you never

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:56.010
know although to be honest with you

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:58.380
swallowed penny makes it extremely

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:59.520
likely relative to the average keeper

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:04.320
run that we got a great chance of

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:06.090
winning here you know it's like we we

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:09.360
know what's gonna be on the test we

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:14.430
still got a study okay we still got to

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:16.010
memorize the answers but we know what's

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:18.260
gonna be on the test

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:20.960
I've never done that by the way I know

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:22.220
that's the Internet has a problem maybe

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.570
it's human nature as soon as someone

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.400
says I've never done that people go

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:27.020
guilty conscience huh not not

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:34.280
necessarily true surely in some

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:37.100
situations I am actually like I am an

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:38.660
honorable student I was gonna say to a

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:43.820
fault but really it's never really

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:45.260
backfired on me too much you know I was

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:49.520
also the kid where when you did like

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:51.410
take-home exams and they say don't work

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.580
with a partner obviously you go back to

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:55.540
the dorms people are like let's work

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:58.130
together and I'm like I don't know

00:24:55.540 --> 00:25:00.590
professor Harris said don't use a

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:03.260
partner so I think I'm just gonna do it

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:04.850
myself you don't want to I wouldn't want

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:08.540
the teacher to be disappointed in me and

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:11.809
as is that a loti approach perhaps just

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:19.200
wanna try this but you know what I stand

00:25:11.809 --> 00:25:22.140
by that code I think it's valuable

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.850
have a code of ethics plus it was also

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:27.030
like you know pretty easy anytime you

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:28.680
get to take home exam like there's a if

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:31.890
you haven't been if you've never done

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:33.960
really closed book exams or sorry open

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:36.240
book exams and that happens a lot like

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.800
in high school I don't think I you heed

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:42.720
the impression that an open book exam

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:44.250
was easy right not really the case no oh

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.020
you got your textbook why don't you just

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:47.640
look up the answers cuz really it's more

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:49.770
about you know proving that you know how

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:51.840
to do something like it doesn't prove

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:54.450
anything they show the teacher that

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.500
you've memorized you know X formula I

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:57.030
know you're going what about the

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.460
quadratic formula no you don't need you

00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:01.800
don't need to have it memorized

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:03.990
that's like maybe in the 1600s you did

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.130
because books were infinity dollars and

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:06.060
it's day and age you don't need to the

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:08.430
only reason you need to have the

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:09.900
quadratic equation memorized is to you

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:13.050
know satisfy your ninth grade math

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:18.120
teacher also the title of my favorite

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:23.960
book the world useful maybe for the next

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:26.070
floor but an open book exam my opinion

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:27.990
is that they tend to actually be more

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:30.450
difficult than closed book exams because

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:32.280
they don't they're not testing like you

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:34.140
know what is Avogadro's number they're

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:36.720
going like use Avogadro's number to

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:39.060
solve what might be a more difficult

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:41.430
problem where am I going with this

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:44.580
take-home exams of the opposite in my

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:46.170
experience every take home exam I've

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:48.660
ever out of my life has ended up with

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:49.500
like the class average being 95 or

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:52.530
something like that

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:55.410
the one exception might be like one of

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:57.660
my English classes in university they

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:59.070
gave us the essay topics in advance so

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.630
that we would write the essays at home

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:02.190
and we could bring in the essays that we

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:04.020
wrote at home and then copy them onto

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:06.650
the piece of paper I don't know why that

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:08.610
was an exercise at the time but it was

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:12.240
and in that one you know when you write

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:13.590
an essay you could you never really know

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:16.260
where you're gonna fall at least in

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:18.540
college you know you that could be an

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:21.210
a-plus essay that could be a C+ essay

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:24.320
dependent of the teachers feeling you

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:24.320
never really know where you stand

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:30.630
lucky me just gonna use a bomb here we

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:34.950
got a like our odds of beating mom

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:37.770
extremely high our odds of beating mom's

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:39.390
heart I would put it above 50% odds of

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:43.350
beating Isaac I'd put him a little lower

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:45.120
to be honest with you good run and we're

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:47.310
gonna have to beat Isaac at some point

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:50.430
to unlock Wooden Nickel if we could

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:52.920
accomplish that on this run that would

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:55.560
be a success in and of itself thank God

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:57.660
for swallowed penny dude so we can spend

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:59.910
80 years on that shop what for what

00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:01.820
speed and lock upgrades not necessary at

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:05.010
this point although our luck is zero

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:08.000
just realized despite getting all those

00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:11.040
luck upgrades and that's the thing about

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.550
you know stem degrees dude versus like

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:16.350
an arts degree people have the

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:19.230
impression I had to take a balanced

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:20.610
education and I say that you know doing

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:25.500
the jerk off motion in my hand a little

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:29.610
bit sorry monetize monetize errs mana

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:32.070
Kaiser's know but you know science

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:34.200
conceptually might be a little bit more

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:36.060
difficult in some respects I guess you

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:38.160
got lab work but his lab work you know

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:40.680
harder than building a portfolio maybe

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:44.490
maybe not it's lab work harder than you

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:45.840
know painting I don't know I I'm not

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:48.210
necessarily gonna get into this argument

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.770
but I will say is that in in science

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:53.160
usually know where you stand and that's

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:56.730
worth something anytime I took an arts

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:59.810
course this may surprise you because I'm

00:28:56.730 --> 00:29:02.820
so obviously intelligent and analytical

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:06.030
but I was more of an artsy kid in high

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:09.230
school my highest marks were like music

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:14.160
and English did fine in science but like

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:15.540
music and English were my jam even still

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.890
you know in university you take an

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:19.070
English class and write an essay about

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:21.360
you know bartleby the scrivener

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:24.930
you know what you're gonna get handed in

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:28.480
a nice a good essay get it back from the

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:31.940
teacher 75 it's not a bad mark

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:34.790
you go in for your you know calc 2 exam

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:38.230
you go I bomb that you get it back 62

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:42.280
you're like yeah okay turns out that my

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:45.020
expectations met reality on this one I

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:47.030
have I have a very it's not really like

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:49.550
a nerdy young Sheldon sort of anecdote

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:51.860
but I remember specifically I took an

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:53.510
exam in my first semester of University

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:56.270
for my calculus course that was an okay

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:58.730
student in calculus even though I

00:29:56.270 --> 00:30:00.800
remember almost none of it extent except

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:02.750
how to you know derive the interval of

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:05.750
like Forex anyway

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:06.830
grab this we could always tell the port

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:09.050
none of this is good enough we don't

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:12.260
need it we don't need it head down to

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:13.910
the next floor and just keep moving yeah

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:15.590
forget the shop even we don't need it

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:19.240
we're working on other stuff to be

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:21.410
unlock something as a result of n no

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:24.410
this is good though dude

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:26.150
like actually good because this floor is

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:29.210
twice as long and we teleported right to

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:32.930
the boss fight anyway so uh they give us

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:34.760
a word problem which essentially was a

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:37.040
visual problem to be solved using

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:39.920
calculus so is like there's a fish on

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:41.360
one side of this stream and it wants to

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:44.240
go to the other side of the stream the

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:46.460
stream is moving it's flowing in a north

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:52.040
direction at like this many meters per

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:53.510
second what angle or what equation for

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:55.640
like the slope of the line should the

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:57.770
fish swim at in order to conserve as

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:59.090
much energy as possible you know it was

00:30:57.770 --> 00:31:00.470
head you had to interpret a lot of these

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:02.090
formulas and equations that were given

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:03.350
to you and then apply them in such a way

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:05.720
as to solve the problem for yourself

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:07.850
well I I was doing it I did okay on the

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:12.260
test but I are on the exam I should say

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:13.640
but I was getting myself in a tizzy over

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.990
this particular question like I knew

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.970
this problem to be solved but I just

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:18.530
didn't know you know what goes where how

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:20.630
to apply one formulator the other for

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:22.550
this specific situation so I thought I

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:23.690
was a smart guy and I just said well if

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:25.310
the fish wants to conserve as much

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:27.200
energy as possible he just shouldn't

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:29.390
swim at all because not swimming

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:32.780
according to your calculations here take

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:36.020
zero energy I did not get full marks for

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:37.630
that question in theory you take the

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:40.070
mark

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:42.620
you walk out and get the halo in

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:44.929
practice should I do it no cuz I could

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:48.710
step on the spikes in reality I'm gonna

00:31:44.929 --> 00:31:50.510
do it cuz I'm not a baby I've played

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:52.340
enough Isaac I'm not gonna shy away the

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:54.770
spikes don't even move you're gonna tell

00:31:52.340 --> 00:32:00.590
me I should try to avoid the immobile

00:31:54.770 --> 00:32:02.050
spikes not necessary my dudes that was

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:05.150
also the only time I've ever had

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:06.500
examines aya T my entire life I studied

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:08.179
I knew what I was doing

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:09.679
looked at the first page can't answer

00:32:08.179 --> 00:32:11.450
any of the questions question one no

00:32:09.679 --> 00:32:14.450
idea question two no idea question three

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:17.030
no idea turn to page two question six no

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:18.620
idea question seven no idea finally I

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:20.240
found a question that was like uh what

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:21.800
does the plus symbol represent was

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:23.510
something like that and I said oh I know

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.800
this I answered that question right

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:25.940
started to build some confidence went

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.400
back and I'm like wait a minute I know

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:29.900
all this stuff turns out I'd actually

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.250
studied it you know over the course of

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:35.270
the preceding four months did fine on

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:37.040
the exam that's why I'd like my my exam

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:40.940
advice if you ever find yourself you

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:42.500
know you get test anxiety everybody's

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:45.250
got their own solutions for dealing with

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:47.809
it I guess but if you're taking an exam

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:50.360
I'd like to start by finding the easiest

00:32:47.809 --> 00:32:53.360
question on the exam takes like two

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:56.360
minutes starts your momentum op right

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:58.250
you know always start by writing your

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.840
name your student number on it and then

00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:01.610
immediately after it it's like prison

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:06.890
you got to find a question that you can

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:09.230
mess up establish your dominance over

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:10.730
the exam and then after that everything

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:14.150
flows a little easy once you know you

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:15.559
got one question then you get two

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:17.540
questions then you get three questions

00:33:15.559 --> 00:33:22.100
and then you know the rest is pretty

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:23.510
much up to your preparation and if you

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:27.429
can't answer a single question on the

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:27.429
exam you should have gone to class

00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:35.200
that's just you know take the El on that

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:38.530
one enroll for the the makeup course

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:40.240
next semester anyway what are we even

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:41.860
talking about this is big cuz if we beat

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:44.200
Isaac and by the way the only reason

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:45.880
we're in this run at all is swallow

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:48.910
penny we're it not for swallow penny we

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:50.620
would be screwed but the keepers kind of

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:52.810
inherently an unfair character in with

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:54.070
so did we get a disproportionate

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:58.270
advantage oh dude

00:33:54.070 --> 00:34:00.790
big time big time we kind of need it at

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:02.080
least on so be a Wooden Nickel once we

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:06.760
get Wooden Nickel which could actually

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:08.740
happen on this run then things become a

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:10.300
little bit more fair 50% chance to

00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:12.820
actually be able to recover HP after

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:17.320
after taking damage most if you have

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:19.150
nun's habit but for now I'm gonna take

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:21.550
what we can get so we took what we can

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:26.860
get she looked at me with a big brown

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:29.520
eyes and said y equals MX plus B which

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:29.520
is true by the way

00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:42.669
why because your boy doesn't mess around

00:34:39.419 --> 00:34:46.810
what is this shot now when you open do

00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:51.160
we can have it we have triple brimstone

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:54.840
but our face doesn't turn our damage is

00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:54.840
the marijuana number

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:04.869
so our damage actually stinks pretty bad

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:06.240
who would have thought oh bumbo stole my

00:35:04.869 --> 00:35:19.740
money

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:19.740
no Bumbo stole my money I needed that

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:31.420
you're not gonna shoot you're not gonna

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:37.270
shoot cuz you're scared but sincerely I

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:42.160
really need that money yeah but like I

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:49.630
need it like a lot thank you thank your

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:51.339
back we're back we're back okay don't be

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:52.780
proud of me for what I've done here this

00:35:51.339 --> 00:35:54.910
was a stupid decision we should not have

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:57.550
done this we also should probably be

00:35:54.910 --> 00:36:00.520
saving keys at this point we've rear old

00:35:57.550 --> 00:36:02.230
what was actually a pretty solid run

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:05.619
into a run that if I'm being Frank with

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:07.180
you is kind of trash that doesn't matter

00:36:05.619 --> 00:36:09.819
that much said well it might because we

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:15.579
need coins to survive but who doesn't in

00:36:09.819 --> 00:36:19.740
today's economy this would be a

00:36:15.579 --> 00:36:19.740
wonderful time to get shoopdawhoop

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:25.840
my decision was a bad one but if we got

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:28.570
to live with it and I'm happy because

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:30.520
again we made the run very easy for

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:31.960
ourselves took away some of our bragging

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.640
rights and now I'm saying no bring those

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:39.610
bragging rights back I have the bragging

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:43.000
right of way I do want to max out Bumbo

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:47.320
cuz like we could just hide plus it by

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:49.740
the way it wasn't all bad we got the

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:56.190
ability to fly thanks to the Seraphim

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:58.930
transformation but as you can see

00:36:56.190 --> 00:37:01.060
approximately every room on planet Earth

00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:03.940
is taking about 80 years to actually

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:05.950
complete so a tiers upgrade would be a

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:07.240
very nice thing for us to see I'm not

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:09.040
worried about the chests too much it's

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:12.370
all like this run the endgame is the

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:13.570
chest but we get pretty much the value

00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:19.540
that we were hoping to derive just by

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:25.710
beating Isaac we're done did it all for

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:25.710
a troll bomb just kind of sad really

00:37:28.509 --> 00:37:37.249
you spit out a coin there I do respect

00:37:31.279 --> 00:37:39.739
that don't hit me please don't don't but

00:37:37.249 --> 00:37:42.130
I specifically asked not to be hit we

00:37:39.739 --> 00:37:42.130
need the key

00:37:43.869 --> 00:37:53.359
no Bumbo the five senses for you let's

00:37:48.799 --> 00:37:59.499
go okay we got next-level bum buh excuse

00:37:53.359 --> 00:37:59.499
me we have X placebo tears

00:38:01.609 --> 00:38:09.470
I mean why not right oh my god this rate

00:38:07.609 --> 00:38:11.420
of fire who would have thought it turns

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:16.099
out an 84 rate of fire is actually

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:18.559
pretty bad the damage is good but mostly

00:38:16.099 --> 00:38:20.269
thanks to the Empress unfortunately what

00:38:18.559 --> 00:38:24.009
are the odds you drop a key after this

00:38:20.269 --> 00:38:24.009
fight probably fairly low huh

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:30.019
good

00:38:27.339 --> 00:38:34.940
so the wooden nickels should be unlocked

00:38:30.019 --> 00:38:36.619
now which is basically a prerequisite

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:38.390
for getting further into the like boss

00:38:36.619 --> 00:38:39.980
Russians keeper for example hushes

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:43.430
keeper those are gonna be a dang

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:45.259
nightmare try out try it out bombs okey

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:47.359
i'm drowsies fine i can see forever

00:38:45.259 --> 00:38:50.239
spine full health not relevant right now

00:38:47.359 --> 00:38:53.900
that's fine infestation to is not that

00:38:50.239 --> 00:38:55.460
good because our rate of fire sorry it's

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:59.200
not that good because our damage stat is

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:59.200
actually fairly not that good

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:12.070
it's killing me dude having to charge up

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:12.070
80 for every single time

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:21.630
mind you when things you know die tends

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:24.540
not to take too long

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:26.460
bumbo if you're spitting the coins you

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:27.900
can have the coins okay I do want you to

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:29.730
hit max level you can kill things a

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:34.560
little faster we're in a much better

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:40.099
spot nothing huh thank you for not being

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:40.099
greed at least that's for you Bombo

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:46.450
he's got to be get in there search your

00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:48.850
feelings you know it to be true

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:51.000
the real problem is if we can't kill an

00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:53.470
enemy in a single charge of our shots

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.620
that's where the nightmares gonna start

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:58.920
cuz we really almost can't afford to

00:39:56.620 --> 00:40:04.120
give enemies any chance to shoot us

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:10.510
that's for you come on getting to know

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:16.960
you getting new noella Bombo getting to

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:18.670
grow you getting to hope you like me you

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:24.430
ever failed a note completely just warp

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:27.850
it no shoots please no shoots please

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:30.090
no shooting please we need that coin no

00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:32.710
not negotiable

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:34.750
also of bum Bo's busy chewing on enemies

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:36.340
from being max level he might not be

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:38.800
able to eat our coins which is a pretty

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:40.920
relevant concern for me at the present

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.920
moment

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:45.829
[Music]

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:54.269
fine that went very well actually we

00:40:49.619 --> 00:40:56.539
could open it didn't end up being very

00:40:54.269 --> 00:40:59.970
good but it's actually it's sad but

00:40:56.539 --> 00:41:03.920
blank card is worse than mom's pad if we

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:03.920
never get any card to work with it so

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:10.480
might as well respective there's a

00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:17.530
chance that that ends up being our

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:19.450
superior option unfortunately this is

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:21.490
still not the most regrettable reroll

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:22.840
I've ever done the stakes might be close

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:29.290
to the highest but that's what makes it

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:32.230
fun it just goes to show you like how

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:34.950
unassailably strong swallowed penny is

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:42.520
is the keeper would have been nice to

00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:45.180
not have to take that but it's fine like

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:48.040
even with the the fairly awful reroll

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:50.440
we're still mostly set you think we have

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:53.710
a little baggie we also have taro cloth

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:54.580
which is very strong we need cards but

00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:55.870
I'm thinking maybe we got a little

00:41:54.580 --> 00:42:00.690
baggie and that's why we haven't seen a

00:41:55.870 --> 00:42:03.829
card yet come on

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:03.829
[Music]

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:07.160
that's for you

00:42:10.029 --> 00:42:13.809
that's fine I'm actually happy you're

00:42:12.399 --> 00:42:24.579
like milling my coins and giving them to

00:42:13.809 --> 00:42:27.279
bumbo who is now at max level no what

00:42:24.579 --> 00:42:29.799
can we say we really did it to ourselves

00:42:27.279 --> 00:42:31.719
however I'm stoked we did the reroll we

00:42:29.799 --> 00:42:33.219
died by our own principles and we got

00:42:31.719 --> 00:42:34.659
wooden nickels so keeper runs should be

00:42:33.219 --> 00:42:37.029
easier in the future for now thanks for

00:42:34.659 --> 00:42:38.469
watching I'm an idiot but I'll be back

00:42:37.029 --> 00:42:39.639
