00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.720
hey everybody welcome back to northern

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.980
lane plays the binding of issac

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.560
afterbirth plus we've been knocking

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.110
these challenges out at a ridiculous

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.429
pace still got challenge 11 challenge 19

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.769
I don't even know what they are

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.000
we're due for a well we only have two

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.010
left on the list right now which is

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.920
awesome we have the two big ones right

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.720
now own a and streak which I started by

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.260
hurting myself for some idiotic reason

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.359
and also of course ultra hard which is

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.960
extremely challenging in and of itself

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:35.510
Oh nein streak should not be that bad

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:39.719
and I don't say that just to you know

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.090
get myself going here but really we beat

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.489
Oh nein streak or at least had a run

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.100
capable of beating onand streak I just

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.960
ruined it by being an idiot on the like

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.190
six runs ago or there's probably like

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.800
close to a month ago now that I think

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.199
about it by the time this goes up but

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.930
yeah and and actually the onand streak

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.690
video is one that I almost feel the need

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.340
to apologize for everybody takes the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.369
apology as a sign of weakness but I I

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.220
take it as a sign of of pride you know I

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.409
think I did wrong by the game and I want

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.299
to own up to that

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.520
apparently oh that was bad but we're

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.200
okay apparently it's a well known thing

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.140
or at least relatively well known that

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.759
in owning streak you never want to take

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.229
anything that gives you multiple shots I

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.710
was operating under the principle that

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.600
if any of your shots hit you would not

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.400
take damage whereas the way that it

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.229
actually works is if any of your shots

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.900
miss you will take damage so obviously

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:40.229
we ended up taking a pro Chon that last

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:44.780
attempt here that was decidedly idiotic

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.460
more or less I'm drowsy and lemonparty

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.619
neither of which are pivotal at the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.860
present moment we did take one hit I

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.880
don't really mind not getting a deal

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.210
with the devil because I think we

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.570
already have an actually like very easy

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.079
win here with chocolate milk Jacob's

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.500
Ladder I mean I don't think friendly

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:10.349
balls worth too much here over the book

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.319
of Belial as is anyway but we we have a

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.689
great run all we need to do is of

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.370
avoid taking the kinds of items that we

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:19.260
took the last time we did own and streak

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.329
that ended up you know costing us a

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.499
chance at the crown I think that it's in

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:28.439
our best interest to just stay as as

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:31.889
safe as possible without necessarily

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:33.659
ruining the the Zain of the run but at

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:36.840
the same time like the Zane of the run

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.819
is kind of inherent I think so let's see

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.639
we've still got like a 50% chance of a

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.340
deal I just only want to shoot at that

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:46.590
guy when he's unlikely to move so we get

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.120
lucky we get squeezy here tears upgrade

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.069
could be dangerous because we don't want

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.199
to fire too quickly but this is actually

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:56.480
potentially a really useful deal with

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:58.919
the devil dude nothing grinds my gears

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.540
more than a deal with the devil

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:02.069
with three red chests where one or more

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.090
the red chest takes you to the deal with

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.109
the devil if I could cry would feel like

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.000
this okay

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:15.389
we're really like I'm adhering to this

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.430
idea I'm attached to the idea is a

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:19.259
better way to describe it of getting all

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.139
these challenges done on a second pass

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:24.629
I'm content to fail from time to time I

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.979
think failure by the way the reason I'm

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:29.280
not gonna take box of spiders here is

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:32.370
because I don't trust mice I don't trust

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.949
myself to take box of spiders because

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.109
sometimes when I use the space bar it is

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:39.659
going to shoot the tear that I've stored

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:41.370
and if it shoots it into nothingness

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.859
then we obviously are gonna take damage

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.889
as a result I think I took damage it's

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:49.859
weird because Jacob's Ladder kind of

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:52.229
confuses it a little bit but I hit a

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:55.139
rock which is not an enemy and then

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:57.930
Jacob's Ladder killed four enemies made

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:00.569
me think that we deserved to not take

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.430
damage there but I do think that the

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.650
game calculated it appropriately

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.379
unfortunately for me but you can see

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:12.569
like this is working out really really

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:15.090
nicely right now and word three minutes

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.039
deep we're already on the fourth floor

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.680
which is indicative of this being a

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:22.770
pretty strong run especially amazing

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.210
when you consider the fact that you know

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.099
the only thing we start with on this run

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.610
is basically chocolate milk and we're

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.090
Judas

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.360
so we

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.770
have a good foundation I mean it's

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.000
better than your average starting Judas

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.889
run except for the fact that if you have

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.449
less than a hundred percent accuracy

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.910
you're gonna end up taking damage one

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:41.160
way or the other right so I think that

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.870
we've just sort of accidentally created

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.910
a run that's actually kind of incredible

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.250
all we need to do is not miss you know

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:54.780
would be like an 11 out of 10 synergy on

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:59.010
this run dead shot in case we needed any

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:01.229
more incentive to to not miss but I

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:05.520
think this high damage Jacob's Ladder is

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:06.990
kind of crushing it for us like without

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.360
that we'd be in a much worse position

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.010
but with that we're kind of like sitting

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.169
pretty here I don't think we there's

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.940
there's too much that we can do to mess

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.669
this up as long as we don't accidentally

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.500
fire a bunch of aberrant shots just kind

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.490
of into the ether now of course as I say

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:26.490
that we are starting to lose HP here

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.350
there usually comes a little it's almost

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.720
like the opposite of if you remember

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.010
10th grade English class or somewhere

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.280
around there your teacher will give you

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.900
kind of be the anatomy of a story starts

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.360
with the rising action and then at some

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.860
point there's a climax and then it ends

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.599
with a day to Maude you know the the

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.389
falling action after the climax is

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:47.760
complete we kind of start with things I

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:50.580
wouldn't say at their climax necessarily

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.289
but well on the rising action and then

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:56.280
things kind of like day Newmont

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:57.690
in the middle before hopefully kind of

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.680
reaching an origin point near the end

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.570
I'm just gonna be honest I don't know

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:05.130
what the heck I kind of lost the plot

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:07.260
halfway through there although I almost

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:13.970
walked right into that although it might

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:17.099
be an okay idea to take shoopdawhoop I

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:19.050
almost just want to not mess with it

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:22.020
because I believe we had shoopdawhoop on

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:26.789
an earlier owned and streak attempt and

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:27.900
it was not necessarily I think I'm

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:29.729
throwing the baby out with the bathwater

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:36.419
as I guess the way I want to describe it

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:39.000
I think even if it maybe didn't actually

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:41.099
contribute to us losing that run it was

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.409
on the run that we lost and as a result

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:45.870
I'm kind of holding it against it

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:49.310
despite the fact that it might have

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:52.050
nothing to do with that to begin with

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.310
really it's more a more elegant way to

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.830
describe it as if it ain't broke don't

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:59.039
fix it right that was an extremely lucky

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:05.789
hit there and it is decidedly like not

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:07.740
broke right now and as a result no

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:09.810
fixing is necessary which is very nice

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.219
for me because you know red green used

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.510
to say if the women don't find you

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:16.110
handsome they should at least find you

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:19.770
handy what happens if you gotta neither

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:21.210
though so we got a speed upgrade a big

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.440
tear downgrade there but I don't think

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.530
that matters too much with chocolate

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:29.159
milk I've been working on my my

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:31.650
handiness I'm attracted to the idea of

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:34.500
being able to build stuff and this is

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.729
gonna sound dorky and because it's like

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.680
the dorkiest thing I've ever said to

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:42.479
begin with but it's kind of because I

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.710
have a rudimentary please don't hurt me

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:45.479
real programmers but I have like a

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.240
rudimentary understanding of software

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:51.240
engineering now and I'm like carpentry

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:53.219
is just software engineering with

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.860
real-world materials and I find that

00:07:53.219 --> 00:07:57.840
kind of cool you know I used to look at

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.219
a spice rack and go I can't conceivably

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.960
understand how you would build a spice

00:07:59.219 --> 00:08:02.010
rack now I look at it and I go okay

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.320
first you got to learn how to use a

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:06.479
hammer and then you got to buy the wood

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:09.300
and then you got to learn oh that was so

00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:10.680
dumb much like this tangent then you

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.719
just got to learn how to attach two

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.340
boards together and all of a sudden you

00:08:12.719 --> 00:08:17.300
got all the pieces that you need to kind

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:20.130
of like constructed modularly you know

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.080
you build it inch by inch row by row not

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:24.389
all is one discrete unit but I'm not

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.889
there yet we're starting with pieces of

00:08:24.389 --> 00:08:27.289
Ikea furniture and some of them are

00:08:25.889 --> 00:08:32.570
working out okay some of them aren't

00:08:27.289 --> 00:08:32.570
this is potentially pretty solid here

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:44.860
and I'll keep you updated as the as the

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:47.080
time approaches it's a very little

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:49.490
incentive to learn carpentry

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:53.000
unfortunately Ori or any kind of Han yes

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:56.240
although I did fish are not fish sorry I

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.070
didn't fix our dishwasher via a YouTube

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.660
video and I was like I think this

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.830
YouTube thing is gonna start to catch on

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.660
to be honest with you

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:04.220
I googled like the make and model of our

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.530
dishwasher and there was a video of a

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:10.700
dude describing the exact problem that

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:12.830
we have and how to fix it in a way

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.540
though I was kind of like this guy's

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:16.430
like a magician giving away his tricks

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:18.310
like if it weren't for the reward for

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:20.090
the video I probably would have called a

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:22.250
plumber

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:26.240
I'm an electrician what you call for a

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:28.760
dishwasher is that a handyman on an

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:31.520
appliance repairman and it's an

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:34.010
antiquated term an appliance repair

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.760
person is probably the correct course of

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.760
action there but

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:42.460
dude I took way too much damage fighting

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:44.680
the adversary we got a great deal with

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:47.260
the devil chance ie 100 while the angel

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:51.130
chance exists as well I suppose but it's

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:54.730
devil chance toothpicks her up nine

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:56.830
lives I as boring as it probably used to

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:59.500
watch me just ignore all of these items

00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:01.780
that could be fun dude I don't think I

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:04.480
can justify taking nine lives on own and

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:06.160
streak and I hope you'll forgive me for

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:11.230
this given that I have done this

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:13.330
challenge in the past so I'm kind of

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:17.980
just trying to coast this one through

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:19.690
here you know normally when I do an

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:23.770
Isaac run I want it to be like airplay

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:27.250
in the movie I want it to be singing I

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:28.900
want it to have you know I'm serious and

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:32.620
don't call me Shirley moments in it

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:35.230
however this one I want to be more like

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:37.450
airplane the method of transportation

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:40.060
which means essentially I want them to

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:41.740
turn off the seatbelt sign as soon as we

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.360
reach cruising altitude and never turn

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.800
it on again I wanted to smooth this

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:52.870
flight that can conceivably be

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:56.740
guaranteed okay we'll open this that's a

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:58.930
ton of money I really don't think we

00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:02.980
need anything else oh that was such a

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:04.780
big whiff there um oh I really don't

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:08.260
think we need anything else except

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:11.620
maintaining a relatively strong sense of

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:15.160
strength here but we might as well buy

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:17.920
stuff from our our shop if it ends up

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:19.360
helping us out here even just buying a

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.550
bunch of spirit arts might be the right

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.960
call and of course like getting damage

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:26.170
upgrades would still be nice I'm a

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:28.150
little cheesed about that it is our

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:30.960
final floor here so I figured me just

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:33.040
buy whatever we got I said remember that

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.540
but I got to be honest it looks like

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.740
owned and streak is gonna come through

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:37.030
in the clutch for us I'm pretty

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:39.310
confident we're gonna come away with the

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:41.110
W let's go for the four banger we got

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:46.570
two and that's about as good as we could

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:49.960
have expected and this will be like yet

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:50.450
another successful challenge if we end

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.220
up winning

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:56.720
of course which is kind of a truism I

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:59.030
suppose but either way great track

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:00.650
record on what have been supposedly some

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:02.750
pretty difficult challenges I mean we

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:04.520
failed them all the first time the only

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:07.250
one left after this that we have

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:09.020
presently unlocked is ultra hard ultra

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:14.450
hard is a garbage challenge and I'm very

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:16.820
scared of it but confidence is kind of

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:18.740
like at an all-time high here ultra hard

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:22.120
is one of the few it's like ultra hard

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:24.110
and I think maybe speed that we ended up

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.790
you should probably you spoke up a while

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:29.030
a little bit more even though it doesn't

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:30.770
seem that important why not one of the

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:36.170
one of the very few that we ended up

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:38.000
taking more than two attempts on now

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:39.200
because you know me you know that if

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.480
this is a 1 or a 6

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:45.050
I will reroll my whole run it's not it's

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:49.040
go ahead go ahead is one of the few

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:51.440
items in the game that is almost so good

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:56.540
it's bad it's like a reverse Birdemic

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:59.150
sort of situation I love it I recognize

00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:00.950
its objectively great I will go way out

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:02.150
of my way to pick it up especially the

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:04.580
earlier in a run we can get it the

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:06.020
better however I also recognize that

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:08.810
it's probably one of the few items in

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:10.250
the game I could potentially kill myself

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:16.780
with you know kill him with kindness

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:20.540
style the item is so good makes me play

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:22.460
makes me play overly aggressively over

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:23.750
aggressively overly aggressively you

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:26.660
never want to end a sentence with like

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:32.780
Tooley words unless you're chris tucker

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:34.100
in the rush hour movies lee it's not got

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:37.070
to be careful with that impression no

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:39.020
disrespect meant well if there's

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:41.570
disrespect meant it's meant towards

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:44.210
braat braat braat rettner no brett

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:45.950
ratner not to any of the actors the

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:48.140
thespians in the fine film if you will

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:50.000
so seraphim is okay as long as it's

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:52.430
shots don't cause me to take damage and

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.860
boss rush is just not worth our time for

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:57.740
anybody involved we could have fought

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:59.630
the angel statue but I mean the central

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:04.410
theme of this run has been more or less

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:07.420
that I'm not going to rock the boat so

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:10.630
you're a little on the silly side if you

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:12.550
think that I'm gonna try to fight an

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:15.390
angel statue here especially any enemy

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:21.310
with mobility if I can avoid fighting it

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:23.110
I'm gonna avoid fighting it I'll even

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:25.870
tell you straight up that I think

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:29.860
Seraphim was not necessarily a 100%

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:32.170
lights out good choice to take because

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:34.810
Seraphim does a decent amount of damage

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:37.030
it could kill enemies that I'm trying to

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:38.890
shoot at and and caused me to miss as a

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:40.570
result of killing the enemy you know I

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:43.660
shoot where the the enemy used to be and

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:47.370
now exists only a corpse or a memory of

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:54.250
what I was meant to be I tried so okay

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:59.550
grab this also fairly tricky situation

00:14:54.250 --> 00:15:05.080
here just play it cool

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:07.540
certainly do not need the key the run is

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.300
going to continue to get harder this is

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:14.040
not one where we've we found a

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:16.510
circuitous way around it like in the

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:18.580
head trauma challenge for example we

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:22.570
found a basically cheat codes to make

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:24.339
that one work by getting technology in

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:26.490
this one we're still uh you know

00:15:24.339 --> 00:15:28.540
beholding to the rules of the game and

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:31.600
the rule of the unique rules of the

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:33.510
challenge to begin with but it actually

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:36.480
ended up working out pretty well there

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:38.740
we should still be fine though I

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:41.470
actually think that if you were to look

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:43.780
at like potential causes of death on

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:46.180
this run my own hubris is actually like

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:48.700
probably number one and that manifests

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:51.070
itself entirely by taking way too many

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:54.580
deals with the devil so as long as we

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:57.040
can keep ego in check here I think we're

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:59.080
in a good spot I don't even want that as

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.580
long as we can keep ego in check we

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.020
should be good and by the way I don't

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:04.230
need any more spirit hearts I think I'm

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.230
good

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:13.140
foolish human either way okay don't go

00:16:10.529 --> 00:16:19.230
breaking my heart or chasing waterfalls

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:25.140
for that matter easy money

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:28.290
Seraphin can do the dirty work here HP

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:29.970
from crack Jax and actually vibrant bulb

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:31.860
is good cuz I tend to I mean it's good

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:33.839
in the worst of times but it's

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:40.230
particularly good because I have a

00:16:33.839 --> 00:16:42.029
tendency to misuse book of Belial now I

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:45.980
throw myself on the mercy of the court

00:16:42.029 --> 00:16:48.690
cuz I am an experienced Isaac player I

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:50.220
looked at Guppies paw and I saw with the

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:54.649
line that I'm sure you guys saw as well

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:58.170
why not take Guppies paw and just like

00:16:54.649 --> 00:16:59.459
go buckwild with it get 12 spirit hearts

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:01.890
all of a sudden we've got permanent

00:16:59.459 --> 00:17:03.300
polaroid invincibility which does not

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:04.829
protect you from taking damage due to

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.100
the onand street condition as we saw

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:09.630
last time if I remember correctly but

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:11.100
why not just take that and I think it

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:13.860
might allow you to ball out with

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:17.220
illuminated bulb as well the reason is

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:19.350
is simple but also a little lame if it

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:21.660
ain't broke don't fix it on these

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:23.939
challenges and even more so on ultra

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:26.220
hard to be honest with you but on these

00:17:23.939 --> 00:17:32.490
challenges if we're looking pretty I'm

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:36.080
not gonna adjust course I don't want to

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:36.080
shoot cuz you're gonna kill this thing

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:41.040
there's a I think a case to be made that

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:42.690
that is idiotic and I'm never gonna take

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.610
items that improve me if I'm always

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:48.590
worried about maintaining the status quo

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:54.300
however dude status quo sounds like what

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:55.950
George Lucas would name a Gungan in Star

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:58.400
Wars Episode one the Phantom Menace but

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.400
regardless

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:06.780
the spirit heart regardless this is not

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.610
new NL this is not oh what happened to

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:11.250
Lu used to be zany now you're not zany

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:13.410
this is me you know showing up to court

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:15.270
wearing a suit you know it's appropriate

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:17.510
given the situation that doesn't mean

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:19.950
I'm not a jeans and hoodie guy at home

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:21.870
just means that I'm showing decorum to

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:23.760
this situation as is warranted this

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:27.600
challenge show that was a dumb idea

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:31.140
apparently this challenge has been a bit

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:36.510
a bit of a pain in the butt so what I've

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:39.150
chosen to do is handle it with a certain

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:40.680
level of maturity and then we can get

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:44.520
back to the sane once we're done with

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:49.140
the challenges grab that still got good

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:50.010
HP I will take sin robes I think it's

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:52.350
just a straight-up

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:54.330
HP play that also helps us out from a

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:55.980
damage standpoint here we'll head up to

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:57.000
the next floor and I'll just let you

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.020
know straight up it's looking like it's

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.520
gonna be a little bit of a shorter

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.990
episode today but that's okay cuz I

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:03.330
think we got that George Lucas reference

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:05.040
in there and that you know is worth like

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:08.040
two and a half of an ounce normal

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:13.320
references due to relative cleverness

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:14.790
and also accessibility always helps when

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.740
the reference comes to mind and it's

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:18.360
something that's more Universal it's

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:20.850
like oh that's like the character ral

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:23.070
julia played in the made-for-tv movie

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:25.110
from 1987 overdrawn at the memory bank

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:27.000
that one those ones are not impressing

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:28.350
anybody they're just frightening people

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.090
and make you think your brains

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:36.450
constructed like John Travolta's in the

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:37.470
1995 movie phenomenon decent film I

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:42.290
don't know I haven't seen them since I

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:45.630
was seven but phenomenon doo-doo-doo-doo

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:49.220
phenomenon Siskel and Ebert who gave it

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:54.380
one thumbs up one thumbs down in 1995

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:59.660
phenomena starring Travolta phenomenon

00:19:54.380 --> 00:20:03.620
Erik leptin soundcheck phenomena

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:04.310
I don't know I got six bombs I'm not

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.470
fighting you

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:12.920
we got the damage I know we could kill

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:14.180
you what's the point though as long as

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:19.280
we're going in the right direction here

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:22.250
we should have essentially no trouble

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:24.850
whatsoever remember you probably I mean

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:33.320
it's up to you and by you I mean me but

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:38.090
we probably do not wish to use book of

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:45.350
Belial here might just be smarter to

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:47.990
hold off and enjoy having the extra all

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:52.940
stats particularly speed and maybe rate

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:54.980
of fire for a reduced charge time but

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:57.830
every room I'm getting eager here cuz

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.570
I'm looking at it and I'm running the

00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:01.280
arithmetic in my head and I'm realizing

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:04.160
we can't be too far away from being done

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:05.560
with this let's ensure as much as we can

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.060
that we got this win

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:13.550
we got one spirit heart for a few bombs

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:15.980
that's okay alright and in a way I

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:18.400
almost feel the need to apologize for

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:20.690
well let's not get ahead of ourselves

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.920
almost feel the need to apologize

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:23.210
because it looks like this episode is

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:25.640
gonna be a little bit on the shorter

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:28.580
side and combined with that there's

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:32.720
absent a little bit of the NL Zayn and

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:34.160
trickery but at the same time we find

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.170
ourselves completing one of the more

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.820
annoying challenges in the game also one

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:39.710
of the more transformative I actually

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:41.120
like this challenge quite a lot as

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:44.170
compared to something like speed which

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:47.360
is basically just like ah just go for it

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:48.530
this one I'm like it forces you to

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.790
change your playstyle and be more

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:52.720
considered which is something that I

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:54.650
appreciate in spite of the fact that it

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:57.920
got me pretty good as well

00:21:54.650 --> 00:22:00.820
terrible Isaac fight aside here we're

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.820
about to come through in the clutch

00:22:01.179 --> 00:22:06.460
with an easy win that belongs to me Wow

00:22:04.239 --> 00:22:09.279
what are we unlocked for owning streak

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:11.229
kidney stone oh good another item that I

00:22:09.279 --> 00:22:13.049
used to like but is terrible in my

00:22:11.229 --> 00:22:15.519
opinion now because of the fact that it

00:22:13.049 --> 00:22:16.899
needlessly reduces your speed in a game

00:22:15.519 --> 00:22:17.950
where that is like the kiss of death but

00:22:16.899 --> 00:22:19.029
hey thanks for watching hope you guys

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:20.440
