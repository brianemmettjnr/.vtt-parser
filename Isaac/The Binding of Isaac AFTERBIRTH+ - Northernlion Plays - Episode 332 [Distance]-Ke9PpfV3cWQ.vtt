00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.620
hey everybody welcome back to northern

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.750
line plays a fighting - gasps REDD+

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.179
where we've had some zayn we've had some

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.480
gains we've had some good runs recently

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.309
this is fine it's actually like yet

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.619
another decent start speed is a little

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.020
on the low side but not horrible I mean

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.140
if I have 0.9 I'd be like is okay by at

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.619
0.8 am i all the universe hates me

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.560
BK w8 SPLC with four damage which is a

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.779
little bit above average 11 rate of fire

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.420
which is a little bit below average and

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.910
again 0.88 speeds so I think this is a

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.629
well within the bounds of averageness

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.840
start and it's got it's got all the

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.809
tools it needs to succeed here I think

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.360
just want to kill these enemies oh why

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.379
do you didn't kill the huh it didn't

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.090
kill the little one

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.620
I can see forever it's nice I'm just

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.120
worried like we started with personally

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.649
unknown a couple times in a row here at

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.149
least a couple times in the last three

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.220
and HP why's it leaves you in a bit of a

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.780
scary spot where you just don't know

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.640
that's pretty good though you just don't

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:16.369
know where you're where you're at

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:18.750
I got a pill I can see ever it's a

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.880
little deliberately bad version of a

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.310
hero by Chad Kroeger featuring Joey

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.920
Wales Jodie

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:29.220
Josey from saliva I forget his actual

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.729
name but anyway it's been a while I was

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.420
part of the hero generation you know we

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:41.909
we took that song to number one let's go

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:44.009
pyromaniac I ain't ever scared we might

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.409
still be at 1 hp so don't get like too

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.210
cocky here I don't even want to go to

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.430
the curse room just on the off chance it

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.110
could it could kill me like if we're

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.140
rolling exclusively spirit hard same

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.360
deal so I really think we probably can

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.670
afford to go to the spirit or the curse

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.079
room but it's better safe than sorry if

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.140
we started with like two spirit hearts

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.520
we might be in a wonky spot so should

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.600
have definitely played that instead of

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.640
blowing it up but we got a black heart

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.349
out of it regardless now I'll go to the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.900
curse room but it is still mildly spicy

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.420
in here

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.129
not okay now it all worked out to the

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.709
best I wouldn't even buy a spirit heart

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.060
at this point because I you know there's

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.379
a chance that we're on spirit ours is

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.790
the chance that we got two or three red

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.750
hearts and we'd love the opportunity to

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:34.060
get a an arcade on our next floor so so

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:38.049
far so good I think I'd rather use the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:42.280
Sun card right now just to destroy this

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:47.440
guy and take I can see forever down to

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.329
the next floor that's again like a lot

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.459
of spirit odds no stat improvements but

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.049
a lot of spirit hard so that floor ended

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.540
up being really nice for me we found

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:58.510
both secret rooms we got pyromaniac a

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.120
special item that is also incredibly

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.489
useful so like I'm on I'm a very happy

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:09.129
camper and our HP was not incredible but

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:12.400
wasn't that bad we got HP to play with

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.810
here we got a we got a bankroll and you

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.349
know it keeps getting better I do

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.579
appreciate the fact that we're getting

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.959
you know more and more spirit hearts

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.989
here but eventually we do have to

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.329
improve our stats can't just rely on you

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.810
know endless spirit our pickups to make

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.579
the dream work at the same time it's

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.200
very early we got a lot of time left

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.599
before we have to really concern

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.000
ourselves with how things are going here

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:41.379
and golden bombs like the best time to

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.910
get golden bombs is right now early on

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.629
when our damage isn't necessarily

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.889
amazing I don't really care about a

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:50.519
blood bank when we robbed one HP so

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:52.629
that's that's my reasoning for taking

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:56.620
for taking the eternal heart right off

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:59.230
the bat the other thing is that I took

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.150
flush over monstros tooth because

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.459
monstros tooth I hate that you can't

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.780
target the enemy you want to target I

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.799
don't know how you would do it in the

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.750
first place if you wanted to but

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.370
sometimes it lands on an enemy I don't

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.169
want it to land on and it could be a

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.449
little annoying in that sense of the

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:17.739
word but flush on the other hand hits

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:20.500
everything it doesn't do very much

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:24.280
damage but and it takes forever to

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:28.620
charge but I think it has the chance to

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.620
be like more commonly useful

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.310
no mine oh we can't take that we got

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.440
fully charged I thought I heard no

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.610
secret rooms in here alright so we're

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.360
gonna be out of this floor in no time

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:46.060
flat but we still have not really

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.980
again the it's very nice but I would

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.080
like to at some point if possible you

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.310
think it would be in the cards for us to

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.590
improve our stance a little bit

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:57.970
anyway I just want to see what our deal

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.180
with the devil entails for us here and

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.290
then we'll probably like hope the

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:08.470
world's our oyster we're actually going

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:10.360
to take blank card here no doubt we're

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:16.300
probably going to buy the other card as

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:18.130
well yeah yeah it's pretty good you know

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.700
like maybe like the best in the game so

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.080
that's pretty solid blank card Joker is

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.840
teleportation guaranteed deals with the

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.790
devil we might actually you know what

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.500
let's see what we get in our deal with

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.240
the devil but I kind of want to try to

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.130
make deals with the angel work I want to

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.620
at least give it an attempt to make

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.440
deals the angel work the way that we

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:45.030
would do that don't you dare disappear

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:45.030
on me the way that we would do that is

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.920
let's go let's go ignoring this deal

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.730
with the devil or going in and seeing

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:56.890
what there is and then leaving I love

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:59.950
succubus as an item but I'm gonna I'm

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:03.040
going to make this sacrifice to you the

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.210
people we might just get another deal

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.640
with the devil immediately and that

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.410
would make me a very sad sad camper here

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.490
the opposite of a happy camper is the

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:15.400
phrase you don't hear that much because

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:18.670
everyone's so happy when they camp we

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:23.560
got a deal with the angel okay so we

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:26.680
should take void and suck up everything

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.250
else but it sucks that we can only take

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.250
one item

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.830
so now we have once every six rooms

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:41.320
Joker card that also can template other

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:42.760
items so I think it's pretty sensible I

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.010
should have fought the angel statue for

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.150
higher angel chance but you know hey I

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:51.040
think it's the first time we've seen a

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:52.570
three choice angel room we have put

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.640
ourselves I wouldn't say in a tight spot

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:59.560
because first off that's open all sorts

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:03.790
of double entendre but I would say that

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:05.590
we've we've done the opposite of what

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:08.130
you would normally expect as a sensible

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:10.660
idea when your damage is bad and that's

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.520
we basically said no to something that

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.260
deals a lot of damage and improves our

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:18.840
damage when we stand close to it at

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:21.550
least which will succubus of course so

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.930
we've we've instead gone for the novelty

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.930
of the angel deals and there's plenty of

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.490
angel deals that can help us accomplish

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.920
our objectives but there's also plenty

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:32.530
of angel deals that are garbage so we'll

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:35.050
have to of the hope for the best dude

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:36.730
there's no reason to feel guilty about

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:40.800
going off on this donation machine we

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:40.800
took it from basically zero to 999

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:49.480
tarot-card is actually a lovely item it

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:54.490
doesn't particularly do much for us with

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:59.590
respect to with respect to the Joker

00:07:54.490 --> 00:08:02.500
card but that's also completely fine and

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.670
whatever we got so many bombs here for

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.860
the early game we might as well take a

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.810
chance I don't think I'm drowsy applies

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.630
outside of this room but that's also

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:15.130
completely okay I would replace the

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:16.990
Joker card but it would require require

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:19.270
getting something worth replacing it for

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:20.710
like obviously the hanged man once every

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:24.880
six rooms is not really what I'm

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:27.190
interested in as much as I would love

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:30.010
the ability to fly once every six rooms

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:31.870
having the ability to fly is like almost

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:34.410
worse than the Bible because it takes up

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:36.760
the the space bar item slot and the

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:38.470
tarot card slot which we can only hold

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.600
one thing in right now I'll take sack of

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:41.779
pennies that's fine definitely do not

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:46.189
teleport out of this through

00:08:41.779 --> 00:08:48.529
or you will die so Plan C everybody's

00:08:46.189 --> 00:08:51.230
favorite item that they've used

00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:54.110
effectively a maximum of one time in

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:57.019
their entire lives okay it's fine we

00:08:54.110 --> 00:09:00.259
needed the key honestly it's a so high

00:08:57.019 --> 00:09:01.670
cost of paper we needed a key wasn't

00:09:00.259 --> 00:09:04.430
intentional I'm not trying to pass it

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:07.459
off as if it were but this is where I'm

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:08.209
like okay we've been pussyfooting around

00:09:07.459 --> 00:09:12.199
long enough

00:09:08.209 --> 00:09:15.019
give us a tears or damage upgrade just

00:09:12.199 --> 00:09:19.100
magic mush I've kind of got Isaac

00:09:15.019 --> 00:09:20.839
highway blindness we had magic mush on

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.149
the last run we had prompt ptosis on our

00:09:20.839 --> 00:09:24.499
last two runs

00:09:22.149 --> 00:09:26.959
we did have Lieber on our last run but

00:09:24.499 --> 00:09:29.389
we also had brimstone you know that's it

00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:32.269
was an unfulfilled llibre to a certain

00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:35.350
extent but the brimstone you know it

00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:39.170
certainly helps so we get your Big Horn

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:43.100
the bigger the cushion the sweeter the

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:46.750
pushin that's what I said a spinal tap

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:54.350
it's not me and spinal tap satire

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:57.769
now please the window I don't know why I

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:59.750
said it like that they win do when you

00:09:57.769 --> 00:10:02.899
can actually fit a bomb into his open

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:09.740
mouth is approximately like negative 0.2

00:10:02.899 --> 00:10:13.189
seconds long it's not conceivable to to

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:15.829
hit little horn with the bomb I mean

00:10:13.189 --> 00:10:20.269
I've done it every time I've done it has

00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:21.529
been an accident please don't shoot your

00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:23.569
stuff I mean he's going to shoot his

00:10:21.529 --> 00:10:26.379
stuff at me not like that you sickos

00:10:23.569 --> 00:10:26.379
okay

00:10:29.819 --> 00:10:34.990
it's just it's lion law you know if

00:10:32.709 --> 00:10:39.189
you're if you've got bad damage you're

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:41.170
going to be fighting a Bighorn on the

00:10:39.189 --> 00:10:49.360
third floor it's just science it's

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:53.920
programmed into the game please please

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:58.209
please please leave us it was done a

00:10:53.920 --> 00:11:03.490
dust of you so there's our angel deal

00:10:58.209 --> 00:11:06.370
again but I can't fight the angel statue

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:09.939
right now so which is fine it's fine

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:12.459
we're just uh skirting around here I

00:11:09.939 --> 00:11:14.019
think the smart plays you do play this

00:11:12.459 --> 00:11:15.970
you know try to get something from your

00:11:14.019 --> 00:11:18.519
shop with the money and blood bag would

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:20.980
also be fine IV bag we could suck up but

00:11:18.519 --> 00:11:24.059
probably would not want to a dimes very

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:26.019
nice you could say it's top of the line

00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:28.540
so now we've got to deal with the devil

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:30.970
precedent and honestly I don't feel bad

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:35.439
I gave a deal with the angel a chance to

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:37.240
pop off I still think that and I

00:11:35.439 --> 00:11:38.740
recognize this is going to be like a why

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.269
aren't you nerds ever happy sort of

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.740
moment for the developers maybe if

00:11:40.269 --> 00:11:43.959
they'd argue in paying attention to this

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:46.899
which at some point you got to

00:11:43.959 --> 00:11:49.750
understand you know people have human

00:11:46.899 --> 00:11:51.730
limits to their time demanding like an

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:55.750
hour through a day to watch this is a

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:57.250
little ridiculous but I feel like as

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.300
soon as you take an item from a deal

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.800
with the angel you should have angel

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.439
precedent the same way you have devil

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.899
precedent it's a the devil deals are

00:12:02.439 --> 00:12:06.490
still in my opinion largely better at

00:12:04.899 --> 00:12:08.290
least more transformative with single

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:10.750
items like brimstone mom's name change

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:13.240
the game succubus Incubus often times

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:14.709
change the game etc etc I'm insured you

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:18.490
know there's God and Sacred Heart and

00:12:14.709 --> 00:12:20.350
stuff like that but devil deals feel

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.970
more consistent why does it still feel

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:23.559
like you have to move heaven and earth

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:24.790
to get a single angel deal to show up

00:12:23.559 --> 00:12:26.319
and then when you get the angel deal to

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.970
show up by which point you've already

00:12:26.319 --> 00:12:29.769
paid the cost of not taking your first

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:31.480
deal with the devil you just get reset

00:12:29.769 --> 00:12:34.600
back to zero and it's like okay well if

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:36.670
you if you fight a boss that costs you a

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:39.399
consumable that could be precious and is

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:41.110
also like the boss himself is not that

00:12:39.399 --> 00:12:43.829
easy to kill

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:47.980
especially so fast in this tiny room

00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:50.800
then you get like a 20% better chance oh

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:52.600
thank you like why not just give the

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:59.740
same precedent that you give for deals

00:12:52.600 --> 00:13:01.420
with the devil I don't understand the

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:04.980
run right now I mean I'm not bitter it's

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:10.290
no big I'm just telling it like it is no

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:12.820
hunger games no thanks I'm still full

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:17.529
I'm feeling the pain on this run though

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:19.990
like I'm just very much would like to be

00:13:17.529 --> 00:13:23.560
able to kill enemies a little bit faster

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:25.360
and I am a whiny baby about damage

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.860
sometimes part of that is just cuz I

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.269
played so much Isaac that I'm like I

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:31.420
don't want to have slightly above

00:13:28.269 --> 00:13:35.500
average damage I want to be the wrecking

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:36.940
crew but it's I mean I don't feel like I

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:40.839
need to tell you this this is not good

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:43.600
damage he's like are you kidding me we

00:13:40.839 --> 00:13:45.550
got four damage and 11 rate of fire we

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:49.839
had four damage and 11 rate of fire on

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:51.940
the first room of the game we're on the

00:13:49.839 --> 00:13:55.060
catacombs two we got four damage 11 rate

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:56.699
of fire it's not all bad we got

00:13:55.060 --> 00:14:01.480
pyromaniac

00:13:56.699 --> 00:14:03.790
you got a guppy chance we got void with

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:07.180
blank cards sucked up I'm leaving The

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:09.670
Joker card that's how like concerned I

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:11.550
am I'm like well I choke a card very

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:14.949
tempting don't get me wrong however I

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:17.050
had 99 bombs I could kill every enemy

00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:18.790
with bombs all you need to do is get to

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:21.100
99 once and then you're never going to

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:24.790
slip under it once every six rooms you

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:29.829
get another you know 50 as long as you

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:33.570
stay over 49 but this is like on a

00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:36.640
statistical level this will not stand

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:39.279
battery charges please oh thank god so

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:41.170
first you take the bombs then you double

00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:42.730
them then you double them again now

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:45.880
we're at 8 here's where we get started

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:51.220
we roll machine oh no reroll machine and

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:53.769
the real bummer here is no no battery

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:56.300
charge to purchase to begin with

00:14:53.769 --> 00:15:00.350
but a reroll machine and batteries would

00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:02.360
have been like 10 out of 10 now the real

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:05.320
problem here is the temptation to use

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:09.200
bombs that'll just slow down our

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:10.910
doubling that much more so I mean we're

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:20.300
unlikely to improve that much on this

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:22.610
floor I'm sad to say of course we have

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.110
the boss fight maybe the the ideal for

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:28.430
us would be like a boss fight against

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:30.320
the fallen and then picking up copies

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:35.420
head and sucking it up would be not that

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:36.649
bad nine lives also very useful I would

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.720
like to open that but I don't think we

00:15:36.649 --> 00:15:40.820
can justify it right now I don't think

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:44.450
this run is fragile right now I want

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:48.440
that to be clear I think this run is

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:54.769
pretty resilient but it's it's

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:57.470
definitely not there yet a room like

00:15:54.769 --> 00:15:59.089
this really like for me exemplifies the

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:01.339
situation that I just don't understand

00:15:59.089 --> 00:16:02.990
what I'm supposed to do like the enemies

00:16:01.339 --> 00:16:06.320
and then this is a problem that Isaac

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:09.860
has that is like it takes it from a 10

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:13.940
to like an actual 9.95 once every few

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:16.190
runs there just doesn't exist the the

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:17.990
pace to get through rooms that are this

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:21.320
difficult without getting hit I don't

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:23.120
it's potentially conceivable I think you

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:26.120
know it is not beyond reason to suggest

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.380
that there is a way you could get

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.180
through that room without getting hit

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.500
but could you reliably get through that

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:32.510
room without getting hit I don't know I

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.890
I still see people who do very well on

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:36.470
dailies complaining about room

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:39.260
archetypes and I think that that's fair

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:40.850
but you know it's an enviable problem to

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:43.130
have to figure out how to balance a game

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:45.140
that most of the time people probably

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:48.040
feel is a little too gama below it's a

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:48.040
little too easy and

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:54.470
you know then you throw in a hard room

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:57.380
and people go all I can't even dodge

00:16:54.470 --> 00:17:00.110
this one without getting hit the virus

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:02.540
we have a recurring theme basically on

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:04.310
this run and that is that we continue to

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:07.790
get these items that have great

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:13.250
potential you know we just haven't taken

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:15.470
them to their highest possible pinnacle

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:18.170
of greatness I suppose you know we could

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:19.610
get spun and that would be HUGE if we

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:23.720
don't get spun there's essentially

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:25.130
almost no reason for us to be there I am

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:27.140
going to do this and I know I should be

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:28.640
doubling but I'm also saving the chance

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:31.100
for an imprint which is what just

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.170
happened thankfully so we do this and

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:36.170
then we get cubbies head and you know

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:39.200
once every 6 rooms getting three flies

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:43.070
means basically nothing but it's getting

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:45.890
us closer the good news is no matter how

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:47.690
bad things get and we're losing a lot of

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:49.250
HP and if we spend like five minutes on

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:51.200
this floor that's all you need to know

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:53.690
maybe I'm playing badly and not dodging

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.370
as well as I should but any time like

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:58.180
the third or fourth floor takes you five

00:17:55.370 --> 00:18:01.100
minutes you know you're in a weird spot

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:08.150
with great potential but a weird spot

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:13.460
nonetheless no matter what we can use to

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:17.450
a clubs to get bombs to heal ourselves

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:22.250
and now I honestly think that the right

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:24.080
play is to go up to 46 bombs and then go

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:28.130
back for the Joker card now that we got

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:33.080
to guppy items I know I move away from

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:35.690
the bombs but maybe that's why now that

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:43.610
we have two guppy items it seems fairly

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:48.110
sensible dude oh food okay is almost

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:50.480
death but that's fine now that we have

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:51.890
46 bombs which oh sorry eighty-three

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:56.360
bombs cousin taro cloth we actually got

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:59.270
299 I think close we might as well just

00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:00.890
grab the Joker card and try to make the

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:03.070
guppy dream come true I am actually an

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:05.230
idiot this is where we stop in an idiot

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:06.519
okay since oil thank you it's a damage

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:09.789
upgrade holy crap

00:19:06.519 --> 00:19:12.820
I did that because we heal up quickly

00:19:09.789 --> 00:19:15.610
and seemed worth it okay

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:25.149
so you've had your floor of tilts you

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:28.110
can have it all my Empire of tilts I'm

00:19:25.149 --> 00:19:28.110
just looking

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:34.809
we finally we got two-thirds of Gumpy we

00:19:31.059 --> 00:19:38.919
got two-thirds of spun there's our Joker

00:19:34.809 --> 00:19:42.399
card just give me one of these to finish

00:19:38.919 --> 00:19:46.990
it off I'm being a baby like whenever

00:19:42.399 --> 00:19:50.519
damaged yet but we have actually barely

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:53.200
improved our damage made our speed

00:19:50.519 --> 00:19:55.659
enough of a good deal worse to be

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:58.000
terrible rate of fire is exactly the

00:19:55.659 --> 00:20:00.220
same you know we need something

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.889
transformative at this point we put in

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:05.080
the the time I don't even want to point

00:20:02.889 --> 00:20:08.320
out how that first shot actually went

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:10.029
right through that enemy oh he's a ghost

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:16.929
but you've got a disabled his ghost

00:20:10.029 --> 00:20:18.789
generator - no just no okay I actually

00:20:16.929 --> 00:20:21.429
didn't expect that to be the secret room

00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:26.110
so as far as I'm concerned I got pretty

00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:32.080
lucky there we cannot fly these could

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:35.710
give us a spirit hearts which are quite

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:38.169
important right now the luck upgrade is

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:42.610
nothing to sneeze at either forgive me

00:20:38.169 --> 00:20:44.980
now I do believe that if you suck up a

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:46.480
forget-me-now it's lost our sight like

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:50.230
you use it every time you press the

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:54.879
spacebar which is actually great on the

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:58.450
chest or it seems like it would be but

00:20:54.879 --> 00:21:00.190
you also never make any progress so and

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:03.580
we'll never be able to use the Joker

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:05.590
card again so all I ask for game I'm

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:09.190
willing to Zayn I'll say in with the

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:11.289
best of them look who we got our Zayn's

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.830
on now that was not a good idea on my

00:21:11.289 --> 00:21:14.680
part

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:17.830
it's not the most obvious thing in the

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:19.510
world but I need you to give me the

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:23.830
tools to say no because I can't give up

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:26.020
the the Joker dream right now you're

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:33.940
asking me to do something I cannot do I

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:36.820
cannot oblige there have been good plays

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:41.950
on this run as well I just want to make

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:44.200
that clear the like milking the Christ

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:48.550
out of two of bombs was a two of bombs

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:52.660
milking the Christ out of two of clubs

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:55.090
was a good play and now we like I mean

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:57.130
it's scary we're gonna the chance to

00:21:55.090 --> 00:22:00.420
respond but if we get hit once we'll die

00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:05.020
so the smart play is not to do this but

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:10.750
come on how can you not real problem

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:17.050
though 0.78 speed being able to fly

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:19.090
helps out but this is in a way it's

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:21.820
almost like my punishment for taking

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:23.890
guppy I feel like you can't just take it

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:25.870
like a guppy in a vacuum you've always

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:28.180
got to offer something to the the rng

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:30.700
god so putting myself on half a spear at

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:37.330
heart as a result so I think basically

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:39.250
if we find a if we find a spear at heart

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:42.480
or a black heart we'll probably get

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:42.480
enough pace to win the run

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:50.690
I think basically that spirit art gives

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:55.340
us the win and it's a little bit of a

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:58.700
broad stroke admittedly but and got a

00:22:55.340 --> 00:23:01.220
broad strength baby and I'll win the

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:03.890
game okay we don't need to check that

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:07.220
but we will check that we're only on

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:09.620
necropolis one of all oh my god if we

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:13.040
had fought this guy on half a spirit

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:17.510
heart we're dusted there's no question

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:22.270
in my mind no there's not an important

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:22.270
enough conversation for Skype right now

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:33.560
it's a dire moment thank you for the HP

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:36.380
thank you for the HP ain't working

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:38.840
scared to take the devil you're gonna

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:45.170
take the go ahead get some boo boo boo

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:46.640
okay I'm closing this window as the

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:48.140
Skype window I closed it wasn't the

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.200
Isaac window that I closed that be a

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:55.790
little brazen one and a half spirit arts

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:59.140
is so much nicer than one gallery and by

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:59.140
guppy I mean ghost baby

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:15.160
I know we're on one it wasn't a misspeak

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:17.770
really a miss speaking you haven't seen

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:19.720
our item room yet you know what we

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:23.290
should just get out then take your item

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:24.760
room one and a half means that there's

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:28.330
only one enemy in the game that can kill

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:30.160
you in one hit so and then that dude

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:32.560
only shows up like once every 30 runs or

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:35.740
something apparently dude we're starting

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:37.660
it's all coming together I don't even

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:39.250
know what happens if we suck up

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:40.450
forget-me-now the present here's the

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:42.580
here's the reason I'm not going to suck

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:44.530
up forgive me now first off is it Zayn

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:47.410
yeah but I've done it the other reason

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:49.630
is it puts you in a limitless Zayn and

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:52.270
that's dangerous you guys ever see

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:53.410
ant-man it's like going to many shrinks

00:24:52.270 --> 00:25:00.100
and ant-man it puts you in like the

00:24:53.410 --> 00:25:01.930
subatomic realm we can't just like go to

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:04.840
an item room forget-me-now go to an item

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:06.490
room forget-me-now it it becomes so zany

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:09.190
it actually strips the world of all

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:12.460
meaning it's only a Zayn if it goes

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:15.190
against like the norm is that going

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:16.750
against the norm if it becomes so common

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:18.220
I know it seems like I'm making up a lot

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:21.010
of excuses not to do this but the other

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:24.160
one is just that like I don't like the

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:26.590
the infinite loop it's different on the

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:29.230
when we used to do undefined Luke's on

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:33.580
the chest the reason is very simple it

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:34.780
was close I said so no that's the reason

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.640
is very different is because there is a

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:38.770
chance that you wouldn't get the

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:43.600
undefined loop so eventually it was like

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:49.480
self-limiting but these are not these go

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:55.030
on forever and as a result you know as

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:56.650
aim with no limit is not sane this is a

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:58.420
good situation by the way we don't I

00:25:56.650 --> 00:26:00.640
mean we could get dull razor but it

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:02.860
doesn't matter for us deep pockets is

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.360
pretty good you should keep buying this

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:06.100
beer at ours is what I mean okay so Jar

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:08.380
flies I don't know if it works

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:10.960
I believe trinkets melter works so we

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:12.700
should smelt it all right that's going

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.800
to obviously spit us out back there but

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:16.630
I mean it's not like it cost us anything

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:19.300
Jarrah flies I just don't think it works

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:19.840
now if I could just stack up infinity

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:23.260
spirit

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:25.600
I'd be a happy camper or some spirit

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:30.429
arts is also fine okay

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:32.169
where the heck was our shop relative to

00:26:30.429 --> 00:26:38.260
the boss room good save nobody noticed

00:26:32.169 --> 00:26:41.440
the miss speaking there thirty four keys

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:47.080
that to his fades from like zero keys

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:54.909
really worked out well for us I thought

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:58.570
it was here curse of the lost man is so

00:26:54.909 --> 00:27:00.220
annoying especially when you tella for

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:01.630
it I mean that one's on me

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.890
we must have come this way and then

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:05.649
maybe it was often there was like this

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:14.679
room I chose not to do I'm not taking

00:27:05.649 --> 00:27:18.130
forget me now a lot of like very minor

00:27:14.679 --> 00:27:21.159
design foibles coming to the service of

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:24.100
the Cizek run right now this is not fun

00:27:21.159 --> 00:27:25.779
maybe not everything in every game

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:30.070
should be designed to be fun but this is

00:27:25.779 --> 00:27:33.789
like this is hell I don't mind like

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:37.350
we're going to live we basically got

00:27:33.789 --> 00:27:40.539
absurdly strong on this floor

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:42.309
drastically improves you know the way

00:27:40.539 --> 00:27:45.130
this run looks for us from an optics

00:27:42.309 --> 00:27:47.919
standpoint but like the thing is like I

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:50.440
know we didn't go this way because we

00:27:47.919 --> 00:27:53.980
had to walk back to get the Joker card

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:56.399
from our boss fight so I just I just

00:27:53.980 --> 00:28:02.919
don't know where he went

00:27:56.399 --> 00:28:07.409
I'm begging you and we still got one

00:28:02.919 --> 00:28:10.029
more floor to go like please have mercy

00:28:07.409 --> 00:28:11.649
did we come this way like I thought

00:28:10.029 --> 00:28:15.130
maybe I skipped that room that's where

00:28:11.649 --> 00:28:16.330
am i teleported out of okay so worth for

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:18.750
the life of man I don't know how we did

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:24.940
it but we're out of here okay move on

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:28.929
did bad stranger it's been banned cuz of

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:30.880
the loss don't do that like to know

00:28:28.929 --> 00:28:34.450
where I have the

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:40.390
and have some fun and make some friends

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:42.730
goodbye Zoo is not to me when you might

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:44.440
as well deal crack on it he rocked ice

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:46.720
wall come on a little too little too

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:48.250
late on that right uh what do we need

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:51.130
now to make this run because it's good

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:56.050
what do we do to make it better speed

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:58.030
dude 0.78 speed is not becoming of a run

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:59.680
that's in maturity like this this is

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:01.330
like what's my age again sort of

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:05.290
situation except it's what's my speed

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:07.780
again nobody likes it when you've got

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:10.600
bad speed and you still shoot like

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:13.000
you're on basement one what the heck is

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:14.710
a TD whoa wait let's read again what the

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.910
heck is ramming speed my friends saying

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:18.160
I don't act my speed

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:20.850
what's my speed again room what's my

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:25.210
speed again

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:29.020
not bad for like completely off the cuff

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:30.850
I was the kid who when I grew up thought

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:32.380
freestyle rap was actually all

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:35.500
constructed at the time that it was

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:37.840
wrapped I you know to this day it was

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:40.360
like a professional wrestling is staged

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:42.370
sort of realization for me that you just

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:44.710
write the beats or you sorry you write

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:46.720
the lyrics at home and then just find a

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:51.490
way to apply them to you know a beat at

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:53.470
runtime basically I'm still that's

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:56.920
that's the ideal for me is you just

00:29:53.470 --> 00:30:01.120
constructing in your head stop this

00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:07.180
please okay item room that's a speed

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:10.830
downgrade got so mind flutter you turn

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:10.830
me into Jerry Seinfeld temporarily

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:20.830
I don't quite think this is the worst

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:24.880
guppy run we've had you know this year

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:24.880
but it's got to be in the conversation

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:31.250
seven damaged admittedly has changed the

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:33.710
game like and our consumables are in a

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:35.210
lovely spot we definitely want to go to

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:37.160
the shop I don't think there's been a

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:38.690
run and some of this is obviously like

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.430
me being in any of it I don't think

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:47.030
there's been a run recently where I've

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:50.090
had to rely as much on on blue fires and

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:51.500
spirit hearts and you know skulls and

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:53.240
stuff like that to give me any sort of

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.980
like a reasonable chance of victory now

00:30:53.240 --> 00:31:00.740
we're past that we shouldn't need that

00:30:54.980 --> 00:31:02.780
and if we do it's embarrassing but this

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:07.730
is like you know winning a million

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:09.920
dollars and then but you do I don't know

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:12.050
like this the metaphor fell apart what a

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:14.480
metaphor will eventually be a memory of

00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:15.950
a time when I tried so hard to get you

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:17.600
to relate to what I was about to say but

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:18.800
I was like lies it's like in a million

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.840
dollars but then immediately getting

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:23.720
stuck in a time travel device and you

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:25.130
know then you travelled with time when a

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:28.490
million dollars isn't worth nearly as

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:31.040
much money like you know not it's not

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:35.330
sensible we could suck up and trick you

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:40.910
the razor you wait a minute hey your

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:43.640
moron NL why aren't you sucking up bad

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:45.230
passes and using them as statistical

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:47.270
improvements I mean that was actually a

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:48.920
good rate of fire improvement how many

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:50.510
opportunities have I had to suck up an

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:53.780
item that stinks and I have chosen not

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:57.920
to that's actually infinity percent my

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:59.390
bad yeah yeah that's pretty stupid all

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:02.350
right but you know at least you figured

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:04.910
it out before the run was totally over

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:07.670
it's always better to have that and then

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:09.980
like people go when's he going to notice

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:12.290
he can use void and then edit oh that he

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:13.670
finally did it still what an idiot than

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:15.080
it is to just get a bunch of tweets

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:18.410
after the fact and be like you know you

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:19.580
can use void did we roll bad passes yes

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:24.310
right

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:24.310
stead temporary brain fart I guess

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:29.870
so rate of fire is improved don't be mad

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.279
at me for telling the truth seven

00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:33.940
damaged its lading the games not that

00:32:31.279 --> 00:32:36.289
good the flies are going to carry but

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:38.240
seven damaged insulating the game is not

00:32:36.289 --> 00:32:39.889
like the be-all-end-all we're still

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.620
going to use blank card Joker because

00:32:39.889 --> 00:32:44.409
it's amazing and we've really relied on

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:47.600
that for the whole run pretty much so

00:32:44.409 --> 00:32:50.090
the more the merrier dude I am so in for

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:51.470
lump of coal which we did not get but

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:53.750
yet okay sure

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:56.059
I'll suck up Krampus head we're going to

00:32:53.750 --> 00:33:02.539
teleport at the present moment we

00:32:56.059 --> 00:33:04.549
teleport every time we use we use void

00:33:02.539 --> 00:33:07.039
because both of our cards are teleport

00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:09.080
cards but eventually we may be able to

00:33:07.039 --> 00:33:10.909
use this as Krampus instead if we desire

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.980
now I hope we could get something a

00:33:10.909 --> 00:33:14.929
little stronger than just Krampus head

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:16.039
once every six rooms because I don't

00:33:14.929 --> 00:33:17.570
know about you but I got a sneaking

00:33:16.039 --> 00:33:19.639
suspicion that there's an easier way to

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:21.620
get the effect of Krampus head once

00:33:19.639 --> 00:33:23.059
every six rooms then sucking up Krampus

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:24.980
has had with void and then getting rid

00:33:23.059 --> 00:33:26.509
of all your teleport cards just like

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:28.070
there's got to be an item in the game

00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:32.179
that fits the bill there just slip on my

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:36.889
mind right now see the item is Krampus

00:33:32.179 --> 00:33:39.379
is head that's the joke there but if we

00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:42.440
if we ever get rid of the teleport cards

00:33:39.379 --> 00:33:43.580
which we should on the chest because

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.690
it's not like we're ever going to need

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:46.460
to go to the deal with the devil twice

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:47.779
on the chest in all likelihood probably

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:51.379
should have suck that up as a passive

00:33:47.779 --> 00:33:53.330
but now we can suck up this as a passive

00:33:51.379 --> 00:33:55.220
instead oh dude I'm just being honest

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:57.279
with you it feels so good to go fast

00:33:55.220 --> 00:34:01.850
right now

00:33:57.279 --> 00:34:04.970
now I figured we'd suck that up because

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:06.559
I don't care about having a cube of meat

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:10.060
we never really should get close to an

00:34:06.559 --> 00:34:12.619
enemy at this point in our lives I think

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:17.990
there is a dice room and a curse with

00:34:12.619 --> 00:34:19.940
the blind dice rooms are almost always

00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:22.579
at this stage of the game especially if

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:26.149
it looks like a super win dice rooms are

00:34:22.579 --> 00:34:28.299
almost always a bad idea which is why

00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:31.460
we're going to go look

00:34:28.299 --> 00:34:33.619
this might be the rare you know reroll a

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:37.159
one run into a better one run sort of

00:34:33.619 --> 00:34:39.440
situation because we're like we're

00:34:37.159 --> 00:34:41.389
waiting on bank approval to get one run

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:42.589
status this isn't like we're walking in

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:44.270
and we're like I'm going to knock them

00:34:42.589 --> 00:34:46.039
out with my pitch this is like I hope

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:47.780
they let me live my dream of winning on

00:34:46.039 --> 00:34:57.410
this run it's still a slightly

00:34:47.780 --> 00:35:00.500
borderline doesn't matter okay let's see

00:34:57.410 --> 00:35:02.180
we're going to take it duality dude I

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:05.359
mean there's nothing that more

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:08.990
exemplifies the way that this run has

00:35:05.359 --> 00:35:10.160
gone then getting duality on our last

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:12.410
deal with the devil

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:14.690
our last guaranteed deal is that we

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:22.400
can't even use duality with the goat

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:24.619
head so at this stage of the game I will

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:29.150
say no matter how bad things are in

00:35:24.619 --> 00:35:32.990
Isaac they can get worse sometimes so

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:34.279
should really and I'm disappointed we

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:36.940
didn't get the reroll because I would

00:35:34.279 --> 00:35:41.839
have liked to just to see where it goes

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:45.980
where it could have gone rather but in

00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:46.910
this in this particular situation maybe

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:49.910
it's for the best

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:51.890
it is unfathomable to be to me I should

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:54.799
say that we have 0.78 speed this late in

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:56.480
the game I didn't anything we lived in a

00:35:54.799 --> 00:36:00.220
world where God was that cruel that

00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:00.220
apparently I was mistaken

00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:09.310
just kill mom it should happen for Kim

00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:11.079
mom's hardships I should have him

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:13.420
relatively quickly we're not going to

00:36:11.079 --> 00:36:15.220
make it to hush we did delirium on our

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:17.440
last fight so like I feel like we got

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:19.390
some stored goodwill there maybe it's to

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:23.560
ago but anyway I feel like we've got

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:27.089
some stored goodwill there I just beg

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:29.460
you for something a little little better

00:36:27.089 --> 00:36:32.260
of course we've already seen that but

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:34.119
okay okay okay we're at the home stretch

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:37.660
and again it's almost impossible to lose

00:36:34.119 --> 00:36:41.440
I just wishing for something a little

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:46.109
bit more exceptional as good as I mean

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:49.150
we have Pali Pali sorry I'm a pyromaniac

00:36:46.109 --> 00:36:52.420
we've had it for 55 minutes here and

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:53.950
it's never really at least outside of

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:55.630
guaranteed survival and the early game

00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:57.700
never really didn't anything for us

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:59.079
because we haven't gotten much HP either

00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:00.819
and the HP that we have gotten

00:36:59.079 --> 00:37:04.000
admittedly we've traded immediately away

00:37:00.819 --> 00:37:11.140
so I mean I got to take some ownership

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:14.260
for that this is just bad I don't want

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:15.339
to be this bitter I'm not really bitter

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:18.550
it's not like I'm like I'm never gonna

00:37:15.339 --> 00:37:23.880
please him again but come on it's a bad

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:23.880
business decision but nothing there um

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:31.119
it's like we've gotten them the most

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:32.530
I roll were the items and we did become

00:37:31.119 --> 00:37:35.140
Guffey but apart from that we've gotten

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:36.760
like the most I roll were the items okay

00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:40.380
something with the devil every single

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:43.540
floor but none of them have provided

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:45.640
literally any damage ups how do you get

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:48.760
six deals with a devil with no damage

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:50.230
ups all the damage ups we have come from

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:54.880
other sources and there's been two of

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:58.359
them over the course of you know 12

00:37:54.880 --> 00:38:05.230
floors one of them was pretty good I'm

00:37:58.359 --> 00:38:07.450
not I'm not mad but it's just it's just

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:10.000
a surprise I mean Isaac keeps finding

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:11.319
new ways to surprise he I guess is the

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.040
way that I'm trying to get this point

00:38:11.319 --> 00:38:14.040
across here

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:20.040
either way I will say there's a chance

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:23.430
that nine lives might be the right way

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:25.110
to go basically trading 3 spirit odds

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:27.360
for one red heart and then multiplying

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:29.160
our lives by nine you can't look at it

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:31.170
on a strictly mathematical level but

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:32.700
there is a chance that that's the right

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:34.230
way to go especially if we do end up

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:41.520
taking a deal with the devil on the next

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:43.680
floor dead onion is pretty good will

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:45.120
chubby is it okay at best we're going to

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:49.710
go this whole run without speed upgrade

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:50.250
it's mostly just incredibly health up

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:54.210
okay

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:56.520
actually a health up is pretty good so

00:38:54.210 --> 00:39:04.680
what I will do is look for a half red

00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:06.240
heart and then teleport also good don't

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:09.540
forget you can use void to suck up the

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:12.870
bad items so that passes that's what we

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:14.550
want can be a conception at least

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:16.740
enables permanent polaroid invincibility

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:18.390
and gives us a potential side benefit

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:21.330
that's that's an item i can't complain

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:25.190
about it is way too late to be likely to

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:29.610
use to like pay out for us but you know

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:31.440
you know when when you got a at some

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:33.210
point you got to stop complaining we got

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:35.340
a good item is too late to make it work

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:37.950
but it's you know it's not like they

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:41.130
just gave us crap so these are totally

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:43.200
avoidable items here I'm committed to

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:47.420
you know the attempt to give us one

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:47.420
speed upgrade at some point on this run

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:55.920
it's a big help I'll get another bad

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:58.020
trick so just in case one potentially

00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:02.510
run ruining pill wasn't enough for you

00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:02.510
let's add in a second one just for sport

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:10.910
I don't know that's probably where we

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:12.770
should use perks to be honest with you

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:13.940
in fact we should be using perks on any

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:19.150
room in which it seems like we could

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:22.040
conceivably be hit at all because with

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:27.260
our trinket which was like endless

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:33.860
nameless there is a a chance to just get

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:37.850
it back right after you use it so okay

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:39.680
so we're going to suck up GB bug that

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:41.510
has given us another tiers upgrade I

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:48.650
think all of our stat improvements have

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:50.360
been tiers in shot speed which is not

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:51.650
bad that's actually if you can choose

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:58.940
that you know it gives you a tiers

00:40:51.650 --> 00:41:00.350
upgrade every time you probably would of

00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:02.470
course wouldn't mind getting some speed

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:05.140
either a tough-love grade item

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:08.900
absolutely nothing wrong with that

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:10.370
especially with five luck rosary

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:13.820
basically gives us the win if we weren't

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:15.590
guaranteed it already and we'll carry

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:18.730
this one through - it's like logical

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:21.950
conclusion that's another luck upgrade

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:23.780
but man what is what a strange run as we

00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:29.060
come around the horn here it's just like

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:30.500
not great it's got the shell of

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:34.280
something great it's like a Terry's

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:35.900
chocolate orange that is masking toxic

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:38.740
waste inside of it or some flies a

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:40.460
kinder egg full of broken glass I'm out

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:41.450
thanks for watching hope you enjoyed the

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:42.320
episode if you think like a like button

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:43.550
I'll set a great deal of course

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.410
subscribe if you want to see more in the

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:49.180
future but for now thanks for watching

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:49.180
and I'll see you next time
