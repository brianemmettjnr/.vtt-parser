##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.529
everybody welcome back northernlion

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.779
the binding of issac what could be

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.440
greater well world peace yeah but I mean

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.830
like realistically what could be greater

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.450
well Universal basically I said

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.810
realistically what could be greater

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.490
where Lazarus again JW six six are 8rq

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.480
we know where stacks because we got

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:28.199
three numbers in the seed three numbers

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.760
in the seed means we're set the numbers

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.289
give the good stuff the letters give the

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.320
bad stuff we've already established this

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.510
time and time again last run we were

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.739
Lazarus two lasses in a row is actually

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.750
completely fine not the best character

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.250
in the game but an early game like mini

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.469
game to try to figure out when we're

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.350
supposed to die usually the answer ends

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.660
up being if we find HP we go for it and

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.539
also it means that we basically have no

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.449
reason not to hurt ourselves pardon me

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.670
as long as we're able to as long as

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.140
we're able to survive once we come back

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.270
from the dead they God me they've

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.770
surrounded me well I don't know maybe

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.060
we've doomed ourselves a little bit here

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.010
but we'll take the pill now pheromones

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.750
would have been better to take that pill

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.350
earlier admittedly as we all know but

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.830
again assuming we don't get hit by a

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.409
champion kind of a big assumption to

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.470
make the present moment we should be

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.780
okay good God and God love it it's a

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.400
surprise to find we can't stop it where

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.420
the heck is my additional HP here

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.430
there's a bomb on that other room you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.990
should go back for it I already see the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.210
you know the heart beating is one on

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.100
this one it's very simple we go back we

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.439
get the bomb we use the bomb to access

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.970
that chest the chest gives us a spirit

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.600
heart or enough money to buy one from

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.649
the shop and then we're good to go

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.240
should have gone back for this earlier I

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.100
mean we do have secret room access that

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.710
might be worth more in most situations

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.079
than just grabbing a single chest but in

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.689
this case I'm willing to I'm willing to

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.979
make a chance at it I know what you're

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.799
thinking how does he do it

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.929
I can't believe it works even half a

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.390
spear at heart dude that's fine half a

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.200
spear at art is OK in my world I would

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.959
still like

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.860
get enough money to get an arcade on the

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.269
next floor

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.090
you know it's HP could come in handy

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.530
let's let's finish our exploratory

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.599
surgery here so we can make sure that

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.000
we're going to be safe but we really did

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.849
get bailed out to be 100% honest with

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.760
you this could have been a very very

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.560
dangerous situation so out of our golden

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.560
coupe we got enough money to make an

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.510
arcade worth while we could also move we

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.769
have ten cents we do have ten cents so I

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:48.590
think you use a key there's no spirit

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:51.150
hard for sale okay I guess we just go

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.709
and there was a tinted rock in here so

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.030
give me the spirit heart please oh

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.200
that's that's no good I can't believe

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.000
that out of all of that we didn't create

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.420
more of an advantage but it's kind of

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.519
the early theme of this run is a little

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.130
fraught with danger at the same time

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.840
regular version of Ragman far from the

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.280
ideal enemy that you want to fight here

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.420
but certainly there are a worse enemies

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.130
we could be facing here in the early

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.840
game try to keep up our pace here and we

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.940
did manage to get back there that's good

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.920
we got more HP which is also excellent

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.600
that gives us a good ability to play a

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.980
blood bank if we're able to find one on

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.620
the next floor but we're light on keys

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.510
also have not improved our damage at all

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.920
except for the respawn is Lazarus which

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.090
is enough for now

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:43.440
but you know it's not like we've saved

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.720
the day when it comes to the actual run

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.609
so far so the big deal for us is

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.510
definitely making sure that we get this

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.370
deal with the devil

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.870
hopefully we'll manage to snag a little

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.700
bit of HP along with it so we're not in

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.620
full glass can and build without having

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.980
the cannon part of it which would I mean

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.290
that would just be mr. glass right

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.150
golden key we've already solved our key

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:08.519
related concerns as a result of that at

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.389
least temporarily and I got to be honest

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.230
with you

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:16.590
one heart earlier on for gertie jr. is

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.090
paying dividends right now I mean

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.739
inevitably we weren't going to use our

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.000
bomb for that unless we absolutely had

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.680
to to begin with but the fact that we've

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.690
managed to make it work decently for us

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.340
in light of having many other damage

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.540
upgrades and we are still very early to

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.460
be fair but is quite good for us so

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:41.140
through luck upgrades this is maybe the

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:43.090
best shop we got Wheel of Fortune

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.040
we have no bombs but I'll tell you what

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.570
I'm going to buy a bomb pop down Wheel

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.530
of Fortune and see if we can get value

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:52.420
we got four cents and lazy worms let's

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.000
say if not great value but I will take

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.280
starter deck which is giving us a full

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.350
card there's something to be said about

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.390
that I don't know we got some future

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.760
prospects there starter deck is nice no

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.630
pills is usually for the best because we

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.640
know what we're getting into

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.760
and we'll probably we'll look for an

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.650
arcade and then use our fool card to

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.880
maybe allow us to get into the boss Trap

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.140
room and then teleport out because I

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:19.120
don't really want to save a fool card

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:21.340
for boss rush but as of right now we're

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:29.140
100% in the clear crystal ball is such a

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:31.270
good space bar item pick up a little bit

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.880
more money we can hold emergency

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.470
contacts so we might as well even if I

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.970
don't understand it at all and

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.710
apparently we found the secret room

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.800
which is a surprise to me but we have no

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.960
bomb so then we accidentally create the

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.090
secret room or did we just see it

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.060
because if we created it that's one

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:53.320
thing you know we can walk in if we just

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.610
saw it like a glimpse between dimensions

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.910
or something like that that's different

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.800
now I don't think we can I don't think

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.390
we can just walk into it unless I was

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.590
going to say maybe up here somehow would

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:06.940
give us the ability so we have no arcade

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.270
which means the only way they were going

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.130
to be able to grab the whatever is in

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.220
the boss trap room is by getting a deal

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:17.580
with the devil which you know luckily

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:20.380
100% is going to happen

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.240
monstro not a particularly difficult

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.690
boss fight to be honest with you all I

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:29.290
want out of this is enough damage or DPS

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:31.270
at least so that I'm not like worried

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:34.240
about making sure the enemy stand on top

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.680
of our anemic creep because Annie may

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:40.509
creep

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:43.050
it's not that decent what the hell am I

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:43.050
doing here

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:50.770
mmm give me some good tears oh okay

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.360
that's where we stop because the rest of

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:56.320
the notes become actually difficult no

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:58.780
bombs are you kidding me what am I

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:10.930
supposed to do there's two stone chests

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:13.030
back there I'm mad I was looking for two

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:15.160
Justice cards or do it like a justice

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.900
card I guess I should say but we should

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.970
be happy we got go ahead go ahead pretty

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.110
much ensures that we'll have a chance in

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:23.260
the future to take some deal with the

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.310
devil items presumably no you don't

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.330
understand it's not right see what

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:28.360
you're supposed to do therefore peak

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.800
irony is give me a bomb and then when

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.840
you give me the bomb I go oh of course

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.280
you give me the bomb and I try to you

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.229
know make some kind of pity joke about

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.419
it out of it like oh that's lions law

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:38.919
right there you ever desperately need a

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:43.090
consumable they'll only give it to you

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:49.810
after it's not useful anymore but we

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:51.130
past that we're past that the sun card I

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:54.610
like it I love it

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:56.050
I want some more of it literally I could

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.880
hold some more of it so if you'd like to

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.360
give me some I wouldn't kick it out of

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:05.889
bed for eating crackers

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:07.870
there's peak irony we're going to get a

00:08:05.889 --> 00:08:10.000
charge here too so we're definitely

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:14.050
going to be able to crack open that

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.199
tinted Rock one way or the other where

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:19.060
we get the Sun card dude crystal ball

00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:20.620
starter deck is a decent combination you

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:23.139
can't deny it look at that two speed

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:25.030
upgrade extra HP for our deals with the

00:08:23.139 --> 00:08:28.120
devil we're going it's not quite as

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:30.970
great as our last Lazarus run started

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:32.589
but maybe it'll finish stronger like by

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:35.800
the end of that last Lazarus run I was

00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:39.159
just like yeah it's going okay but I

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:42.300
really could use some more bum friend

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:42.300
ear your lucky day buddy

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:48.140
like we got those or we got that guppy

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:50.579
item and then we never got another

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:52.170
another got the item we got the first

00:08:50.579 --> 00:08:54.450
copy item we got was on the very first

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:57.680
floor may be on the very first room and

00:08:54.450 --> 00:09:01.019
then after that just nothing to a hearts

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.740
keep the full card but replaced with

00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:06.660
yeah

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:10.890
there you go belongs to me thank you

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:12.120
very much what was this the son you know

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.550
what would keep the son instead of the

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:22.680
fool I understand the boss rush concerns

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:23.970
but think this is correct we're getting

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:27.440
to the point especially with all these

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:31.290
champions that I'd like to improve from

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:34.680
4.20 damage as a dank as it is to get to

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:35.970
something a little bit more palatable

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:40.100
for us because we're just starting to

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:43.140
fall behind a little bit here the Harmon

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:49.260
Joker's son yeah I mean Joker's son it's

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:52.890
pretty good we're spoiled for choice I

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:57.000
wish we can stack up four cards now you

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:59.940
know starter deck plus polydactyl is

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.980
something but you cannot no over the

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:06.140
engine limitation or design intention

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.140
but those items do not stack

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:12.769
I'm just begging for like an actually

00:10:11.629 --> 00:10:14.060
good deal with the devil here if we

00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:16.939
don't get a good deal with the devil on

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:19.519
this floor I may actually do a cardinal

00:10:16.939 --> 00:10:21.470
sin of lazy Isaac Ness which is using

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:24.589
the Joker card like right off the bat on

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:26.240
the next floor to try to you know get

00:10:24.589 --> 00:10:28.160
those upgrades as soon as possible if

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:31.850
they even exist which which they may or

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:34.459
may not I'm also I took bum friend

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:37.100
mostly because bum friend like was

00:10:34.459 --> 00:10:38.720
literally in a room next to nine cents I

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.610
couldn't access so it seemed like you

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.959
pick it up you're gonna at least get you

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:43.220
the consumable you spent to get bum

00:10:41.959 --> 00:10:46.749
friend back and sure he'll probably

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:49.459
annoy you in the future but you know

00:10:46.749 --> 00:10:50.959
maybe you can get that super bummed

00:10:49.459 --> 00:10:53.300
transformation for the second time in

00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:59.240
over a thousand episodes and after that

00:10:53.300 --> 00:11:00.769
point the world is your oyster right for

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.449
vigilant we should be able to stop him

00:11:00.769 --> 00:11:05.180
from stealing money that like we

00:11:02.449 --> 00:11:06.620
actually can get most of the time at

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.930
least it's really bad on blood banks

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:12.589
though I'll admit it's also really bad

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:14.180
on Billy banks you know the creator of

00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:14.720
Tae Bo is this a reference that makes

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.209
any sense

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:19.040
in this day and age is this thing on

00:11:17.209 --> 00:11:20.420
hello that's where I'd tap the

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.629
microphone if this game didn't take two

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:25.699
hands to play most of the time uh I

00:11:23.629 --> 00:11:26.649
don't think yeah good good play there it

00:11:25.699 --> 00:11:29.089
was a good one

00:11:26.649 --> 00:11:32.269
blow this guy up get out of here you

00:11:29.089 --> 00:11:34.870
stinky mega fatty we're behind schedule

00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:37.550
that shouldn't be able to stand with the

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:39.259
with the goat head shouldn't be

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:46.430
plausible to be behind schedule for much

00:11:39.259 --> 00:11:49.279
longer just on a principled level okay

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:51.800
dusted HP shouldn't have taken a yet

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:54.350
little brim now that's some good gravy

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:57.379
right there head down to the next floor

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:59.660
again behind schedule but little brain

00:11:57.379 --> 00:12:01.850
is actually a huge get and this is a

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:03.679
little too late like we really could

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:05.980
have used this earlier but I'll live

00:12:03.679 --> 00:12:05.980
with it

00:12:10.999 --> 00:12:17.819
that was highly worth it I think but I

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:20.970
can't really afford to get rid of the

00:12:17.819 --> 00:12:24.029
crystal ball like forever because I need

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:27.300
the HP I need the correct I need the the

00:12:24.029 --> 00:12:30.240
spirit hearts is what I mean to say just

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:32.910
use the Sun to mill them down just a

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:35.999
little bit more so we got a damage bonus

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:37.410
but like a rate of fire decrease it

00:12:35.999 --> 00:12:41.490
wasn't quite proportional but it's

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:42.959
enough to make me think you could have

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:46.589
also teleported and not done this to

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:48.389
begin with but hey well let's just roll

00:12:46.589 --> 00:12:52.019
with this for like the floor and then

00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:54.240
see how things go really don't want to

00:12:52.019 --> 00:12:56.369
use the Joker card right now for reasons

00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:02.689
that I assume are somewhat obvious I'm

00:12:56.369 --> 00:13:05.670
going to answer really fast rate of fire

00:13:02.689 --> 00:13:09.059
really bad amount of damage so I'm going

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:11.550
to be a little risky here in case it's

00:13:09.059 --> 00:13:13.290
not obvious and keep using v8 so the

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:14.970
thing with the eight is it's like almost

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:16.649
any other die in the game that rerolls

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:18.059
essentially your whole run in this case

00:13:16.649 --> 00:13:22.129
is just reroll in your stats but you get

00:13:18.059 --> 00:13:24.269
the idea you only need one good roll

00:13:22.129 --> 00:13:26.040
this is not a good roll but it's not

00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:30.050
horrible we didn't roll everything bad

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:32.189
it's just like largely pretty not great

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:34.589
collectively pretty not great all we

00:13:32.189 --> 00:13:36.929
need is one roll that gives us I would

00:13:34.589 --> 00:13:39.569
say like greater than five damage and

00:13:36.929 --> 00:13:41.069
lower than ten tears and then I'm good

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:47.910
to go as long as my speed isn't like

00:13:41.069 --> 00:13:50.579
below one which seems unlikely see

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:52.949
that's like it's close we're very lucky

00:13:50.579 --> 00:13:55.589
as well in case it's not super clear

00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:58.049
here that basically little brimstone

00:13:55.589 --> 00:14:00.360
will carry us through all of these

00:13:58.049 --> 00:14:02.850
exhausting rerolls if we have to have it

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:09.480
carry us at least fit bummed that

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:11.759
there's no there's no battery charges

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.619
will buy spirit heart and this I know

00:14:11.759 --> 00:14:15.959
people are going to say please please

00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:19.259
please purchase the potato peeler I

00:14:15.959 --> 00:14:20.400
don't think it's that sort of run not

00:14:19.259 --> 00:14:24.360
yet anyway

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:26.040
I think we got at least one more role

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:30.270
and then we could always go with the d8

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:34.470
long-term if we wanted to crystal ball

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:36.210
is really like a it's a safe play which

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:41.580
is far from being a bad thing right now

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:43.740
but it's it is a little more on the

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:45.300
boring side the d8 is I mean they both

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.090
they run the gamut right because the d8

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:49.320
is great but on the other hand it also

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:50.670
like once it's good there's a

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.880
conceivable chance we'd never use it

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:55.440
after that point so we've got a got to

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.360
play our cards right there I think the

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.310
crystal ball is the more extendable item

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:02.010
long term in terms of our enjoyment

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:04.550
through dark Prince's crown actual 10

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:08.430
out of 10 trinket once we get past the

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:11.460
once you get past the depths to d12 is

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:12.900
basically useless in my opinion many

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:16.170
people have taken issue with me saying

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:20.850
that and to be honest with you they're

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:23.670
probably right but I've never had a run

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:25.290
where I was like this item saved us that

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:30.030
is not the criteria for you being any

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:33.540
good but still big speed upgrade it's

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:35.430
another tough one honestly that's where

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:38.760
you stop and this is fine so we don't

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:40.680
have any guppy items I think I think we

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:44.190
take nothing and then we go back for

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:47.400
crystal ball did the d8 do anything for

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:49.560
us I think in the end tears are the same

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:51.420
speed is the same because we got the

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:54.810
extra speed upgrade or later on this

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:57.090
floor and then our damage might have

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:59.580
gone up by like 1.5 so effectively we

00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:01.920
got like a passive little damage

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:04.250
increase I think if I'm if I'm taking

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:06.420
inventory correctly it's not that good

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:09.130
but

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:10.960
it was worth using it for that floor

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:12.670
although I did effectively probably pass

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.680
up at least two spirit ARS or at least

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:16.990
two payouts from crystal ball by not

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.410
keeping crystal ball so think about that

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.300
as well

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:23.740
this is the time where we pop this by

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:29.080
the way so you go for this maybe get

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:32.350
your first crystal ball charge get the

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:33.610
map grab this rune joker card out I

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:36.730
don't want to fight these guys I want to

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:38.800
maintain our chances to get to boss

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:40.510
Russian think our odds of getting a

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.870
teleport card for boss rush are pretty

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:46.410
solid to be a great time to grab lump of

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:52.330
coal okay that's fine

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:54.550
not enough sore about that and we got to

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:56.200
remember you know the double-edged sword

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:58.120
I know we're talking a lot about Isaac

00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:01.930
here but this run has not yet reached a

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:05.490
point in which we're ahead of the scape

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:09.339
velocity you know the escape velocity in

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:12.160
astrodynamics the speed at which you

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:14.140
have to be moving in order to escape the

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:22.720
Earth's gravitational pull more or less

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:24.370
I think that's close to correct I don't

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:26.819
think we're there yet honestly I don't

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:30.340
think fat on mushroom helps us enough

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:37.600
seraphim is like pretty good but let's

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:38.740
go a little deeper all dude it ended up

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.740
being worth it even though our rate of

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:43.750
fire is not great enough to make

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:46.000
technology zero work anytime you use a

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:48.520
reroll machine and your last reroll is

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.840
the one you're happiest with you won you

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.610
know you made the right decision so

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:53.200
certainly I feel like we made the right

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:56.680
decision here and it was looking a

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:58.809
little dire for a while so there we go

00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:03.320
HP HP

00:17:58.809 --> 00:18:05.989
let's go we got this from the brink

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:08.329
we've sort of pulled it back here if we

00:18:05.989 --> 00:18:09.979
want to make boss rush like what's more

00:18:08.329 --> 00:18:11.929
important shop with 12 cents or the

00:18:09.979 --> 00:18:14.449
chance of boss rush think it's the

00:18:11.929 --> 00:18:16.909
chance of sauce rush I'm going to peep

00:18:14.449 --> 00:18:19.519
this for for anything and as a guppy

00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:20.959
items so now I'm regretful I didn't take

00:18:19.519 --> 00:18:23.419
Guppies paw in the last floor but we

00:18:20.959 --> 00:18:25.129
could only deal with the situation and

00:18:23.419 --> 00:18:28.249
the presented itself on the last floor

00:18:25.129 --> 00:18:31.369
you know we we could have thought more

00:18:28.249 --> 00:18:35.089
about potential if the run was safer but

00:18:31.369 --> 00:18:37.009
it was it was not safer so not going to

00:18:35.089 --> 00:18:39.079
waste my time dealing with hypotheticals

00:18:37.009 --> 00:18:41.319
right now dude spirit odds are coming

00:18:39.079 --> 00:18:43.940
through in the clutch

00:18:41.319 --> 00:18:46.940
okay so now what we need is like huge

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:49.969
rate of fire increases hook me up with

00:18:46.940 --> 00:19:00.529
that break me off a piece of that sand

00:18:49.969 --> 00:19:01.899
onion I hate this boss I'm telling you

00:19:00.529 --> 00:19:04.489
straight up

00:19:01.899 --> 00:19:09.499
delirium hardest boss in the game hush

00:19:04.489 --> 00:19:11.690
number two brownie number three the dude

00:19:09.499 --> 00:19:13.339
is on dodge able by by yours truly at

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:15.229
least so we know that's a Krampus

00:19:13.339 --> 00:19:22.339
situation up there we got our full card

00:19:15.229 --> 00:19:26.659
for boss rush let's go unprepared no I'm

00:19:22.339 --> 00:19:28.069
not prepared they gave me a they gave me

00:19:26.659 --> 00:19:28.729
a curse with Allah so I can't see where

00:19:28.069 --> 00:19:30.979
I'm going

00:19:28.729 --> 00:19:36.859
the hole on soos rune plan has fallen

00:19:30.979 --> 00:19:38.059
apart here very very lucky that that

00:19:36.859 --> 00:19:40.699
worked out that way because we could

00:19:38.059 --> 00:19:42.499
have quite easily been forced to take

00:19:40.699 --> 00:19:44.089
damage I really don't like that room for

00:19:42.499 --> 00:19:47.059
that reason it doesn't come up that

00:19:44.089 --> 00:19:48.859
often but it's it's very easy to find

00:19:47.059 --> 00:19:51.669
yourself like unable to avoid taking

00:19:48.859 --> 00:19:55.039
damage on that room this is a

00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:59.329
objectively stupid I think to try to

00:19:55.039 --> 00:20:01.729
make that gamble work but it could be

00:19:59.329 --> 00:20:06.019
subjectively smart if we if we beat the

00:20:01.729 --> 00:20:10.579
odds and get a blood bag early what is

00:20:06.019 --> 00:20:13.510
up with the with the needless active

00:20:10.579 --> 00:20:16.240
item d12

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:20.030
da was fine I'm not insulting that but

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:24.850
d12 glowing hourglass these are not part

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:28.790
of my is not part of my plan right now a

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:31.130
was that's another way out so I think

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:32.410
get rid of on Zeus and enroll a was in

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:36.890
the fool

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:38.390
we don't need on Sue's on this floor the

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:40.190
fool does help us get out of a room that

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:41.720
we don't want to be in like maybe we go

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:45.860
super in the wrong direction we want to

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:47.570
teleport back obviously I got to give

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:49.190
Big Ups to crickets head but I also got

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:51.110
to give Big Ups to Guppies tail for

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:54.800
potentially making that golden chest

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:56.900
exist in the first place sometimes we

00:20:54.800 --> 00:21:00.260
forget that you know some of the lesser

00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:06.350
guppy items do still have uses outside

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:08.150
of the outside of the transformation we

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:11.780
should keep it you still got can we beat

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:15.140
mom quickly I think we're at like quick

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:19.790
ish I'm not sure if I'd say quickly oh

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:22.940
dude you got to keep chaos now we can

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:24.800
beat mom quickly head of the keepers at

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:29.390
least interesting and feels like it's

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:31.340
worth taking I think we're going to make

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:33.380
bas rush which might strike you as a

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:34.850
surprise given the timing that we're on

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:36.980
our way out dude these golden chests

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:38.810
only pay out with items I'm the happiest

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:43.250
man in the world even if some of them

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:51.110
aren't exactly 10 out of tens I'd rather

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:53.030
not use chaos to kill mom but if we have

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:56.000
to we have to

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:58.070
all right let's go now that we have 12

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:04.910
damaged I think the odds of us requiring

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:10.840
chaos are a little lighter but you know

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:13.940
what there you go it's got to be done

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:15.140
just do it and get out don't even worry

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:17.560
okay

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:23.930
this was not worth it at all man

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:26.420
technology to zodiac it's a super bummer

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:31.150
but some of the zodiac items are alright

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:31.150
I don't know what we got on this floor

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:42.110
okay in the end could have been better

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:44.420
boss rush kind of screwed us a little

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:47.030
bit why did I take shade basically just

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:48.590
because I was in there and I was like I

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:50.330
can't take the time to make a

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:52.970
well-reasoned decision about this item

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:56.060
because if we wait too long we're not

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:58.490
going to be able to make the we're not

00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:00.890
going to be able to make the boss rush

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:02.600
now in hindsight that didn't matter too

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:06.470
much we probably made the right decision

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:09.800
but making the boss rush was also

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:11.720
largely irrelevant luckily though free

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:15.590
items for us on these floors

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:17.750
High Priestess not free items but you

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:19.430
know I think you know what I mean we got

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:24.380
item rooms that shouldn't exist so

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:26.420
they're free as far as I'm concerned and

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:30.260
we will have a chance to maybe recoup

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:32.660
our hours a meanness on the hush fight

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:35.150
if we so desire whether or not we desire

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:36.860
will basically boil down to do we have a

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:38.930
permanent ears upgrade by then and does

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:40.370
our HP look good because I'm not

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:42.770
worrying about our damage twelve damage

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:44.420
is great I'm not worried too much about

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:46.250
like utility items because their space

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:49.010
bar item is great the wafer does double

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:50.690
our HP effectively at this point so it's

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:52.490
great to have it and I'm stoked as a

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:54.920
trinket guide for us it's just a you

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:57.710
know another feather in this trinkets

00:23:54.920 --> 00:24:00.770
cap but at the same time it doesn't make

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:03.440
the hush fight go twice as fast it just

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:05.860
makes it makes us much more likely to

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.860
survive

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:11.230
so get stomped son I preached this doing

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:13.330
what it does best

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:16.210
our second last guarantee deal with the

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:20.050
devil could have been guppy we could

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:22.300
have been guppy by now but you know what

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:25.090
let's let's appreciate what we've got

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:28.420
not what we perceive ourselves to have

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:32.470
missed out on it's probably better for

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:34.270
our overall happiness and taking one hit

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:40.030
on that room it's like completely okay

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:43.200
I am unconcerned I would love selfishly

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:43.200
to complete the guppy dream

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:48.970
we haven't actually and I don't think

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:55.840
it's like the game has changed that much

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:58.900
but I think the guppy dream has been

00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:00.730
coming less and less usually it was like

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:06.310
a guarantee

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:07.930
Rawdon baby is also fantastic like in

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:10.140
our to item rooms from the womb and

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:13.330
beyond we got better items than we got

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:16.650
throughout the rest of the game what's

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:16.650
our other one that's ace of clubs right

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:28.210
we got so much time so we got algae's I

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:31.300
mean we get algae's into the blood bank

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:34.780
to get some more money and possibly aged

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:38.500
people at speed upgrade I'm going to do

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:41.520
boss rush as well the Sun the Sun well

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.520
we're going to keep algae's for now

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:52.510
what's more important to algae's rooms

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:53.980
or algiers slot machine obviously

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:56.820
fortune teller wheel of fortune is like

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:59.620
one extra item but think I'm more of a

00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:03.820
algae's algae's man makes us almost

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:05.560
impossible to kill but then if I use the

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:07.600
algae's rune for the blood bank we kind

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:11.640
of miss out on that luxury so you know

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:11.640
maybe you can see my concern there

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:22.809
because I should just do whatever feels

00:26:15.099 --> 00:26:29.829
the most fun at this point the moon

00:26:22.809 --> 00:26:32.469
might as well magic you know what we can

00:26:29.829 --> 00:26:41.559
take Liberty cab now because we don't

00:26:32.469 --> 00:26:44.950
need we don't need any more rooms item

00:26:41.559 --> 00:26:46.419
rooms I should say on the womb I don't

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:53.139
believe that gives you item rooms in the

00:26:46.419 --> 00:26:55.869
cathedral and beyond so I don't know do

00:26:53.139 --> 00:26:58.119
we really need it's weird because like

00:26:55.869 --> 00:27:01.749
hear me out here I would be using the

00:26:58.119 --> 00:27:04.469
algae's rune which I thought we had to

00:27:01.749 --> 00:27:06.789
of where's the other one in here maybe

00:27:04.469 --> 00:27:09.219
did we not have to it maybe I'm mistaken

00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:10.479
but we'd be using the algae's rooms to

00:27:09.219 --> 00:27:11.529
try to get more money on the hush flight

00:27:10.479 --> 00:27:12.999
but I don't really want to do the hush

00:27:11.529 --> 00:27:15.279
flight without having to algae's rooms

00:27:12.999 --> 00:27:16.529
because I can afford to be a snob with

00:27:15.279 --> 00:27:19.539
the way this runs looking right now

00:27:16.529 --> 00:27:21.609
algae's son algae's ace of clubs algae's

00:27:19.539 --> 00:27:22.869
wheel fortune let's take son it is for

00:27:21.609 --> 00:27:26.289
mapping ok now we're going to replace

00:27:22.869 --> 00:27:30.089
the son card with a dice charge dice

00:27:26.289 --> 00:27:30.089
shard is a much much more fun item

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:35.020
so this is going to be our last deal

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:36.760
with the devil it is guaranteed to not

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:42.040
be Krampus because we've seen cramp Oh

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:44.770
already I don't know what besides guppy

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:47.020
I'm super eager to get but hey dude the

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:48.910
mark with permanent polar invincibility

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:50.920
activation sign me up

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:53.620
I'm ready to go so I'm skipping the hush

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:55.180
fry just because well because I want to

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:56.830
we end up doing them on the dailies all

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:58.290
the time anyway and we're still at 10

00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:01.060
rate of fire if I'm going to use like a

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:04.570
I'm going to make up a reason to spin it

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:06.910
generate a fire come on you know what is

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:07.990
this amateur hour I don't know what

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:09.580
that's supposed to mean but when you say

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:14.560
that implicitly some people think you

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:17.220
know what you're talking about so so

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:22.120
they aim for a little added layer of

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:24.700
professionalism it's my money say with

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:28.120
me one more time it's my money and I

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:30.100
want it now so liberty cap I mean

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:34.080
whatever it gives us is fine but I'm not

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:34.080
expecting big things necessarily

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:42.250
especially because we've already got

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:45.810
like near guaranteed mapping it's mostly

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:47.950
just something that exists for like a

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:50.230
little bit of a statistical change

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:51.700
room-to-room should stop using keys

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:53.290
because keys on the chest are worth way

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:55.600
more and we're probably going to get a

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:57.100
bunch of them so the ideal payout would

00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:02.140
actually be like a joker card right now

00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:04.030
and stop using keys so that we can

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:05.620
actually you know get the deal with the

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:08.280
devil that we're accustomed to in this

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:08.280
life but

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:14.490
doesn't look like that's gonna happen

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:16.440
and that's completely okay another fast

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:20.400
run and it's honestly I'm getting like a

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:23.040
feel for Lazarus as being like good but

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:25.200
for some reason semi unremarkable when

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:28.200
it comes to actually getting the stats

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:29.820
at the end like both of these last two

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.800
runs it's probably just basically

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:33.450
randomness but for both of these last

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:37.110
two runs I've just been like it's good

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:39.750
is not not good it's just not that

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:40.950
incredible so I think we blow this up

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:44.400
and we're going to obviously use

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:45.630
forget-me-now it's a fun item might as

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:48.480
well just use two gods we can only take

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:55.920
two things down with us so I think we

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:58.080
want to take algae's dice shard we could

00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:00.870
have taken like we could have taken

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:03.000
something else I guess but that's

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:05.280
obvious cursed I of course curse of the

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:09.120
blind curse die and then how to jump my

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:10.350
reflection common cold oh man if we

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.460
didn't have curse of the blind these

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:12.200
would have been rear old in like two

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:14.430
seconds

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:21.320
instead now we've got an interesting

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:23.550
setup here it's still not bad but

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:25.560
certainly these are items that I would

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:31.770
not have gone for voluntarily probably

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:36.390
d1 I mean we should use the d1 to create

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:38.990
like endless dice shards I guess it's a

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:38.990
card Oh

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:48.600
we could have used this to create

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:50.940
endless items there but I think endless

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:52.830
dice shards is also fine how to jump the

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:54.659
t1 is not better than how to jump how to

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:58.020
jumps probably better on earth on a raw

00:30:54.659 --> 00:31:01.470
level at least but you know I actually

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:04.260
am starting to believe that my

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:07.080
reflection with or without cursed I plus

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:11.460
static tears might be sort of cool as

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:15.270
long as you're using it as long as

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:16.799
you're using it appropriately legand you

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:18.059
can get the tears far enough away from

00:31:16.799 --> 00:31:22.529
each other they create these kind of

00:31:18.059 --> 00:31:25.200
cool patterns that I'm not I'm not fully

00:31:22.529 --> 00:31:26.010
believing there are any bad there any

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:29.429
worse than that

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:31.279
you know our tears were before so we

00:31:29.429 --> 00:31:37.039
should like dice shard this maybe and

00:31:31.279 --> 00:31:40.260
number two that's not good necessarily

00:31:37.039 --> 00:31:43.679
please oh you know what I think I can

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:47.130
live with that I just resent having to

00:31:43.679 --> 00:31:49.020
play carefully because when I put in my

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:51.240
time in this game just give me the easy

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:53.340
wins no I mean this is still an easy win

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:55.789
it's actually an ideal situation because

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:58.380
it's an easy win that's also weird

00:31:55.789 --> 00:32:00.990
now this run has like a reason to exist

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:04.679
beyond filling a quota because we got a

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:06.950
new synergy that you know on paper looks

00:32:04.679 --> 00:32:13.669
like straight garbage but is actually

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:13.669
pretty interesting blood rights

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:20.680
considering we have the wafer I thought

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:23.500
that maybe like triggering blood rights

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:24.730
for some damage and invincibility might

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:26.460
not be horrible but we're kind of

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:30.910
forcing an archetype that doesn't

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:40.180
necessarily make sense but we're also

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:41.710
completely safe so no yeah so remember

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:43.030
what I said about four second archetype

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:44.500
that doesn't completely make sense I

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:49.960
think that more or less proves it right

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:52.270
there we get ship the whoo

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:57.150
all right that makes more sense sac

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:57.150
dagger also lovely let's finish this off

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:06.070
almost at the end of your two more rooms

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:09.280
and then the final room which by my

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:11.230
count makes two plus one that a k-pop

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.530
song sounds like it should be a k-pop

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:14.980
song

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:23.260
okay now we're down here curse die isn't

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:30.180
it lovely isn't it annoying isn't it

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:33.010
special despite being the crappy thing

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:34.900
but is it that it always shows up with

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:37.050
personal blind or is it that you only

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:39.610
pick it up now with curses or blind

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:40.360
either way easily run thanks for

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:41.470
