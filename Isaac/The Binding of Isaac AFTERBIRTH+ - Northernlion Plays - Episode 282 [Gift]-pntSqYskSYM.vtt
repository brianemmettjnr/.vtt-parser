00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.680
hey everybody welcome back to on the

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.980
line please binding of issac afterbirth

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.380
Plus last run we is a new era let me

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.639
just say that we had strife and

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.400
persevered this run I am going to drop

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.410
ringworm right off the bat brmm cqy -

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.109
and I mean I know what you're saying

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.680
you're looking at this and you're going

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:28.320
my dog you got mega and you got black

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.349
candle right off the bat that's a great

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.130
start and you know what you certainly

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:39.090
certainly are not wrong I will say oh

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.770
that's not great our rate of fire is

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.030
also good don't forget about that our

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.739
damage is pretty actually bad but of

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.840
course everything else in this run like

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.329
so much more than balances it out so

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.129
this should be another good one and dude

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.379
this is exactly what I needed

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.940
I mean we let's not act like this is a

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.410
one run so many things going on we're on

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.559
like the 8th the roof or something like

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.430
that you know we could die on the hog

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:10.170
fight it would it would be very sad but

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.520
not impossible it'd be sad enough if we

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.619
just got to hit one more time on the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.240
Honda fight but Wow okay we'll be

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.009
careful what you wish for but this is

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.840
exactly what I needed is a couple of

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.490
runs that we're up to no good started

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.259
making trouble in the neighborhood but a

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.560
couple of runs that put me in this

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.890
situation where now I feel like I can be

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.790
decent at Isak again once this one's

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.159
done our buy one get one free easiest

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.850
runs of all time coupon is officially

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.009
expired I think but take what I can get

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.720
for now thank you for not taking me to a

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.229
narrow room I would have been mad

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.000
displeased Oh dark bum as well okay well

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.140
now don't do many it don't be do me any

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.210
favors here this is getting a little

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.590
ridiculous but we are going to go to our

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.329
shop as well because even though an

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.490
arcade might be nice would be good to

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:04.560
have spear at hearts as well survival

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.450
does matter at least until we get to the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.619
point where like and hopefully we will

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.590
reach this where it's basically

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.270
impossible to lose but you might be

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.120
saying Oh old NL would have taken

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.799
ringworm

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.590
to some extent you're right but old NL

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.810
also cared just a little bit too much

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.269
about what people thought you know it is

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.159
good to care about what people think I

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.790
think when I was a teenager I had to say

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:29.409
idea like when I get older my goal is to

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.569
not care about what anybody else thinks

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.790
it's like a diluted shortcut to self

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.500
confidence or something like that caring

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.470
about what other people think means

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.319
you're courteous oh there was a tinted

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.959
rock instead of the secret room here a

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.730
font a little sermon we don't need to

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.970
use that but that's still okay it means

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.230
that you're a courteous person you know

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.209
I'm not saying you should go outside and

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.200
be like oh this is are my pants okay I

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.879
don't know but I am saying you know it

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.019
means that you're you care about what

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.090
other people think you know you care

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.690
about how they live their lives that's a

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.099
good thing but I cared maybe a little

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.269
bit too much to the point where it has

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:13.510
becoming deleterious ringworm is just

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.609
not good it's in fact so bad I'm going

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.970
to take this pretty flies very nice

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:21.790
actually thanks for the spider it is

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.519
actually very deleterious it's not just

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.959
a fun easier effect it's actually kind

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:30.160
of terrible it makes it nearly

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:37.209
impossible to hit your shot speed it

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:39.250
gets cranked up by like a factor of 34

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.400
just be careful around these rocks you

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.400
know

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.010
more spirit hearts please is too many

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.790
orange fires to be honest new this is a

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.040
very aggressive very aggressive room

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.000
take your shot

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.340
shoot coward you're only gonna kill a

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.520
man no not the spiders going right to

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.680
the door that I was going to go to

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.080
apologies for the reaction but I was

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.090
also at the same time a little perturbed

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.400
by the situation as it presented itself

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:13.920
okay we got two bombs I would like to

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.960
get to three and a half or four spirit

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.580
hearts so and you know it's not

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.880
implausible to have that happen our luck

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:24.240
stat is above zero and also we have dark

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.830
bombs so thinking some combination of

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.090
those elements should lead us to be able

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.500
to having three and a half to four

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.930
spirit arts by the deal with the devil

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.290
which means we can take a deal with the

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.760
devil without dying and hopefully then

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.880
we could buy something from the shop of

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.880
necessary to supplement our HP but may

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:47.180
or may not be relevant ideal shop items

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.180
by the way anything that allows us to

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.190
really hope this isn't a dead end

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.740
good good good anything that allows us

00:04:53.190 --> 00:05:04.830
to charge up mega faster is pretty much

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:07.170
invaluable okay well the good news is we

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.880
can't take any of this anyway the bad

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.010
news is that did almost cost myself a

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.120
chance at it but you know I guess we're

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.720
going to be going for an angel room

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:19.500
unless unless things change here it was

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:23.340
really funny we could have if we'd gone

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.450
to the shop and maybe blown it up we

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.450
could have Bob

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.370
he could have ba ba ba ba ba ba you know

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.200
we could have bought a spirit heart and

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.910
maybe would have taken debts touch there

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.770
but you know what that might have been

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.180
terrible maybe taking deaths touch in

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.700
that situation would have killed us dead

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.670
like two rooms laters so I don't feel

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.560
too bad about it I think we made a

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.000
reasonably well-informed decision now we

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.020
got deals of the angel to look forward

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.250
to I wouldn't presume that that

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.250
guarantees us access to a good run

00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:05.190
seven cents gives us King baby don't

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:08.340
know that's relevant in the least don't

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:13.830
fart on me I don't give you permission

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:15.060
to fart on me hey that's it we got to

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.180
buy a bomb it's this simple

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.800
that's the only explanation told dead

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.920
onion is not sad onion but it's still

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.830
great okay here's what you do crack into

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:28.110
this go grab it

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.270
don't take it hermit card there's no

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:36.690
bomb for sale there is no God

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:40.470
okay um Hiro font great card but it's

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:43.500
not a bomb dude you telling me I have to

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:46.950
leave magic must really a send on this

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:50.460
run there's nothing like there's

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.990
actually nothing we can do you know I

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.810
guess I'll have to be content with just

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.370
black candle mega dark bomb and

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.440
cat-o'-nine-tails on the first two

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:02.010
floors it hard something not every run

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:04.170
can be a 15 out of 10 will have to deal

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.850
with our 13 out of 10 and just accept

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:11.790
that that's the way life is sometimes

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:15.330
it's unfair you know what it would

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:17.490
actually be awesome to get and we had

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.860
this on our last run our last non daily

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:22.850
run at least it would be awesome to get

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.850
jumper cables

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:30.560
because mega will kill enough enemies to

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:32.750
get at least like a fifth of its charges

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:37.630
back I don't know mega might have 12 so

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:40.400
a fifth of 12 is not you know an integer

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.810
making the whole metaphor compromise but

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:48.200
just imagine it's a floating-point

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:49.370
number we could have taken advantage of

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.870
that if we've gotten mega on our last

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.150
run or if we get jumper cables on this

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.620
run let's see what we can do there but

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.240
for now I'm kind of excited

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.730
angel rooms this could be a mega satan

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.550
attempt mega two mega satan what are the

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.540
odds what a country what will they think

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:12.740
of next

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:14.210
mega to mega satan ingenious please 0.57

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.430
luck you got to give me a bomb at some

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:19.790
point it sounds like I'm praying to a

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:25.840
lord called 0.57 luck lucky some sort of

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:31.160
frickin destiny Android protocol droid

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:38.810
let's go probably not a huge deal to get

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:41.030
linger beam here there's something kids

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:43.720
dad's gonna can't stress enough by the

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:46.700
way dead onion huge get I love decided

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:51.380
the low shot speeds sometimes hurts a

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:56.510
little bit but well done I think it's

00:08:51.380 --> 00:09:00.140
probably about a million times better we

00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:02.420
should do like one more room just so

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:04.100
that we don't cause ourselves to kill

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.780
the boss and then sit inside of the deal

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:11.870
with the devil or angel for the next 25

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:13.610
seconds benda item room not really a

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:15.080
good purpose to go to shop I say we just

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.960
head down to the next floor honestly you

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:19.670
got a spirit out for me no such luck on

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:21.890
and it's just bounce manly is anything

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:23.750
else too important for us on this floor

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:25.340
Cuba meat is nice but our damage itself

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.870
is good enough especially with the

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:30.950
cannon ion tails and then effectively

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:34.600
piercing shots so now we've got 75

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:34.600
percent chance of a deal

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:41.510
175 mega gives us a better deal chance

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:51.300
well it's not Cuba me and it's not dead

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:53.400
onion it could be black feather but I

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:56.670
thought black feather was just a damage

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:58.940
increase for every evil upgrade of which

00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:06.330
you I believe we have zero right now

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:11.960
linger beam I don't know man I'm often

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:16.620
out of no man's land a battery charge

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:22.050
it's a bummer but we're still holding it

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:24.210
together pretty nicely here feel like

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:26.490
the most common way we get mega these

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:29.190
days is to actually just spawn with it

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:30.930
it does show up occasional deal with the

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.730
devil but it seems to I mean it doesn't

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:34.980
show up every week or anything like that

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:39.090
but it seems disproportionately likely

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:40.590
to show up on an even started birth I

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:42.690
guess maybe you can random items from

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:46.050
any pool so it might actually be

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:47.880
literally more likely to show up on an

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:50.850
even start it might not just be variants

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:53.130
working out in our favor for the 4000

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:54.510
time every so we do have a bomb now I

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:56.070
don't know if I want to go back to the

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:58.080
curse room probably not the worst idea

00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:02.400
but four and a half HP is a good spot to

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:04.740
take a deal with the devil if we if we

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.120
actually get one and decide to be don't

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.440
worry about deals of the angel the deal

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:10.400
with the devil is actually worth taking

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:13.080
what I'm trying to say here so let's

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:16.710
start going mister mega which is just

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:19.350
mega confusing I know mr. mega mega

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:21.090
couldn't get two items that are much

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.710
more different than that different

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.450
category different level of charges

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:26.040
different value propositions probably

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.540
several battery charges there you're

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:31.620
going to give me a range upgrade for all

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:34.080
my troubles huh not horrible with dead

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.510
onion but certainly like not what we're

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:40.210
looking

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:43.240
or to a clubs

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:45.880
pop then the Sun and the High Priestess

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:48.750
I guess you know we're almost done with

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:50.800
this floor already if we want to be

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:55.990
there's no point in taking Judas's

00:11:50.800 --> 00:12:01.030
telling just yet and again we got like a

00:11:55.990 --> 00:12:03.730
decent item but 0.39 damn and damage and

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.320
a little bit of concussion action is not

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.940
going to it's not going to win the day

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.370
for us or anything like that so I'm

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:11.440
going to be a little ballsy here and

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:15.970
it's somewhat brazen but I want to

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:17.230
backtrack anyway come on no they won't

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.740
open okay well I've made a terrible

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:21.940
mistake

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:24.220
I want to backtrack anyway to go to the

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:26.830
shop I would put that in contention for

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:34.030
possibly like the worst use do mega of

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:35.890
all time just a series of trap rooms and

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:37.080
nonsense so I'm going to sacrifice us

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:41.170
peer at heart

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:45.280
come back here open this up I was like

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:46.870
extraordinarily not worth it probably

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.950
could have told you that in advance but

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:49.950
where's the fun in that

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:59.410
jumper cables it's greed it's not jumper

00:12:54.190 --> 00:13:02.890
cables sets us up in a great position

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:05.790
financially on the next run you know

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:08.140
it's like getting the big tax rebate

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:11.320
putting it into a savings fund or

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:13.320
something like that or an index fund

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:15.610
invested you know the tractive

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:20.020
performance of the S&amp;P 500 at an

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:22.360
expected value of 7% a year it's a

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:26.170
sensible idea now it might not feel as

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:28.990
good as rent in a high action car you

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:31.660
know like a Ford Focus RS for a couple

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:33.100
hours but probably more sensible

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:36.070
although I don't know the once in a

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:38.020
lifetime thrill is offered by a Ford

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.370
Focus RS and pre did I mention though

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:43.430
recently I have become sponsored by the

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:45.700
Ford Motor Sports Company not true

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:48.290
that's probably illegal which is why I'm

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:55.610
enclosing this in curly braces aka

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:57.620
satire brackets not a secret room all

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:58.550
right if you say so we're going to head

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.650
down to the next floor we're going to

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:02.840
use the Sun like right away we got a 100

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:04.190
percent chance of a deal in air quotes

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:12.650
we just don't know what kind of deal is

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:15.710
going to be easy money so if we get a

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:19.450
deal with the oh this is a little scary

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:21.740
actually we get a deal with the devil

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:23.720
what are we looking for well first off

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:25.550
enough HP to make it work I can't

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.870
believe I know I've lost HP but I can't

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:29.630
believe our HP is so low

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:33.050
considering we got dark bum and not

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:40.400
negative 18 luck how is it plausible we

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:44.300
have had so few red hearts drop we

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:46.100
haven't been able to make dark bum give

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:49.760
us like more than two spirit odds do the

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:51.080
outbreak is amazing but well the

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.460
Northern Line you're talking about the

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:56.210
item not the movie starring Dustin

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:57.500
Hoffman and okay fine I forgot outbreak

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:58.970
actually is still awesome though the

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.010
movie's not so much apparently that

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:02.900
movies I mean I've only seen it on

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:12.260
Korean television when I was sequestered

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:13.910
in my hotel judgment well better angel

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.680
chance yeah

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:20.960
and a spirit heart that was money well

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:23.470
spent you know what hooked me up go hard

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.470
on the shop

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.870
so I don't really know either movies but

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:29.209
then I looked it up on Rotten Tomatoes

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:32.000
afterwards and I was told by Rotten

00:15:29.209 --> 00:15:33.560
Tomatoes they said and outbreak it's not

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.950
the high point of any of the stars

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:40.220
careers so I took that as gospel and

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:45.680
I've been insulting the good work of

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:50.089
that filmmaking crew ever since I fan

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:54.279
peels like the pill voice announcer is

00:15:50.089 --> 00:15:58.250
like the sponge mock mean in vocal form

00:15:54.279 --> 00:15:59.959
the pill announcer is this but okay you

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:02.600
get where I'm going with that decide

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:05.180
whether or not it's funny and then laugh

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:13.580
or cringe accordingly and we'll move

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:18.170
along here okay this is the greatest

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:21.140
time for us for two runs in a row now I

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:22.790
find myself I mean they said it in the

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:25.810
song you all need somebody to lean on

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:32.089
but in this one it's you I'll need a

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:37.550
cube of meat son cube of meat when

00:16:32.089 --> 00:16:45.589
you're not strong it will kill dudes it

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:51.940
can carry around it might be so long -

00:16:45.589 --> 00:16:57.320
you don't need a cube of me to lean on

00:16:51.940 --> 00:17:02.630
you just count book revelations if you

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:05.959
can okay okay it's too it's too far dude

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:12.559
you know what this is bad form but I

00:17:05.959 --> 00:17:14.420
actually hates a brownie so we're going

00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:17.750
to take care of that we're gonna snag HP

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:21.500
I really did not want to fight brownie

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:24.410
so wasted charged dude maybe wasted days

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:27.040
and wasted nights but I would do it

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:30.380
again if I got the chance

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:32.289
megha does destroy boss rush so we put

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:35.620
ourselves in a pretty good spot

00:17:32.289 --> 00:17:38.039
got a look it's pretty bad

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:40.679
well we get a charge for every wave so

00:17:38.039 --> 00:17:45.070
which is actually like an overpayment

00:17:40.679 --> 00:17:51.519
because the average wave is a lot easier

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:54.190
than the average room you know there's

00:17:51.519 --> 00:17:56.710
no hazards to watch out for it's just

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:59.230
three or four enemies nothing wrong with

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:00.490
that I'll keep elke we're down on the

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:02.679
next floor we got to make it to boss

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:04.450
rush but if we make it the boss rush we

00:18:02.679 --> 00:18:07.149
can do boss rush even with our run

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:08.500
looking a little suspect here we can

00:18:07.149 --> 00:18:12.399
make it the boss rush we actually have

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:14.080
two HP I would love to have taken Rawdon

00:18:12.399 --> 00:18:15.610
baby we literally would have died unless

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.470
we took our HP before we went into the

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:19.090
deal with the devil which actually was

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:20.470
the more sensible approach now that I

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:22.330
think about it then we would have had

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:24.279
one HP novel we would have rotten baby

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:26.980
along with us that probably would have

00:18:24.279 --> 00:18:31.330
been better I'm a I'm a big enough

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:35.110
person to admit my mistakes that was a

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:38.620
great contagion a great outbreak way

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:41.789
better than a stupid 1995 film starring

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:44.950
Dustin Hoffman am i right

00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:47.649
more like dustin frig off man I don't

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:50.730
want to watch outbreak anymore when I

00:18:47.649 --> 00:18:59.529
watch another one of your middle EMU V's

00:18:50.730 --> 00:19:03.460
like last chance Harvey not a bad movie

00:18:59.529 --> 00:19:06.820
just not a you know particularly strong

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:09.519
effort consistent as touching I suppose

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:11.620
at best oh we all need somebody to lean

00:19:09.519 --> 00:19:13.240
on let's go Satanic Bible we don't need

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:15.820
it long term but we're happy to have it

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:17.950
for now and then in our double key room

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:19.870
which we can afford to go to for room

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:23.320
you know what this means

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:25.779
like I say like that full room you know

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:29.350
what this means it is the full realm

00:19:25.779 --> 00:19:32.250
song no it means we roll our books we

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:36.720
get bookworm and we get a battery charge

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:36.720
bomb that's not a battery charge

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:39.980
but it's all starting to come together

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.660
here

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:44.220
teleport cards we don't have to fight

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:47.400
posterize should we get a teleport card

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:49.860
so we know that this is a secret room we

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:55.260
know that that's worth it worth it work

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:58.200
we blow this guy up to take his money so

00:19:55.260 --> 00:20:01.650
we are got an easy like frictionless

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:03.690
shop purchasing power death card Hermit

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:08.340
card hermit card is a teleport out of

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:10.590
the boss rush this is it Luchini pouring

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:12.870
from the sky let's get rich what the

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:13.350
cheeky vines the sugar dimes can't quit

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:16.470
what

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:21.770
so pop the cork and steam the Vegas and

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:23.850
let's get lit what's and then he

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:26.900
honestly couldn't piece together like

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:29.400
the next 100 words he says introducing

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:32.429
phantom of the door walk through my

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:36.200
heaven with something and something and

00:20:32.429 --> 00:20:41.070
something showboatin with Ruger's

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:43.410
Bellefonte bigger asking for what it's

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:48.890
worth as we confiscate your figures and

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:51.570
then Sonny Chiba goes in and he says

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:55.500
Casanova Brown levitating cheeky and

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:57.390
dashikis ala hot a car 54 chasing

00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:00.600
diamond runners and then I'm just lost

00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:03.030
at that point it's just you know biggie

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:07.290
Azalea raps in my head like they got the

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:08.550
skills I do not have the skills oh we've

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:09.840
already seen a dice room so I don't

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:13.429
really want to go into the other double

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.429
key room they tend to not be worth it

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:20.090
that's I'm going to source that that's

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:23.370
Lucini by camp low from the 1997 album

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:29.640
uptown Saturday night a Forgotten near

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:31.950
classic with soul samples long before

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:35.780
Kanye West's late registration took them

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:35.780
to number one on the Billboard Hot 200

00:21:41.539 --> 00:21:50.249
please No Deal

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:53.070
Polaroid we pick something up we get

00:21:50.249 --> 00:21:54.690
boss rush decide for yourself everybody

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:57.620
sorry we get Megas what I mean to say

00:21:54.690 --> 00:22:01.279
decide for yourself we doing this

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:01.279
crickets head great get

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:19.150
we should use mega so we can get the

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:21.070
extra charge right away it's going very

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:22.470
well right now by the way we're just

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:29.700
worried about fighting enemies that

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:31.600
unfortunately have long death animations

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:37.420
luckily it hasn't been that much of a

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:39.610
problem so far that took a little longer

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:41.560
than I'd like but this ended up a you

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:45.150
know in my opinion being very much worth

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.150
the cost of doing business here

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:50.470
we got crickets head for free analog

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:52.600
stick by the way I didn't even mention

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:54.520
it but case you're unaware its tears

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:56.950
upgrade even if you don't want to take

00:22:54.520 --> 00:23:00.150
advantage of the 360 aiming so this is

00:22:56.950 --> 00:23:02.620
actually like an excellent use of our

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:04.960
boss restroom here we also got an HP

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:07.350
upgrade for effectively doing no work

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.970
and we've still got a full charge I

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:11.970
don't even want to teleport anymore even

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:21.250
though we haven't been to our shop yet I

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:23.680
don't see the need to teleport we'll use

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:29.490
it down here instead and try to choose

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:29.490
our way into a early mom fight

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:35.970
the more big rooms like the merrier dude

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:46.900
that's fine in fact it's actually very

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:48.610
very good this is when we started out of

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:50.080
control strong on this run you got to

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:51.700
admit there was a lull in the middle

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:56.460
where it seemed like a win was gonna

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:56.460
happen still but like it's not amazing

00:23:56.730 --> 00:24:03.340
now we are looking really really nice on

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:05.680
this run amazingly we've done this

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:07.180
without getting a single deal like we've

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.330
gotten the deals we just haven't taken

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:12.370
any I would love to see an angel deal

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:13.810
now I still think negative mega Satan is

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:18.160
the funniest thing in the world let's

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:19.960
see they have the same word in them but

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.400
the game seems to feel differently and

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.980
it exclusively wants to give me deals of

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:25.300
the devil will still have deal with the

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:28.030
angel chance because we're only taking

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:30.250
Guppies caller crackerjacks has shown up

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:34.060
and given me a speed upgrade actually

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:38.020
good even merciful if I'm being honest

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:39.520
and got to be honest like I know I said

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:42.730
honest about 12 times in the last two

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:44.830
seconds but at 24 minutes in our last

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:48.640
run we had just picked up mom's Knight

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:51.400
to the best of my knowledge so this is a

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:54.700
much better performance just from the

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:59.110
seed perspective like eight point seven

00:24:54.700 --> 00:25:02.480
damage plus piercing shots plus mega

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:07.100
it's pretty nice

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:11.080
we live in lavish here hidden them slide

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:11.080
for the cenotes as they said in Luchini

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:19.610
at this point we're just trying to do as

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:22.250
many rooms as possible that we have a

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:25.340
few you know less rooms to do to get our

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:26.810
mega charge back dark bomb is finally

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:29.450
coming through because it's getting the

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:30.890
red hearts that help it function you

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:33.710
know we got a whole nice little

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:35.900
operation going here and I'm not talking

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:47.900
about water around the knee a whole

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:50.060
bucket see all you've done it we should

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:52.100
be picking up money but I really don't

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:54.130
think I'm gonna fight hush you might

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:58.040
think this is a lame reason for it but

00:25:54.130 --> 00:26:01.040
I'm not convinced that our range is

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:03.080
suitable for a hush fight because of

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:05.180
dead onion and poor shot speed you got

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:07.480
to be pretty close to enemies to kill

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:09.680
them and being pretty close to hush is a

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:12.080
recipe for taking more hits than I'd

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.830
like and mega doesn't crap on in the way

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.020
you'd expect

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:20.690
not sure if it's super Armour or what

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:23.360
but now void I think is a different

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:27.920
story like fighting delirium on void I

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:30.500
think mega works pretty well at that if

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:34.940
we get the opportunity after the chest

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:36.800
we'll go for it I do kind of want to

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:39.320
take this down to the down to the

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.390
cathedral and the chest first though to

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:43.640
see how it works so no deals with the

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:48.050
angel my apologies but I think it's

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:50.510
utterly apparent I did try red chest

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:52.040
means we open them golden chest means we

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:54.230
might open them stone chefs means we

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.740
open them regular chest means we don't

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:57.200
care

00:26:54.740 --> 00:27:00.760
and if we don't care then you don't care

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:03.050
one two three times two to the six

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:04.730
something something quick with the limp

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:06.020
biscuit mix I can't remember it's been

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:07.400
for a verse it's probably like four

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:09.440
years since I listened to roll in by

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:11.900
limb biscuit and even then it was only

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:13.550
for meme purposes which I think it's

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.880
like smoking in movies your brain

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:17.820
doesn't count it as

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:22.260
as poison because it's for them dudes

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:32.820
for the purposes of art please die

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:34.620
faster we'll go back for the battery

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:36.060
charge this is looking like it's pretty

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:40.620
much got to be the right way to get to

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:42.060
the oh and a curse room here that is

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:43.320
bordered by a secret room but it's

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:46.620
looking like this is the right way to

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:53.160
the boss probably so pretty close to

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:54.750
being able to it's fine pretty close to

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:56.700
being able to go down to the chest and

00:27:54.750 --> 00:28:00.150
see how our life looks once we make it

00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:02.130
down there plus we're pretty close to a

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:04.830
mega charge see I probably should have

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:06.540
been hit there alone oh please tell me

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:08.340
that somebody else got poisoned through

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:15.720
like whatever astral plane you guys used

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:19.800
to teleport around not so bad a dead end

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:22.380
at this stage of a an area I don't buy

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:25.860
it what I do buy is that cancer trinket

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:27.300
0.88 speed is like god-awful but being

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:30.330
able to have a much better rate of fire

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:31.980
here seems like a suitable positive you

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:34.440
just sometimes you got to pay damage to

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:38.180
the spike gods in order to say thank you

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:38.180
for giving me the good rng here

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:45.610
money well-spent

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:49.990
now you actually oh I thought you could

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:51.460
go straight down and use the mega charge

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:56.799
a little bit of it apparently not we

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:58.840
should be in a bulletproof situation and

00:28:56.799 --> 00:29:01.870
it got better although I wouldn't

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:03.880
necessarily say much much better um I

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:09.510
mean you know we do give the Emperor

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:13.500
card black hole I'm not going to use but

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:15.640
several pills I can see forever X lakhs

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:19.720
we're going to keep using mega because

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:21.309
it's amazing but we could use the

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:23.860
emperor card so as far as I'm concerned

00:29:21.309 --> 00:29:25.330
we just won that Emperor card is a win

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:27.100
I'm choosing not to collect on and the

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:29.289
Mulligan by the way amazing pickup and

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:31.120
certainly cements in my opinion at least

00:29:29.289 --> 00:29:33.330
that we made the right decision here by

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:38.559
choosing to go with the cancer trinket

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:40.929
just keep walking backwards because you

00:29:38.559 --> 00:29:43.409
know firing more shots means getting

00:29:40.929 --> 00:29:43.409
more flies

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:55.450
on average but also like unassailably

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:55.450
mathematically intergalactic planetary

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.440
0.57 luck it's a very strange number to

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:05.180
be at the end the run to pick up zero

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:07.640
lucky pennies over the course of a whole

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:10.370
run is almost more impressive than

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:12.110
having like not than having like 20 luck

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:21.980
but it's more impressive than having

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:23.570
like three luck luckily I'd say every

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:25.280
other stat except for maybe our speed

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:25.490
and range have made up for it in a big

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.710
way

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:28.940
like there's and it's why I'm struggling

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:31.220
a little bit from a commentary

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:33.320
perspective I have nothing to complain

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:37.910
about and that's really like that's my

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:40.040
bread and butter I think we could find

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:41.990
ourselves very very very slightly under

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:43.940
the gun if we don't have a mega charge

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:46.220
and then we end up fighting like a

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:48.440
double gate room and then a double

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.910
adversary room and my brain breaks and

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.530
I'm like you know me sweet just use your

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:54.400
Cuba meat against all these guys despite

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:57.770
not having permanent polar invincibility

00:30:54.400 --> 00:31:03.410
like this is a wonderful room for

00:30:57.770 --> 00:31:06.110
contagion or outbreak but a nasty room

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:07.400
to not have mega admittedly we certainly

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:11.780
made up for not being able to get rotten

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:15.980
baby though all right this will not

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:20.240
charge us on the bright side we're going

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:24.130
to have a charge for the boss don't need

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:27.510
your HP just

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:31.780
around him here I'm going to try to kill

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:33.610
ultra lust last I don't really need nine

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:35.860
lives in hindsight I was kind of hoping

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:39.220
there'd be a wrath on you so I not a

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:42.340
wrath an Envy on here and I could use

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:47.460
that Envy to pick up shoopdawhoop or

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:55.690
something but not a huge deal either way

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:58.230
boss fight a boss fight boss fight we

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:58.230
should be good

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:06.670
void or no void we'll play it as we see

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:08.860
it should are known of course it's going

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:10.600
to be a void floor there is a battery

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:12.390
charge back here that's pretty important

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:14.190
crack into these these are free items

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:17.350
stigmata

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:19.660
I'm not against leech either we need

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:21.160
basically save as much HP as possible

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:23.200
for the Delirium fight I think if you've

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:27.070
got full HP you're not going to lose the

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:28.780
Delirium fight and this is a big moment

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:30.730
for us because I've lost on delirium

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:32.800
like three or four times in a row now so

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:36.480
to come through on a good run and finish

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:36.480
the job here would feel really nice I

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:40.630
got to test something because I don't

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:42.310
know how many other people are willingly

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:46.570
coming down to the Delirium floor but

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:48.430
not just pills again I was hoping that

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:51.930
it wouldn't give us pills and instead it

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:55.660
would give us an item as you know a

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:58.030
reward for coming down here but it's

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:59.530
okay it's not that I'm sad about it or

00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:02.590
anything it's not like I am going to

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:04.360
change the chances of us wanting to run

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:07.710
or anything like that don't be silly

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.710
it's not like I like you or anything

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:21.490
I saw that coming a mile away and tried

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:23.800
to like dodge around it I don't know man

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:27.400
hear me out here I don't think we should

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:30.310
use mega like amber I think we should

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:32.260
hold mega in case we come across our

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:34.440
delirium fight right away we could use

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:36.880
the Emperor to teleport out of that but

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:38.740
mega doesn't seem that useful for

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:41.200
room-clearing right now just because I

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:43.360
mean it's obviously literally useful for

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:46.030
room-clearing but it doesn't seem that

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:48.280
great because it doesn't charge itself

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:50.410
up and I'm not going way away I can't

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:52.510
use mega all the time I think we really

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:54.400
really would like mega to be available

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:56.530
for our boss fights so let me just hold

00:33:54.400 --> 00:34:00.100
the charge and rely on your still very

00:33:56.530 --> 00:34:02.020
good DPS here in the interim period and

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:03.550
pick up as many you know hearts and

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:06.430
spirit ARS as you can see we can

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:08.200
obviously full HP is ideal if we can't

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:11.830
make it in there with full HP it's not

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:16.050
necessarily the end of the world but

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:16.050
like don't give up damage for no reason

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:21.880
mom's box of trinkets was given a safety

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:29.770
cap it does also make the cancer trinket

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:34.390
twice as good so the next step is a

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:36.460
nalgas ruin and we just got it we got

00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:37.960
two actually but like we need the

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:39.340
algae's ruin way more than we need the

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:41.110
emperor card and due to all of our

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:44.350
bosses are like clustered over there

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:51.450
which is actually sweet for one I think

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:53.440
it means that I can use mega and

00:34:51.450 --> 00:34:56.970
probably will be able to generate a

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:59.250
charge magic mush no it's fine

00:34:56.970 --> 00:35:08.550
and on a room like that that could have

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:14.730
been a difference-maker she try to chart

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:16.490
a course with no backtracking but oh

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:19.290
well

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:24.030
the algae's ruin should give us a pretty

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:28.380
easy lead on a win here especially if we

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:29.910
have a full- time we do have Guppies

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:31.710
collar but we need one more guppy item

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:34.260
to make that work but if it works it's

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:44.579
beautiful it's just a little scary right

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:48.480
now it's one of the rare like very very

00:35:44.579 --> 00:35:52.579
rare situations in which an improperly

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:52.579
played nine lives could actually kill us

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:58.050
this should have no chance to be

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:59.670
delirium this is a very nice layout I

00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:01.260
only see two bosses that have a high

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:05.520
chance to be delirium left could be

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:09.510
delirium and then top right could be

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:12.680
delirium this is not delirium just a

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:12.680
little baby Isaac

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:20.990
which almost makes you want to pop my

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:23.120
first algae's and then go back for the

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:31.280
other one if necessary at a slightly

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:32.690
later date I think we'll just play it as

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.550
is right now we're doing fine

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:41.870
it's a good exercise in patience to

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:43.640
begin with I don't necessarily feel the

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:46.610
need to do every boss before delirium

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:48.320
might be nice to just get to full HP and

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:54.740
then do every boss or sorry an endo

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:56.840
delirium but we'll see all right an

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:58.760
extra spirit heart I actually feel like

00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:01.060
probably the right play with algae's is

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:03.620
you wait till you get a hip down lengua

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:05.950
don't speak to me ever again you wait

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:08.450
until you get a hit down to one HP

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:10.160
little dicey admittedly it's late to you

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:13.580
know somewhere in that range and then

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:18.110
you pop algae's and you hope that the

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:23.060
leech generates a little bit of HP for

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:25.070
you to get back to full and that way you

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:26.300
didn't waste any opportunity cost you

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:28.010
actually use the algae's we're going to

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:31.940
regenerate a little bit of HP along with

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:33.980
you a theme is totally fine probably

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:39.160
unlikely to generate too many demon

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:39.160
hearts for us but certainly not useless

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:46.460
so I'm not going to be dodging too much

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:50.800
here we can get out of the way of

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:54.200
enemies but getting out of the way of

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:56.690
shops is a little finicky here we

00:37:54.200 --> 00:38:00.320
basically killed like half of deliriums

00:37:56.690 --> 00:38:02.390
HP and we summoned like a buttload of

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:06.710
flies and Eve in the mean time here so

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:08.660
just be smart because the nalgas rune is

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:11.800
probably not enough to mathematically

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:11.800
save you right now but

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:19.360
you know the same reasons I had for not

00:38:17.350 --> 00:38:25.270
going to the hush fight completely apply

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:26.230
right now our range is so bad it's hard

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:31.540
for us to hit him without putting

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:32.860
ourselves a great risk so I'm actually

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:41.170
going to break my own rule and pop

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:43.000
algae's right away just so if it goes

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:45.940
wrong we're not coming off of algae's

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.540
panicking about having you know one hit

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:48.540
away from death

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:55.260
I'm calling slight bullshit he

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:57.660
regenerated HP when he changed into a

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:59.130
different form of an enemy we're going

00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:01.760
to win though delirium is going to die

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:04.710
and you know what a great run for

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:06.450
confidence purposes I'm feeling a lot

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:09.090
better about my eyes play maybe

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:11.130
absolutely started with mega but we did

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:13.590
have to forsake magic mushroom this run

00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:14.850
don't forget about that catch me outside

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:15.870
don't forget about that for now though

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:17.070
