00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.480
hey everybody welcome ignorant land

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.370
please binding mascara plus we probably

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.300
did not deserve to win the last run but

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.090
we did so screw you that's right I'm

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.740
Angie now i'm angie northernlion Hunger

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.089
Games no thanks I'm still full stole

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.509
that joke from Eric Andre I don't even

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.230
care

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.210
MDP lis 3q is we doing Samson greed mode

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.740
run today with what I would describe as

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.810
a pretty okay first room pickup magics

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.240
cab raise our luck stat I don't know if

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.210
luck affects things as much in greed

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.340
mode as it does in other modes mostly

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.170
because you don't tend to get consumable

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.700
drops from oh dude you don't tend to get

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.440
consumable drops when you finish waves

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.180
but maybe that's just because we've

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.510
never had a luck stat that's high in IV

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.969
ever considered that quad shot is like

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.160
actually bad sort of but I like it

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.199
that's that's my defense at least and

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.030
the other thing with Samson is like as

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.640
long as we can keep our HP relatively

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.989
high we got great incentives to like go

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.040
into these rooms sure it didn't really

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.920
work out for us there but that's okay

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.350
and we got five damage times four shots

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.820
right now actually pretty good obviously

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.820
the problem is that the rate of fire is

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:24.150
like kind of trash isn't it like your

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.189
tier rate is affected the same by triple

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.110
shot and quad shot but quad shot gives

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.659
you the extra tier so it's it's more

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.450
potent in that regard or my perhaps

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.250
mistaken I don't remember but I

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.680
certainly remember loving triple shot

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.180
and then people smarter than myself said

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.729
NL why do you love triple shot here's

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.759
like a statistical quantitative analysis

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.490
of why triple shot is worse than just

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.630
not having it most of the time and I

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.450
said you know what that makes a lot of

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.100
sense I consider myself a man of logic

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.300
I'll acquiesce

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.300
[Music]

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.439
but I believe the quad shot might still

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:06.060
have some a certain junus a qua but it's

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.060
not really as unis a quad it's more like

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.170
I'm trying to think of how to say I have

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:16.330
four shots in French mmm

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.430
just sweet quiche Lorraine I can say

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.769
that I'm french-canadian or at least you

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.420
know my DNA is french-canadian am i

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.930
french-canadian no probably not I

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.330
suppose I have to have this conversation

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.769
with people all the time not all the

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.610
time but you know at least a few times a

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:37.030
year not to say that this happens you

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.830
know to Canadians all that often but you

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.319
know people will be like so like it was

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.459
your family French and I'm like nah okay

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.610
what about like you know are your

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.350
grandparents friendship eggmad

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.209
great-grandparents not great-great

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.600
grandparents I don't know ever before in

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:55.299
like 1830 okay you're getting too far

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.890
back to be reasonable now I don't know

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.650
where my great-great grandparents are

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.829
from because I'm not an Austrian like

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.400
Baron or something like that you know I

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:08.320
don't have a knowledge of my family tree

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.590
going back to you know oh well he was

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.750
the governor of the fort Frontenac and

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.750
so I just I I don't know where the name

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:20.980
came from evidently at some point I had

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.859
a French ancestor he convinced a

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.769
Canadian or someone that's settled in

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.150
Canada at least to create children with

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.859
them and we've been we've been rocking

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.569
that Anglophone with the francophone

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:34.890
last name ever since okay

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:37.750
I'm not gonna change it what's the point

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.310
you change it yeah exactly

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.500
I don't know where I'm going with this

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:46.569
either way yeah all right so we don't

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.720
want to use this but it is a guppy item

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.790
one way or the other

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.769
yeah I'm like almost tempted to get more

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.299
HP here's what I think we no no no this

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:59.410
is stupid we should not buy a key I

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:03.340
think 7 cents for essentially a reroll

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:06.880
is okay 7 cents for a damaged upgrade is

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.760
ok 7 cents for a damaged upgrade is ok 7

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.260
cents to get closer to spun is okay and

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.599
now we're leaving and this worked out

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.019
very well except our speed stat is kind

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:20.109
of bad now but our damage has gone up as

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.510
a result of Jesus juice and synthol and

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.340
then we're one away from spun our rate

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.000
of fires gone up as well our speed is

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.620
pretty bad

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.970
I'll just like level with you on that

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:33.610
one speed is not in a good spot and why

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.630
pay seven cents for the HP upgrade

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.210
because the kick started that whole

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.880
thing to begin with that's why pretty

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.010
much what it comes down to I'm gonna go

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.870
in here mostly because I don't really

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.160
care about preserving our demon hearts

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.050
right now it's too early for them to

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.000
have any chance of making it to the end

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.039
of the game so first thing we're gonna

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:58.060
buy as a Kiki's 3 cents it's really good

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:59.889
for us but we'll probably wait until we

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.840
finish a couple of waves here

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.889
oh there's much reason to take extra

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.050
damage you know if we can't kill enemies

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.479
on the second floor with 5.8 6 damage we

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.430
got bigger problems so we're in a very

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.320
weird situation early on on this Samson

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.380
run but a good situation like our stats

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.120
are wonderful I would say I really

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.680
thought we could thread the needle there

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.539
you'd like to one makes you smaller

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.720
pills and then you know we're living in

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:24.720
there

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:32.410
we don't have deal with the devil

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:34.060
precedent which I think could be

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.099
interesting we can kind of get the best

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.680
of both worlds here we have a bead on

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:41.260
guppy we got a bead on spun and our

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.470
stats are good to begin with so there's

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.030
very little to complain about I'm

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.010
actually just gonna mainline this

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.190
because I mean we don't lose anything

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:53.500
for leaving but I feel like we just sort

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.050
of might as well knock out the whole

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.220
to-do list so I'm not distracted so

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.139
we'll just kill all the enemies he will

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.150
get another spirit heart here the spirit

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:03.190
hearts are a trick right now there's no

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.849
need to worry too much about trying to

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:10.120
preserve them in my opinion at least I'm

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:11.650
Way was kind of a trickier enemy here

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.419
I'm way more interested by the way our

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.940
range and shot speed are actually like

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:19.210
10 out of 10 right now I just stood

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.800
there and took that one it's actually

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.300
really really good because it allows me

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.030
to stand on the other side of this big

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:31.250
room

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:32.750
just knock enemies out all right book of

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.259
Belial on greed mode there's a lot to

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.819
like I'm not gonna take the bird because

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:40.430
I think it's better for me to have HP

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:42.560
now honestly I'm looking at this I don't

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.419
like any of these items enough we could

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.240
maybe buy a bomb in fact I think I

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:49.099
probably will dude contagion kinda

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.650
stinks because I think it only works on

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:53.120
the first wave that pops when we press

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.479
the button in fact it might not work on

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.250
any of them but I like it as an item

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:59.870
which is why I went dude and then I

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:03.349
evaluated it a little bit more and went

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:05.419
um which is kind of the same experience

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:10.789
as like reading the menu with TGI

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:13.610
Fridays dude so that ended up being like

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:15.050
extremely good but I think we'll stick

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.400
with book of Belial I actually think the

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.500
damage from book of Belial could be

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.699
better

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.620
plus it's weird I take Guppies head all

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:23.629
the time so let's mix it up every time I

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:27.770
go to TGI Fridays I could really go for

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:29.449
a Jose Cuervo tequila burger right now

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:32.719
and then I'd you know see the picture

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:35.509
and I got oh right NL Donuts old TGI

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:37.669
Fridays it's a national institution

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:40.159
nobody's saying that I'm strong Manning

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:42.409
you look okay so what do we got here car

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:46.069
battery I don't think does anything

00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:47.690
unfortunately and we don't need another

00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:50.120
speed upgrade so the first thing we're

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:53.930
gonna do is try to get value for money

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:56.839
here and it worked

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:58.310
uh you're looking for like a three cent

00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:59.779
key if you can get one we can't and

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:02.000
that's okay so I'm gonna pay five cents

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:04.580
for a random item and it was really

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.270
really worth it that's a huge damage

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.550
increase

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:10.279
let's go peep this room I'll take the

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:12.979
pills I ain't ever scared health up

00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:18.319
range down bombs okey absolutely worth

00:08:12.979 --> 00:08:20.419
it range was already fine I don't mean

00:08:18.319 --> 00:08:22.789
you could make a pretty good case for a

00:08:20.419 --> 00:08:25.550
couple of these Cuba meets good I think

00:08:22.789 --> 00:08:29.629
also x-ray vision is pretty good but I'm

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:30.709
probably just going to not take them

00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:32.360
because I think we can afford to be a

00:08:30.709 --> 00:08:35.380
little bit more selective as far as I'm

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:37.240
concerned we already have the win

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.830
we're not quite there yet and and more

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.960
importantly we could easily mess it up

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:42.550
like we could royally Jack this one up

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.010
yeah there's no value from a double

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:46.600
press so I think not taking car battery

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:48.850
was the right call unless there's some

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.950
kind of unique interaction like you know

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:52.570
it's twice as powerful despite the fact

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:56.110
that if you'd normally use it twice it

00:08:52.570 --> 00:09:00.600
doesn't do anything extra for you always

00:08:56.110 --> 00:09:04.600
possible but probably also unlikely

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:08.710
so we'll just finish this off easy way I

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:10.420
don't think we need I don't think we

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:12.040
need to go like out of our way to buy

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:14.920
things that aren't necessarily very

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.210
valuable sometimes you do sometimes you

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.740
need to take the Hail Marys and then

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:19.420
like the last greed mode run we had I

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:22.090
forget which character we were Lazarus

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:24.220
maybe things were tight that was and not

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:25.570
in like a you know the way HC Justin

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:29.290
says it you know he goes oh it's tight

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:30.820
no that's not the way I felt about that

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.800
last run I was like this is a tight fit

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:37.620
it was like the way you describe a

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.620
parking spot is tight ie bad

00:09:40.509 --> 00:09:48.800
excuse me oh I'd really thought that was

00:09:45.709 --> 00:09:50.509
gonna work um we were we were taking

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.190
Gamble's on that one this one I don't

00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:54.680
think we need to go that far so the more

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:57.529
money we can save you know a penny saved

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.329
is a penny closer to not having to play

00:09:57.529 --> 00:10:04.910
the base level of greed mode anymore we

00:09:59.329 --> 00:10:08.920
can move on to greedy or eventually yeah

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:08.920
a really smart way to take damage there

00:10:09.459 --> 00:10:20.949
watch out nice really illustrates how

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:23.509
strong cage is or how panky is that art

00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:26.029
19.5 to damage took that long to kill

00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:27.500
him I was gonna suggest that honestly it

00:10:26.029 --> 00:10:30.199
would be not the worst thing to get

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.769
Krampus here but I do think the pact is

00:10:30.199 --> 00:10:32.990
worth it

00:10:30.769 --> 00:10:37.399
I don't think our speeds necessarily

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:40.939
high enough to make to make black powder

00:10:37.399 --> 00:10:41.600
a good choice but oh we got spun we got

00:10:40.939 --> 00:10:46.279
speed

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:48.709
we got perks we got addicted and we out

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:50.389
of here 47 cents now we might want to

00:10:48.709 --> 00:10:50.930
talk about like picking up some HP or

00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:52.970
something

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:55.670
well there's literally just HP right

00:10:52.970 --> 00:11:00.949
there you know what I think we just head

00:10:55.670 --> 00:11:02.930
down to the next floor ah I'll give you

00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:05.259
a three cents I'll give you enough sense

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:08.860
to reroll let's be honest that was a

00:11:05.259 --> 00:11:11.449
that was a gamble I'll take blood clot I

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:16.100
don't think we need anything else on top

00:11:11.449 --> 00:11:18.560
of that I just wanted like you're I get

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:23.389
to John Nash II you know Russell Crowe a

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:25.250
beautiful mind I I find myself running

00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:26.689
the numbers oh that's so good though I

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.740
find myself running the numbers of my

00:11:26.689 --> 00:11:28.939
head I'm like well technically if we

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:32.089
just go down to the next floor that's

00:11:28.939 --> 00:11:35.209
like basically a free reroll and it is

00:11:32.089 --> 00:11:37.870
it is a free reroll you got a go for

00:11:35.209 --> 00:11:37.870
that obviously

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:43.200
but that doesn't mean that it's not

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:44.670
worth using like potentially two cents

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.190
to get another reroll okay we probably

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.670
don't want to use suicide king is my

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:50.100
guess

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:56.100
chaos card is the perfect thing to save

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:56.720
for the greed fight no question full

00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:00.330
health

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:05.460
next Lex I mean our damage is already

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:07.640
disgustingly good the virus could be

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:11.220
amazing actually

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:13.380
we shouldn't be in too scary of a spot

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.940
here I really just want to bomb but

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.730
let's let's buy a key they're only three

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.960
cents so that's pretty lucky for us and

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:20.130
we'll place that in here and this is

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.730
what I mean by I couldn't mess this one

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:28.530
up dead tooth is just okay I'm not gonna

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:32.190
go into the into the curse room because

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:35.190
it's quite scary right now but we also

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:38.190
have like a nearly unprecedented amount

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:40.410
of damage output especially like lump of

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:44.250
coal means that our minimum damage right

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:46.380
now is nineteen point two eight I have

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:48.660
no idea what our maximum damage is but

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:50.580
tell you one thing most enemies are not

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:53.280
surviving one hit of this plus our rate

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:55.230
of fire is incredible so we're not gonna

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.460
have this on every floor cuz not every

00:12:55.230 --> 00:13:03.090
floor is gonna have a diamond judgment

00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:06.440
but it's actually one of the strongest

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:06.440
quad shot runs I've ever seen

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:14.220
now what I would love to see are some

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:15.900
red hearts and I don't know where we get

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.490
those without having to purchase them we

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:20.730
might just have to bite the bullet but

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:23.160
the chaos card means if we go down to

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:24.210
the the greed fight the super green

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.000
fight whatever you want to call them

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:29.370
probably his name if we go down there

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.420
with one HP we should win as long as we

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:38.210
don't miss with the with the chaos shot

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:42.870
which is sadly not unprecedented but

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:50.070
probably unlikely please don't be

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:51.630
jumping right now honestly getting hit

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:58.530
once on that fight is no big deal

00:13:51.630 --> 00:14:01.470
I prefer to stick with book of Belial

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:03.150
you already have a lump of coal which is

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:05.000
why I assume that we were pretty much

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:14.760
saddled there um

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:16.050
screw it health up perks shit

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.300
shouldn't it take any because if it was

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:20.610
bad trip we might uh we might have had

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:23.190
some problems but you know what I also

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:27.540
like to live dangerously not a very good

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:29.250
Austin Powers impression I think that's

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.540
worth it we want anything else here I

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:34.560
don't think so I think we want to save

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:37.440
our money suicide King is bad and maybe

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:42.810
mom's pearl but I'm kind of in that he

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:44.310
should buy another three cent key while

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:47.520
it's on sale I wish wouldn't get some

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:50.790
bombs but we do want to save some money

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.930
to donate so i think it's it's okay for

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.460
us to not break the bank even though

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:55.770
some of those items are good like early

00:14:53.460 --> 00:15:00.960
with it before your donation machine is

00:14:55.770 --> 00:15:03.390
maxed didn't raise our rate of fire at

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:06.860
the cap before your before your donation

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:10.110
machine is at the maximum it's probably

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:11.610
better to not always just operate under

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:15.000
the principle of I'm gonna buy whatever

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:17.480
item is good it's my opinion at least so

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.819
we might begin saving right now I mean I

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:22.589
think it's very strong too

00:15:20.819 --> 00:15:25.259
start of floor at eleven point zero

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:30.269
seven damage especially because we also

00:15:25.259 --> 00:15:33.449
have like wow it's like really really

00:15:30.269 --> 00:15:35.069
good especially because we also have no

00:15:33.449 --> 00:15:40.319
boss fight as long as we can actually

00:15:35.069 --> 00:15:41.850
land our greed shot oh my lord it's one

00:15:40.319 --> 00:15:43.499
of those things were like I was rewarded

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:51.749
for taking damage and I'm kind of mad

00:15:43.499 --> 00:15:54.149
about it thanks to the virus thought we

00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:55.319
could maybe beat you before you beat me

00:15:54.149 --> 00:15:56.970
it looks like this one's gonna be

00:15:55.319 --> 00:15:59.839
relatively easy and you know what kind

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:02.179
of needed that after a couple of 5050

00:15:59.839 --> 00:16:05.279
runs that have come up I mean literally

00:16:02.179 --> 00:16:09.299
the the last run that we did not in

00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:12.149
greed mode but overall was 50/50 we

00:16:09.299 --> 00:16:14.669
flipped the coin twice got lucky on both

00:16:12.149 --> 00:16:16.289
of them and and managed to survive a

00:16:14.669 --> 00:16:18.929
situation that we probably should not

00:16:16.289 --> 00:16:21.569
have thanks to Guppies collars so I'm

00:16:18.929 --> 00:16:24.209
extremely thankful for that of course

00:16:21.569 --> 00:16:25.589
but also simultaneously cognizant of the

00:16:24.209 --> 00:16:35.429
fact that it's probably not gonna happen

00:16:25.589 --> 00:16:36.539
forever what what's going on here okay

00:16:35.429 --> 00:16:37.919
what do we want on our deal with the

00:16:36.539 --> 00:16:39.179
devil just give me copy we win

00:16:37.919 --> 00:16:42.779
I mean we're probably gonna win anyway

00:16:39.179 --> 00:16:44.699
but no sadly nothing of value there in

00:16:42.779 --> 00:16:47.609
my opinion we could just continue to buy

00:16:44.699 --> 00:16:49.169
some stuff like we could buy red hearts

00:16:47.609 --> 00:16:50.939
but they're gonna be three cents no

00:16:49.169 --> 00:16:52.879
matter what so I think we we don't lose

00:16:50.939 --> 00:16:56.009
anything by waiting for the next floor

00:16:52.879 --> 00:16:58.169
can we patch in some way that greed mode

00:16:56.009 --> 00:17:00.600
makes it plausible to get bombs cuz I'm

00:16:58.169 --> 00:17:02.579
feeling the burn right now we have a

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.079
demon judgement we know we have 3 HP

00:17:02.579 --> 00:17:07.589
there's bombs okay

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:10.069
this will take us to two and a half take

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:10.069
us to two

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:19.850
still on to moms coin purse can't see

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.020
cuz Austin just signed into play battle

00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:23.660
grants it's a health downgrade that's

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.500
pretty bad it's a range upgrade that's

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:27.190
fine

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:29.390
we made that like inverse trade earlier

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:31.310
it's like three and a half I think we

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:40.130
just buy it so we got it all okay

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:46.700
and then we sure I'm not worried

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:50.450
three cents doesn't matter what I mean

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:52.370
by that is you know if we donate ninety

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:54.230
six we're not gonna be like too bad we

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:56.750
couldn't donate ninety nine because it's

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:58.640
just irrelevant you know ever hear that

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:59.870
expression you pay for you take care of

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.550
the pennies the pounds take care of

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.510
themselves

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:03.620
you've been watching this channel for a

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.810
long time you know that's one of my

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:08.270
least favorite expressions the idea is

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:09.830
if you if you pay attention to the

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:11.990
details the big picture will sort itself

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:14.210
out but the the metaphor just doesn't

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:15.290
make any sense why would you take care

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:17.540
of the pennies when you could just take

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:19.520
care of the pounds which are a superset

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:21.110
of pennies if you're taking care of the

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:24.920
pounds you're taking care of the the

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:26.540
pennies by definition well that's just a

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:32.960
metaphor yeah but the metaphor doesn't

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:34.100
make sense so the lesson is lost well if

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.390
you don't buy a cup of coffee in

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:38.960
Starbucks once a week it'll be a

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:40.850
millionaire I don't think so it's good

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:44.600
to be frugal I want to want to get that

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:46.640
out there it's good to be frugal it's

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:49.120
good to be low maintenance to it to a

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.120
point at least

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:55.029
sometimes I get in these arguments I

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:57.820
worry about the community I've created

00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:59.799
sometimes cuz they have like I go into

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:03.190
other chance that I'm tangentially

00:18:59.799 --> 00:19:04.659
associated with and they have NLS s

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:10.200
style arguments and I'm like is this

00:19:04.659 --> 00:19:13.360
what like would have become my sweetest

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:14.590
friends you know I people are like

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.179
what's the average price for a hotdog

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:17.830
and I go ah you know I think like two

00:19:16.179 --> 00:19:20.140
dollars people go you're crazy

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:23.649
a buck twenty-five I would never pay

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:25.779
more than 129 for a hotdog and I go is

00:19:23.649 --> 00:19:27.880
this what I've is this my legacy on

00:19:25.779 --> 00:19:31.090
planet Earth is these kind of arguments

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:32.980
but so I think you know being frugal up

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:34.270
to a point makes sense but taking care

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:36.190
of the pennies and the pounds take care

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:40.510
of themselves as a it's nonsensical it

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:44.919
just doesn't make any sense either way

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:47.380
we're about to win this run dude hello

00:19:44.919 --> 00:19:49.299
it's monstro it's gonna be a little bit

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:51.159
on the shorter side as far as episodes

00:19:49.299 --> 00:19:54.010
go today it's kind of in that awkward

00:19:51.159 --> 00:19:59.200
in-between period but I think that's

00:19:54.010 --> 00:20:02.020
okay I might also miss and then that put

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.429
a damper on things I did not miss so

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:05.230
many I apologize for being a bit of a

00:20:03.429 --> 00:20:07.539
shorter episode but I also didn't invent

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:09.850
greed mode so you know keep your sorries

00:20:07.539 --> 00:20:11.289
in a sack hopefully we can donate a

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:13.330
bunch here we did unlock lusty blood

00:20:11.289 --> 00:20:14.919
actually a great item we've had a bit of

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:17.710
a streak lately of unlocking items that

00:20:14.919 --> 00:20:20.470
you know oh good we got mysterious paper

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:22.419
right who cares this is a little bit

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:24.130
more on the positive side it's a lot

00:20:22.419 --> 00:20:26.200
more on the positive side lusty blood is

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:28.809
potentially like a game changing item

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.470
we're also getting real close to 999 in

00:20:28.809 --> 00:20:31.480
green mode

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:35.320
I think a green mode you do want to get

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:37.210
the donation machine to explode but

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.100
we've had a really good track record of

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:40.870
donating a lot of money we haven't had

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:43.390
many green mode runs where was like 20

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:44.980
cents donated and of course to be honest

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:46.090
with you the big reason why we were able

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:48.549
to donate so much money is because we

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:52.240
got chaos card so we knew that there was

00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:53.740
like no risk of us as long as we can

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:57.100
make it here we were gonna win is what I

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:58.690
mean to suggest but anyway look

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.100
two dollars is a reasonable reasonable

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.450
price for a hotdog that's all I'm trying

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:04.450
to say for now thanks for watching her

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:05.380
