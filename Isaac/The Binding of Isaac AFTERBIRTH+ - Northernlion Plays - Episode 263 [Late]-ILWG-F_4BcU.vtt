00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.090
hey everybody welcome back to run lane

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.130
plays the binding that northern lien

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.259
plays the binding of issac afterbirth

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.150
plus we lost last round but we lost on

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.240
delirium it's kind of like a weird thing

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.950
for me to bring up because we should

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.509
have won against delirium but we never

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.170
should have gone to the void in the

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.050
first place

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:24.390
the m16 h77 see so it's kind of just

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.760
like an all-over sloppy play but I made

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.230
it in a weird way like in real life this

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.429
would make it sound way worse but

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.199
because we're playing a video game it

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.750
makes it sound better I did it out of

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.200
pride like we had already beaten the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.360
rest

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.329
here's let me throw something out there

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.850
a compromise and it's only for

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.960
ego-driven fools like myself however I

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.320
am what I am and that's all I am what if

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.030
your streak incremented when you beat

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.489
blue baby or the lamb and then if you

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.079
got a void portal you could go and try

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.239
to beat it as a bonus but it didn't

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.070
compromise your streak I'll take mini

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.800
monstro mini monster it's pretty good

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.409
that means if you choose not to go

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.090
you're not the bad guy now I know that

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.380
in the most recent afterbirth plus

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:14.520
booster pack it actually allows you to

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.930
have achievements active while you are

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.900
playing the game at least after you've

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.119
beaten mom's heart so I know like some

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.420
people have said like it's going to make

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:27.479
achievements a little less important I

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.950
guess my response to that is how do you

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.450
make something less important than zero

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.950
important but I digress

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.390
important to some people not important

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.860
others maybe that's the kind of thing

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.350
that could be introduced in that in a

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.630
mod I have no idea of course that adds

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.009
in all sorts of I don't know like it's

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.640
going to say ethics concerns we don't

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.020
really mean it like that you know

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.820
security concerns where you're like I

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.560
don't know maybe NL just modded a streak

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.320
in to be ninety or something after you

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.630
lost your honor I have no idea what this

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.939
entails in the long run but you know I

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.259
had hope at this point if you watch

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.890
1,500 freakin episodes of me play in

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.390
this game you would trust me not to fake

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.159
a win or something like that just to

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.290
increment the freaking street but anyway

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.640
the distance I feel like that's an

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:14.140
elegant solution you know to

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.340
to make it so you automatically will not

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.159
automatically make it so when you beat

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.480
blue baby you get the streak increment

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.920
and then it's like a bonus round to see

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.989
if you can be delirium then I would

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.180
always be like unless I've run this

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.250
garbage and I'm about to dive regardless

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.680
let's go buy delirium if the run has

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.299
like literally any chance or I mean even

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.519
if it doesn't but you at least have HP

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:36.310
to survive a couple of rooms might be

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.049
worth taking a crack at it anyway last

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.700
run this is not excusing some relatively

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.590
sloppy play on the delirium fight

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.510
specifically but doing some late-night

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.790
Isaac right now I normally record you

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.129
know late morning early afternoon food I

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.019
will be happy with pentagram doing a

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.150
little bit of a later run it's not late

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.060
a nice 1020 you might hear my voice a

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.470
little bit on the quieter side honestly

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.970
I'm trying to be quieter in videos to

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.819
begin with first off because people tell

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.420
me I'm clipping and that's that's bad

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:08.069
but also whiskey is tired man after a

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:11.200
for a long day of basically shouting

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.609
voice gets tired and I'm feeling it more

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.620
than usual lately I'm not sure if I'm

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:18.280
starting to come down with you know some

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.739
kind of spring allergies or something

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.329
like that but finish the day and look

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.150
Mamet throws like a little bit soaring

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:28.599
that get a better vocal hygiene regimen

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.980
you know I need to have like some tea

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.840
with ginger and honey or something like

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.250
that it's like the only and I don't mean

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.769
this to be offensive but it's the only

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.329
home remedy I believe in a whole

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.879
heartedly whenever people are like oh

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.410
yeah man I get sick I've just fart on a

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:43.049
garlic clove and then eat it I'm like

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:48.250
that's ridiculous

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:50.049
look I love the d6 I love to d4 too but

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.540
I like really love to be sick so let's

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:55.690
stick with this but when people are like

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.970
oh I just put like you know ginger tea

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.730
honey and lemon in a cup with like some

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.109
black pepper drink it clears you right

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.010
up I'm like you know what I believe you

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.349
100%

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.190
maybe that's fair maybe it's not but

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:11.260
it's the way I've chosen to live my life

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.060
um we should check for a battery charge

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.370
because charge because magic fingers is

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.130
effectively completely worthless here

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.380
five cents is good if only for the

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.440
ability to buy a spirit heart from the

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.550
shop which might be advisable and we got

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.050
a lot of HP there

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.370
of course it also does give us the

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:33.759
ability to get an arcade but not for a

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.979
couple of floors so we do have a silver

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:37.389
chest a holy chest an angelic chest I

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.759
don't know what you want to call it I

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:43.090
just know the satyr makes it takes a

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:47.009
man's life nick nolte Tropic Thunder

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:49.509
real Renaissance for that movie now that

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:53.379
it's on Netflix great film

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:55.930
I saw a trailer for it when I was in

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:57.610
college I don't remember what movie was

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.099
in front of and to a certain extent I

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.360
feel great personal shame for that we

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.800
don't need to buy a spear in our anymore

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.270
I remember looking at the trailer be

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.469
like this movie looks like trash then it

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.659
came out and I was like all the reviews

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:09.639
are really good and then I watched it

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:11.949
like opening weekend and I was like this

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.509
is one of the best movies of the last 10

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.250
yea I wrote it in my best movies of the

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:17.110
last 10 years list that's a joke I don't

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:21.639
have one of those maybe I did I sure as

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:25.240
heck wouldn't show you I stepped on the

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:26.979
spikes I'm not proud of it but it's

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.319
better to embrace the situation as it

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.940
exists and try to fight against it we

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:32.560
got three bombs out of it there really

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:37.419
we're just looking for I mean if we got

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.949
a battery charge that'd be sick but I'm

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:40.870
gonna go back for a battery charge as

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:43.300
soon as I said it I was like that's the

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.069
right call I wish it weren't but it is

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.279
the right call so we'll go back there is

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:51.219
a battery charge you know what I'm going

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:52.840
to go a little bit more aggressive we've

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:54.550
been very nice to our donation machine

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.289
lately and now it's time to pay the

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:01.599
piper so we want to get to 20 cents I

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:03.029
would say that is likely now we only

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:07.150
need two more cents

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:09.580
so a 20 cents 22 now we have more

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.259
options and then we get the reroll now

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.610
the weird thing about this is that we

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:15.279
don't want to use the reroll right away

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.659
we might end up having having a deal

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:18.219
with the devil that's more valuable for

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:19.900
us to rerolls we can reroll three items

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:22.900
that are all take about then that's a

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.699
better option for us than just ensuring

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.249
that we rolled the item room most of the

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:31.499
time I think it

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:33.449
we really like it so far if nothing else

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:35.759
this run can definitely highlight the

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:38.839
power of mini monster or little monster

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:41.699
which is just crushing it right now we

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:46.229
probably just want to take both of these

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:48.299
i mean empty vessels great it would be

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:50.459
nice to lose enough HP to fly but

00:06:48.299 --> 00:06:51.899
guppies hairball is an enabler PJ's is

00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:54.149
great with these because it gives us

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:57.089
extra spirit arts on top and we can use

00:06:54.149 --> 00:06:58.499
those spirit arts to sustain us while

00:06:57.089 --> 00:06:59.939
we're in the empty vessel state smart

00:06:58.499 --> 00:07:02.369
fly is actually pretty good as well and

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:03.869
we'll move along here sadly without too

00:07:02.369 --> 00:07:05.639
much of a damage bonus except for a

00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:06.989
pentagram but you know mini monster is

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:09.029
helping out a lot as well we got a good

00:07:06.989 --> 00:07:12.149
deal with the devil chance because of

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:14.399
precedent and the the pentagram here and

00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:16.139
we got a couple of transformations on

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:18.479
the on the backburner I would say if we

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:19.619
can get another one item for each of

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:20.729
those or either of those then we'll

00:07:19.619 --> 00:07:23.099
start to think about those a real

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:26.399
possibility but for now we're really

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:29.879
just rolling with what we got and

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:31.919
feeling relatively good about it I don't

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:33.629
do a run you know handle the

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:35.699
fundamentals and that's why I another

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:39.059
reason at least I didn't want to take

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:42.839
the d4 d4 is great in fact as I've said

00:07:39.059 --> 00:07:46.589
many times it's probably almost too good

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:48.929
I don't know what you do about that

00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:50.550
because I mean that was a bad addicted

00:07:48.929 --> 00:07:55.110
pill but I don't want it to change

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:57.629
because it being good in an extremely

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:59.189
long term offsets the incredible

00:07:57.629 --> 00:08:01.110
short-term pain of getting a terrible

00:07:59.189 --> 00:08:02.519
roll so like I don't think you can just

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.509
be like hey make it a 12 room charge

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:05.610
because then if you re roll into

00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:07.229
something garbage it sucks and it takes

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.699
away the reward for people like myself

00:08:07.229 --> 00:08:12.229
who are like yeah you know well weather

00:08:08.699 --> 00:08:16.979
the storm of some crappy d4 rerolls

00:08:12.229 --> 00:08:18.869
to get to something amazing but what I'm

00:08:16.979 --> 00:08:22.979
just trying to get at here that I did

00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:24.509
not get rid of the d4 because I wanted

00:08:22.979 --> 00:08:26.789
to win I got rid of it because I wanted

00:08:24.509 --> 00:08:30.360
to play a game you know I'm always like

00:08:26.789 --> 00:08:31.439
you in the movie metaphor I've never

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.709
seen it but I'm familiar with the

00:08:31.439 --> 00:08:39.000
concept of the film you me and Dupree

00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:40.529
Matt Dillon aka the scumbag private

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.130
investigator from the Something About

00:08:40.529 --> 00:08:43.710
Mary you

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:49.170
also in the outsiders as well as singles

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:55.380
I believe you know the seminal reroll oh

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:56.970
that's the moneymaker the seminal you

00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:00.420
know movie about the Seattle grunge

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:02.220
scene who made that I know who made that

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:06.360
movie who made that movie give me a say

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:07.950
that Cameron Crowe singles not singles

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:13.290
in my area I was going to get me put on

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:17.610
a list isn't it 1992 film by Cameron

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:19.980
Crowe he's done it anyway let's get back

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:21.510
to business here now that I've turned on

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.600
cheatengine to give me good items um

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:29.690
wait did I say that out loud uh what was

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:31.950
I gonna say here Oh Matt Dillon yeah

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:33.750
Matt Dillon he's like a straight-laced

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:35.310
dude you know he's like I'm gonna go to

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.830
work honey and she's like wow what a

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:39.570
scrub you know but he's got a friend

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:41.280
his name's Dupree he's played by Owen

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:45.360
Wilson Dupree is like a piece of human

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:47.250
garbage you like you know lives on Matt

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.050
Dillon's couch and I don't know he has

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:50.460
like a smelly dog or something and he

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:52.050
sleeps with ladies on their couch even

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.610
though they got kids around it's kind of

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:55.080
like I mean I'm not saying that he

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.890
should be like king shame for but you

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.660
know it's kind of an uncomfortable

00:09:55.890 --> 00:10:01.800
atmosphere of raise a child whom you

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:05.250
gotta you know somehow in

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:06.570
counter-intuitive lothario here said and

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.700
perhaps a bad example for your kids

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.110
having unprotected intercourse and then

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.610
on furniture you might still be making

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.980
payments on depending on the structure

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:15.540
of anyway when it comes to Isaac in real

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.430
life I'm a Matt Dillon but in Isaac

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:20.670
sometimes I can be a Dupree I think

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:24.270
that's pretty obvious but I got to be

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.530
Matt Dillon on this run that seemed like

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:27.840
a smart idea to me although we are

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:28.830
getting further and further from you I

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.840
know that most of the time on the

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:33.150
internet that phrase ends with God's

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.350
light every day we get further and

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:37.680
further from God's light usually

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:39.810
accompanying a picture of like I don't

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:43.410
know somebody jerking off in public or

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:46.850
something like that but we're losing our

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:48.650
ability to get to come

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.620
empty vessel which is why I'm going to

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:52.610
take ghost baby because I'm kind of like

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:56.530
we might as well

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:59.180
we're basically we're killing it on HP

00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:00.380
you guys ever seen runaway jury maybe

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.870
they could be my next film metaphor

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:06.950
that's a good movie man runaway jury

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:09.530
Dustin Hoffman gene Hackman to people

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:12.790
with man at the end of their last name

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:15.580
at the top of their game doing a

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:17.900
serviceable job bringing a John Grisham

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:19.820
page-turner to the screen don't forget

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.980
who's the female lead in that movie

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:24.740
racial vice you know it to be true you

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:26.030
might have said Catherine zeta-jones you

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.640
would have been incorrect she was in

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:30.800
intolerable cruelty sounds a little

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.270
similar both have to deal with legal

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.830
stuff came out in the same year

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:37.580
one of them's the Coen brothers joint

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:40.240
though runaway jury is a good film

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:42.680
I don't know how Mema bêlit is you know

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.750
some movies long after release have

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:48.620
become memes in the Internet era there

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:50.720
is a part where Gene Hackman goes you're

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:52.400
losing me my jury and I'm like clearly

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.990
that's me me bull but I don't know you

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:57.800
can't force them you got to let a mean

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:59.480
season and develop by itself you're just

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:05.540
going straight into the fire my man oh

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:07.040
no baby what is you doing anyway if you

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:10.250
haven't seen runaway jury like don't

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:12.830
rush out and see you it is 14 years old

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:15.950
I mean I haven't seen it in a long time

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:18.590
but it's good but it's more of like a at

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:20.780
this point catch it on cable you know I

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:22.400
would recommend it though if you find

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.870
that if you find yourself not doing

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.910
anything else and you've decided to give

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:27.260
up for the rest of the day I don't mean

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:28.460
that as a bad thing right after this

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.020
video I'm going to give up what am I

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:32.090
going to do I don't fold some laundry

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:34.960
play some Mario Kart for a few hours as

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:42.050
is my my god-given right

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:43.280
I've worked today that's about it anyway

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:45.560
I wish I had more to add to that but

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:48.140
there isn't that enough in today's

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:51.560
society I went downstairs and got the

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:53.540
pizza when the pizza came that's that's

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:56.000
enough for one day's work mom I

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:59.330
shouldn't have to mow the lawn I got the

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.590
pizza when the pizza came well son I pay

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.390
the property tax

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:06.290
yeah but I put the toilet seat down

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:09.050
after I urinated well I have the deed

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:12.560
cool is my bedroom those squatter's

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:14.180
rights so we just had whiz I don't think

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.560
it's the right call to take it I don't

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.700
really want to take tourists but I also

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.410
don't want to be the guy who turns down

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.000
invincibility but I rewrote both of them

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:21.560
nonetheless so straight-up daddy

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.740
longlegs I think is better and they're

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:27.110
both fun but mysterious liquid is more

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:29.030
fun in my opinion they're both good

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:30.320
though I want to get that across here

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:33.740
I'm not saying mysterious liquid is

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:35.000
better than daddy longlegs I think

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:37.910
there's some situations in which it is

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:41.960
this might not be one of them to stay is

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:46.180
like neutral as possible but you know

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.180
it's because the daddy daddy's long leg

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.030
daddy

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:52.520
yes that's correct daddy's long leg not

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:54.380
daddy longlegs anyway that's the real

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:59.050
thing you know the union's out

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:59.050
everywhere they got spies everywhere

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:06.610
looking out for slanderous daddy

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:09.920
longlegs verbiage their words not mine

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:11.270
so we've got no we do have 14 cents okay

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:13.820
so let's re-roll dibs because this is

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:16.640
garbage and then we're just going to buy

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.940
this and get out of here run is good by

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.250
the way

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:20.630
like actually completely good especially

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:22.610
against enemies that are on the ground I

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:25.100
would like to get a rate of fire

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:31.910
increase but it's not compulsory for us

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:33.110
to win another battery charge there but

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:35.660
it still might be worth it because we

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:37.280
probably do want to reroll little Chad

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:39.860
unless we get a deal with the devil and

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:43.580
the deal with the devil gives us dark

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:44.900
balm or we somehow lose like to spirit

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.580
arts over the remainder this fight we

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:49.100
might get a little spooked but HP is

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:50.510
pretty good right now we probably want

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.550
to reroll that but first you check this

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.960
demon baby is okay but I'll go for the

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:56.690
one reroll and I think that that was

00:14:53.960 --> 00:15:00.530
worth it and then I will rear ol little

00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:01.790
Chad ah we got it here's upgrade so

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:03.950
basically it could not have worked out

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.750
better for us than that that was smart

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:07.310
play and it worked out well for us now

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:09.350
we got non-stop deals with the devil and

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:11.600
the deals of the devil are not by the

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:13.360
way maybe I'll play the appearance

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:17.379
changer at some point

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:19.629
I'm Hank Hill man I only care about the

00:15:17.379 --> 00:15:21.399
propane of the propane accessories in my

00:15:19.629 --> 00:15:25.689
family I don't care about you know Hot

00:15:21.399 --> 00:15:27.360
Topic Sephora makeup table over here I'm

00:15:25.689 --> 00:15:32.769
a I'm a Wrangler man

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:37.149
we're Levi's 501s and whatever they sell

00:15:32.769 --> 00:15:39.519
in the pudgy boys category of Target

00:15:37.149 --> 00:15:46.689
those are my clothes it's my uniform

00:15:39.519 --> 00:15:48.730
when I go to work and that's what

00:15:46.689 --> 00:15:50.470
they'll bury me in hopefully in like a

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:54.220
million years when the earth gets hit by

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:57.720
an asteroid we'll see uh two stone

00:15:54.220 --> 00:16:00.100
chests you gotta look sorry

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:02.170
that's pretty great both of those are

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:04.569
like completely acceptable head of the

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:06.879
keeper plus making sacks out of some of

00:16:04.569 --> 00:16:08.739
the pennies you heard the song making

00:16:06.879 --> 00:16:10.600
love out of nothing at all by air supply

00:16:08.739 --> 00:16:12.879
this isn't that we're making sacks out

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.350
of pennies it's like the supply chain in

00:16:12.879 --> 00:16:17.410
the process of development is very

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:18.610
simple to be honest with you even a

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:20.110
child could figure it out I don't know

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:22.239
why hey you're having so much trouble

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:24.579
with it honestly it's kind of offending

00:16:22.239 --> 00:16:26.259
me we're going to keep this moon card in

00:16:24.579 --> 00:16:29.189
case that's not abundantly clear the

00:16:26.259 --> 00:16:31.629
moon card this is the utmost importance

00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:38.319
because we would like to use our moon

00:16:31.629 --> 00:16:42.129
card to get out of boss rush assuming we

00:16:38.319 --> 00:16:45.790
can actually use it properly I'm

00:16:42.129 --> 00:16:48.189
probably some people out there I I know

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:50.919
I don't make these videos for you I just

00:16:48.189 --> 00:16:52.629
wanna I want to sell my whole audience

00:16:50.919 --> 00:16:54.939
out but no I mean I do make these videos

00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:56.110
for you but also for me and you know for

00:16:54.939 --> 00:16:58.389
the Government of Canada so I can

00:16:56.110 --> 00:17:02.230
continue to pay my way to exist in this

00:16:58.389 --> 00:17:05.100
country but I also make them as if I'm

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:07.870
talking to younger version of myself

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:09.159
because I've I understand what I'm going

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:11.190
to colloquially call like summer

00:17:09.159 --> 00:17:14.220
vacation mindset

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:15.990
and that's you know I don't know about

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:18.330
you guys I wouldn't say it was

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:20.130
particularly spoiled it wasn't like I

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:22.530
was on my super sweet 16 but when I was

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:25.830
growing up like I didn't get a summer

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:27.540
job until I was like 17 I did work a

00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:29.730
little bit through college university

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:32.280
but it wasn't like I can't frame it like

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:34.290
I struggled through college and

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.760
university so for those of you who do

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:38.360
that I have the utmost respect but it'd

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:41.750
be disingenuous for me to say that I did

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:44.580
okay we need another battery charge

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:47.340
where's this going well it was the whole

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:51.330
point of this is that when I was in like

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:52.740
high school I wake up at like 10 a.m. my

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:54.420
mom would already be at work and

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:56.700
sometimes she'd call around lunchtime

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:59.040
right and she'd be like hey can you like

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.330
put the can you take the chicken from

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.710
the freezer and put it out on the

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:04.080
counter well you know what let's go

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:05.940
three dollar bill man we need the

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:09.090
offense and we even by need I mean we

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:12.120
sort of want the offense moon I precise

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:14.370
yeah we want to be on the moon I mean I

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:16.920
guess your mom it's 11 a.m. this seems

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:18.300
pretty reasonable and then you know you

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.770
hang up the phone and you're like oh I'm

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:22.050
gonna go make a sandwich oh let's play

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:28.020
some you know the NBA 2k four or

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:30.330
something like that we care we don't

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:32.070
care let's save our money for now just

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:33.150
grab this and then you forget and she

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.740
comes home at the end of the day and

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.840
very nicely she's like what the heck man

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:39.240
you had one thing to do I was at work

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.650
for like seven and a half hours and an

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.780
hour lunch break I had to eat it with

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:44.730
people and may not even like that much

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.500
you're complaining about how you've got

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:47.610
one job you got to take meat out of the

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.990
counter you were probably standing in

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:52.260
the kitchen we had a phone call this is

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:54.270
the pre cellular telephone era least you

00:18:52.260 --> 00:19:00.180
know in my household the pre cellular

00:18:54.270 --> 00:19:02.700
telephone era but what I'm the tangent

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:05.640
to pull back for this is that range plus

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:07.590
luck we could use the luck these are

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.000
both abilities to fly I'm a little

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:11.580
offended we're going to reroll both of

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.020
them and it was a tough call actually to

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.670
choose two reroll both of them because

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.840
if we had taken one a reroll the other

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:19.590
we could have put ourselves an empty

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:20.760
vessel state it genuinely is a tough

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:22.860
call I'm just going to take the lock

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.440
upgrade um but I think there's something

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.030
about like chore

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.890
momentum I think about this a lot

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:29.960
actually and I don't even mean it

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:32.180
sarcastically for once I actually think

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.520
about it from time to time I think if

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.810
you want someone to do something first

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.640
off don't just tell people to do things

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:40.790
that's pretty rude but what I mean here

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:42.350
is if you have like a subordinate which

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:45.830
is an offensive way of saying you know

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:47.480
an employee basically or if you want to

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:49.730
structure your own life more

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:53.120
productively the worst thing you can do

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:54.860
is give yourself one job for a whole day

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.510
by the way I'm not excusing myself I

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:59.150
should have been less lazy put the

00:19:56.510 --> 00:20:01.310
chicken out on the kitchen counter more

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:03.170
quickly like this very simple job I

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:05.480
would I would kill for that job now I

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:06.650
mean I have free room and board all I do

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.000
is put the chicken on the counter so

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:11.350
someone else could cook it for me what a

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.350
lovely existence thanks mom

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:18.740
you bitch obviously joking I yesterday

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:22.940
was Mother's Day I called my mom said I

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:24.740
love you mom you bitch no this is this

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:28.850
is borderline uncomfortable for me

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:30.560
anyway hmm the worst thing you can do is

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:32.960
give yourself like one thing to do

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.430
friends for a day my theory and I don't

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.530
know if it's backed up by anything set

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:38.630
my own anecdotal experience but is that

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:40.370
any way you know there is actually I

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:42.110
forget the principle there's like a

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:44.030
pseudo scientific principle that's like

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:46.280
the amount of time it takes to do

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:48.680
something expands to the amount of time

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:50.960
available which is like the commonly

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:54.170
used analogy is like if your teacher

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:56.240
gives you an assignment that takes if

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:59.420
the amount of actual work on it is going

00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:00.920
to be like two hours and then he or she

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.800
gives you a deadline that's like a week

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:05.840
in advance you'll have it done in a week

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:07.460
if she makes it two weeks in advance or

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:09.740
two weeks later I should say you'll have

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:12.200
it done in two weeks you know the idea

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:14.600
being that people procrastinate and then

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:16.970
the procrastination is fundamentally I'm

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:19.790
going to pick this up just to use it at

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:21.230
Gees why though luck upgrades are we

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:24.370
even going to make bombers at this point

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:24.370
a little tight

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:31.050
go for broke let's go people

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:32.580
procrastinate I understand that I've

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:35.370
done it myself many times in my life

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:37.320
including recently why do we have 17

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:38.460
damage now why do we have 17 damage on

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:41.430
that room that was sweet

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:42.750
can we go back to that we've irked up a

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:46.830
friends till the end pill that's not

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:50.160
that bad okay let's give this a try

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:52.650
anyway what I was going to say is uh you

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.840
gotta like get some momentum like if I

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:56.970
have to do if I have one really really

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:59.100
important thing to do on a day and

00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:00.600
nothing else first off it's a pretty

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:02.010
good day but it can be stressful you

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.420
know I'm one of those people who making

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:06.030
a single phone call is like more

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:08.670
stressful than 10 hours of work but we

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:10.230
definitely want this we don't need the

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:12.270
spear in our it's going don't make me

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:13.740
laugh I got empty vessel now and we'll

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:17.670
take the soul along with it because it's

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:21.920
a beautiful item then we'll bounce

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:21.920
okay I'm dude this is like really good

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:26.300
mr. mega is fine by the way but I might

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.590
reroll it

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:30.960
we don't want transcendence don't be

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:32.850
silly anyway I'm getting sidetracked

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.380
here and again this is preachy and I

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:35.880
accept that and you're welcome to

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.350
completely ignore my advice that's a

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:41.970
very sensible approach as well but what

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:45.750
I'm going to say that's also not that

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:49.860
good let's take it and maybe we can

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:52.620
donate some at least we must have

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:54.240
swallowed a trinket that's giving us

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:58.050
these bonuses that I've since forgotten

00:22:54.240 --> 00:23:00.840
anyway what I usually do is I stack a

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:02.820
front load my day and I'm I'm actually

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.710
if I can do my own word I'm a very

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:07.140
productive person as far as youtubers go

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:08.490
where I think I don't know people always

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.780
blow smoke up our ass they're always

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:11.940
like you talk to people in the business

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.960
and they're like use youtubers and

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.680
twitch streamers are the hardest-working

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.170
people I know

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:19.650
and I'm like a lot of us do work hard

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:21.540
but a lot of us don't do crap yeah a lot

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:23.760
of us are working like eight-hour weeks

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:26.370
man so like I can't tell if you're being

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:28.710
honest or disingenuous but you know in

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:30.480
terms of like output at least I I'm a

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:32.640
busy guy and I pride myself on being

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:35.520
busy sometimes to the point of being

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:37.710
deleterious but just just the way I'm

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:41.940
wired for whatever reason but I have a

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:44.309
energy as well I front-load my day so

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:47.460
that the easiest tasks are at the front

00:23:44.309 --> 00:23:50.399
and what this means might seem

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:52.520
counterintuitive but if I was my mom I

00:23:50.399 --> 00:23:55.590
would never

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.669
at least now in my life I would never

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:58.350
say that she was wrong with her

00:23:56.669 --> 00:24:00.600
parenting strategy of course but I would

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:02.850
never make a phone call it's like can

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:06.750
you take the chicken out of the freezer

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:11.490
and put it on the counter there in a

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:13.190
reroll everything here you know it's the

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:16.620
incredibly low percentage gamble work

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:20.700
instead I'd be like hey can you mow the

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:22.950
lawn and also take the the chicken out

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:24.840
of the freezer and put it on the counter

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:27.200
because you know as soon as you hang up

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:29.940
that phone whoever you're talking to is

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.409
taking the chicken out of the freezer

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.840
and putting it on the kitchen counter

00:24:31.409 --> 00:24:38.309
because that's the easiest job they can

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:39.659
have their to-do list just by doing one

00:24:38.309 --> 00:24:41.429
thing that takes ten seconds all of a

00:24:39.659 --> 00:24:43.500
sudden you're like I've accomplished 50%

00:24:41.429 --> 00:24:45.299
of my goals and then maybe they do where

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:47.549
they don't do the you know mow the lawn

00:24:45.299 --> 00:24:50.460
or whatever but you know you've done one

00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:52.529
task if you got one thing like you and

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:54.990
I've lived this life you know in college

00:24:52.529 --> 00:24:57.559
in particularly okay is Sunday all I got

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:59.610
to do today is do the laundry

00:24:57.559 --> 00:25:02.279
probably applies to some of you out

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:04.289
there right now doing a lot of people

00:25:02.279 --> 00:25:05.970
active like doing the laundry it's a

00:25:04.289 --> 00:25:07.919
major chore by the way if you don't do

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:09.299
your own laundry or you've never done it

00:25:07.919 --> 00:25:11.100
I'm going to reveal something to you

00:25:09.299 --> 00:25:13.679
doing your laundry is is the easiest

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:17.070
chore in the world you throw your

00:25:13.679 --> 00:25:19.140
clothes in the washer then when the

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:21.299
washer beeps you throw your clothes in

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:24.149
the dryer and then when your dryer beeps

00:25:21.299 --> 00:25:26.190
you fold the clothes it takes the

00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:27.779
folding of the clothes is the only part

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:30.960
that takes like any length of time

00:25:27.779 --> 00:25:32.850
longer than 30 seconds so laundry is a

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:34.350
very very simple chore which is why I

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:36.480
volunteered to do it at home all the

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:38.010
time it's a hundred times easier than

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:42.350
doing the dishes even if you have a

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:44.880
dishwasher in my opinion least but I

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:46.950
digress you know it'll be Sunday all I

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:49.649
got to do today is do the laundry it's

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:51.419
1:00 a.m. that didn't do the laundry how

00:25:49.649 --> 00:25:52.799
does that happen we got one thing on

00:25:51.419 --> 00:25:54.929
your to-do list and then your time

00:25:52.799 --> 00:25:56.700
expands to fill that one thing there's

00:25:54.929 --> 00:26:00.330
that thing expands to fill all that time

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:02.340
rather I should say now you can even go

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:04.320
the opposite way in this as well you can

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:06.539
put too many tasks on your daily to-do

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.909
list and then it's like if your mom

00:26:06.539 --> 00:26:10.590
called you and she was like hey honey

00:26:08.909 --> 00:26:11.880
I know it's your summer vacation you've

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:13.590
worked really hard to get straight B

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.539
pluses this year in high school but

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:19.529
could you like mow the lawn do the

00:26:15.539 --> 00:26:22.350
dishes you know blah blah blah you'd be

00:26:19.529 --> 00:26:23.549
like I'm just gonna get a job cuz I mean

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:25.110
I would maybe that's her goal in the

00:26:23.549 --> 00:26:27.630
first place in which case good honor but

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:30.240
she's mine flooded you

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:32.309
she's a your you're not her intellectual

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.630
equal she bested you and quite frankly

00:26:32.309 --> 00:26:34.950
it's not a surprise she's probably like

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:35.399
three times your age right she's got

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:39.690
wisdom

00:26:35.399 --> 00:26:41.159
anyway you know but you're gonna you're

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:42.539
going to be less inclined to do anything

00:26:41.159 --> 00:26:44.909
I think you you know if I get it to do

00:26:42.539 --> 00:26:46.380
is like ten things on it from somebody

00:26:44.909 --> 00:26:49.559
I'd be like come on you didn't break

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:51.840
this down into meaningful chunks it's

00:26:49.559 --> 00:26:54.210
like instead of giving me chicken

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:56.549
nuggets you just gave me one breaded

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:57.929
chicken loaf it's not the same thing no

00:26:56.549 --> 00:27:00.120
matter how much they try to tell you it

00:26:57.929 --> 00:27:01.409
is so I don't want to lose empty vessel

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.059
but we will still keep the ability to

00:27:01.409 --> 00:27:04.919
fly because we're copy and then we'll

00:27:03.059 --> 00:27:06.570
roll that and the pacifiers are good

00:27:04.919 --> 00:27:09.240
enough peer down so all their tears off

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:10.919
I should say so I'll take it anyway so

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.299
that I've spent like four floors very

00:27:10.919 --> 00:27:14.580
inefficiently telling you about my

00:27:12.299 --> 00:27:17.789
strategy to maintain productivity that's

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:21.630
that's it and then the other thing so

00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:24.090
the step one for actionable stuff put a

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:25.169
task at the start of your day so easy

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:26.970
even a child could do it

00:27:25.169 --> 00:27:28.590
for example record the daily in the

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:30.240
binding of issac after birth plus it's

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:33.720
usually the first you know work-related

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:35.070
tasks I knock out on a daily basis gets

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.500
you then you get going you get in a good

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:39.510
mood to work unless you add a daily like

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:42.809
I've had recently which mostly we're

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:43.950
great but I messed them up it could be

00:27:42.809 --> 00:27:46.230
it could be the easiest thing in the

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:47.399
world could be reply to this email you

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:49.669
know you just want to do something that

00:27:47.399 --> 00:27:53.159
you still at the start of your day

00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:54.840
pretty early on where you don't say out

00:27:53.159 --> 00:27:57.239
handle this later alright now you got

00:27:54.840 --> 00:28:00.090
that done don't put too many tasks on it

00:27:57.239 --> 00:28:02.519
you know highlight before five things

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:04.049
you need to get done on a daily basis I

00:28:02.519 --> 00:28:05.609
promise you other stuff will come to

00:28:04.049 --> 00:28:06.929
fill it up and if you got extra time do

00:28:05.609 --> 00:28:09.559
your laundry it's not that difficult

00:28:06.929 --> 00:28:12.349
that's what I'm doing right after this

00:28:09.559 --> 00:28:14.759
my life is going to be much better

00:28:12.349 --> 00:28:17.249
having folded the laundry in the dryer

00:28:14.759 --> 00:28:18.659
move the load from the washer into the

00:28:17.249 --> 00:28:20.340
dryer and then folding that load when

00:28:18.659 --> 00:28:22.710
it's done in an hour then it would be by

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:24.929
playing one extra GP of Mario Cart

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:26.489
although I promise you I'm still going

00:28:24.929 --> 00:28:28.349
to be playing that Mario Cart tonight

00:28:26.489 --> 00:28:30.690
there's time if you manage it there's

00:28:28.349 --> 00:28:32.309
time enough for everything I well many

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:34.009
things please I assure you we don't have

00:28:32.309 --> 00:28:37.470
a child that would be a nightmare

00:28:34.009 --> 00:28:39.479
perhaps one day but for now you know

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:41.009
there's a Patton Oswald joke is like we

00:28:39.479 --> 00:28:42.359
have a baby who's called ten hours of

00:28:41.009 --> 00:28:43.769
sleep a night that's the other thing you

00:28:42.359 --> 00:28:45.450
want to be productive ten hours of sleep

00:28:43.769 --> 00:28:46.859
at night really helps everybody is in a

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:49.200
position to do that probably right oh

00:28:46.859 --> 00:28:51.330
look at this I'm joking but probably not

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:54.779
in generating myself well to the rest of

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:59.340
the world here what is a engender mean I

00:28:54.779 --> 00:29:01.739
always use that in gender meaning cause

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:04.080
or give rise to a feeling they were not

00:29:01.739 --> 00:29:06.059
engendering Goodwill yeah okay that it

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:07.710
makes sense you know we're not giving

00:29:06.059 --> 00:29:10.379
rise to the feeling of goodwill so we

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:14.249
are going to fight each other now we're

00:29:10.379 --> 00:29:18.840
going to fight the hush on this one and

00:29:14.249 --> 00:29:24.259
we took Eden's blessing not for the

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:27.419
tears up so much is the so much is the

00:29:24.259 --> 00:29:28.109
extra item on the next run spirit odds

00:29:27.419 --> 00:29:30.960
are good here

00:29:28.109 --> 00:29:36.659
spoon benders great and then we crack

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:39.450
into these I think we would maybe used

00:29:36.659 --> 00:29:40.979
ice shard but we should pop the world

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:44.009
card like or drop it in here I should

00:29:40.979 --> 00:29:46.889
say this is a very very good run now and

00:29:44.009 --> 00:29:50.389
then sure we roll everything else

00:29:46.889 --> 00:29:50.389
beepers I is not great

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:57.120
at this point I mean with nuns ever we

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:58.620
might have a choice but doesn't really

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:02.910
matter that much see we got going on

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:04.050
here so I'm trying to see what effect we

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:05.430
have from whatever Oh do you know what

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:06.630
it's three dollar bill that's adjusting

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:08.700
our stats okay

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:11.370
that's why we have 13 damage sometimes

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:12.570
that's pretty good I mean it's very good

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:15.390
especially when you consider that we got

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:18.090
a hive mind coming along with it we're

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:20.490
doing a lot of damage this is a slight

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:23.070
Redemption on this run again I hope

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:26.220
doesn't come across as preachy you know

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:28.740
I've had a lot of lazy times in my life

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:33.450
and I actually really respect the

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:37.920
therapeutic value of laziness I think

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:39.270
even more so than a lot of people and I

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:42.600
mean that sincerely although it might

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:45.630
seem kind of silly you know working hard

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:47.520
at something important something that

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:51.510
you're passionate about that's number

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:53.670
one number two is not necessarily

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:55.620
working hard at something you're not

00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:58.040
passionate about number two might be

00:30:55.620 --> 00:31:01.170
laziness

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:04.290
you know there's value in laziness I've

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:06.780
been so lazy sometimes that you get

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:10.790
bored of Recreation I think that's a

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:13.950
dangerous symptom as I in the DSM 6.9

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:15.780
you know if you're if you're bored with

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:18.570
your with whatever you're doing for

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:20.220
leisure on a consistent basis maybe your

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:21.570
OD'ing on boredom a little they try to

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:26.340
shift a little bit into the upper

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:27.540
category if possible but you know it's a

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:32.240
complicated size you're talking about

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:35.580
human motivation and drive and emotion

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:38.370
inspiration stuff like that I see it all

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:42.330
the time successful people make posts

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:45.750
like so it's very self-serving they make

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:47.550
posts like never lose your hunger you

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:50.580
know you could do it just drive to

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:52.680
succeed you know they make it seem like

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:55.350
on the one hand I get it it's very it's

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:57.330
a motivating tool and yeah you are going

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:59.010
like hey never lose your hunger that's

00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:01.530
important you see it in YouTube a lot of

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:03.390
people you know working jobs they don't

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:04.120
really like that much and then they get

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:05.860
to the point where there

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:07.390
big enough to move onto YouTube the

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:09.190
first leg couple of weeks so they're

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:11.740
doing it or and even you know months

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:14.590
they're doing it they're hungry I don't

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:16.300
want to go back to swabbing the poop

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:18.280
deck I deliberately chose a job that

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:19.990
doesn't exist anymore really to be

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.640
respectful except like a highly

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:24.130
disrespectful to poop decks whoppers but

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:26.380
anyway and then you get used to it it's

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:28.630
sort of like you know step one if you

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:33.130
find yourself complaining about like oh

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:35.320
you know somebody left shitty comment

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:36.850
and you're like well you know it does

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:39.040
suck but it's part of the business and

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:40.720
I'll take this and then you're like long

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:42.460
you know I'm not really working as hard

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:43.990
as I used to and you just you'll lose

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:46.120
that track that's important but at the

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:48.730
same time it's so self-serving to be

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:51.820
like you want to be successful stay

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:53.650
hungry I want to see a day in your life

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:55.540
mister stay hungry because when you tell

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:58.540
people staying hungry is like the most

00:32:55.540 --> 00:33:00.700
important thing in the world you're

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:02.260
leaving yourself open you telling me you

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.640
know with the big celebrity for this is

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:04.420
Will Smith and I'm not insulting Will

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:10.090
Smith at all

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:11.680
Will Smith is always like without

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:12.940
insulting him but I really do have

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:15.730
nothing against him I just have a

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:18.930
personal you know quibble with this he's

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:22.300
always like you know when I was a kid I

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:24.430
only cared about two things reading and

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.630
running because reading you got that

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:26.980
voice in your head that tells you to

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:29.650
stop cuz you're bored and you just keep

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:30.970
doing it and running you got that voice

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:32.590
in your head that tells you to stop

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:33.730
because it hurts too much you got to

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:36.460
learn to push through those two voices

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:38.500
to be successful I was like man first up

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:40.060
great quote the same day there's

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:43.510
alliteration in everything it's got the

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:45.910
whole nine yards right Beelzebub we did

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:48.730
get Beelzebub I was like you're going to

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:55.780
tell me if I go back to Will Smith when

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:56.890
he was 16 80% of the time it's a man

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:59.260
we're never going to get to use it but

00:33:56.890 --> 00:34:02.470
80% of the time that dude is reading or

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:05.530
running that's ridiculous that's just

00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:07.480
nonsense that at that point becomes like

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:09.700
unproductive I'd be like this man he's

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:11.950
an obsessive we got to get him some

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:13.780
therapy or something there's never a day

00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:15.820
that wouldn't sixteen-year-old Will

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:17.190
Smith took in a little bit of the

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:19.589
devil's lettuce

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:21.659
never date sorry can't too busy run it

00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:23.849
and reading I don't want it to affect my

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:26.129
Bo to max say that's an honorable reason

00:34:23.849 --> 00:34:27.990
to abstain but at the same time I don't

00:34:26.129 --> 00:34:32.369
buy it dude I think that's a little bit

00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:34.109
of retconning you know I work hard now

00:34:32.369 --> 00:34:37.379
I'm not going to tell you like the

00:34:34.109 --> 00:34:39.269
secret to success is always grinding

00:34:37.379 --> 00:34:40.500
anybody tells you the secret of success

00:34:39.269 --> 00:34:44.759
they don't know what they're talking

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:47.220
about most of the time I think there

00:34:44.759 --> 00:34:50.339
were days in college I watched like 11

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:52.289
movies that's too many movies don't do

00:34:50.339 --> 00:34:54.240
that that's my advice the roads of

00:34:52.289 --> 00:34:56.519
success is not paid with 11 movie days

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:57.839
but you know if you don't have too many

00:34:56.519 --> 00:35:00.000
of them you'll probably be fine as well

00:34:57.839 --> 00:35:01.500

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.640
