##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.170
everybody welcome extra line plays a

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.580
binding of issac entry plus there was a

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.530
very very very small backlog and as a

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.179
result there has been a new booster pack

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.150
which I'm looking at right now

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.029
booster bag booster pack - afterbirth

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.000
plus jump - booster pack - the second

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.410
booster pack was released on May 12th

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.090
contains six new items one who drink it

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.000
and miscellaneous changes so I'm not

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.779
going to look up what the new items do

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.090
but I know that angel rooms are now

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.940
considered better let me close the wiki

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.170
here anyway we're doing a daily so it's

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.399
possible we'll see none of it it's

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.920
possible we'll see a ton of it looks

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.789
like today's daily goes to mom's foot

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.739
the highest score was 46,000 which

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.289
indicates certainly that person found a

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.360
way past where the heck is Isaac baby oh

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.860
the scores of maybe the scores have

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.440
adjusted somewhat because I've gone a

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.730
little bit up on the leaderboards

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.050
latinum II we've been 55 seconds here

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.109
just talking this let's get on with it

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.210
last daily was my may 11 to 6 to one

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.210
point zero one percentile I believe that

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:11.460
was the one where I made a protest by

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:14.790
fighting delirium and then trying to the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:22.290
International jump day what is Saturday

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:24.420
May 13th day no not 72 okay it's a

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.310
Saturday 72 things to do with Metro

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.259
Vancouver on Saturday May 13th is too

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.930
late it's like 9:26 p.m. I just got back

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.549
from Redmond Washington either way we

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.110
got thunder thighs we got a horrible

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.150
speed that is made slightly better by

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.390
that speed uphill ooh

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.799
[Music]

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:45.930
does how to jump do that or is is that

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.790
how to jump like thunder thighs combo

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.670
I've presently been unaware of because

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.439
if so that's pretty dope and we should

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.630
be using that like all the time as long

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.700
as it doesn't get us literally killed

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.659
I'll be pretty happy and actually how to

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.070
jump does a good job of not really

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.340
requiring high speed now we do have

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.879
crystal labyrinth so we have to make

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.229
sure that we don't muck it up too badly

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:11.760
because if we take red hard damage we're

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.890
going to be in a tight spot but really

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.440
I'm just going to try to like wound

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.120
we thing and then one or two shots even

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.470
with relatively poor damage should get

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.930
the kill this is an interesting daily

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.730
good stuff we'll break that pot or at

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.700
least we should break that pot this I

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.880
mean it's super overpowered to basically

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.380
be able to have unlimited bombs combined

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.840
with the functionality of how to jump is

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.000
pretty incredible you know we do know

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.510
now our secret room will not be adjacent

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.070
here we should be very very cautious our

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.840
secret room will not be adjacent to that

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.100
curse room so if we want to get into the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.120
cursor and we should pick up a spirit

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:58.140
heart or alternatively wait until we

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.570
finish with getting the deal of the

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.800
devil on this one right I don't need to

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.570
jump into things we have thunder thighs

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.790
we could even just walk into them you

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:11.340
can just walk over it so here's an

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:14.910
interesting one do you take not wheel of

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.290
fortune do you take this man to be your

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.540
lawfully wedded husband

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.760
do you take small rock I mean there's

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.130
great positives about it that are very

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.870
obvious everybody knows these positives

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.299
let's be a hipster and talk about the

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.730
negatives our speed has been modified so

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.010
our new speed would be terrible

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.470
we'd probably we might just be back at

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.829
0.45 but that's still pretty bad the

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.810
other thing worth noting is that we need

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:44.640
to kill these guys the other thing worth

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.829
noting is that we do compensate for that

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.120
we could just jump around like non-stop

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:54.600
but I kind of worry about the long-term

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.130
viability of that I think we're pretty

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.070
lucky to have not been hit there if I'm

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:03.000
being honest with you

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:05.310
and I tend to be luck up of course so I

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.280
didn't even see you there what do we

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.859
want I think we want to reroll these

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.470
we're doing fine on time by the way so

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.670
don't sweat that but think we want to

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.019
reroll these and if we're going to

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.169
re-roll we might as well just jump

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.209
around we really wanted to we might even

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.870
consider jumping up jumping up and then

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.870
getting down

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:30.030
so we're going to go until we see

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.530
something we want restock is something

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:38.760
we would like okay so then we'll go into

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:39.990
our secret room and there's a single do

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.640
we really want to blow those up there's

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.760
a single penny in there which will allow

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:50.490
us to get restock so we will go back and

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:52.770
get restock restock gave us three red

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.120
hearts which is not my favorite in the

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.400
world tell you what let's just go to the

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.750
boss fights first I think I do see no

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.370
there's not I think - Drock up there

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.800
I think we've adjusted to this run

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:06.390
pretty quickly put ourselves in a decent

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.560
spot to succeed but time will tell if

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.840
that becomes the case but yeah this is

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.970
like a I've taken a little bit less of

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.260
an approach you're being zany right now

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.830
just because the daily have started a

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.150
little zany and it's kind of like come

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.040
on this is our secret room like don't

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.330
even mess with me is they Jakob don't

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.410
lie to me man ah well at least we got

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.550
second secret room potential out of that

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.550
but yeah I think we've we've adjusted

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.950
pretty well like I think this is a daily

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.360
where I have a chance to succeed I

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.390
haven't been hit at all yet I mean how

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.330
to jump makes that relatively easy to

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.730
avoid in the first place but still

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:47.790
definitely would have preferred to use

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:50.220
High Priestess on the Hans but yeah that

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.500
was like really dumb but long as we can

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.650
keep from jumping like literally right

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.240
into them we should be fine

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:00.330
super bandage is also great we could use

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.950
a speed upgrade definitely take that

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.080
don't take out it why would we take

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.760
sorry not how to jump why would we take

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:12.210
the nail here I would never take the

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:15.690
nail here I think I'm well obviously

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.540
going to go back to the for the curse

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.250
room we're still pretty ahead on time

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.660
0.6 speed is horrible I probably should

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.640
not take smaller rock especially

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.470
considering we got independent damage

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.840
upgrades but I'm going to take small

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:30.090
rock for the DPS potential speed so

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.250
hopefully is like easy to come by

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.200
I mean speed kills coming up mountain

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.080
speed kills rolling down the street

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.550
speed kills the presence of mind

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.250
and speed kills if you know what I mean

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.710
that's what Gavin Rossdale said Keanu

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:46.020
Reeves said the bus can't go slower than

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.699
55 miles an hour which I always I took

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.430
that as a great matter of international

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:53.849
treason really because we in Canada we

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:56.159
use the metric system and you notice

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:59.039
inferred Khan Khan yahay Reeves know

00:06:56.159 --> 00:07:00.990
Keanu Reeves the canadian-american actor

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:03.210
I really hoped that he would have gone

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:07.020
to bat for us in that one and been like

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:11.599
I really like to what a good impression

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:14.909
I really like to say the measurement in

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:17.819
it's William Shatner now um which one of

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:21.750
these could help us the most probably a

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:25.500
karma I suppose out of all of these now

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:29.159
if you really trust the game you

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:31.800
shouldn't have done that if you really

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:32.990
trust the game and specifically how to

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.250
jump

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:38.419
you should give these a try it's not

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.419
costing us too much time

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:45.310
[Music]

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:49.759
okay but like this is madness obviously

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:52.190
you think he would have given it in km/h

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:53.960
and I know those amongst you are going

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:57.080
km/h that's stupid who uses that

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.720
measurement well you know like 98% of

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:02.509
the population of the free world but

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:04.580
ignoring that many amongst you or smite

00:08:02.509 --> 00:08:05.990
Lee is slightly smaller proportion

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.060
admittedly but some amongst you are like

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:10.970
well if you wanted to be completely

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:16.190
unambiguous why don't we just use meters

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:18.919
per second that's the ISO unit for speed

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:21.139
you know what you're smarter than I am I

00:08:18.919 --> 00:08:24.889
resent you for it but I respect you for

00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:27.820
it as well you're right meters per

00:08:24.889 --> 00:08:34.310
second it's a good tool it's a good

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:36.320
measurement what's funny is that I mean

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:42.200
last mentioned we were down in in

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:43.969
Seattle and Redmond and first off if you

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.550
ask and this is just anecdotal

00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:48.589
experience I'm not trying to be you know

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:51.260
nationalistic or anything like that or

00:08:48.589 --> 00:08:53.900
even xenophobic but my experience is

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:56.390
that if you tell an American that you

00:08:53.900 --> 00:09:00.110
are from Canada they think that you took

00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:03.200
like a jumbo jet or like a FedEx cargo

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:04.820
plane how was your journey are you okay

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.980
do you need like some beef jerky or

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:09.620
something where it's your Vancouver to

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:11.510
Seattle is a very pleasant two and a

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.400
half to four hundred hour drive

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:17.360
depending on traffic in the Seattle area

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:20.060
is very nice but if you ever say if

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.990
you're in you know Maine and you go oh

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.089
I'd you know

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:25.459
drove the North Carolina last week

00:09:23.089 --> 00:09:27.170
everybody knows oh yes approximately

00:09:25.459 --> 00:09:28.760
like agumon fourteen and a half hour

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:30.680
drive if you say you're from Vancouver

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.660
it's actually like you flew in on a

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.959
freaking spaceship that doesn't come

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:38.330
equipped with rearview mirrors it dips

00:09:34.959 --> 00:09:41.450
anyway that's not a secret room

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:42.770
apparently but then yeah we were down

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:48.279
there and as soon as you cross the

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:51.470
border the navigation system starts

00:09:48.279 --> 00:09:53.120
spitting out lines I would say spitting

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:55.640
out lies as well but that's more of a

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:58.040
personal thing in

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.870
cereal and it becomes very confusing

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:02.030
pretty quickly because you know I'm

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:05.030
driving along and they're like in 200

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:05.810
meters turn left on East Seneca Street

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:08.870
and I'm like

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:10.220
easy 200 meters you know 1/5 of a

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.510
kilometer nothing wrong with that I'm

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.770
not going to do the mile conversion in

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:16.400
my head because I don't want to enable

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:18.560
you and that is going in a in a quarter

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.130
mile turn right on Spring Street and I'm

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:23.680
saying

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:26.330
first off bitterly whip on dude but also

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:28.010
turn right on Spring Street in a

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:30.890
quarter-mile and I'm like not only are

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:34.340
we getting into Imperial measurements

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:37.250
but fractions simultaneously that's a

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:39.650
pretty advanced lateral move for my GPS

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:43.250
here I still think I mean we we hung out

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:46.250
King I hung out with the bear taffy and

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:49.910
his wife who is called wife taffy not in

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:52.700
real life so you know what I mean we got

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:54.620
it like speed up as well like just well

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:56.090
I'm saying this anecdote keep that in

00:10:54.620 --> 00:11:00.560
mind that I'm also feeling the intense

00:10:56.090 --> 00:11:02.510
pressure of time here but I don't know

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.890
where I was going with that there was a

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.450
there is meant to be an anecdote there

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:07.130
we were driving with them the anecdote

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.720
is very simple it's not a good story and

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.070
I regret bringing it up but the only

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.830
thing worse than bringing up a bad story

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:15.740
is going as don't forget about that

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:17.750
story's bad but you know you're driving

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:20.570
and you know the GPS was given us

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:22.040
coordinates and imperial and I was like

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.510
these don't make any sense that's the

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.200
end of the story there's really no

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:26.570
punchline

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:28.190
believe you me I tried to manufacture a

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:32.320
punchline as quickly as I could it just

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:34.970
does not exist so I'm sorry about that

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.930
we did an escape room when we were there

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:39.310
if you're not familiar with the concept

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:41.930
an escape room is a cooperative

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:43.340
team-building exercise where you go into

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:46.160
a room and they lock you in there and

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:48.230
it's a business and inside of the room

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.000
are a series of puzzles that lead you to

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:51.350
eventually being able to solve the

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.090
greatest puzzle of all which is how to

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.440
get out of the room so think of it you

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:56.450
know it's like a big old puzzle game you

00:11:54.440 --> 00:12:00.170
get an hour to complete I'm ashamed to

00:11:56.450 --> 00:12:02.150
say that we lost at the escape room but

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:04.460
I am very pleased to say that we crushed

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:07.270
it we were nobody was at each other's

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:10.730
throats hello

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:19.250
what the hell

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:19.250
what are we doing what is this

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:26.430
so temporarily we were like a demon and

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.520
that was sick I would like to go back to

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:34.980
demon land please because I think maybe

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:37.110
our speed would have been better and now

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:39.360
it's gone alright so I have no idea what

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:42.000
that was but hopefully that wasn't the

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:44.220
scene when we finished it we were two

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.290
puzzle shy of finishing it and we had

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:48.240
really solved some good puzzles over the

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.830
courses I'm talking like we did some

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.480
smart stuff I was very impressed

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:53.760
especially because fur bear and his wife

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.140
is the first escape room they'd ever

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.820
done I'm not saying Kate and I are

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:59.130
experts but we've done a couple before

00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.780
it's not like extremely experienced but

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:03.150
we kind of know like alright we're

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:04.650
looking for hidden stuff that's going to

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:05.940
point the four digit in three-digit

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.380
combinations we can enter into these

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.550
locks that will give us keys and then we

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.520
enter that and you know blah blah blah

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:13.290
you know it's a it's a pretty simple and

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.660
repeatable process although sometimes

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:17.400
the puzzles are more difficult but yeah

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.840
would I was impressed with their

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:21.420
abilities they killed it then we

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.530
finished it and we had lost they gave us

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.580
the keys to the kingdom there I oh

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.870
here's what you need to do blah blah

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.280
blah and they're like well you didn't do

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.930
too bad this is a room designed for

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.760
twelve people why didn't you tell us

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:31.890
that a check-in like I'm going to have

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:35.100
this on my permanent record that I

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:37.350
failed this escape room takes my overall

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:39.240
effectiveness and success rate on escape

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:42.900
rooms that hurts me by the way in a deep

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.530
way from a to attitude with two out of

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:49.320
three

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:53.490
that's a precipitous fall three room

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:58.500
blow this up take the key take the

00:13:53.490 --> 00:14:02.130
nickel forget the bombs don't forget the

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:04.320
key or the the nickel I should say we do

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:05.730
we need speed that is not speed that's

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.470
going to hurt me I have surrounded

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:10.860
myself with bombs that was a poor

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:12.360
decision on my part this daily is Godin

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:15.200
I wouldn't say it's gotten bad but it

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.440
certainly has not gotten great here

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.450
anyway

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.889
it was good though we had it we had a

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:23.199
fun time

00:14:19.889 --> 00:14:25.180
why was I in Seattle I'm glad you asked

00:14:23.199 --> 00:14:28.899
I hadn't found a way to shoehorn it in

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:30.459
yet I was writing an exam well he every

00:14:28.899 --> 00:14:31.600
time I say I'm writing an exam Dan gets

00:14:30.459 --> 00:14:33.339
mad at me apparently it's not the

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.889
parlance of the United States of America

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:38.230
and it's my job to be accommodating to

00:14:35.889 --> 00:14:39.639
our lucky neighbors to the South who

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.439
well admittedly did let me into their

00:14:39.639 --> 00:14:43.540
country this weekend thank you for that

00:14:41.439 --> 00:14:45.850
American Border Patrol appreciate it

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:47.319
it's not like I should be disallowed no

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:48.970
matter how bad I am at Isaac I don't

00:14:47.319 --> 00:14:50.500
think you should be able to go this guy

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:53.290
sucks at video games don't let him into

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:55.870
our country unless he criminally sucked

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:57.399
at video games then maybe but I don't

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:59.860
think I'm quite at that level yet

00:14:57.399 --> 00:15:01.899
although that Judas episode of Isaac a

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:09.970
couple days ago might make you believe

00:15:01.899 --> 00:15:12.069
otherwise we need this deal here but

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:14.319
yeah and and I'm happy to report I

00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:16.930
passed the exam it was not a

00:15:14.319 --> 00:15:20.490
particularly difficult exam but I did

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:23.529
study quite a lot for it so to get that

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:25.720
w felt good now what does that mean it's

00:15:23.529 --> 00:15:28.959
essentially a piece of paper that

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:31.839
indicates I know how to turn unity on

00:15:28.959 --> 00:15:33.939
and off and then manipulate objects to

00:15:31.839 --> 00:15:37.509
some extent within it it does not mean

00:15:33.939 --> 00:15:40.149
I'm capable of building binding of issac

00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:45.879
after birth Plus for example but who is

00:15:40.149 --> 00:15:48.579
who amongst us is I might not even be

00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:50.829
capable of building this run into a win

00:15:48.579 --> 00:15:53.559
so let's not get to above our station

00:15:50.829 --> 00:15:55.839
here see you like I mean I can't because

00:15:53.559 --> 00:15:58.779
we have unlimited bombs so I think I'm

00:15:55.839 --> 00:16:00.040
just going to bypass that for now what

00:15:58.779 --> 00:16:02.620
do you do with an emperor card an

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.720
emperor card is one of the weirdest see

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:06.970
like what is this okay now I'm a demon

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:09.490
and I don't really understand what's

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:11.620
going on with that but I was only a

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:13.629
demon temporarily there must be like

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:15.040
today must be international you know

00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:19.000
look at a mere day or something like

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:22.899
that not international look at a mere

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.620
day a mere you deserves privacy just

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:25.620
like anybody else

00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:30.250
I'll tell you what is not international

00:16:28.269 --> 00:16:32.690
you know have a functional amount of

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:34.879
speed to do your run with day

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:36.740
but I can't help but feel that probably

00:16:34.879 --> 00:16:38.629
first off might be a little rusty it has

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:41.180
been 36 hours since I played Isaac which

00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:43.250
is a world of time and my in my universe

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:45.110
and then okay maybe we should also not

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:48.589
be jumping directly into enemies on a

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:53.420
regular basis and then knowing then know

00:16:48.589 --> 00:16:56.509
there is an end then though I should

00:16:53.420 --> 00:17:01.699
never have willfully gone down to four

00:16:56.509 --> 00:17:07.130
speed that was a poor decision and I

00:17:01.699 --> 00:17:11.270
live with it every day every boss I have

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:16.549
to lay did I say lay that's not mine

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:18.650
okay very good there naked ladies see

00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:21.760
I'm I'm dealing with the struggle here

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:21.760
you might be able to see it for yourself

00:17:21.939 --> 00:17:27.470
darn the struggle is can't get close to

00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:29.150
that guy because if I get close he's

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:31.640
going to be able to hit me almost as

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:34.039
fast as I can jump not like literally as

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:36.440
fast but pretty darn close so we got to

00:17:34.039 --> 00:17:38.299
be more careful

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:42.070
it's tough dude what do you think about

00:17:38.299 --> 00:17:46.309
that there is a self-sacrifice room

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:49.480
prior to boss rush I have to think that

00:17:46.309 --> 00:17:51.830
this is the wrong way to handle things

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:55.400
so the emperor card becomes a very

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:58.159
interesting sort of thing for us right

00:17:55.400 --> 00:18:01.280
now I mean the luck is nice good good

00:17:58.159 --> 00:18:02.990
jump but the emperor card becomes very

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.669
interesting for us because we could use

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:09.080
it to teleport but I don't really want

00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:12.020
to what I would much rather do is use

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:17.299
this to make sure on the next floor that

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:20.090
we're able to get to our our boss rush

00:18:17.299 --> 00:18:22.039
which I don't even really want to fight

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:24.020
if I'm being a hundred percent with you

00:18:22.039 --> 00:18:26.570
guys right now if I'm being you know

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:27.590
straight up with you not completely

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:32.380
convinced we're going to be able to

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:32.380
crush that Gary Vaynerchuk style

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:41.070
my favorite k-pop song so I'm a whole

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:44.850
thing that we get the keys to the

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:46.860
kingdom here there is a teleport

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:51.680
somewhere now the question becomes is

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:56.640
the teleport the teleport on this floor

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:58.260
is it the boss rush that we're supposed

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.850
to go sorry not boss rush is it the

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.740
self-sacrifice room that we're going to

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:03.240
go to I've really functioned on a pretty

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:06.120
easy principle and Isaac and the

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:07.560
principle has been you definitely buy

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:11.580
this because then you double everything

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:12.540
else but you might want to take this

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.550
first because you don't really care

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:17.160
about doubling that you don't really

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:18.690
care about doubling taro cloth I don't

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:24.360
even know what that is it's a new item

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:28.220
moving box wow what have I done um okay

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:32.250
so I'm assuming that the moving box

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:35.520
allows us to pack up all of our items

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:38.130
and then dispose of them if not dispose

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:40.460
of them use them on another room so this

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:44.160
my head is already spinning with

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:46.860
plausible reasons for this item here

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:52.950
like our synergies that you could use it

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:54.720
with rather I'm going to blow this up is

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:56.700
weird like super tight on time if I got

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.740
0.4 speed and I got a freaking walk

00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:01.800
everywhere because we created everything

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.730
I think we just diplopia and I

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.990
straight-up

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:05.940
think I mean maybe we could just

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:08.100
endlessly synergize these or something

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:11.280
but I think you take potato peeler and

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:13.500
you're freaking go nuts with it dude and

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.710
my reasoning for that is very very

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:18.570
simple

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:19.920
yeah I got a go though my reasoning for

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:21.900
that is very very simple

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:26.670
I want this meat boy to do like all the

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:29.070
damage in the world so I actually feel

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:32.040
like the right course of action is to

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:34.650
maybe just immediately go through to the

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:37.560
boss fight but we don't have a way to

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:39.480
get past boss rush so we would be doing

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:43.310
boss rush and maybe there's something to

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:45.930
that you know we'd be happy I guess but

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:46.530
how we going to get out of boss rush is

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:49.590
advised

00:20:46.530 --> 00:21:00.570
Ahmir I've got no idea leave a mere out

00:20:49.590 --> 00:21:04.530
of this and Perez I I think we should

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:07.890
just go to boss rush right now I'm gonna

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:10.260
do like one more room maybe I'm going to

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:12.270
try to get some skulls basically I don't

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:13.590
think I can necessarily beat mom that

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:18.770
quickly it's part of the problem for me

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:18.770
here but then like beyond that I need

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:25.770
let me put it this way if there's no

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:27.360
teleport we're not going to get extra

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:29.370
points anyway so we're not going to get

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:31.260
out of boss rush and we're not going to

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:32.760
get out of the boss fight we might as

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.440
well get boss rush points and then hope

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:37.410
that we get some kind of useful drop in

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:38.790
the interim period there I do want to

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:43.980
see if one of these is speed

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:46.290
I thought the speed pill was just white

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:47.580
but puberty is a good pill I don't know

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:48.810
I don't care that I got it I will kill

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:52.290
this guy just to see what we get and get

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:53.880
the points but okay grab this get the

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:55.500
heck out of here honestly and again I

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:58.350
don't expect this to necessarily be a

00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:02.120
great daily now I must prefer to have

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:02.120
the scene by the time that I get here

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:11.310
we don't though so I think you know you

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:16.020
can only play the situation as it's

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:18.660
given can't look down at a doyle brunson

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:20.100
210 on suited and then be like Olaf I

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:22.470
had pocket rockets I'd love to play

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:24.930
aggressive right now you know it's an

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:27.570
academic exercise is not that productive

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:33.720
in the mome so here's what we're going

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:38.420
to do we're going to grab this and we're

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:41.910
gonna oh you gotta take infestation

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:43.920
infestation no breeding given us spiders

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:44.940
that cause bleeding doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.130
doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:49.760
doo-doo-doo-doo this is my phosphorus

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:49.760
item

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:56.090
shouldn't focus on that because now I

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:59.059
mean we have a problem in case that's

00:22:56.090 --> 00:23:08.360
not abundantly clear we got some issues

00:22:59.059 --> 00:23:10.640
here we're very very very slow if I

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:14.929
could turn back time what a tale my

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:16.789
thoughts would tell we have one job

00:23:14.929 --> 00:23:19.190
right now and I don't even mean

00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:21.350
everything I don't even mean in the you

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:24.230
know you had one job sort of way but

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:27.470
like all you had to do was follow the

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:30.110
damn train CJ but no we don't have to

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:33.020
follow the darn train okay all we got to

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:37.039
do here is not get hit by anything that

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:38.270
does double damage like not getting hit

00:23:37.039 --> 00:23:41.000
by anything that does a full heart and

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:42.080
then sure I don't I don't think we're

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:48.409
going to find a seam I'm going to be

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:51.770
honest with you I think that when

00:23:48.409 --> 00:23:56.500
today's daily ends it will just end and

00:23:51.770 --> 00:24:01.690
that's okay I can be all right with that

00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:04.309
dude I had not even considered the fact

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:06.740
that you can actually just press space

00:24:04.309 --> 00:24:08.840
and jump in place your big disgrace

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:12.140
whether or not you're waving your

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:14.929
feather all over the place it seems like

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:16.909
it takes your momentum into a salad

00:24:14.929 --> 00:24:18.470
sucks really bad it seems like it takes

00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:21.230
your momentum into account when it

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:22.850
produces direction that you will be

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:24.620
traveling to I don't care we got a half

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:26.120
sphere at our back so all we need to do

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.770
is continue to get some of those we're

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:31.760
going to have a daily score that is

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:37.220
actually like bad bad it is going to be

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:39.559
bad not just for how did that work it's

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.700
going to be bad not just relative to the

00:24:39.559 --> 00:24:42.830
fact that we know their scores in the

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:50.110
forty thousand really bad relative to

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:55.419
you know a normal run of this length

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:55.419
that much is guaranteed more or less

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:59.770
I don't know where I messed up though I

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:01.780
also have no idea what the mirrors do I

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:04.270
got to assume that that's like some you

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:07.300
know specially designed Alec cart for

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:08.920
today's daily only sort of stuff I still

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:12.400
think you're you might disagree with me

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:14.950
on this I still think my personal choice

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:17.530
for like the best change you could ever

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:21.220
make to dailies is to just make them all

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:23.650
go as far as they can go and that's a

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:30.090
very it's motivated by self-interest if

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:34.570
I'm being honest you know I tend to

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:39.130
hello hello I tend to perform best on

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:40.809
dailies that first before I go deeper

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:42.640
into this tangent I want to point out

00:25:40.809 --> 00:25:45.220
thank up or who are Babylon yeah we now

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:49.840
have 0.7 speed which is exceptional of

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:54.610
course no but I think it's clear I tend

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:57.220
to perform best on dailies that go all

00:25:54.610 --> 00:26:00.940
the way and today's daily I mean yeah

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:03.250
that's like a horrible score I mean let

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:04.660
me go to the reddit.com slash are slash

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:06.309
finding advise because now I got a chip

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:07.540
of my shoulder I just see what's going

00:26:06.309 --> 00:26:09.700
on today's daily let's reveal the

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:11.800
secrets now that we've now that we've

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:13.059
done it first off as always I apologize

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.340
I'm not going to blame that on rust

00:26:13.059 --> 00:26:16.559
taking smaller aquas a bad decision but

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:22.360
then I think I missed something

00:26:16.559 --> 00:26:26.010
somewhere let's see two words can

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:26.010
describe this daily fun and stupid

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:31.120
booster pack must be interesting here

00:26:28.929 --> 00:26:33.970
have even more breaking items fuck this

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:35.470
I don't know what that means but all you

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:38.440
need to do to win this daily is jump

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:41.679
that's it you can also use how to speed

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:43.000
the counter it counter the low-speed use

00:26:41.679 --> 00:26:45.700
how to jump to counter the low-speed bed

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.380
is continually jumping this should

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.520
definitely been a blindfolded run I

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:52.750
don't know I guess that means you have

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:58.390
no tears man I'm looking at these scores

00:26:52.750 --> 00:27:01.770
and I feel like a moron yep this run

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:01.770
teaches you how to use how to jump

00:27:01.809 --> 00:27:07.599
how dare you say Zayn northernlion

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:11.529
copyrighted the word Zayn his lawyers

00:27:07.599 --> 00:27:15.580
will be coming after you some of these

00:27:11.529 --> 00:27:17.710
scores are amazing man I suck today I'm

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:19.719
looking everyone's like the stupidest

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:22.210
grin on my face god dammit I squandered

00:27:19.719 --> 00:27:23.799
a fun daily this one's a my bad I take

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:25.119
ownership I apologize hopefully you

00:27:23.799 --> 00:27:27.070
enjoyed the commentary and found that

00:27:25.119 --> 00:27:27.999
can't play a nice little companion piece

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:29.619
there but for now thanks for watching
