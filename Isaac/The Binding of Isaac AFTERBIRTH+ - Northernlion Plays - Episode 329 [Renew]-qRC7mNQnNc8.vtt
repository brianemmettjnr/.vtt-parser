00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.560
everybody welcome back northern Lions

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.870
The Binding of Isaac we keep getting

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.469
like decent streaks going here we've had

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:14.070
some great runs on and empirical sea

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:18.000
dish level recently 0.96 speed good rate

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:22.529
of fire good damage box of friends gives

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.779
us ok nevermind we win it's a it's a

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.310
really good starting item though hey

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.320
let's start the Isaac episode I'm going

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.269
to build some tension I'm gonna build a

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.890
moment will he or won't he win I don't

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.649
know there's death touch in the first

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.129
item room so I mean that compromises our

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.800
rate of fire but apart from that it's

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:44.309
extremely worth it oh no I mean in a way

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.070
it almost I'm not gonna say it isn't

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.600
because the piercing shot is sort of an

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.010
intangible that helps us at an enormous

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.469
deal as well but we did we had 33

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.719
percent decreased rate of fire this is

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.180
an excel no just a just a large floor

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:06.990
and we basically got 33% increased

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.790
damage so we're shooting 1/3 more slowly

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.310
this is a weird way to phrase this but

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.170
we're shooting 1/3 more slowly but we're

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.240
doing 1/3 or maybe slightly more than

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.259
1/3 more damage I think it's because

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.960
like a tears down is like it's a

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.180
relative quantity and I know please

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.860
don't stop talking about relative

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.770
quantities I'm almost there but no what

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.790
I mean is like the first tears downgrade

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.200
always seems to be like

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.400
disproportionately large in the first

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.920
tears upgrade always seems to be

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.880
disproportionately large so I was acting

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.900
you're not going to believe me I was

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.070
going to predict that that was going to

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.770
take us to eight anyway then just like

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.630
the one from spawn when you get the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.909
first tears upgrade and or downgrade it

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.090
always seems to take you to like almost

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.409
mid double digits but anyway we're

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.060
completely sad we got a spirit are we

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.219
got a chance at an arcade on this floor

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.079
we got piercing shots with deaths touch

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.880
this is balls of steel told you

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.479
paralysis did I say balls of steel

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.070
because in in my head I said paralysis

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.149
yeah this is just like a 10 out of 10

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.170
actual start bursting sack

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.260
embarrassingly still don't totally know

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.720
what this item does I know

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.500
that occasionally gives you some spiders

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:23.430
I always get it confused with

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:27.390
the spider bombs but spider bombs spider

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:31.290
bombs they explode into spiders mom it's

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:35.700
not a phase I swear to you I'll still be

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:39.049
emo in 2022 look out they are the spider

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.319
bombs that was a genuine voicecrack

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:45.989
maybe I'm going through second puberty I

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.459
don't know dude like sometimes I don't

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.980
feel like I'm actually going through

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.900
puberty again but sometimes I feel like

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.540
I'm going through like hormonal changes

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.780
that are similar to puberty like I feel

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.090
like I started shaving when I was when I

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.099
was 13 a little on the early side not

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.109
not like two orders of magnitude early

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.530
but a little on the early side and I was

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:10.409
like a four for a long time I was like a

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.480
once-a-week sort of electric razor guy

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:14.040
for like the last seven or eight years

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.680
I've been at once a week use the

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.379
electric razor and it keeps me like at

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.970
the end of it I get a little beardy but

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.949
you know for the most part I just got

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.180
like sublet and the stubble gets longer

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:26.639
and then I'm like ice getting a little

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.879
itchy I should you know sort it out I

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:32.579
think I might have to move to a2 times a

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:35.370
week shave I think I'm still feeling the

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:38.970
residual effects of like becoming an

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:42.389
adult and like right now like I shaved

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.709
yesterday and I in shave I use the

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.790
electric razor I should say so it always

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.220
leaves you with like a little bit of

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.590
stubble and then today I have stubble

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.060
still but it's like movable stubble I'm

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.430
not saying you could style it but

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.060
there's like I can I can feel the hair

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:00.199
like Bend when I rub my hand on it means

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.569
tomorrow I'm gonna have like an actual

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:05.669
pseudo beard like I'm going to look like

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:10.709
I could be an MMA fighter at least from

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:13.260
a follicular standpoint I'm not really

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.120
willing to go for broke on that one and

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.949
that means in four days I'm going to

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.900
start to be like you know when the hair

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.539
starts to get like weirdly curly at the

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.070
jawline I'm gonna be like alright guess

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:26.930
it's time to shave again I don't want to

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:30.510
be a two times a week shaver

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.980
I'm not go specially considering we

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.070
can't do anything with this anyway um

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.570
with the the box of France it is we can

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.530
get to farting baby sorry I don't want

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:42.120
to misrepresent farting baby check it

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.360
out check it out

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.110
pretty solid I'm not complaining about

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:52.380
my lot in life you know like whenever

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:55.110
you complain about its just crank on the

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.210
old razor blade had extremely

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.570
disproportionately good payouts for us

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.610
here um whenever you complain you know

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.580
as a dude you're like oh I've gotta

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.950
shave my face once a week a lot of

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.870
people there's a lot of like men shave

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.820
their face once a day which is crazy to

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.950
me that's like some actual I don't know

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.960
if you know this but like when I grew up

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:20.370
the era that I grew up in men were

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:22.410
clean-shaven the the ideal appearance

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:27.090
for virility was like Justin Timberlake

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:29.460
was like a baby face like teenager

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.970
basically so as a thirteen-year-old

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.230
where people are like chest hair I mean

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.330
they still probably are like that

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.920
because that's that's too young yeah

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.560
it's like a 17 year old people are like

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.640
chest hair ooh you're like golly at

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.220
chest hair

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:47.610
ooh I meanwhile take my shirt off looks

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:51.240
like Robin Williams elbows you know the

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.770
thing is we're so lucky if you're if

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.660
you're a hairy dude and you're growing

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.480
up in this era you don't understand

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:00.990
beards maybe like again seven or eight

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.270
years ago inexplicably became sort of in

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.680
vogue and it'll pass I know you're

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.900
looking at these photos of yourself

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.960
right now and like you know plaid

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:12.600
clothes you got a full tattoo arm sleeve

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.580
a beanie and thick rimmed glasses it's

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.700
not me insulting you I am in that camp

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.800
as well - the tattoos and then the well

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.180
cloths beard but either way you're going

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.620
to look back on those photos the same

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.510
way you look back on photos of like your

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.000
parents in the 1980s they thought they

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:29.610
looked good your mom made your dad at a

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.650
party and said I want his DNA to make

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.290
you to make you and that's the beautiful

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.510
part about it but anyway yet it's not

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:39.969
going to last forever and I am NOT

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:43.789
looking forward to the day where

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:45.499
clean-shaven this becomes the number-one

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:47.780
inventive your clean-shaven you can't

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:49.400
grow facial hair this is just how you oh

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.469
I didn't mean I'm in to hit spacebar

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.789
they're actually like you might be

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:55.729
growing up in this era and you can't

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:56.990
grow a mustache first off you're the

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:59.060
luckiest person in the world you just

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:01.009
don't realize it yet because you know

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:04.639
that means nothing for you it means you

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:07.969
can't grow facial hair with big deal you

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:12.349
know I'm not trying to insult you but if

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:14.389
you're if you're a clean-shaven person

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:16.430
or a follicularly challenged person in

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:17.629
an era where beards are in vogue it's

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.159
only bad because you don't have the

00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:22.279
option to make the stylistic choice you

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:24.229
want if you're a hairy person when you

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:26.090
know having a face as smooth as a baby's

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:28.159
bottom is in vogue you got to shave

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.870
every 45 minutes it adds a lot of

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:32.300
overhead to your work week is all I'm

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.589
saying so the other thing I'm trying to

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.169
say to you is don't sweat it because

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:38.569
you're going to one day you will reap

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:42.169
the benefit of your of your hormonal

00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:43.729
nature I promise you this because it

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:45.259
already have I already paid the price I

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:46.639
paid the price as a teenager now I'm

00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:49.610
reaping the benefits as a young adult

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:51.289
but yeah one day the the beards your to

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:53.659
say no they're not is the timeless look

00:07:51.289 --> 00:07:56.419
mmm not true trust me it's going to go

00:07:53.659 --> 00:08:00.919
out of fashion and we're all going to be

00:07:56.419 --> 00:08:02.300
sons of bitches basically I'm not

00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:04.610
looking forward to it because you know

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:08.199
trends change but you know what stays

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:11.389
the same convenience and being able to

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:15.800
justify some stubble is really really

00:08:11.389 --> 00:08:17.539
convenient it's nice I can't deny it we

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.919
have so much time here that I'm like

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:21.830
absolutely I'm going to come through

00:08:18.919 --> 00:08:23.180
this room we do have an extra why do we

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.039
have an extra devil chance to blow

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.020
something up must have blown something

00:08:25.039 --> 00:08:30.649
up or no way way black candle is just

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:33.909
like a raw chance increase I think well

00:08:30.649 --> 00:08:33.909
yeah you know those those are trends

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.719
trends come and go we've been in this

00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:44.690
like pseudo hipster thing for a while

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:46.760
and honestly I'm relatively for it and I

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:48.550
say that because hey I'm bald I have a

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:52.250
hairstyle that is somewhat associated

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:53.610
with you know at least trendiness right

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:55.320
now it's like a bowl

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:57.209
choice but really it's just because I

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.010
have male pattern baldness so I benefit

00:08:57.209 --> 00:09:01.410
I've got terrible eyes I wear thick

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:03.959
glasses those are sort of in so weirdly

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:07.980
enough I kind of like mr. Magoo back

00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:09.690
flipped into like being sort of trendy

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:12.149
even though I still dress like I'm 14

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:14.430
years old most of the time clean up nice

00:09:12.149 --> 00:09:16.079
sometimes though but that's going to

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:18.589
change dude I have these nightmares that

00:09:16.079 --> 00:09:21.180
like you know I'm going to wake up and

00:09:18.589 --> 00:09:24.690
kpop style is going to have taken over

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:28.279
the planet and that's like you know

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:32.100
compared to the average Korean boy band

00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:34.589
member I probably got like 60 pounds on

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.510
them can't grow any hair except in

00:09:34.589 --> 00:09:40.200
places that they don't have any hair

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:43.440
themselves I don't look good with a

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:47.010
tucked in shirt I don't look good with

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.720
the you know the Dame Edna glasses I got

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:51.480
a long way to go if I'm going to if I'm

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.310
going to hit standards of a male beauty

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:56.029
in that but you know maybe at that point

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:58.199
I'll be full-on dad build so it'll be I

00:09:56.029 --> 00:10:00.089
should I shouldn't worry about it that

00:09:58.199 --> 00:10:02.850
much because you know what's the

00:10:00.089 --> 00:10:05.760
timeless look for men is uh having the

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:07.410
backpack on the front leg over your

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.000
chest and stomach and then having a cute

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.800
little infant in the in the front of it

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.440
people go don't bother him he's a dad

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:16.070
he's doing bad stuff okay so we're just

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:20.130
going to take this get back out of Dodge

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:25.890
BFF would be nice this run is still very

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:29.070
very good I mean obviously it's still

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:32.120
very very good I don't think now that's

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:34.560
our first beelzebub in a blur I think I

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.880
also don't really care about playing an

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:40.920
arcade anymore but that'll change if I

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:42.810
get some HP on this floor I think I mean

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.329
I could play the blood bank right now

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:46.740
but I sort of I like the idea that we

00:10:45.329 --> 00:10:49.949
could use this for razor blade as well

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:51.630
by speaking of which the razor blade is

00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:53.399
actually like the best pick up that

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.300
we've had on this run first off is

00:10:53.399 --> 00:10:56.339
actually useful

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.589
whereas box of friends was basically not

00:10:56.339 --> 00:11:01.140
at least in the present moment they're

00:10:58.589 --> 00:11:04.589
good at the time but also at the present

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:07.910
moment beyond that it also allowed us to

00:11:04.589 --> 00:11:12.210
open up that

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:15.420
this room is new and scary it allowed me

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:16.890
to open up the mimic which I thought

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:20.150
gave me something good if I remember

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:23.550
correctly we can only play this once

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:26.630
sure you know what I'll play it a little

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:29.460
because it might be nice to get BFF but

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:32.280
beyond that it also allowed us to get

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:34.110
sack of sacks which will have a subtle

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.090
but important impact over the course of

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:37.860
the run like it really helps out a great

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:39.330
deal it's just the sort of thing where

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.280
you don't pick something up and then go

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.360
oh thanks sack of sacks you go oh my

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.180
luck is very good right now

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.710
instead I'll admit we could use

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:48.990
temperance to get like double blood bank

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:51.720
plays here but the kind of thing is like

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:53.940
you know we're we're like an aspiring

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:57.450
millionaire picking up dimes off the

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:59.370
street it's a weird look you know he's

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:02.370
like bill mr. Bill Gates you just sold

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:03.540
your company for a hundred million

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:05.430
dollars why are you picking up those

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:09.720
dimes off the street all money's money

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:11.820
you know people would write memes about

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:14.210
that I never lose your hunger but Bill

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:17.310
Gates that's not a good use of your time

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:19.110
you're picking up dimes I mean this now

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:21.390
sounds like I'm doing a hip hop lyric

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:23.060
but your work is picking up dimes too

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:28.290
except instead of dimes it's like

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:32.640
$10,000 bills don't get confused that's

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:34.860
not ten thousand one dollar bills that's

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:37.520
one bill that says ten thousand on it

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:41.730
it's got a picture of warren g harding

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:45.500
yeah that's right i know the historical

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:50.060
rankings of american presidents

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:52.070
I always like whenever I look at

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:54.140
historical rankings and this happens

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:55.930
more often than you expect of American

00:12:54.140 --> 00:13:00.730
presidents in my head I'm always like

00:12:55.930 --> 00:13:03.260
warren g harding is consensus number one

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:04.190
he's the worst president in US history

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
what did he do

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:08.030
ah you know he was he was like crony

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.710
like with his business on her friends

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:11.000
and then don't worry this isn't the

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:13.160
current event

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.290
he was crony like with his business on

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.820
her friends and then like he was pretty

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:19.070
much useless and it didn't really

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:20.420
accomplish anything and then he left a

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:21.560
bad legacy and I'm like how could you

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:25.130
get worse than that and then you're like

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:27.230
Oh James Buchanan basically started the

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:30.530
American Civil War or laid the

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:32.960
foundation for it and then when you take

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:37.700
care of this and pass it off to Abraham

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:40.280
Lincoln is like actually what isn't

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.660
quite like a you you fire me no I quit

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.980
it I'm gonna mess things up before I

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:48.740
leave sort of moment but it's sort of

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:50.300
close you know I'll tell you what we

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:57.830
might as well temper on stay here a

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:59.810
little bit little scary but 15 cents is

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:01.460
good I'm not going to get BFF though the

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:03.589
gold I'd rather just save it and buy

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:08.930
something a little bit more virile in

00:14:03.589 --> 00:14:12.050
the future it's like being Neville

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:13.850
Chamberlain right like it we I wasn't

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:17.750
alive obviously at the genesis of the

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:19.520
Second World War but you know that your

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:21.650
legacy is messed up as a politician

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.210
fairly or otherwise and admittedly I

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:27.500
don't have enough of a grasp of the

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:30.020
situation to save say either way with

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:34.190
nuance or with with confidence I guess

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:36.710
but you know he will always for the rest

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:38.150
of history that cares about this air

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:41.510
he's gonna be the guy who was like yeah

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:45.080
okay you go for it just but nothing else

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:46.640
okay like James Buchanan apparently sort

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.320
of falls in the same camp although I got

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:53.570
no idea anyway one second we got a

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:57.170
message here hmm oh yes this I'm aware

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:58.950
yeah it's a NIC saying he's not going to

00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:01.230
be on the show today because he has to

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:02.550
his girlfriend at the airport that's you

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:06.589
know you're too kind you don't have to

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:06.589
be apologetic about that things come up

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:12.690
actually could you tell Aer Lingus to

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:17.579
delay the flight a little bit we got a

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:20.310
show to run here I have nothing against

00:15:17.579 --> 00:15:21.870
Ireland and this is an easy joke I don't

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:25.560
feel good about making it it's a it's a

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:28.320
hack joke but really like I could see

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:30.209
calling it Aer Lingus like a hundred

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:33.329
years ago even though the word I'm sure

00:15:30.209 --> 00:15:35.820
still had the same connotations but in

00:15:33.329 --> 00:15:40.170
today's era you can't be calling your

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:41.790
airline Aer Lingus it's I almost don't

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:43.769
care how like it oh it's got traditional

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:46.709
Gaelic meaning or something like that I

00:15:43.769 --> 00:15:47.100
mean as cool okay I'm sorry wait wait

00:15:46.709 --> 00:15:50.639
wait

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:54.329
I'm not trying to be insulting at all

00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:55.610
here is Gaelic Irish is that the one

00:15:54.329 --> 00:15:58.589
because I thought there was like another

00:15:55.610 --> 00:16:00.690
there's also Celtic but a Celtic might

00:15:58.589 --> 00:16:03.300
be a tradition as opposed to a language

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:04.920
I think it's Gaelic anyway if it's a

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:07.170
traditional Gaelic word then that's cool

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:11.640
okay I'm not telling you you can't have

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:16.740
the word but like you know if in my

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:18.690
language fellatio meant love well that's

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:22.170
the universal language of biology if in

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:25.649
my language fellatio meant like progress

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:27.510
and I was like it's err pilate's you

00:16:25.649 --> 00:16:29.279
know I would expect people to be like

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:31.079
you can respect your own cultural

00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:33.690
traditions but your airline has a silly

00:16:31.079 --> 00:16:35.490
name maybe it's working for them though

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:38.820
and then in the modern era maybe Aer

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:40.199
Lingus gets more traffic than you'd

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:42.870
expect as a result of their name I've

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:46.970
heard I've never flown with Aer Lingus

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:50.279
I think they predominantly do do haha

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:53.670
Ireland - ex and ex2 Ireland flights and

00:16:50.279 --> 00:16:54.390
I've never been to Ireland so I haven't

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:56.069
had the chance

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:57.810
it's like Iceland dare you ever flown

00:16:56.069 --> 00:17:00.180
Iceland there if you have been to

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:01.949
Iceland the answer is yes if you have

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:04.079
not been to Iceland the answer is no

00:17:01.949 --> 00:17:06.750
unless you caught maybe a connection

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:09.919
that later went to Iceland that you were

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:09.919
not going on but anyway

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:16.319
you get the idea why I'd never go to

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:20.039
Ireland well time never just I don't

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:21.629
know why I would I think Ireland is a

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:23.659
place that I would go like with my

00:17:21.629 --> 00:17:26.009
parents that's not to say that it's a

00:17:23.659 --> 00:17:31.379
country for people who are in their 50s

00:17:26.009 --> 00:17:34.919
just like that's a vacation that you as

00:17:31.379 --> 00:17:37.649
a native English speaker you can take

00:17:34.919 --> 00:17:41.730
when you're older because it's not that

00:17:37.649 --> 00:17:43.169
risky and now it's we're getting you

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:44.490
know like borderline offensive I'm not

00:17:43.169 --> 00:17:45.899
judging the country I'm just saying

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:48.330
you're going from one english-speaking

00:17:45.899 --> 00:17:49.769
country to another country that speaks

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:52.860
English but as different customs and

00:17:49.769 --> 00:17:55.139
traditions that's a low risk trip you

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:59.730
know you're not like hey I'm going to

00:17:55.139 --> 00:18:01.110
Thailand where I might not be able to

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:02.429
get around although I assume that you

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:03.299
know knowing the people I know who have

00:18:02.429 --> 00:18:05.129
been to Thailand

00:18:03.299 --> 00:18:09.200
you could probably hack it out if you

00:18:05.129 --> 00:18:11.999
add to it let me put it aside going to

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.259
like Cote d'Ivoire or something like

00:18:11.999 --> 00:18:14.610
that you know you're what are you gonna

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:16.019
do in Ireland now we're gonna see some

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.820
historical stuff we're going to be at

00:18:16.019 --> 00:18:19.409
the pubs we're going to oh there's the

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.399
Blarney Stone okay and then we're good

00:18:19.409 --> 00:18:23.700
like that was fun

00:18:20.399 --> 00:18:25.379
nothing wrong with it but as a young

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:29.820
person who still has the slightest bit

00:18:25.379 --> 00:18:31.350
of adventurousness in my body I like

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:35.879
going places that are a little bit less

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:37.049
domestic not quite like I'm not the kind

00:18:35.879 --> 00:18:39.240
of guy who's like let's go to Cambodia

00:18:37.049 --> 00:18:40.919
and ride on an elephant or like let's

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:43.190
live in the Australian bush for a week

00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:43.190
but

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:51.170
experiencing a wildly different cultures

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:55.580
is cool and a luxury admittedly but okay

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:56.960
okay okay magic mushrooms important I

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:57.740
was starting to feel like this run had

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.720
stalled

00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:02.300
ever so slightly now we're actually

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:04.490
temporarily this is really bad because

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:08.000
our HP was a driving factor for us here

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:10.730
when our damage hasn't been 10 out of 10

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.680
it's like 8 right now but this obviously

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:17.510
gives us a great ability to become guppy

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:21.860
and if I'm being know now if I'm being

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:23.270
straight up with you I will move heaven

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:28.930
and earth to become guppy

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:31.610
because it hasn't happened recently I

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:34.900
hope I'm not in the minority on that

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:37.520
like there are places that I would go

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:39.980
with my wife that I would not go with my

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.240
parents and I think kind of like well

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.980
not not wouldn't go but I would prefer

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:46.330
to go with like different company and

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:51.020
the same kind of applies like in Reverse

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:53.150
because I think like if my my parents

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:55.040
have a desire at some point to go you

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:58.160
know do the UK tour like Scotland

00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:00.020
Ireland possibly England as well what

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.580
about Wales I'm going to be honest with

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.930
you and this is not meant as an insult I

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:04.400
come from a small country as well I'm

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:06.920
not sure that they know that Wales is a

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:09.590
country they're doing well in their

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:11.120
lives they're not you know geography

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:14.330
majors they might know that Wales is a

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:16.850
country they might think it's a Duchy or

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:19.420
something and historically that has been

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:23.870
the case Oh at times but I'm just saying

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:25.250
it's not really their wheelhouse but I

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:27.460
think that Kate's not that interested in

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:31.820
that kate is much more like you know

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:33.650
let's go to like I don't know Croatia or

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:36.440
something like that and I would I would

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:37.610
much rather go to Croatia with my wife

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:39.140
especially if she's going to have the

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:41.060
phrase book handy and I can just sort of

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:43.300
sit back and eat though fully delicious

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:43.300
foods

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:51.940
I don't know this is a dead-end

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.590
conversation maybe other people don't

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.570
feel the same way I guess it depends on

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:57.130
you know the kind of family you come

00:20:55.570 --> 00:21:00.539
from it might surprise you I come from a

00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:03.909
family that's relatively risk-averse

00:21:00.539 --> 00:21:06.640
this is like a genuine thing that I'm

00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:08.650
about to tell you in the whole time of

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.929
my youth like the entire time I lived

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:17.289
with my parents I never saw them take a

00:21:10.929 --> 00:21:20.620
vacation that was more than like when I

00:21:17.289 --> 00:21:21.789
was 21 we all went to Las Vegas we are

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:25.000
going to give ourselves a crack at boss

00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:26.440
rush here when I was 21 we went to Las

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.580
Vegas which was like a five-hour flight

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:32.169
for my hometown but apart from that like

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:34.360
every year when I was growing up it was

00:21:32.169 --> 00:21:35.770
like okay we're gonna go to like Ottawa

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:38.200
we're going to go to Toronto you know

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:39.610
two to three hours away by car and that

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.900
was going to be like their vacation and

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:43.390
I'm like they've done well for

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:45.280
themselves they just never really were

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:47.140
adventurous in the travel department and

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.929
they're getting into it now they're a

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:51.309
little bit older not and now honestly

00:21:49.929 --> 00:21:53.440
now they don't the raise this scumbag

00:21:51.309 --> 00:21:56.320
right here they got more more time and

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.909
more money I'm sure but you know always

00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:01.179
look back on that or I'm like wow for

00:21:57.909 --> 00:22:04.539
like and it's a fairly common experience

00:22:01.179 --> 00:22:06.850
I think but like for 20 years like you

00:22:04.539 --> 00:22:08.740
win not that far away from our hometown

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:11.320
that's that's admirable that you put

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:12.669
your lives aside to to raise me but I

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:17.380
think that also there's an element of

00:22:12.669 --> 00:22:19.630
like genetically I know them and if I

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:22.030
didn't have an exterior force being like

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:23.679
hey let's go like somewhere exotic I'd

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:25.330
be like I can just stay home tonight why

00:22:23.679 --> 00:22:28.600
don't we just watch a movie you know

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:34.240
that's built into my DNA on a

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:39.850
fundamental level as well I don't know

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:41.710
man what is this I'm excited but I think

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:44.200
that's like fairly common like in the in

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:46.690
my hometown or at least you know I went

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:48.460
to a school that was very very small it

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:49.840
was kind of just like a school that

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.309
collected people that didn't really fit

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:54.100
into other school districts that were

00:22:51.309 --> 00:22:55.990
nearby and it was like hey it's Spring

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.100
Break what are you doing and everybody

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:59.110
in the class was like

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:01.360
and saying you know with my grandma for

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:03.429
a week instead of going to school and

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.660
then there would be like one person

00:23:03.429 --> 00:23:08.710
they'd be like we're driving to Florida

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:10.320
and we'd be like what Florida that's

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:13.210
crazy

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:15.660
that was too fast that shot speed was

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:15.660
too fast

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:25.870
now you're picturing like where I grew

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:27.640
up is like that picture of the lady from

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:31.120
the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:32.919
he's got like you know sand on her lips

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.690
because it's so dry like there's no

00:23:32.919 --> 00:23:36.039
water anywhere anyway that's not really

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:42.000
what it was like it's just a more

00:23:36.039 --> 00:23:42.000
domestic the domestic sort of town

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:47.230
there's nothing wrong with it it's just

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:48.700
that it's just different but it's not

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:51.340
different for a lot of people just you

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:53.049
know normal and it was normal at the

00:23:51.340 --> 00:24:01.419
time as well as still as normal in this

00:23:53.049 --> 00:24:03.130
day please stop being excited not you

00:24:01.419 --> 00:24:06.700
watching this video I need you to be

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:08.830
excited so we can you know sell

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:10.510
impressions to advertisers basically and

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:17.500
also so you have a good impression of me

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:21.940
as a person let's go just I don't

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:24.490
understand why I look at this run and I

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:27.640
go it's kind of like not that good

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:29.380
like we're just missing one over-the-top

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.669
Sylvester Stallone element here to

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.830
really bring it home I think and

00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:34.600
obviously like the easy one is guppy

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:37.299
which is why I'm holding the Joker card

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:39.039
right now hoping that if we don't get a

00:24:37.299 --> 00:24:41.590
deal with the devil we can make this

00:24:39.039 --> 00:24:43.480
joker card work for us the ideal is

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:47.169
actually that we don't get a deal with

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:48.460
the devil because then we can use our

00:24:47.169 --> 00:24:49.630
Joker card on this floor we'll have a

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.799
hundred percent chance to get a deal

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:52.480
with the devil on the next floor

00:24:50.799 --> 00:24:54.309
assuming we don't take red heart damage

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.929
which actually is possible with nine

00:24:54.309 --> 00:25:02.080
lives that we take red heart damage and

00:24:55.929 --> 00:25:03.610
live and then we can carry our yarra

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.290
room without worrying that we're costing

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:07.120
ourselves a devil deal overall well at

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:08.830
this point you might as well Joker and

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.600
we get came being conception which

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:20.110
honestly I think is basically free right

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:23.770
now here's the deal I'm going to take

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:28.270
the Joker instead of the era and it's

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:34.500
I've almost like slided backwards into

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:38.320
being scared of this run again as

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:40.299
strange as this might sound the run is

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:46.020
okay come on

00:25:40.299 --> 00:25:49.450
but the Year Arun is for free items of

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:52.240
you know unknown qualities they could be

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:56.590
amazing it could be horrible the devil

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:58.330
deal is zero to three items that are

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:59.200
from a better pool we can't guarantee

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:01.360
that they're good but they're from a

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:05.710
better pool so I actually think we need

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:07.539
to go mildly risk-averse here with one

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:11.470
and a half spirit arts I think that it

00:26:07.539 --> 00:26:14.380
might be wise for us to play very very

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:16.659
slightly more conservatively we didn't

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:20.919
get a deal that's wonderful news so now

00:26:16.659 --> 00:26:22.659
we can actually assuming we live long

00:26:20.919 --> 00:26:24.640
enough we can actually get a guaranteed

00:26:22.659 --> 00:26:26.860
deal on this floor like the womb - and

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:29.350
then we can get the Joker card to work

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:31.030
for us on the cathedral and our guppy

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:33.520
odds are just sodas I mean they're 100

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:35.440
actually so disregard all right now I am

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:41.049
no longer afraid at all so I'm the Joker

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:43.030
card out we could have handled that

00:26:41.049 --> 00:26:45.760
differently we could have like died and

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:47.169
then taking the same or like taking the

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:50.140
same to die and then pick up those

00:26:47.169 --> 00:26:53.159
spirit arts but I'm fine with this as

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:55.750
well the asain pick up is really just

00:26:53.159 --> 00:26:57.100
it's like future proofing the run the

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:58.659
idea is we get hit we get permanent

00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:05.650
polaroid invincibility we get a good

00:26:58.659 --> 00:27:10.120
time to pop these devil hearts here yeah

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:11.980
I think like I'm not a very and this

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:13.870
won't surprise no one I'm not a very

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:17.590
thrill-seeking person I've you know done

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:19.480
many landmark Isak episodes that I hope

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:20.710
resonated with the non thrill-seekers

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.720
out there where I said like you know

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:24.130
everyone's always society pushes this

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:26.290
idea that like the

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:29.170
tonic ideal is I'm not afraid of

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:30.850
skydiving but I don't buy it I think

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:32.920
some people like thrill-seeking and they

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:34.990
find value there and for other people

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:38.710
like it's not that I'm necessarily

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:44.350
afraid of dying while skydiving at all

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:48.370
it's that I just don't feel I don't

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:49.810
enjoy the terror of following like when

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:51.460
even when I'm on a roller coaster I

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:54.310
don't have that much fun and people

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:56.920
roast me for it and that's why I present

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:58.540
it but at the same time like when the

00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.670
roller coaster is going down the drop

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:02.260
I'm not like this is fun I'm like oh I

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:04.330
have an unpleasant feeling in my body

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:06.190
right now I don't derive enjoyment from

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:08.680
that and maybe maybe that is genuinely

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:10.240
unusual but I'm not trying to think we

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:13.660
should abolish all rollercoasters my

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:15.580
problem is you know Kate will be like we

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.570
should go skydiving and I'm like tell

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:20.020
you what if you think you would enjoy

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:22.480
skydiving you go skydiving I'll Drive

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:25.450
you there and then she's like no that

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:28.750
wouldn't be fun thrill-seeking always

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:31.120
depends on marginalizing someone who

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:33.010
doesn't want to thrill seek nobody ever

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.610
wants to do it alone it's kind of it's

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:36.460
so fun

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:37.360
why don't we see more solo skydivers you

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:39.220
know people are like yeah you just take

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:43.150
me up but just like to get a couple of

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:45.760
runs in year instead you know I got to

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:48.460
go and like have an incredibly

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:50.380
unpleasant Excellus experience somebody

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:52.330
can do in their whole life it's like

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:54.160
yeah all subject my body to the abject

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:55.630
emotional terror that it thinks it's

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:58.740
dying if it'll make your day a little

00:28:55.630 --> 00:29:03.940
bit better it's too much man I can't I

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:05.770
can't do it consistently but you

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:08.110
understood the other thing is like I'm

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:10.510
very content and even as a child I was

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:12.010
very content yeah hey it's your day off

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:17.440
you want to do something special that's

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:19.960
thinking I would just read for like 600

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:21.700
minutes but if you got plans and you

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.470
want to like take me along that'd be

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:25.870
cool as well you know let's see what we

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:28.530
got going on yeah let's do it

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:30.970
we're still gulping so who cares right

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:33.130
we didn't get a second transformation we

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:36.440
got tiny planet all of our stats went

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:39.140
down this is

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:41.420
that's Jacob's Ladder which seems really

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:44.540
bad with tiny planet we do have a holy

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:46.820
mantle I see as well I say Jacob's

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:50.750
Ladder seems bad because it only pops

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:51.350
the red joker cargo it's just gone

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:55.610
forever

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:57.530
it only pops the Jacob's Ladder

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:58.820
electricity when the tears die so it's

00:29:57.530 --> 00:30:00.890
going to take a million years for that

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:02.660
to happen here obviously let's try to

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:05.120
get bookworm going on it's not a

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:07.460
honestly like not a great run on the

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:09.320
reroll but because we're got the at bad

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:11.750
and holy mantle obviously protects us

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:13.610
nicely as well I don't even want to take

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:18.440
the Bible because I know that we could

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:19.910
die if you pop the Bible against Isaac I

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:22.010
think you die instantly it's been a

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:26.060
while since that is factored into my

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:33.190
existence whatsoever but you know

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:35.810
something to think about anyway as

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:39.730
always I want to I want to let you know

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:39.730
if you're if you're not a thrill-seeker

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:47.480
society is lying to you you know you

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:49.310
don't if you if you feel the pressure to

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:52.130
go bungee jump and go skydiving if you

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:54.410
are a thrill seeker by all means dude go

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:56.480
be Felix Baumgartner see if I care I'm

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:59.480
happy for you genuinely the little

00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:04.130
jealous of them being honest I like that

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:07.550
that emotion for some reason but if

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:11.150
you're like I'd rather just read what's

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:12.860
more exciting skydiving or reading

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:15.440
Charlotte brontë's Wuthering Heights

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:17.210
well it is a high action thrill ride you

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.170
know like that's me so I understand

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:22.090
where you're coming from

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:22.090
don't let the side to get you down man

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:31.510
okay we're so slow right now speed up

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:35.500
please host pay toxic shock ghost pepper

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:37.900
ads just like you know it is what it is

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:40.580
they're fine

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:43.460
thanks to tiny planet we will probably

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:46.810
never land a successful ghost pepper

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:46.810
shot but we might get lucky

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:57.670
please honestly a 10 out of 10 item for

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.670
us right now is sac dagger

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:11.090
we have sad bombs no we do not have sad

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:15.320
bombs I'm begging you stop leaving that

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:17.060
never should have taken that long sac

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:19.120
dagger is the moneymaker especially with

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:21.680
holy mantle we should be popping it

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:23.810
constantly there we go I knew we were

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:25.550
like we had one item for Beelzebub

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:28.190
already so all we needed after getting

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:31.760
that was one to have come into existence

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:37.310
via the transformation so we're said in

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:40.040
that department oh it's been a little

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:42.680
bit of a I wouldn't say a bad Isaac run

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:45.860
at all I mean it's been so safe that

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:49.070
I've been able to just go off on weird

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:54.530
commentary for a while hear how to jump

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:59.180
is actually fine here epic fetus okay

00:32:54.530 --> 00:33:04.280
well that like makes the run fairly

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:09.170
substantially less interesting but no no

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:10.700
less strong admittedly still think sac

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:16.970
daggers like the best damage you look

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:19.160
for us we have a ripp nod leaf it's not

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:20.600
like it matters like we had 25 different

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:27.860
ways to win the run at this point but

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:30.380
just a surprise apparently epic foetus

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:33.470
is like just absolute garbage with

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:35.480
Guppies that seems to be the general

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:38.690
gist of things here just let me fight

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:43.750
blue baby we just got a run into him the

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:43.750
runs over its borderline on loser bull

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:52.360
Bob's brain irrelevant

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:56.049
I'm just like I'm dying here with this

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:56.049
0.76 speed man

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:07.880
so I mean we should if we get another

00:34:06.139 --> 00:34:10.099
spirit art we should pop suicide King

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:11.569
because we can get you know it's

00:34:10.099 --> 00:34:13.190
basically like having a yarrow rune

00:34:11.569 --> 00:34:15.589
that's going to cost us a lot of HP and

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:25.310
possibly ruin our run so as far as I'm

00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:27.470
concerned that's a win-win how sad that

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:31.849
we can fly but we're using how to jump

00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:37.129
to go fast it's an embarrassment alright

00:34:31.849 --> 00:34:42.230
so we suicide Kings because there's a

00:34:37.129 --> 00:34:44.960
spirit hard got mom's knife what the

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:48.200
heck is going on with these okay that's

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:52.069
pretty cool admittedly but what a

00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:55.970
strange series of combination still

00:34:52.069 --> 00:34:59.030
mom's knife has saved us from from

00:34:55.970 --> 00:35:02.829
boredom to some extent although we are

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:02.829
about to finish this run regardless oh

00:35:03.609 --> 00:35:15.710
my god 0.46 speed I'm trying to land the

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:19.220
shots so that mom's knife just cuts him

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:21.920
up means we don't want a direct tip we

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:23.540
want to just slightly be off-center and

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:25.280
we're going to get the win here I will

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:27.920
not do delirium even if they offer it

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:29.030
because 0.46 speed is an active war for

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.079
now thanks for watching hope you enjoyed
