00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.040
everybody welcome back i'm northernlion

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.049
I'm a little mad about the way the both

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.540
of those own and streak attempts worked

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.200
we're on the Guardian oh this I remember

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:17.550
this it's Guardian spear and then XR o

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.850
7p nhf oh dude I totally totally

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:27.449
remember this because it's nonsense

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:33.000
Oh No so the Guardian we have to protect

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:36.780
at all times which for a lot of enemies

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.210
is gonna be completely okay but for some

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.790
enemies is gonna be quite literally

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.579
nearly impossible enemies that rush us

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.920
down enemies that shoot beams or enemies

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.320
that drop things from the ceiling are

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.960
more or less gonna be a crapshoot to see

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.449
if we have basically any chance I mean

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.440
what can I do there to see if we have

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.079
any chance to escape their clutches I

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.699
wouldn't get your hopes up too high but

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.890
honestly after the last run that we just

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.900
did that onand streak one not the one

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.850
where I ruined it cuz that one you know

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.280
I take responsibility for going to boss

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.960
rush there and then losing my ability to

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.530
teleport which may we might have lost

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.270
anyway but certainly that was not the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.479
right way to handle it to put it

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.340
succinctly that was very very close

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.840
actually an orbital might help us out

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.479
quite a lot here because we're immune to

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.079
damage if we can just walk into enemies

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.610
that are trying to walk into Isaac's

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.329
heart we might be in a much better

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.600
position

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.180
it wouldn't hurt too much if you chose

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.670
to follow me I know that like I'm your

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.229
guardian I suppose the reality of the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:49.490
situation is that I should be following

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:51.810
you but I'm sure

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.070
trying to kind of skirt around those

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.080
requirements at the present moment

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.880
you're annoying me a great deal and your

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.650
inability even if you just stood the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.390
entrance to the room I'd have a better

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.310
chance to protect you I think just try

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.640
not to wander into enemies that's like

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.320
you know step number one uh okay I'm

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.470
gonna buy the spirit heart to give us a

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.210
great deal with the devil plus like just

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.630
survival chance that's right just keep

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.630
him

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:19.380
just keep him back we'll be back we got

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.860
him I think we have no item rooms on

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.209
this one uh we could have used a nickel

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.000
there to give us a better chance of

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.470
getting yeah we got it these these are

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.730
both pretty big right here you could

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.000
have used a nickel there for a better

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.170
chance of getting a sack boy which I

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.330
think could be a very very meaningful

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.440
pickup for us but these are actually

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.090
good gifts right now

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.370
guppies head gives us more hurtin power

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.990
and Lord knows we need it because

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.930
that'll give us the ability to kill

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.890
enemies before they could even get to

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.140
the thing that we're trying to guard

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.959
here I don't know what I'm supposed to

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:59.250
do about that bomb the other thing is

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:00.810
that the wait a minute yeah guppies head

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.760
is the other one dark bomb is the is the

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.110
one that we got that's also gonna be

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.070
very meaningful especially if we can get

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.810
our luck up there

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.519
turning red hearts into spirit hearts

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.290
good modicum of protection for ourselves

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.600
and I got high hopes that that'll lead

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.010
to success in the in the short term and

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.269
hopefully the long term as well we got

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:23.070
the 15 cents exactly Bar None 20 cents

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:25.080
now so we should buy a sack boy comes

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:29.430
with a free sack which is a 5/7 value at

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.830
the very least on average at least give

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.549
us a bomb six flies I'll check the card

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.910
the card is temperance I I think we

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:42.360
might be able to play that thing I

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.280
really really thought we would just be

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.959
able to play temperance forever because

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.940
we have technically Isaac's heart but

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.519
apparently not dark bomb you got that

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.989
one okay we're still kind of living on

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.269
the edge like an Aerosmith song here but

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.580
I think we got a good foundation I've

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:00.030
lost Guardian runs in the past because I

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.900
remember the specific examples very very

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.980
very well unfortunately

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.709
because they were particularly

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.110
noteworthy for a I mean what can you do

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.390
about that basically when you have the

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.360
mom fight mom just steps on the Guardian

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.010
so you're just screwed in that case

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.769
thank you for the extra spirit heart and

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.479
a teleport card as well so that confirms

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.740
if we weren't confirming it already that

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:26.860
there are no there are no item rooms on

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.540
this run because we did not teleport to

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.970
an item room I think we're just gonna

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.169
try to you know the son cards great but

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.000
I think we're mostly trying to just buy

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.510
spirit hearts keep ourselves in the game

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.889
here and really trying to run down the

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.820
clock on this one I think we've got a

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:44.050
great situation all we need to do is uh

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.260
make sure that we don't ruin this great

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.210
situation by acting needlessly

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.190
aggressively throwing HP away for no

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.990
reason in many ways this kind of feels

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.430
like the perfect run for me because I

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.289
can get an orbital and just run into

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.260
enemies without worrying about my HP

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:03.010
being compromised so maybe I'm being

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:04.120
needlessly kind of about the whole run

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.130
when we're actually in a pretty good

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.960
spot I don't know maybe maybe not the

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:13.180
Guardian I think I've got a bias against

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:15.220
it but the bias is not based on fiction

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.930
the bias is based on the fact that we've

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.389
done this run before and had it ruined

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.160
by bad things but honestly I'm primed to

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.080
like some challenges more than the first

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.280
times we did them I think based on the

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.539
fact that I hate some of these

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.970
challenges more than the first time I

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:30.849
did them as well so you know turnabout

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:35.199
is fair play oh how the turntables as

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:38.080
they say now good you didn't walk into

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:40.270
that I appreciate it two keys has given

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.610
us a range upgrade that couldn't be

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.080
worth less but there's our two keys back

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.510
so everything from this point onwards is

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.449
just gravy and this is really the value

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:52.810
of Sackboy right here is allowing us to

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:55.240
get way more than we bargained for out

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:58.750
of out of way less we can fly as well I

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.729
don't know why I'm neglecting to take

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.550
advantage that on a more regular basis

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:05.289
yeah I've said this on the last two runs

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.370
on the last 209 streak runs and probably

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:07.930
on every challenge that we've done

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.150
you're probably getting a little sick of

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.950
it but I think we're good I think we got

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.170
a good chance to win this one

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.000
this one even more so because it only

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.860
goes to mom's heart as far as I'm

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.540
concerned we're like you know couple

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:24.560
Emperor cards away from an easy victory

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:28.370
here hey would you mind just staying

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:31.970
close to me like I'm trying to skirt the

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.920
line between protecting you but also

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.120
like actively seeking out enemies so

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.430
they have no chance to knock you down

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.290
this was one of the knock your HP down I

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:42.080
should say but this is one of the cooler

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.670
challenges in terms of like design it's

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.860
nice to revisit it you know a couple of

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.890
years later and remind ourselves that

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.720
see like if you don't actively go out

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.580
and seek them before they get to you

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.170
they're just gonna get to you anyway

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.900
it's not like you win by just waiting

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.190
for them to get there and like

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:02.930
especially here we got to take out this

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:04.940
portal would it kill you to dodge I'm

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.500
trying not to be ungrateful here but you

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:10.690
know when a shot comes in I don't even

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.690
say an actively dodge just move

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:17.030
maybe we're not quite as well protected

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.050
as I had originally assumed but you know

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.970
what that's just gonna make it all the

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:25.100
more interesting as we continue to move

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:26.990
along here still got the Sun card more

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.030
looking for like a Nine Lives sort of

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:32.000
guppy ish situation here because I think

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:34.610
our end game probably has something to

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.920
do no red hearts our end game probably

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:40.220
has something to do with that well

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:42.770
that's fine just killing every enemy in

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:45.920
a room before we ever have to deal with

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:48.200
any of the enemies on the room but we'll

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.850
see if that if that pipe dream has any

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.100
chance to become real as we continue to

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:54.440
progress here making good time but we're

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.300
making good time on every single one of

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:59.330
these runs so it's not really like

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:04.880
that's not a revelation 20:12 or

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:07.760
otherwise that's reroll well and nothing

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:11.020
else here is so right right right we're

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.020
protecting this guy my bad

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.970
tears down something's wrong neither of

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:19.160
those are really good

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:20.900
HP upgrade is very good and also you

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.000
know gives us the added advantage of

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.710
having

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.590
more value out of our son card here

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:33.340
which we will go back for dust Li not a

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:36.900
second secret room 48 hour energy lovely

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:39.430
item plenty of flies we're doing okay I

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.659
do think I took a lot of damage that I'm

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:43.419
a little disappointed but there you know

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:45.040
what would be big for us is BFF and you

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:45.940
no pun not intended but sure I'll take

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:50.620
it

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:53.530
I want BFF because again if our orbital

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:55.360
could actually kill enemies before they

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.220
have any chance to do anything then as

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.880
far as I'm concerned like we're gravy

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.170
we're golden

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.480
we're gravy is not the way that

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:03.900
expression works to lows thinking we

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:10.570
local come on homie we gravy we gravy

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:12.340
come on homie we gravy we gravy on these

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:14.380
rooms obviously it's working out but you

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:19.050
know it's really up to the enemies at

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:22.510
this point please get away if the enemy

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:24.040
actively tracks down the Guardian were

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:25.840
in trouble like these fires could cause

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.580
big problems that lump of coal by the

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:31.540
way I'm assuming is totally useless here

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:32.950
if they don't actively seek the enemy we

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.570
can usually kill them before they have

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:36.040
any chance to get to us but straight up

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:40.000
on some of these rooms I actually feel

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:41.710
like we have no chance with the current

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.570
equipment that we've got just kick it

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:44.920
right into him Smart Play at least we

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:47.350
didn't take damage but it looked like we

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:50.770
would like this room I think we just got

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:51.910
a try to get a little lucky any time we

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:54.760
don't take damage on a room where

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:56.920
enemies can can hit us from afar we got

00:09:54.760 --> 00:10:00.670
to just say thank you basically so I

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:03.550
think we do get rid of Guppies Guppies

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:05.080
head here in favor of Satanic Bible we

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:08.520
got bookworm which is irrelevant but

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:11.470
we're kind of in a race against time and

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.900
how do we give ourselves more time well

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:20.070
we give ourselves more HP how do we give

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:22.270
ourselves more HP Satanic Bible copy

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:25.089
maybe they're immune to bombs I'm not

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:28.839
nope took damage for sure or not

00:10:25.089 --> 00:10:31.330
actually I'm not not fully convinced but

00:10:28.839 --> 00:10:33.730
the what am I trying to say here the

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:35.279
Sackboy pickup also is going to give us

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.660
like a huge advantage here

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:41.009
it's probably gonna give us more battery

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:43.050
charges than we otherwise deserve and as

00:10:41.009 --> 00:10:45.360
a result I mean you saw that pay off

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:48.749
right there but as a result we should be

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.730
able to generate a ton of demon hearts

00:10:48.749 --> 00:10:53.249
of these demon hearts are very valuable

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:55.050
for us at accomplishing what we want I

00:10:53.249 --> 00:10:56.550
think we will take chaos just to mess

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:59.249
with it and and really this is a big

00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:00.180
moment I've got in front of the bomb I

00:10:59.249 --> 00:11:03.329
did what I could

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:08.730
no no no oh I'm mad at myself that time

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:10.680
can you just get away either way chaos

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:13.350
plus like this restock machine here

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:15.449
gives us an amazing chance of getting

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:22.199
some items that were actually very happy

00:11:15.449 --> 00:11:24.089
with copy items of course are the big

00:11:22.199 --> 00:11:26.550
ones I don't think we really care about

00:11:24.089 --> 00:11:30.499
that we're almost at full HP when you

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:33.720
consider the when you consider the

00:11:30.499 --> 00:11:34.980
batteries that we left outside so I'm

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.709
not too worried about buying that stuff

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:39.809
either I'll definitely buy HP I'll

00:11:37.709 --> 00:11:41.639
definitely buy this card again I don't

00:11:39.809 --> 00:11:44.250
think the science does anything for us

00:11:41.639 --> 00:11:45.600
so we're up to 99 bombs that's looking

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.740
great we don't even need to go back for

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.850
the battery charger because we're so

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:52.199
close to full HP that have spirit hard

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:56.809
unlikely to make a difference if it does

00:11:52.199 --> 00:12:03.779
we're in we're in the danger zone as is

00:11:56.809 --> 00:12:05.459
and now deals with the devil certainly

00:12:03.779 --> 00:12:08.579
mean a lot less but I'd still like them

00:12:05.459 --> 00:12:12.829
compass is great I really I think we're

00:12:08.579 --> 00:12:12.829
set oh I got rid of the Sun card dang it

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.820
in spite of all that though I think

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.350
we're in a very very good spot

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.940
I don't think we need guppy but nine

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:26.029
lives might be nice cuz it will also

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:27.829
still preserve our spirit hearts we're

00:12:26.029 --> 00:12:31.010
kind of like we've got a ton of momentum

00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:33.620
right now and I kind of needed this cuz

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:34.940
I still love playing Isaac the reason

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:37.430
the series is around us cuz I love

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:41.810
playing it it's like a sheer force of

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:43.160
will at this point got be pleased but

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:45.310
like I'll level with you

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:49.519
alright we don't take damage because of

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:51.709
because of the Isaac's heart there I do

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:53.570
view the challenges not all of them some

00:12:51.709 --> 00:12:55.220
of them I quite like but some of the

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:57.260
challenges I definitely view is like a

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:59.930
necessary evil like we've got to

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:01.279
complete this challenge in order to go

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:04.130
back to my favorite part of the game

00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:05.329
which is playing it with everything

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:06.709
unlocked and you might say you don't

00:13:05.329 --> 00:13:09.079
have to play it like you don't have to

00:13:06.709 --> 00:13:10.820
do the challenges but I like to have the

00:13:09.079 --> 00:13:12.260
full experience so I like to have

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:14.779
everything unlocked and truth be told

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:17.000
doing all these once is not really a big

00:13:14.779 --> 00:13:20.779
deal it's not like a crime against

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.180
humanity but I was waiting I felt like

00:13:20.779 --> 00:13:25.190
we've had disproportionately poor luck

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:27.199
for a while as we've been trying to do

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:29.089
these this one on the other hand has

00:13:27.199 --> 00:13:34.069
been very very good for quite some time

00:13:29.089 --> 00:13:35.630
so I will acquiesce them this is a much

00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:40.250
better situation to find ourselves in

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:42.980
here we also only have to go to to mom's

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:46.490
heart so there's definitely no reason to

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:47.990
get overly cute with this dude that made

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:51.199
my motion sickness trigger like crazy

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:52.940
there anyone else experienced that it

00:13:51.199 --> 00:13:57.170
was like the whole camera it felt to me

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:58.220
like it was tilting there but just

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:00.949
something about the way the camera

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:05.839
scrolls on big rooms gets me gets me

00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:09.910
sometimes it just gets me you know thank

00:14:05.839 --> 00:14:12.350
you for not paying out exactly yet I

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:15.480
almost blew that one a little bit

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:18.589
I kind of wanted that read hard but

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:23.760
more power to you we had to luck not bad

00:14:18.589 --> 00:14:27.209
no payout perks is fine yeah I mean we

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:28.350
could give you bombs but I wait a minute

00:14:27.209 --> 00:14:30.269
didn't take damage from that though

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:31.050
what's up with that it's like I'm being

00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:38.940
lied to

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:42.449
all this time puberty you know what take

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:43.560
the nail we're no no we're still paying

00:14:42.449 --> 00:14:45.899
I don't know dude

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.550
creative cloud now's not the time I

00:14:45.899 --> 00:14:49.740
don't need an update cuz I paid for your

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:51.930
software you don't need that you don't

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:53.910
need to harangue me into this I pay for

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:56.100
your software monthly I know you're

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:57.899
trying it the updates should be a my

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.920
leisure I'm not an enterprise user is

00:14:57.899 --> 00:15:04.380
what I'm trying to say

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:05.550
I've never even rented a car yeah hey

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.990
while you're dealing with one of them

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:10.410
the other ones just gonna come poop on

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:14.399
you I guess yep bye wait stuff you could

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:16.800
do except get in there faster so joke's

00:15:14.399 --> 00:15:18.209
on me I guess we could still have

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:20.220
problems here let's go in here

00:15:18.209 --> 00:15:22.740
pop the devil card we didn't get as much

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:28.230
out of the demon judgment as I would see

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:28.620
what can you do if the foot just fell on

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:33.149
him

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:34.889
because he walked into a location sure

00:15:33.149 --> 00:15:37.319
I'll take it thank you that the foot

00:15:34.889 --> 00:15:40.610
could fall on it irritates me dude I

00:15:37.319 --> 00:15:43.800
think it's probably worth grabbing

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:45.899
infamy on the off chance that it works

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:50.519
here which to be honest with you I'm not

00:15:45.899 --> 00:15:53.940
convinced of but either way this one

00:15:50.519 --> 00:16:02.839
might be coming through in the clutch to

00:15:53.940 --> 00:16:02.839
guppy items please I'll do it

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:10.199
the reasoning is that we have 99 bombs

00:16:06.269 --> 00:16:11.550
already I am I really just wanted to see

00:16:10.199 --> 00:16:14.459
what the bombs look like and I didn't

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:18.809
expect them to stay in there as my it's

00:16:14.459 --> 00:16:21.870
my bed I'm oh is this what it's like to

00:16:18.809 --> 00:16:23.309
play with Malthus so we have these

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:25.290
homing bombs but now that I think about

00:16:23.309 --> 00:16:27.749
it we can't really afford to use them

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:29.009
because we can't guarantee that in fact

00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:29.999
it seems like quite the opposite it

00:16:29.009 --> 00:16:35.009
seems like the Guardian for whatever

00:16:29.999 --> 00:16:36.809
reason just wants to go into the into

00:16:35.009 --> 00:16:37.350
the path of the bombs wherever they may

00:16:36.809 --> 00:16:42.180
be

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:46.290
so Big Ups to you being the ultimate

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:47.639
jerk we're very lucky that as of yet

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:49.620
we've managed to kind of maintain an

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:53.759
equilibrium because we're taking wicked

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:55.860
damage that's more of my ideal room type

00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:56.839
right here and this fits the bill as

00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:04.470
well

00:16:56.839 --> 00:17:08.789
one away I think from the yep yep one

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:12.809
away from me baby one away

00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:14.699
one away from the bathroom one away I

00:17:12.809 --> 00:17:22.620
don't think infamy works the way I

00:17:14.699 --> 00:17:24.149
wanted it to here you know what maybe we

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:28.319
should have done the smaller room there

00:17:24.149 --> 00:17:31.919
oh no you think oh okay you're crushing

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:34.799
my dreams I'm trying so hard I got I got

00:17:31.919 --> 00:17:36.929
the run completely tailored you are

00:17:34.799 --> 00:17:38.610
gonna walk on every spike I can see it

00:17:36.929 --> 00:17:42.090
you you're actually gonna take pleasure

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:48.090
in walking on the spikes I see it in

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:50.130
your eyes I am no longer confident like

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:52.470
at all that we have any chance but we

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.690
did get HP and we did get damage does

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:57.570
the damage do anything no but all we

00:17:54.690 --> 00:18:01.740
really need to do is make it like a few

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:05.039
rooms into this run if we make it a few

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:07.500
rooms into this run just walk away

00:18:05.039 --> 00:18:11.710

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:13.299
trajectory handled again here

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:15.580
with with respect to our demon heart

00:18:13.299 --> 00:18:17.500

the Guardians beard freakin socks man

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:54.520
doesn't do enough damage to have any

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:56.289
reasonable chance to defend this awful

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:59.380
creature that we've been saddled with oh

00:18:56.289 --> 00:19:05.409
well it's pretty linear ride to the

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:08.049
finish here actual lanta oh my actual

00:19:05.409 --> 00:19:09.309

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:25.210
for us thanks to puberty as well you had

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:27.820
your chance dark bum and you blew it

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:29.260
out of sight out of mind I made these

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:31.890
lyrics up these are not the lyrics to

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:35.740
since you've been gone by Kelly Clarkson

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:37.600
but since you've been gone I can breathe

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:39.640
for the first I mean at that point it

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:42.490
kind of falls apart under advanced

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:44.680
scrutiny I suppose no yeah just walk

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:46.690
over to why wouldn't you walk over to

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:48.790
this guy and Stan yeah okay bait me away

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:51.940
from that one and then yeah okay to

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:56.590
every you're like baby Groot or

00:19:51.940 --> 00:20:00.940
something just F off your do take it

00:19:56.590 --> 00:20:03.010
aggro from every enemy I protect you

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:08.920
from one enemy you go take aggro from

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:10.570
the other one you know it's one of the

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:13.600
better design challenges in the game

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:15.550
yeah put that in your pipe and smoke

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:19.000
oh yeah laser beams probably the easiest

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:20.620
thing to defend an enemy from a shot

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.390
that all just goes through your body

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:24.280
okay we actually did something genius

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:26.200
there but at this point I just pay a

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:29.380
room tax once per room you're gonna get

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.900
hit sooner you come to accept that the

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:34.510
better I suppose

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:41.800
algae's algae's I don't even know if

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:43.900
that is going to protect our our Isaac's

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:47.920
heart here but I'm obviously like hoping

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:51.910
we're taking the hobbits to a 600 block

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:53.740
son nah there's a there's a proper play

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:55.750
here and if we do the play if we do the

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:58.180
proper play properly then we are going

00:20:55.750 --> 00:21:00.940
to get the win because you get that all

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:07.110
the places we have gone don't walk there

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:07.110
please all right

00:21:08.119 --> 00:21:12.049
you've done a good job

00:21:12.679 --> 00:21:19.139
pop algae's does it protect Isaac's

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:25.979
heart hey I mean I've got no shield

00:21:19.139 --> 00:21:29.269
around myself so I think it does protect

00:21:25.979 --> 00:21:32.009
Isaac's heart we got pretty lucky there

00:21:29.269 --> 00:21:33.989
this is definitely like on the shorter

00:21:32.009 --> 00:21:37.200
side as far as videos go but it's with

00:21:33.989 --> 00:21:39.659
good reason we're gonna do a another run

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:41.609
after like not in this video we're gonna

00:21:39.659 --> 00:21:42.779
do like a refresh run after this and

00:21:41.609 --> 00:21:43.889
then we might actually make a second

00:21:42.779 --> 00:21:44.489
pass and some of the challenges we've

00:21:43.889 --> 00:21:46.049
already done

00:21:44.489 --> 00:21:48.379
we got blank rune which is a very good

00:21:46.049 --> 00:21:51.239
pickup I'm happy with that but yeah

00:21:48.379 --> 00:21:52.469
annoying annoying run towards the end

00:21:51.239 --> 00:21:53.879
I'm looking forward to doing like a

00:21:52.469 --> 00:21:54.869
vanilla run next for now thanks for

00:21:53.879 --> 00:21:56.159
watching her because I've enjoyed the

00:21:54.869 --> 00:21:57.570
episode if you did click the like button

00:21:56.159 --> 00:21:59.129
sorry it's a little bit on the shorter

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:01.799
side but we're semi free of the

00:21:59.129 --> 00:22:03.779
challenges to do what we won't any old

00:22:01.799 --> 00:22:07.249
time for now thanks for watching again

00:22:03.779 --> 00:22:07.249
