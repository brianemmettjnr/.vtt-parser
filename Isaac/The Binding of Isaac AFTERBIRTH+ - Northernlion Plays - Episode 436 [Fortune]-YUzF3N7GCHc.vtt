00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.970
everybody welcome back to windows making

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.259
a noise and also northernlion playing

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.200
The Binding of Isaac at Birth plus which

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.870
is gone swimmingly recently got a good

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.900
streak going on and I think we're due to

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:22.170
knock some more greed out if possible

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.390
for example this weird question mark

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.510
character Ron dumb does not have okay

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.090
that's a stupid joke Eve has no greed

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.790
mode once we're done with this we maybe

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.559
never have to do greed mode ever again

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.360
except to get the donation machine to

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.070
$9.99 but then I don't even know if you

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.660
need to succes low for hb8 see if you

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.239
need to get the donation machine in

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.520
$9.99 or if it carries over in between

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.160
the two different modes I don't believe

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.360
that it does but it could this is a

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.010
pretty good get right here we can put

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.530
ourselves productively into the Whore of

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:09.110
Babylon state and hopefully pick up an

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.110
item in the process I'm ready

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.340
interesting choice I don't know if I if

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.700
I like it or hate it

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.979
let's try this on for size okay we got

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:25.110
five extra cents out of that did not

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.640
blow up that thing I think we're good to

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.189
roll like this oh you know what we

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.470
should buy a key yeah by the five cent

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.759
key could have gotten a spear at art as

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.310
well but I'd rather start with a little

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.560
extra momentum a little hon doesn't

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.439
really give you much but you know our

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.700
damage is five point eight six

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.479
regardless that's a really good place to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.990
be

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.659
starting your your run ad here obviously

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.880
wow that was like really bad I thought

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.470
for certain I had that lock down and

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.960
then as the shot got closer and closer I

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:59.399
started to question myself but the run

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:03.009
is most delicate at startup

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.929
please no portals the run is most

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:10.720
delicate at startup so we're just trying

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:12.489
to be conservative with our HP excuse me

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.459
sir conscientious with our surroundings

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:19.299
they I was a genuine terror in my voice

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:21.010
when I said excuse me sir Oh Lord was

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.269
standing right next to you no the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:28.720
enemies that could have ended my own

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:31.390
life well probably I mean I don't want

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.650
to say half - let's just say it would be

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:38.440
a strong idea I imagine for us to

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.410
purchase some HP related items now that

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.180
could just mean a spirit heart and I

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.730
think that's the way we would want to do

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:51.069
it but we might actually and this is a

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.989
little bit more of a a risky play but I

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.970
think just in terms of finances we

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:58.660
should buy a spirit heart and then buy a

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.480
red heart that way we can also come back

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.819
here and still at least give this guy a

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.069
chance to pay out with something what

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.200
makes you small not that bad okay I'm

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.569
gonna put gonna throw good money after

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.579
bad good HP after bad in this case we

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.959
got speed plus range as a result you

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.709
know what I can live with that I'm also

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:20.139
gonna try to swing for the fences here

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.880
that thing traded five cents for three

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:25.480
bombs that's a really good trade that

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.459
isn't actually gonna manifest itself

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.650
just yet but five cents for three bombs

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.030
is a totally fine trade I'm sure we'll

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.540
get an opportunity to use those better

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.130
in the future I feel okay about this the

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.650
speed plus range pickup is not ten out

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.260
of ten for us just yet but there may

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.120
come a time where one of those stats is

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.669
relevant and it could be either of them

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.889
as of right now neither of them is

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:49.889
really a big deal but that could change

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.140
in the meantime though just do your best

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.400
not to take damage we have only been

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.720
here once it kind of looks like we've

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.910
been playing worse than we actually have

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.440
in my opinion a little hot just keeps

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.870
this dude afraid the whole time that's

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.800
excellent apparently not the whole time

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.120
just almost the whole time we'll

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.920
probably leave this floor having not

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:15.860
purchased anything except whatever might

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:17.570
sit in the deal with the devil it sets

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.310
us back a little bit oh that was

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.680
horrible especially when you consider

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.330
that financially you know we also spent

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.850
money on consumables which is kind of

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.590
the cardinal sin of greed mode sometimes

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:37.600
you got to do it but it can it can put

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:39.590
you in a weird spot no question take it

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.780
take another little piece of my heart

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:46.910
now baby so the way that we're gonna do

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.480
this walk in here put something down see

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.320
what you get

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.760
crickets head well worth it do that half

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.560
a spirit I just took you to three point

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.750
eight or sorry plus three point eight to

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.990
damage which is in the nines for us I

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.460
think this went okay our HP obviously is

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.140
in a very delicate spot but we can

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.050
actually absorb an HP upgrade like we're

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.669
gonna do right there without losing

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.290
Whore of Babylon which is extremely

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:11.090
positive and then the other thing is can

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.640
one of those bombs that we got for like

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.030
1.7 cents each payout and indeed they

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:20.380
did

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:24.200
so we'll now take a key got bomb bag

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:27.020
okay you could spin this as if like bomb

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.580
bag was what allowed us to get I'm sorry

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.160
as if getting those three bombs is what

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.080
allowed us to get bomb bag I was so dumb

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.370
I don't necessarily think that's the the

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.660
way things happen but if you want to

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.760
spin it like that I think it makes me

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.790
look smarter than I actually am a lot of

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.669
the positive decisions I make an Isaac

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:45.650
essentially come down to happy accidents

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.720
a lot of the bad things that happened to

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.740
me are unhappy accidents but I'll be the

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.320
first to tell you

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.540
success is a byproduct of luck to some

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.270
extent I think you gotta put yourself in

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.650
a position to be lucky I mean Tiger

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.420
Woods said you make your own luck in

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.830
there's a

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:03.010
knows a thing or two about getting lucky

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.750
it's a joke about the fact that he was a

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:07.060
sex addict which is one of the

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:12.250
addictions that it's okay to make fun of

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:13.870
people for relatively speaking if you

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.460
were like haha that guy's addicted to

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.800
pain meds people would be like that's

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.800
very insensitive but if it's a

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:24.040
high-powered celebrity addicted sexual

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:27.090
intercourse you say well joke's on him

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:29.650
he's Weiner in himself and not in that

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:32.440
I'm talking about it the Anthony variety

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.390
not of the just a little prick variety

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.370
I'm not saying it's right I'm just

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:38.470
reflecting society's standards I'm not

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.540
setting them I'm I'm a 28 year old

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:44.380
Canadian I don't choose what what we

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:46.840
laugh at and don't laugh at NL are you

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.850
aware that you've lost enough spirit

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.280
hearts here to potentially cost you the

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.390
whole run yes I am it is the first Isaac

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:56.110
run of the day I don't want to use that

00:06:52.390 --> 00:07:00.400
as an excuse necessarily but you know

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:07.840
it's okay to be a little rusty to begin

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:08.980
with oh pretty bad didn't need to use it

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.180
but I'm glad we didn't you know what

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.800
I'll roll headed cramp is something we

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.690
could get good use out of that we got 45

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.860
cents but nothing really to do with it

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.670
right off the bat so we got a ton of

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:20.110
money stats are very good but we're

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.550
still looking for some of the items that

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.780
can really break us wide open but the

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.490
good news is if we find them we can

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.410
definitely buy them right off the bat

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:28.840
hive mind is probably worth giving a

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:32.680
shot to but i've acquiesced it already

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:38.500
so okay rate of fire and DPS as a result

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:45.180
improve it'll buy a key gives us

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:48.190
chemical peel also pretty good our bomb

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:53.020
extravaganza keeps continuing here to a

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:55.360
Diamonds to a hearts pretty garbage what

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:57.520
about now I don't think toothpicks

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.350
raises your rate of fire cap I almost

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.770
think we should go Maggie's bow which

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:04.480
gives us one HP but allows us to

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:05.980
possibly get something out of this and

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.650
also gives us deal with the devil fuel

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:10.870
which is important dish chariot another

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:13.480
great card for this situation right here

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:14.650
I don't think we want mr. boom I'm happy

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.710
enough with Krampus I said we got a

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:20.530
little horn which is occasionally quite

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:23.320
nice and destroys anything it hits but I

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.220
don't like these items that much so we

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.480
might be missing out on toothpicks

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.430
admittedly but I'm gonna go for the

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.630
re-roll I certainly don't care about

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.890
data miner at some point we're gonna

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:32.230
have to pick it up but that item is

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:35.020
garbage and I have put in the time to

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:37.000
determine that it's garbage continue

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:40.030
using bombs we're gonna get more fanny

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.160
pack belly button sure I mean we could

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:43.630
try a belly button on for size here and

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.340
I think lucky Rock combined with bombs

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:49.750
is pretty positive don't have a ton of

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:54.790
money now so let's just try to get that

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:56.530
set up appropriately okay now we'll

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:59.470
throw some more bombs at the problem

00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:01.630
here a lot of good stuff here I think

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:03.430
you go taro cloth but if we could afford

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:06.610
to buy all these items I would love to

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:08.230
buy all these items cuz halo is fine

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:12.180
even if it temporarily loses Whore of

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:12.180
Babylon for us there's no big problem

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:19.760
it's pretty much my ideal wave bombs

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:23.210
that are easy to avoid

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:26.030
she also like try to occasionally if you

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:29.240
got nothing better to do throw out some

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:31.520
shots at rocks because if science breaks

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.900
them you get some money out of it either

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.130
way we could blow them up for some extra

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.200
money regardless because we're getting a

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:37.790
decent number of bombs not really doing

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.620
anything else with them but I think

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.000
we've broken this one and in a good way

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.590
not broken in the sense that like we can

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.390
crash the game but we've we've broken

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:47.240
this run wide open we found that the

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:49.700
tactic we needed in order to in order to

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:53.480
get an easy W here for 21 cents do you

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:54.860
go halo or black candle probably um

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.440
you're gonna think this is weird but I

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:59.090
think you'd go black candle and he says

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.890
that as he's walking over halo which is

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:03.470
what I meant to say of course mm-hmm

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:05.660
no but for real that was a misstep why

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:07.340
would you go why would you go black

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.440
candle I'm not worried about ruining

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.670
horror Babylon because we'll just buy

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.620
something from the deal with the devil

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:15.350
this floor next floor like we're not

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:16.430
gonna get six deals with the devil in a

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:18.830
row that don't have items in all

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:20.660
likelihood we're four or whatever we

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:26.930
however many deals with the devil still

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:29.480
remain but we don't get much of a damage

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:30.920
bonus for Whore of Babylon sorry let me

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.870
rephrase we don't get much of a damage

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.310
bonus for the halo and if we're already

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.480
at the rate of fire cap we're not

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.010
getting much out of that either

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:39.050
plus we're already at the speed cap

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:40.730
range is largely irrelevant I actually

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:42.640
have talked myself out of buying the

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:46.190
halo to begin with I don't think it's

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:47.810
necessarily worth it it's hard to look

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:52.310
at in all stats upgrade and say that

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:54.710
this is not something I desire but but

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:56.360
it really isn't is it as long as we're

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:58.010
already capped out and you know the

00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:01.850
damage bonus you get from the halo was

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:04.940
like 0.9 or something yeah so we'll just

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:06.890
take pentagram raise our damage being

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:08.900
the Whore of Babylon state we could buy

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:11.030
a halo but I'm not gonna instead I'm

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.590
just gonna leave but actually let's make

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:17.660
sure this thing's tapped out

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:20.750
that'll do it starter deck is irrelevant

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:22.160
I think the guy may have just paid 15

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:25.340
cents for a single card because we

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:28.430
already had belly button but the card

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:30.080
was okay here using

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:34.190
the bombs we got from that we can make

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:38.089
our money back but I still hesitate to

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:41.810
say it was a good idea okay down to the

00:11:38.089 --> 00:11:45.230
next floor damage DPS even HP is pretty

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:47.870
disgusting here we also saved a little

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:49.399
money by not having to buy keys so maybe

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:53.260
that justice card was okay but it was a

00:11:49.399 --> 00:11:57.200
bad decision one way or the other

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:59.870
alrighty seventeen cents this is why I

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.220
like having a little HP remaining so we

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:03.410
can play these demon judgements which

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.940
have not really given us a bunch of

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:07.850
great stuff so far but they haven't been

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:14.750
too too bad these floors are like carbon

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:17.600
copies and one another I'm kind of torn

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:19.670
here do we want let's try the three cent

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.390
item there that actually worked totally

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:24.200
fine

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:26.570
do we want Jesus juice it is a damage

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:29.149
upgrade to of diamonds is huge but we

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:30.500
don't need to use it yet because if we

00:12:29.149 --> 00:12:33.110
get to twenty four cents it takes us to

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.550
ninety nine which actually okay so we

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:37.339
probably should

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:38.660
in all likelihood by Jesus juice now cuz

00:12:37.339 --> 00:12:40.880
we don't need very much money to get to

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.440
99 cents regardless we don't have the

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.000
money just yet so we'll hold off on that

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.250
check this out

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.709
not a stone chest for the first time in

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:51.440
Earth's history we're going to win and

00:12:48.709 --> 00:12:53.900
I'll tell you straight up I might try

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:58.010
for the greatest gamble mankind has ever

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:59.600
seen what if we try to donate one

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:03.580
hundred ninety eight cents to our

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:08.150
donation machine that's right we get to

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:10.459
99 cents donate it all which is there's

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:14.510
a relatively okay chance that would work

00:13:10.459 --> 00:13:15.680
for us then we pop two of diamonds so I

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:18.470
guess we couldn't get the ninety nine we

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:21.020
could donate like 70 cents and then

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:22.670
quadruple with the two of diamonds plus

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:23.870
Tarot cloth and then donate the

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:25.700
remaining ninety-nine so we could donate

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:28.010
like a hundred and sixty cents if the

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:30.620
percentages hold out for us I want to

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:33.700
give it a try cuz I think I mean 14

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:36.680
damage leaves you in a really good spot

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:39.770
with five rate of fire to speed decent

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:41.390
spacebar item etc etc not to mention we

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.600
can keep taking items from the deal with

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.819
it

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.769
so like this this green mode run is

00:13:43.819 --> 00:13:47.839
solve 12 minutes in we got no worries

00:13:45.769 --> 00:13:50.690
I'm trying to strike a balance by the

00:13:47.839 --> 00:13:53.209
way between greed mode and not green

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:54.740
mode like one on one off because some

00:13:53.209 --> 00:13:57.440
people really like greed mode some

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:59.660
people are like ok with greed mode some

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.639
people don't like it nearly as much as

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:03.529
normal runs and I think to be honest

00:14:01.639 --> 00:14:05.149
with you I'm kind of in that bottom camp

00:14:03.529 --> 00:14:09.440
like I'm having a relatively fun time

00:14:05.149 --> 00:14:12.319
but I am a normal run guy the normal run

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:13.730
is a better it's more restricted which I

00:14:12.319 --> 00:14:16.370
think ends up being a positive thing

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:16.819
because it leads to more variety in your

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:18.949
runs

00:14:16.819 --> 00:14:23.540
whereas in greed mode there's a lot of

00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:26.569
say meanness which is okay I just prefer

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:30.560
I guess I prefer having a little less

00:14:26.569 --> 00:14:32.680
choice in the matter I suppose probably

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:35.300
because I'm not from the land of freedom

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:40.130
just not built into my DNA like that

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:43.519
right okay we'll go Guppies head and

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:45.170
hold it because it's like solid and

00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:47.720
we'll just keep moving on here the only

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:49.130
thing we really want I mean we'd love to

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:54.769
become guffy and I would I would pay

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:58.490
handsomely to do so HP or money tear

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:59.870
detonators I mean it's okay if we got

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.220
better to your effects I might consider

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:03.410
it on this floor but probably not

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:07.639
getting the HP is good because it means

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:09.230
that I can means that I can trade

00:15:07.639 --> 00:15:11.420
essentially for free with the deals of

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:13.339
the devil we want to check wherever we

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:16.910
can get cards from because with tarot

00:15:13.339 --> 00:15:18.680
clot the cards are on paper twice as

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:21.589
useful but sometimes twice as useful

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.300
makes a card vastly more useful than it

00:15:21.589 --> 00:15:25.579
would otherwise would be like I think

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:27.350
for spirit arts is better than double as

00:15:25.579 --> 00:15:29.360
good as two spirit hearts which is a

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:31.880
sentence that as I said it I said to

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.410
myself I've gone cross-eyed both I mean

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.630
look at that this time it's not because

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:40.520
of the because of the fact that we

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:41.930
already had the cap but I digress anyway

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:44.150
all I'm getting at is we could probably

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:47.690
buy three sent cards all day and and

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:48.380
essentially make a profit due to taro

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:50.870
cloth

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:56.930
I mean 1/2 of diamonds at the present

00:15:50.870 --> 00:16:00.380
moment buys us like 70 cents so not even

00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:05.510
worried about our existing HP damage etc

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:07.250
etc like this guy's got to go that was a

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:08.540
pretty bad move but that was though

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:12.760
substantially worse what you're doing

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:15.380
all this to pick up a bomb not necessary

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:17.840
the dream for us right now I would say

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:19.690
is I mean obviously if we get blank card

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:21.710
or something we can just donate forever

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:24.500
especially we have like sharp plug or

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:26.510
something but apart from that the dream

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:31.430
is a deal with the devil that gives us

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:32.690
the gup-e trifecta and once that's done

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:34.490
it's done forever and then I got to

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:36.710
figure out do we still have to grind

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:38.750
greed mode to get to 9 9 9 I'm assuming

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:42.260
the answer is yes but I may be mistaken

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:43.550
here we can move on to greedier which is

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.410
a little bit more interesting I think

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:49.040
just because you get you don't get the

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:51.140
keys to the kingdom you know the kingdom

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.550
might have left a door ajar or something

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.990
but you got to kind of examine the house

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:56.000
and figure out what your point of entry

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:57.290
is gonna be you can't just put the key

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.450
in the lock and then turn it and no

00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:01.450
surprise it's chaos plus copy again I

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:06.730
think it's a pretty strong indication of

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:13.640
like our strengths in this run right now

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:17.200
that essentially I accidentally just

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:19.160
injured Ragman he offers no

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:22.970
substantiative threat to us there's

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:26.080
actually two champion Ragman and I

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:30.200
didn't even notice another good sign

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:31.490
that is the guppy dream take hairball

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:34.940
because we actually don't want golden

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:37.040
chests and I think as we pick up the two

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:39.080
remaining spirit hearts and I gotta be

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:43.880
honest with you I kind of apologize not

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:45.620
the most engaging greed mode run but I

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:48.190
also did not design the mode like I'm

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:52.880
doing my darndest here

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:54.290
takes us up to 98 cents we probably

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.820
could have gotten like another 15 and

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:57.410
bought some stuff there this one's gonna

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:58.730
be a little on the faster side no

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:00.350
question though so we got a key bagger

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:08.110
we can't do anything with we could just

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:11.630
skip this floor not that interested to

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:13.220
spirit hearts I think we should look for

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:14.870
the reroll cuz if we can get a blank

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:16.550
card we can donate even more money I'm

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:20.330
going to also be like kind of hilarious

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:21.650
and blank card is a pretty common get we

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:23.960
don't need any of this it's thing you're

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:26.000
gonna be like Oh take chaos chaos lowers

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:27.500
our odds of getting blank card I believe

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.420
sure it could show up in the deal with

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:35.060
the devil as a result but we don't need

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:36.350
99 bombs we don't need blackhole many of

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:38.180
the items that look good we actually

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:39.770
can't benefit from because our run is

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:43.460
already too good to benefit from them

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:46.010
we're probably gonna get a 15 cents so

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:50.540
I'll take champion belt I'll take spider

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:52.610
mod I think we'll blow this guy up and

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:57.470
and basically just put a capstone on

00:18:52.610 --> 00:19:00.950
this one like the way I see it there's

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:02.960
nothing that can stop us so again what's

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:03.880
the what's the idea here the idea is

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:07.880
very simple

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:10.310
pretty much like 30 percent of the run

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.960
length will probably be us donating to

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:16.400
the donation machine after the run is

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:18.590
over I want to donate from 99 cents or

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:27.740
however many we have but it should be 99

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:30.260
at this point to 24 25 I suppose not

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:32.210
that that's a huge deal we pop two of

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:35.600
diamonds with taro cloth that takes us

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:39.940
to 99 cents it shouldn't have blown up

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:42.910
the key bagger dude that takes us to 99

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:45.620
we donate all of that and then like

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:47.510
we've saved ourselves from having to do

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:50.090
like eight green mode runs to fill the

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:51.830
difference the biggest catastrophe and

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:53.300
as a result what everybody out there

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.980
should be rooting for and I take no

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.300
offense to it I would feel betrayed if

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:58.280
you weren't rooting against me to some

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.720
extent on a run this powerful I'd be

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.920
rooting against somebody else that I was

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.390
watching I'd be like look at

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:06.190
you know pride comes before the fall

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:10.130
it's a natural human instinct I think to

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:15.430
want to see overconfidence failure

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:15.430
it's the Macbeth principle excuse me

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:21.260
what I would hate to see it thus you

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:23.270
might love to see is it clogging on a

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:26.330
zero percent or 1 percent chance which

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:28.730
would actually be pretty funny although

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:31.370
when I turned off the recording I would

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:37.190
start to cry uh I mean that's just

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:39.050
bounce dude we're good beyond good just

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:40.610
don't accidentally use one of the cards

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.660
and you say well what kind of idiot

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:44.020
would do that

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:46.280
you know what channel you're watching

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:48.740
anytime I say don't do this there's

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.730
oftentimes a story that'll match it

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:51.380
unfortunately

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:55.040
so you probably could have bought one

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:56.570
more item but you know that it's it's

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.580
all intellectual at this point we've

00:20:56.570 --> 00:21:02.450
we've had a winning run since like the

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:03.860
fourth floor maybe even since the second

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:06.980
floor we did get a little dicey on the

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:11.030
first floor but since then we've been

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:13.460
completely set we could also we could

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:15.740
probably donate even more because

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:17.540
there's all these guys up here that

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.690
could pay out I would guess we're

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:24.970
probably gonna get like 10 to 15 cents

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:24.970
from three or four guys that have a room

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:31.220
that have a I picked up the money like a

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:34.280
moron well talking about not picking up

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:35.390
the money yeah well I guess to be honest

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:39.110
you have to pick up the money cuz if you

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:40.700
don't he's gonna he's gonna eat it and

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:42.860
gain HP so actually I don't feel too bad

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:44.240
about picking up the money there but

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:47.600
yeah I was hoping to save it and then

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:50.230
use it as as fuel to donate so be it I

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.230
suppose though

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:58.000
did he pick up a coin and give me a key

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:59.500
from flat penny if so he's a much more

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.900
sympathetic character he's like I need

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:04.600
the money but at the same time you can

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:06.300
have the key I know you might need this

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.800
more than me what am I supposed to do

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:13.240
I've already I can generate my own keys

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:14.710
infinitely remind you they only lead to

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:17.220
a bunch of little red heads popping out

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:17.220
here but still

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:26.820
okay he's very very nearly dead and as

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:31.980
such the next phase of our master plan

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:33.570
is close to the beginning there are no

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:37.590
hearts good good good good good

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:40.830
so he's done god I hate super armored

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:47.000
dude I know it's like a three year old

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:49.770
argument at this point but black feather

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.710
actually a trinket I quite like don't

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:54.570
use it that often because rarely do you

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:55.680
get the opportunity to really have it

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:58.800
surmount another trinket but

00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:01.560
occasionally it can be really useful so

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:06.240
the goal here is to donate an absurd

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:10.980
amount we're gonna wait until we get

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:12.360
down to twenty-five cents and if we play

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:14.910
our cards right here we might have one

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:16.470
more greed mode run to max it out and in

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:20.870
that case dude it's been like the most

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:20.870
efficient trip through greed mode ever

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:27.390
if we can defeat greed mode in n runs

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:30.090
where n is the number of characters who

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:32.010
have to defeat greed mode plus one not

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:34.320
quite peak efficiency but pretty close

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:37.980
but actually I think the donation

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:41.010
machine will probably clog I mean you're

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:42.210
taking a minimum 1% chance times the

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:48.170
fact that I want to donate at least

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:51.510
another $0.99 probabilistically speaking

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:55.280
still one penny probabilistically

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:55.280
speaking there's a decent

00:23:57.159 --> 00:24:06.369
I started a joke started the whole world

00:24:01.809 --> 00:24:09.789
laughing only I couldn't I don't want to

00:24:06.369 --> 00:24:11.529
see that's a lewd image yet the joke was

00:24:09.789 --> 00:24:12.820
on me for now thanks for watching hope
