00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.780
hey everybody welcome back to on the

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.910
line plays of mining Isaac after birth

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.800
plus blue baby run and you were always

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.170
talking about things taking time off of

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.420
your life you know were like that exam

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.250
took the year off of my life

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.830
whatever adds to your life nobody ever

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.980
eats a salad and goes like oh that added

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.939
like 30 minutes to my life be e91 8pb

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.410
probably because we're all aware of the

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.199
ever encroaching spectre of death that

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.450
haunts us all anyway we have the tonsil

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.640
to start with your I believe this is the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.530
tonsil at least it's one of those items

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.390
that's relatively new so I usually like

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.320
rely on picking it up to know the name

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.440
it's a smaller more flesh colored Bob's

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.180
brain well that's a little racist isn't

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.340
it NL I mean someone could have green

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.070
flesh haven't you ever seen the mask or

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.539
Shrek for example sure fair enough

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.109
Gomorrah out from the guardians of the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.109
galaxy films of course also green skin I

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.379
don't know where I'm going with this but

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.450
either way what I was going to say is

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.689
the blue baby run that we had yesterday

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.090
or you know whenever that episode went

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.790
up was pretty tough wasn't the hardest

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.189
run we've ever had but was pretty tough

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.509
for the opening of it at least we went

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.590
down a half a spear a tart on the first

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.390
floor and I thought for sure we were

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.590
going to go down but instead we managed

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.869
to actually get kind of like

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.490
unbelievably out of control by the end

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.380
of it and that's nice but things are

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.720
always a little fragile near the start

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.450
of the run and that never holds true

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.409
more than when you're playing as Judas

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.430
here so I love our damage 7.01 damage on

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.950
the first floor is ridiculously strong

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:47.280
but we need HP dude jacob's ladder is

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.090
also awesome and so is getting a golden

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:55.350
poop but as good as Jacob's Ladder is is

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.909
not HP so you know we could have a

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.250
hundred damage but if we get hit by a

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.740
single champion we're going down in an

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:07.619
early round and the sugar I'm going down

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.700
singing is my guess okay that's not

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.500
really what I'm looking for either

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.599
really what I am looking for is a key

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.709
and then if we get a key we can probably

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.359
buy a spear at hard

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.409
and also have a chance for an arcade on

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:21.019
the next floor anyway but with yeah yeah

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.609
that's what was bothering me they're

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.290
kind of a scary situation they're our

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:27.000
champions and now the champion is on

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.159
fire I can't imagine that's a positive

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.489
thing for our situation but look at that

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:34.409
there's a key only an idiot would open

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.329
the golden chest here so we're just

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:41.639
joking I almost got you there I could

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:44.760
feel the the fear you know what oh I

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:47.760
hate it why would you do this to me but

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.560
we got a second key we got a third key

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.780
what I'm thinking is we should actually

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:57.810
go to our boss fight before mmm pardon

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.419
me before we go to the shop because

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.280
there is an extra heart in here and then

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:05.219
if we get the super excellent shop that

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.989
I always love that has two lucky pennies

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.849
on it but also has some enemies we won't

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:13.079
be as afraid unless they're champions in

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:15.450
which case we'll die but okay so here's

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.159
what you do two minutes forty seconds in

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:23.129
those skype messages for like weeks here

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:24.569
there you go I would think that this is

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.389
like there's some statistical sampling

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.859
you know bias involved here with the

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.389
fact that I get skype messages as soon

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:34.709
as I start Issac episodes but I honestly

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:37.530
don't know that that's true I want to

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:42.030
get PhD here is the thing which is why I

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:45.090
went back but I also want or even need

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.879
the spirit heart I don't care so much

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.599
about an arcade but I really really care

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:54.209
about survival let's start with PhD it's

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.680
more fun we get I can see forever so

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.989
that gives us a second secret room

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.370
somewhere which we should try to find

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.319
before we move on this is good this has

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.049
got plenty of time here I really at this

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.509
point there's a secret room I'm not

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.759
doing you know five eyes together so

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:10.229
right I'm not doing five eyes again

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:12.989
pisode on the average day I'm doing you

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:16.500
know like one two three a day the fact

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.299
that I almost always seem to get a

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.549
message right after I start is actually

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:26.340
becoming like increasingly mind-boggling

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:29.370
to even myself dude really

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.389
a little petty don't you think game

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:37.530
there we go

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:40.639
ooh so there was an enemy super close to

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.790
us that died thankfully we got a bomb

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.330
perthro

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:48.870
the gods poppet that's huge of course

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.150
perthro the gods again also huge haggle

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.860
odds not that relevant / throw a was use

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.260
a was try to find a black market maybe

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.400
and then / throw we don't need to buy a

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.900
spear at hard anymore and i don't care

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.250
about money apparently there was a

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.010
spirit are back in this room that i

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.479
totally whipped on so we never needed to

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.490
find ourselves in this dangerous place

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.810
to begin with I will go back for the

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.450
spirit heart it might seem like we don't

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.889
need to but keep in mind if we take a

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.210
deal with the devil we'll only have two

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.490
spirit hearts remaining here so where

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:18.360
the heck was this oh it was in the fire

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:21.690
I didn't even notice and you know what

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.300
with one bomb and what do we care about

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:27.389
in arcade we got in no matter we got 2 1

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.919
hp and we almost always give away one HP

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.300
on the second floor so it's not like

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.550
it's liable to become too relevant

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.780
afterwards but still the exploration

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.840
that we did there helped us out a ton

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.389
and we are like in a pretty good spot

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.720
here should keep this and we saved our

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:45.060
bomb and it ended up paying very high

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.620
dividends for us we didn't get poor

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.610
spirit outs out of it we got two spirit

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:54.120
outs out of it I'll take alright I am

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:56.220
NOT suggesting that my colleagues have

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.200
nothing better to do than sit around and

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:02.220
oh northern - started playing The

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.870
Binding of Isaac rebirth on Steam time

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.750
to send them a Skype message what I am

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.690
suggesting is that maybe you know they

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.010
keep a similar schedule to me and in the

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.289
morning they like to take it a little

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:16.229
easy you know drink some coffee catch up

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:19.020
on the days of news and other happens

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:20.490
dances not a huge fan of leo obviously

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.750
would have rear old it if I'd known that

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:27.330
it existed in the first place and then

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:30.389
excuse me for spirit arts out of a rock

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:33.300
that I didn't even see was tinted maybe

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:36.419
they see me start to play Isaac and they

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.800
go okay it's time to like you know get

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:39.930
down to business time to start my

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.880
workday which apparently involves

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.830
SkyTeam is I'm not it could also just be

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:48.000
a coincidence I could be miss

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:50.430
attributing it it doesn't happen with

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.840
other videos though it's not like I

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.520
start to play dead cells and I get a

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.590
Skype message I really don't understand

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:59.940
it I think I might be the victim of a

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:02.310
very elaborate prank that is really

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:04.860
completely meaningless but anyway let's

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:09.060
go so the ideal outcome for us here is

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:12.360
very very obvious I think deal with the

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.740
devil to guffy items one of them is

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.449
inactive leery roll it into a third

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.970
guppy item after we take it it's a dream

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:20.130
come true we picked up 11 spirit hearts

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:22.500
in the past you know half of a floor so

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.900
I'm pretty positive about that

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.639
we got one item it's demon baby but at

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.560
least we have precedent and then we got

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:30.660
binky which is really good for our tear

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.930
delay and I guess if you want to focus

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:36.030
on the positives we've got the you know

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:41.430
permanent polaroid invincibility already

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:44.639
enabled here well in advance but not

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:45.630
really a huge turn of events for us but

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:50.610
I mean what what do you want me to say

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:52.470
look at this run we got 10.13 damage and

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.729
a higher than average rate of fire these

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.560
are the kind of runs where you get them

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:57.690
and you go back and watch episodes where

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.250
I'd you know die as Judas or say that

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:01.080
Judas is one of the harder characters to

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:04.500
win as and you go what is this guy

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:07.199
talking about well I mean I guess I

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:09.840
would in my own defense I would say

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:11.880
Judas is very easy to win with if you're

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.009
looking to get the fastest wind possible

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.289
you probably want to give you this a

00:08:14.009 --> 00:08:18.030
chance maybe maybe as asel instead that

00:08:16.289 --> 00:08:21.030
you get the idea but he's also one of

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:22.620
the easiest characters to lose with if

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:24.210
I'm if I've got a gun to my head you

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.139
know with the binding of issac we will

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:27.300
pull the trigger

00:08:25.139 --> 00:08:30.120
I'm not taking Judas I'm probably taking

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:32.250
Isaac if I'm being honest even as asel

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:35.969
and get a little spotty from time to

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:40.399
time it wasn't worth doing this but I'm

00:08:35.969 --> 00:08:43.349
glad that we at least got the mimic

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:48.810
48-hour energy we won't even really take

00:08:43.349 --> 00:08:50.070
advantage of it all but 10.5 sometimes

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.560
you know when you're lucky you're lucky

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.640
and on this run I think we definitely

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:58.800
fit the bill right

00:08:53.640 --> 00:09:00.240
now that's that's that man I mean we can

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.650
pretty much just start talking about our

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.120
farts for the rest of this episode and

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:05.730
we'll probably be okay but I'm not going

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:09.980
to do that because it's kind of gross I

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:12.510
know it's a human bodily function but

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:14.130
most bodily functions I'd prefer if

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:17.070
people kept them private I guess I'm

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:19.140
approved you know you live long enough

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:21.570
you grow up to see yourself become on

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:23.010
the wrong side of history as opposed I

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:25.500
don't think people should fart in public

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:28.620
if they can avoid it if you have to and

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.880
lord knows we've all had some I have a

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.410
good feeling about that mushroom up

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:34.400
there but lord knows we've all had some

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:36.810
urgent flatulence situations I wouldn't

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:40.220
doubt that whatsoever experience in

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:40.220
myself you got to do what you got to do

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:46.290
told you um but I think for the most

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.850
part you should try to hold it I still

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:52.800
you know we talked about it on the show

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:56.610
and I think probably a slight majority I

00:09:52.800 --> 00:10:00.810
like this a slight majority agreed with

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:03.480
me a slight majorities mask we're just

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:07.470
going to head down I said that burping

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:09.030
is gross if you do it in public I agree

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:10.770
because I posited that in the first

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.480
place that's right I'm the first person

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:14.820
in history to ever suggest burping is

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.610
gross pretty high opinion to myself but

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:20.820
now what I mean is I on the show I said

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:24.330
that I think burping is a little gross

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:26.820
but only if it's a deliberately

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:29.040
exaggerated so stupid I thought we could

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:31.670
make it but I didn't look at the the

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:34.470
geography close enough

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:35.970
only if you exaggerate the birth this is

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:39.480
my opinion because I you know sometimes

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:40.680
on the NL SS my nuance gets lost out of

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:44.700
the interest of trying to be

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:48.150
entertaining I mean I could get down

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:49.620
with having some extra trinkets even

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:53.040
though we got zero trinkets as is right

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:54.900
now if you just if you're you know

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.690
drinking a carbonated beverage and you

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:59.220
go like birth then I'm okay that's I'm

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:00.240
not I don't think you're a bad person I

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:03.030
don't think you're a bad person either

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:05.950
way unless you're like bad and then you

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:11.290
say something horribly bigoted you know

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:14.830
but if you like summon using your

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:18.820
diaphragm like 30 gallons of air into

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:20.710
your chest and then you go and you just

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:26.620
like belch it out then I think that is

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:33.100
disgusting yeah it's plus we'll take

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:35.290
this I I don't think dualities all that

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.670
in the bag of potato chips very common

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.710
phrase the tip with the kids these days

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:41.020
pheromones is just okay world card will

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:42.460
pop um yeah we'll do everything that's

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.840
available on this floor we have so much

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:48.910
time like we've sped up like

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:51.400
ridiculously but farts are not the same

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:53.170
because farts always smell almost always

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.240
smell at least I know you're good evany

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.460
read the song by Outkast I know you like

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:58.990
to thank your don't stank but lean a

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:03.640
little bit closer you'll see roses

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:05.230
really smell like poo poo poo if you

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.610
think your farts don't stink you're

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:08.080
probably just used to them you're high

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:12.130
on the smell of your own farts as they'd

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:14.350
like to say I as I like to say but burbs

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:16.030
don't always think but people go they

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:17.680
think that burps are odorless it's not

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:20.830
true they just smell like the inside of

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:22.900
your own you know mouth and nose and as

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:24.160
a result you might be tempted to think

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.290
that they don't smell but really they

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:29.770
just smell like your own breath so you

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:32.220
know it said it's odorous to other

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:32.220
people

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:38.170
but a burp is sometimes involuntary I

00:12:35.949 --> 00:12:42.100
think you know you can get gas in the

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:47.829
diaphragm that is more painful or

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:50.350
discomforting than gas in your colon gas

00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:52.000
and my colon gas okay this has gone on

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:53.319
way too far all I'm saying I'm not

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.759
trying to be gross I'm actually just

00:12:53.319 --> 00:12:56.019
saying that I sympathize with those of

00:12:54.759 --> 00:12:57.959
you who think those bodily functions are

00:12:56.019 --> 00:12:59.980
gross you definitely should not

00:12:57.959 --> 00:13:03.389
ejaculate in public unless you're in a

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.389
place that's you know meant for it

00:13:03.779 --> 00:13:07.899
defecating in public I prefer if you

00:13:06.189 --> 00:13:12.180
didn't please get behind closed doors we

00:13:07.899 --> 00:13:16.029
don't want this come on as an insult

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:18.519
give me that at least blow these up and

00:13:16.029 --> 00:13:21.459
that was obviously not worth the cost of

00:13:18.519 --> 00:13:25.180
admission but okay continue moving on

00:13:21.459 --> 00:13:27.579
kind of tempted to buy a spear in our

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:29.319
because we have spent a lot of money on

00:13:27.579 --> 00:13:30.759
spirit arts or a lot of spirit arts on

00:13:29.319 --> 00:13:34.509
that deals with the devil is what I mean

00:13:30.759 --> 00:13:36.100
to say here but I think we're fine we

00:13:34.509 --> 00:13:40.089
can save it and maybe get something on

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:43.329
the next floor instead same thing with

00:13:40.089 --> 00:13:44.319
like you know people sometimes take it

00:13:43.329 --> 00:13:47.019
to the extreme and they go what about

00:13:44.319 --> 00:13:51.250
sneezing in public the thing is is

00:13:47.019 --> 00:13:53.259
sneezing is an involuntary action most

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:57.209
of the time if you're forcing yourself

00:13:53.259 --> 00:13:59.560
to sneeze somehow first off

00:13:57.209 --> 00:14:02.050
congratulations because to be able to

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:04.180
create a sneeze out of nowhere is is an

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:07.120
excellent skill to have I actually I

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:09.670
have a little spot unlike the interior

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:12.970
of my nose if I kind of like irritate it

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:14.709
with a with a rolled-up tissue I can

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:17.649
force myself to sneeze and it feels

00:14:14.709 --> 00:14:19.329
excellent because you know especially if

00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:20.980
you're really stuffed up force yourself

00:14:19.329 --> 00:14:23.050
to go on like two or three sneezes and

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.490
then clears the up pretty nicely plus it

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:26.230
just feels good you know I usually spend

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:30.579
like an hour to a day just making myself

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:33.100
sneeze like you're the weird one that's

00:14:30.579 --> 00:14:37.600
obviously a lie I actually spend most of

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:40.449
all day making myself sneeze but it's

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:43.720
involuntary you know you get like less

00:14:40.449 --> 00:14:45.370
than a couple of seconds between your

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.630
brain sending the signal that you need

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.550
to sneeze in the sneeze

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:50.520
we basically involuntarily coming out so

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:53.200
I don't begrudge anybody a sneeze

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:56.080
coughing I'm like 50/50 I do think

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:58.000
people they cost so much that it blows

00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:01.150
my mind sometimes and I know that people

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.270
can be sick or they can be illed but

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:06.040
still like you never noticed it more

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:09.040
like Kate plays in these classical music

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:11.920
concerts symphonies I have heard them

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:14.560
called fancy new new world phrase for it

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.090
have you heard of these things a young

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:20.020
man by the name of Ludwig von Beethoven

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:24.610
in Austria started to you think there's

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:27.700
a joke in there somewhere you're

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:30.540
supposed to hold your noise until like

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:32.470
in between movements of a symphony and

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:34.480
whenever there's like a break in the

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:36.880
music it's like there's a symphony of

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:38.460
coughing that happens and I'm happy

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:41.590
people have been holding it but I'm like

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:47.860
how many times do you cop on a daily

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:49.990
basis maybe it's it's a you know a young

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:52.840
man's game talking here I occasionally

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:54.760
if I spend like a lot of time talking

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:58.630
over the course of a day

00:15:54.760 --> 00:16:00.100
I mean it's tempting but I resent this

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:02.610
choice because the game is basically

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:04.810
being like hey would you like to

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:08.890
accidentally end your own run and the

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:10.650
answer is no we have not gotten our item

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:12.820
room on this floor let's go back

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:14.710
sometimes if I'm talking a lot for a day

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.330
I start to get like the throat feels

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:19.870
like it's chewed up and I get a little

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:22.570
of a you know a nervous tic or a cough

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:24.670
or something going on in there but maybe

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:27.250
it's just a symphony full of youtubers

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:28.780
which is really my own personal

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:32.140
nightmare when it comes to where I'm

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:33.520
going to be spending my time have I

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:37.180
evolved fully into a self-hating

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:39.240
youtuber no I don't think so I think

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:41.590
there's a lot of youtubers who uh and

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:44.110
and twitch streamers did by the same

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:45.340
token for sure that are aware of what

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:47.320
they do and aware that it's

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:49.000
entertainment but also kind of absurd

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.580
and they have a sensible opinion of

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.450
themselves but there's also a lot of

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.830
youtubers sued you know and I don't

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:56.230
blame them because you get famous when

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:57.750
you're like 20 years old you're like I

00:16:56.230 --> 00:17:00.160
am a god if

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:02.920
not really like I don't think I'm a god

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.690
I'm just saying like we have met some

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:07.839
people not many and I mean that

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:11.470
sincerely I met way more like lawyers

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:12.880
who were super into themselves but then

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:15.760
I've met youtubers who are super into

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:21.339
themselves but definitely yeah why not

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:23.589
I have met some youtubers where you know

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:27.280
what they think they're don't stink and

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:29.590
I feel like if anything I'm glad that

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.030
I'm a little bit older than that maybe

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:32.710
the average age of a professional

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:34.540
youtuber at this point because I grew up

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:36.220
in an era where this job didn't exist as

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:38.230
like a viable career path even when I

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:40.110
was an adult and we kind of just like

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:43.480
accidentally created it which is cool

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:45.280
but if you grew up being like 15 and

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:48.040
then wanting to be a youtuber and then

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.900
succeeding more power to you and I mean

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.400
that sincerely but at the same time I

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:53.830
could see how that would be like I've

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:56.350
achieved all my hopes and dreams and I

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:58.540
expected to and that's that's what's

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:59.440
interesting to me I don't even know

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:03.820
where I'm going with this

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:05.560
for the most part well I all I'm saying

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:07.780
is that eventually when this twitch

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.910
YouTube thing ends which could be

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:12.220
tomorrow or you know a hundred years

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:15.130
from now probably closer to tomorrow but

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:17.800
we'll see I'm like in my head I have

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:19.270
like built up guilt from sleeping in so

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.580
much that I'm like I gotta work as like

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:23.710
a like a coal miner for a little while

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:26.020
or something I'm not saying that's a bad

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:27.190
job necessarily I'm just saying because

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:29.740
some of you might be listening to this

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:31.720
on your on your phone while you're

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:33.100
working in a coal mine probably not

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:37.150
being a miner that's not really my

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:40.810
demographic but you know you could work

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:42.670
in the administer to take that cool

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:44.290
elevator down every day with the

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:46.210
headlamp that would be like if I worked

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:47.920
ite at a coal mine I'd still be like

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:49.870
just give me a headlamp and let me take

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:54.580
the elevator with the real men like once

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:57.240
every couple of weeks please Austin last

00:18:54.580 --> 00:19:03.160
gray wolf is now playing Garry's Mod

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:06.430
it's like the start of a new era I know

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:08.440
Austin streams roughly like around the

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:10.590
time that I start recording most days

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:13.120
this is a great room by the way

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:14.800
it's always enter the gungeon or play

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.690
around on battlegrounds and I'm totally

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:20.140
okay with that I like Washington play

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:23.530
both to see Garry's Mod here it's a

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:29.770
surprise but a welcome one something

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:31.450
something Darth Sidious don't tell me I

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:34.570
pronounced it wrong I saw all three of

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:38.110
those movies and theaters okay and even

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:39.430
as the 13 year old may or may not have

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:45.550
had a thing for Natalie Portman

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:47.680
definitely did but who didn't first even

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:49.840
then though I was like back of the

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:53.770
clones pretty bad it's not a great movie

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:55.230
at all I thought I hit Q there there we

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:57.520
go

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:58.870
so the only thing I'm disappointed about

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:02.650
on this run right now you don't

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:04.870
understand dude okay she don't

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:07.720
understand what it was like to start

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:09.520
puberty around the time that Natalie

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:13.470
Portman was in Star Wars Episode two

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.470
attack of the clones it was a golden age

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:18.760
too much information

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:22.420
scram pokey go I didn't actually mean to

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:24.370
grab the spirit heart but that's okay

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:25.870
temperance similarly I just don't care

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:27.100
about but the only thing that

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:28.870
disappoints me on this run is that we

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.590
got too big too fast and now we're in

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:31.030
this situation

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:32.200
I freaking in a teleport card we can

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:34.120
make something happen with temperance

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:37.210
here but first we need that teleport

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:39.100
card so this this one makes you small

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:46.290
trying to take too many of those but it

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:46.290
doesn't matter too much nothing

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:50.000
we got too big too fast on this run we

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:51.500
have seven damage by the time we left

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.150
the first floor so now we're five floors

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:55.190
later I've got ten damage and I'm like

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:57.110
well this runs really slowed down well

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:58.820
have you considered using book of Belial

00:20:57.110 --> 00:21:00.950
and the item that's been in the game for

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:03.650
ten years and you should really know at

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:05.630
this point how to use this item and to

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:07.039
use this item every few rooms because I

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.840
mean why are you not using it doesn't

00:21:07.039 --> 00:21:10.429
make sense for you to not you see it

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:13.280
look I didn't come to YouTube to get

00:21:10.429 --> 00:21:15.440
back seated alright there's one thing

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:19.659
you know about Northern Line is that he

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:22.159
hates getting advice in the comments

00:21:19.659 --> 00:21:23.840
when as advice in the comments ever

00:21:22.159 --> 00:21:25.640
helped me well what about that time in a

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:27.530
Kerbal space program where you tried to

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:30.080
launch an airplane without having any

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:34.159
wheels you just use Stoke except for

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:38.299
that time and 1/2 tooth 1/2 mm other

00:21:34.159 --> 00:21:41.360
times I encourage you I dare you to come

00:21:38.299 --> 00:21:47.929
up with an example when the audience

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:49.940
feedback has ever helped me ok boss rush

00:21:47.929 --> 00:21:52.250
attempts this might not be a bad time to

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:55.640
fight Krampus yeah it's perfect actually

00:21:52.250 --> 00:22:00.500
so get lump of coal hopefully works well

00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:02.270
with tiny planet keep your keep your

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:05.870
spirit hearts as high as possible I

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:09.679
don't want Krampus head I will say it's

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:12.260
got to be a pretty good item to make me

00:22:09.679 --> 00:22:14.539
want to grab it here scabies is ok

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:16.789
varicose veins is okay but the rest of

00:22:14.539 --> 00:22:19.039
them it's just not worth it like boss

00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:20.900
rush if we don't have a teleport card

00:22:19.039 --> 00:22:22.490
and we're not killing waves like nearly

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:25.070
instantly and it's not a daily which I

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:31.400
should do some more up here maybe in the

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:35.590
future but I ain't interested too much

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:35.590
of an ask for not that much value

00:22:37.179 --> 00:22:47.330
just a grape sound right said nobody

00:22:43.099 --> 00:22:48.889
ever this run doesn't need anything and

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.599
from a commentary standpoint it puts me

00:22:48.889 --> 00:22:51.739
in a weird spot because I just got to

00:22:50.599 --> 00:22:54.259
keep going off on this weird tangent

00:22:51.739 --> 00:22:57.440
about how I don't respect other people

00:22:54.259 --> 00:22:59.989
who do my job or alternatively you know

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:01.759
bodily functions that gross a lot of no

00:22:59.989 --> 00:23:03.619
okay we did it I just don't wanna have

00:23:01.759 --> 00:23:05.269
to do that room again bodily functions

00:23:03.619 --> 00:23:09.289
that gross a lot of people out so it

00:23:05.269 --> 00:23:11.479
puts me in a weird situation you know no

00:23:09.289 --> 00:23:14.320
gappi items or really anything of value

00:23:11.479 --> 00:23:16.309
here whatsoever I'm gonna get hit oh

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.559
well no it was worth because we got a

00:23:16.309 --> 00:23:19.729
spear at hard not even a joke I'll take

00:23:18.559 --> 00:23:22.249
the spirit hard you never know when

00:23:19.729 --> 00:23:24.320
that's going to come in handy this might

00:23:22.249 --> 00:23:26.149
be another candidate for a hush run and

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:28.399
maybe a chance to redeem myself after

00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:30.259
the terrible decision I made in the hush

00:23:28.399 --> 00:23:32.029
fight you know one or two episodes ago I

00:23:30.259 --> 00:23:34.279
can't remember at this point the one

00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:35.869
where I accidentally I tried to do like

00:23:34.279 --> 00:23:39.109
an amazing dark Judas play but instead

00:23:35.869 --> 00:23:44.539
cost myself like you know eight Spirit

00:23:39.109 --> 00:23:50.269
arts or something I don't know let's

00:23:44.539 --> 00:23:52.940
move along here I can't believe I didn't

00:23:50.269 --> 00:23:54.979
get hit there I for impact like five

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.570
times you gonna make me reroll a good

00:23:54.979 --> 00:23:59.179
run you're gonna make me reroll a good

00:23:56.570 --> 00:24:04.279
run you know what I respect it we've got

00:23:59.179 --> 00:24:11.299
epic a crellick you got 46 damage we no

00:24:04.279 --> 00:24:15.529
longer have stompy 46 damage of course

00:24:11.299 --> 00:24:20.629
is 46 damage in homing if attack is very

00:24:15.529 --> 00:24:23.389
very good our HP is also fine this is

00:24:20.629 --> 00:24:26.570
the rare re-roll that's actually like oh

00:24:23.389 --> 00:24:28.450
no we're occasionally shooting out of

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:30.649
the back of ourselves

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:33.789
still with the relic once every four

00:24:30.649 --> 00:24:33.789
rooms this isn't a big deal

00:24:34.739 --> 00:24:39.519
it's one of the rare rerolls that's just

00:24:37.239 --> 00:24:44.889
like really good in every conceivable

00:24:39.519 --> 00:24:48.249
category I think which is again kind of

00:24:44.889 --> 00:24:49.809
like I'm looking for the same first run

00:24:48.249 --> 00:24:51.190
of the day I always like to start a

00:24:49.809 --> 00:24:52.989
little slow first video of the day

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:55.779
really I always like to start a little

00:24:52.989 --> 00:24:57.999
slow and then you know ease into it but

00:24:55.779 --> 00:25:02.679
really by like 30 minutes in which we

00:24:57.999 --> 00:25:07.589
basically are at this point I'm I'm down

00:25:02.679 --> 00:25:07.589
for some Zane I'm not afraid of the same

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:14.320
I'm warmed up I'm eager ready to go high

00:25:12.159 --> 00:25:18.179
eager I'm dad don't ever say that to me

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:22.239
okay I don't respect that dad joke as a

00:25:18.179 --> 00:25:27.570
classic purveyor of dad jokes the high

00:25:22.239 --> 00:25:29.320
blank I'm dad joke it renders you

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:34.269
excommunicate oh is that it will

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:36.700
incommunicado persona non-grata can

00:25:34.269 --> 00:25:40.359
enter a boat race as they said on flight

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:43.450
of the conchords okay take the pill we

00:25:40.359 --> 00:25:48.839
used to have PhD we still do what we

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:50.829
used to to HP is a little dangerous but

00:25:48.839 --> 00:25:53.259
only if we end up hurting ourselves

00:25:50.829 --> 00:25:54.459
which well be likely only if we end up

00:25:53.259 --> 00:25:56.259
hurting ourselves which can happen

00:25:54.459 --> 00:25:57.459
obviously and did literally just have

00:25:56.259 --> 00:25:59.049
them with ipecac but that was just me

00:25:57.459 --> 00:26:00.459
trying to illustrate a point of how

00:25:59.049 --> 00:26:01.209
dangerous things could be if we stopped

00:26:00.459 --> 00:26:02.979
paying attention

00:26:01.209 --> 00:26:04.869
now that we've Illustrated that point

00:26:02.979 --> 00:26:08.559
there is no need for us to make that

00:26:04.869 --> 00:26:11.769
same mistake in the future love having

00:26:08.559 --> 00:26:13.959
good speed and I'm not talking about a

00:26:11.769 --> 00:26:17.139
speed stat I'm talking about have you

00:26:13.959 --> 00:26:18.459
heard of this methamphetamines general

00:26:17.139 --> 00:26:19.929
is going to be a Jay Leno joke in there

00:26:18.459 --> 00:26:22.229
somewhere but I can't compose it at

00:26:19.929 --> 00:26:22.229
runtime

00:26:25.179 --> 00:26:30.729
yeah I heard that manufacturing a

00:26:28.269 --> 00:26:34.419
million said amine in the Golden

00:26:30.729 --> 00:26:37.979
Triangle of Laos very je yeah it's

00:26:34.419 --> 00:26:41.889
called speed to cruise control speed to

00:26:37.979 --> 00:26:44.979
cruise control thank you for the spirit

00:26:41.889 --> 00:26:52.779
heart we do occasionally have Loki's

00:26:44.979 --> 00:26:56.759
horn plus I think it's Loki's horn at

00:26:52.779 --> 00:26:59.409
least Plus bookworm yeah which is I

00:26:56.759 --> 00:27:01.179
wouldn't say necessarily causing

00:26:59.409 --> 00:27:02.529
problems but you can see how it could

00:27:01.179 --> 00:27:05.080
cause problems because there's not very

00:27:02.529 --> 00:27:09.009
many safe places to stand when you're

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:11.409
shooting a bomb out of four parts of

00:27:09.009 --> 00:27:14.289
your face really the only safe place to

00:27:11.409 --> 00:27:17.019
stand is like within maybe the middle

00:27:14.289 --> 00:27:20.759
25% of the level so we just got to try

00:27:17.019 --> 00:27:20.759
to minimize the amount of damage we take

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:24.759
kind of hoping to be greed actually

00:27:22.869 --> 00:27:25.929
although I don't know why now that I

00:27:24.759 --> 00:27:30.639
think about it what do we get out of a

00:27:25.929 --> 00:27:35.200
greed fight at this point but I think it

00:27:30.639 --> 00:27:39.309
becomes almost a numbers game at this

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:40.989
point if we're able to minimize the

00:27:39.309 --> 00:27:42.789
amount of damage we take in preventable

00:27:40.989 --> 00:27:43.690
situations and then just accept that

00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:46.629
we're going to take it in some

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:49.109
unpreventable situations that might tip

00:27:46.629 --> 00:27:51.789
the scales enough for us to be able to

00:27:49.109 --> 00:27:53.080
to win this run with relative comfort I

00:27:51.789 --> 00:27:55.830
think either way we got a good chance to

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.830
win but

00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:03.250
that was pretty dumb yeah I think either

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:07.480
way we've got a good chance to win but

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:09.100
to win that as comfortably as possible I

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:11.020
see that turret up there there's just no

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:13.240
means for me to grab it so I'm just

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:16.270
trying to stay mobile like track three

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:18.160
up of who's next from 1972 it did lose

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:19.690
our eternal heart but I'm out I think

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.790
it's clear I cannot actually fight the

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:23.830
hush in the situation reliably so I

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:24.400
think we should bounce and and save

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:30.340
ourselves

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:33.630
mmm digging on me let's go we could also

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:37.570
I mean even then I wasn't trying to hit

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:38.950
we could try to just go thank you in for

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:41.490
me take advantage of the fact that we

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:44.620
have rotten baby and 46 damaged so our

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:48.520
flies will crush it and we could just

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:50.680
shoot to miss in some situations at

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:52.840
least if it looks like shooting the hit

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:56.610
would hurt us then we could shoot to

00:28:52.840 --> 00:29:03.850
miss actually hematemesis is really good

00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:05.290
guaranteed at least one HP back see

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:09.930
that's what bothers me is that situation

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:09.930
right there because what can you do

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:24.940
don't remember what this does it's

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:29.139
occasional halitosis maybe suffocation

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:31.960
no breathing give me a brush in some

00:29:29.139 --> 00:29:33.070
mouthwash Listerine nning duty duty duty

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:37.330
position

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:38.860
I can't every time I hear last resort

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:42.669
which is very rare and always

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:46.529
self-inflicted in the modern era I can't

00:29:42.669 --> 00:29:50.230
hear it without hearing the mashup we

00:29:46.529 --> 00:29:51.419
conceived of where it's Papa Roach and

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:55.240
box-like

00:29:51.419 --> 00:29:59.529
viola concert Oh cut my life into pieces

00:29:55.240 --> 00:30:02.379
this is my last resort suffocation no

00:29:59.529 --> 00:30:06.330
breathing don't give up if I cut my arm

00:30:02.379 --> 00:30:07.899
bringing dududududu dudududududu

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:09.789
dudududududududududududu

00:30:07.899 --> 00:30:12.419
you know they always use that in like

00:30:09.789 --> 00:30:15.429
commercials for frozen lasagna and stuff

00:30:12.419 --> 00:30:17.289
but like deluxe frozen lasagna I'm not

00:30:15.429 --> 00:30:19.480
talking about those you know 70 cents

00:30:17.289 --> 00:30:24.000
per lasagna the meal I'm talking about

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:24.000
the like you know 250 per lasagna meal

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:34.780
let's go okay we should be fine I mean

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:36.580
it is a faster autumn you got very fast

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:39.100
to start with and then it just keeps

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:41.590
getting faster that's weird you don't

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:43.210
normally get a different style chest

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:47.010
down here these are terrible by the way

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:51.760
but like Brown nugget is sort of okay

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:54.970
wow what a just colossal waste of me to

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:56.530
take that what a colossal waste of a

00:30:54.970 --> 00:31:02.770
chest floor are you kidding me with

00:30:56.530 --> 00:31:04.720
these low keys horn shoves our luck stat

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:08.080
is also zero so I'm not expecting much

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:09.690
help and we have curse of the unknown so

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:15.610
really like if there was ever a time

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:20.620
that it seemed likely or plausible that

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:22.960
we could die it would be right now the

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:24.280
Run has been this final floor at least

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.590
has been constructed in such a way that

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:31.030
it should be conceivable that we would

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:32.410
lose which is very annoying for me it

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:34.000
really did take the perfect storm

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:35.860
starring john c reilly and george

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.420
clooney to make this happen so I think

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:39.670
we're at four plus one right now I'm

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:43.350
going to try to keep like a running

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:47.410
count just to use hematemesis properly

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:49.240
so I think we're at four plus two that

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:51.280
just means I mean it's not like it's a

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:58.110
standardized nomenclature but it means

00:31:51.280 --> 00:32:01.360
to me that we've got four red hearts and

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:03.010
one all I rotated the other way and one

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.720
spirit on I think we're four plus one

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:07.180
keep that in mind The Rime we designed

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:10.840
to explain in due time let me get to

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:14.490
like one plus one or alternatively as

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:14.490
the mathematicians like to call it -

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:19.600
we'll probably use it just because I

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:22.170
want to build in some errors so I think

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.170
we're at four

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:29.030
know where it's six actually okay

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:34.340
phantasms great that we know read at

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:38.840
least six no I don't want moms it does I

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:40.670
mean it doesn't really matters but I

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.450
don't want this one I didn't sign up for

00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:45.380
this one

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:46.730
wish I could disable Loki's horn get out

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.440
of here I don't want you anymore

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:51.580
if that's moving up then I'm moving out

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:51.580
at the BRIT six plus one

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.270
we're six I mean prepare Rebecca great

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:05.340
five prepare for some of the worst

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:07.500
commentary you've ever seen in an NL

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:09.300
episode and you're going to be like

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:11.730
don't worry NL I lived through nokey

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:13.530
meta yeah this isn't going to be no kima

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:15.750
it's going to be like episode 90 player

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:18.540
unknowns battlegrounds level you got a

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:23.220
laugh at yourself okay that's the thing

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:24.900
I have actually forgotten what our HP

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:27.270
was that now maybe we're like 4 plus 1 5

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:28.950
plus 1 somewhere in there please just

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:35.730
give me full HP so I never have to worry

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:37.590
about it well I would have loved for

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:39.960
that last one to have not been picked up

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:41.730
just so we would have known that we were

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:44.310
at max age people whatever let's just

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:46.920
stick to standard NL style now we're at

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:48.330
max HP standard NL style is you know let

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.770
the chips fall where they may

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:51.870
I love it when your deuces are wild

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:54.810
other songs about gambling luck be a

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:57.030
lady tonight what does that mean wait a

00:33:54.810 --> 00:34:00.270
minute this is a bit that's dawned on me

00:33:57.030 --> 00:34:02.640
as I'm saying it here every Aerosmith

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:05.730
song is about intercourse even you know

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:07.650
you know I've been crying Justin again

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:09.360
and you know don't want to miss a thing

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:10.530
all of them loving an elevator that's

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:11.700
the only one that's not that one's

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:14.670
actually just about working at an

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:17.160
elevator manufacturing plant because

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:19.230
he's loving an elevator

00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:20.940
living it up well we'll go in down

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:23.730
because the stair market is heating up

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:25.920
in elevators you know it used to be back

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:27.090
in the day you know you're really rich

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:28.230
you buy a mansion you get your own

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:30.510
elevator put in it

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:32.150
this place you know not anymore people

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:35.580
are trying to be healthier these days

00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:37.020
they might get a stair lift you know but

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:40.730
they're not going to get an elevator in

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:43.560
this modern era just doesn't make sense

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:45.030
wait so when Steven Tyler says I love it

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:50.130
when you're deuces are wild it really

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:53.610
sounds like is he not making the the

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:54.690
assumption that perhaps this is a song

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:56.310
about anal intercourse

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:57.540
I didn't bring my cell phone here

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:59.820
otherwise I'd look into the lyrics let

00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:01.800
me do I don't remember the lyrics at all

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:04.620
it's just another when you deuces are

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:08.040
well yeah and something something loving

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:09.600
so if I en I love to look into your big

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.230
brown eyes they talk to me and seem that

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:18.570
you're

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:24.540
big brown eyes oh he's done it wake up

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:26.100
sheeple they talked to me and seemed to

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:29.100
hypnotize you say the things nobody

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:32.250
dares to say I'm not about to let you

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:35.190
fly away my lover with no jet lag we

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:36.660
stay up all night in my sleeping bag you

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:39.210
got a heart beating rhythm from the

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:45.450
subterranean I really love your little

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:49.230
girl I don't need to explain dude I'm

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:51.330
telling you I love you because you do

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:53.450
such a wild girl like a double-shot of

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:56.730
love and so fine what's a double-shot um

00:35:53.450 --> 00:36:00.000
as far as I'm concerned go to Starbucks

00:35:56.730 --> 00:36:02.250
that's a number two okay so I might be

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.640
making like a little stretch but he does

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:09.390
it the songs about deuces as in dropping

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:11.100
a deuce and it's wild so I think you

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:13.080
know what he's saying there and then

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:17.940
secondly he loves looking into her big

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:20.190
brown I think about it it's just like

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:22.680
mud on the tires that country music song

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:25.200
you know and with a little luck we might

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:26.700
just get stuck with a little mud on the

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.690
tail kay we're done thanks for watching

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:29.880
