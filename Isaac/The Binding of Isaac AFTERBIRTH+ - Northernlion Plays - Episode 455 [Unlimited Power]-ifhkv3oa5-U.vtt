##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.609
everybody welcome back northern land

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.919
places binding buddy a trip plus we

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.019
should do a great ear I mean I can put

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.519
on airs all day but the greedy runs have

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.370
gotta happen at some point you know we

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.230
can use Allosaurus I could also use an

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.130
acquiescence of Twitter here cuz I don't

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.949
care about the bloomberg news what does

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.960
the tax cut mean for Silicon Valley

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.460
businesses they even just saying it puts

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:33.559
me in the Tom Waits voice I had so many

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:37.230
tax cuts I think I need a tax band-aid

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.329
what's cool is Aris I'm ready um we

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.910
messed up our hour last night it was a

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.390
keeper run didn't necessarily go that

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.660
well but any we did okay cause 7c 3 are

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.329
0 I I'm a little stunned that we died on

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.879
that run despite having like infinity HP

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.969
on the final boss but there on the room

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.379
which we died that's how the cookie

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.730
crumbles sometimes you might as well

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.859
take equality right it's like you get

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.300
doubled consumable drops as long as you

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.350
have an equal number of consumables

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.110
which we immediately threw away might as

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.580
well check this cuz we want to like

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:18.780
eventually lose our lives as Lazarus to

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:23.640
begin with is double the way we'll hold

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.070
up because I'm thinking about this and

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.540
I'm thinking about those beans well

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.250
that's already doubled consumable so I

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.220
think actually equality is now worth

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.470
nothing but up until that's hey don't

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.860
take that out of context though let's

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.060
try this an could be worse bad but it

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.700
could be worse let's let's get this

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.200
taken care of um because what I was

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.759
thinking is that all coins should be

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.659
doubled like by default now but

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.729
apparently that's not how that works so

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.740
I mean I guess I'm gonna try something

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.090
I'm gonna trip well no it doesn't make

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.350
any sense like I'm trying to run through

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.509
the math in my head I'm like well just

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.439
don't pick up any coins and then buy a

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.939
bomb and a key for as many as you need

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.590
to buy to get yourself up to like an

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.420
equal level of each and I'm okay but how

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.009
am I gonna do that if I don't pick up

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.670
any coins what I'm gonna buy it with my

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.890
credit card

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.780
doesn't make any dang sense play

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.770
equality is like a really good trinket

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.780
but it's

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.430
like the effect is really good but did

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.320
you say worth the squeeze mostly the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.010
time like early in the game if you have

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.020
zero or one of everything sure but like

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.550
apart from that we kind of approach a

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.140
ridiculous level not to mention that if

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.340
it doubles your consumables every time

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.720
you pick up a consumable it's going to

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.470
put you further away from that equality

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.570
standpoint so not saying it's bad even

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.430
though I just said the juice ain't worth

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.630
the squeeze it's just like it's it's way

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.170
too finicky to enable for the most part

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.980
it's one of those ones where you like

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.800
doesn't make any sense

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.990
just it's it's too tough to fit it into

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.940
the the average North American workday

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.410
you know so we'll look to replace it if

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.570
we ever get to the point like we want to

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.490
have like you know sometimes thirty

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.060
cents if we can have 30 cents thirty

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.740
bombs and thirty keys sign me up

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.360
think my odds are relatively low of

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.720
making that happen on the regular I

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:15.390
could be wrong dude who is ripping up

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:20.490
this keytar solo because it is crushing

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.350
it um excuse me sir use me for the

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:29.160
second time my friend I do not allow

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:30.630
this and I would prefer if you could

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.750
just acquiesce for the moment we're

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.580
gonna have eight cents plus four we're

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.220
gonna have 12 cents we don't need to buy

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.500
a key so we'll probably just gonna step

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.660
on the next wave we do want to die as

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.520
Lazarus but I think you can greed or

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.810
greedy or for that matter you pretty

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.280
much just want to wait until the first

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.710
deal with the devil to do it I mean the

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.110
d4 is potentially really good here as

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.240
well

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.290
donation machine hmm

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.660
that's like a regular donation machine

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.790
so the d4 is fun but I just want to let

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.400
you know we're gonna have like infinite

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.990
d4 opportunities in the future we'll use

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.850
the d4 so much and Isaac you're gonna

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.680
become sick of it I don't need to use it

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.680
on this Lazarus run but I kind of think

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.950
we should do is take deals with the

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.989
devils should they exist and then maybe

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.190
give ourselves the ability to buy that

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.920
HP that's in

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.620
err I don't love spending 15 cents on HP

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:31.530
but kind of gotta do what you gotta do

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:35.610
you know no bombs this wave actually is

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.800
like not that bad right now a lot of

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.950
riffraff but not many of these enemies

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.390
really bring the heat too much so

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.890
somewhat unconcerned you know the the

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.260
little Stephen who's chasing us around

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.870
is actually the most annoying and then

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.720
the Polly cephalopods or whatever you

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:55.290
would like to call the manipulator

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:58.050
multiplicities formed extremely non

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.690
tanky a little annoying with the shots

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.210
but otherwise no big deal it's gonna

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.770
take us a while but greedy your first

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.540
floor like always takes you awhile

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.120
unless you start with Polyphemus or

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:12.690
something like that so not sweating it

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:17.400
too much I think little Steven has been

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:20.190
destroyed which means we can focus on

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.440
these guys when they pop up speed up our

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.529
run quite greatly

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.529
[Music]

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.300
we're gonna get another two plus two

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.919
plus three now there's seven cents takes

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.590
us to 29 now it's actually only gonna

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:39.530
take us to 28 because it's six cents so

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.259
we'll only be able to buy one item and

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.610
it will probably be the HP and then

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:51.319
we'll pick up the key maybe so I think

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:55.430
this is a good chariot opportunity yeah

00:05:51.319 --> 00:06:01.660
that felt right okay we can still do

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:04.639
this uh first just gamble your HP away

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.740
gave us rosary bead I guess we might as

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.780
well try to roll it it's a faith upgrade

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:13.099
it's not gonna be very relevant I

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:15.500
suppose we'll take book of sin and hope

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:18.530
for a red heart or a pill that gives us

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:21.470
red hearts ah dude that's like actually

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.539
fantastic obviously we want taro cloth

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:28.870
as well but to get like the maximum

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:33.880
possible use out of this demon judgement

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:37.490
we shouldn't necessarily take it yet

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.509
it's a key bagger I mean we do kind of

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.610
want to die

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:43.310
on this floor so we can get the damage

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.599
multiplier but we could walk into fires

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:49.849
or something and make that happen

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:51.710
regardless probably I'd rather see what

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:54.020
this guy pays out with and unfortunately

00:06:51.710 --> 00:07:01.550
it's just caffeine pill with it tears

00:06:54.020 --> 00:07:04.539
down crate will take taro cloth devil

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.539
cards probably better

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.810
then yeah just walk into the fires we

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.990
have the same amount of HP it just gives

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:17.030
us the damage up so we'll take that then

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.920
we'll take this and we'll head down to

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.070
the next floor probably will get a key

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.570
but we'll get a key on the next floor

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.890
because it could be three cents probably

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:27.380
pretty minor in the whole scheme of

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.940
things but this is not that bad I mean

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.410
we haven't started very strong selling

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.870
weed you know with the first round pick

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:35.720
you know we take Steph Curry it's more

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:39.920
like you know with the number 17 pick in

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:43.940
the NHL draft we take Brendan Saad like

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:45.590
it's it's not an instant generational

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.630
talent sort of situation but it's not

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:49.190
that bad

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:51.560
we'd like to buy a bomb could pay for

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:55.190
itself pretty quickly do we want more HP

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:57.860
the honest answer there is not really I

00:07:55.190 --> 00:08:00.410
don't like to purchase HP Jacob's Ladder

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:05.570
by the way is fantastic of course but I

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:08.090
don't really like to purchase HP much

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:09.560
prefer to just grab it from the item

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:12.070
rooms and we'll probably have enough of

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:14.360
those showing up to give us a chance but

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.500
we could have taken the tower card into

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.750
the shop there that might have been for

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:21.530
the best what I am gonna do is with our

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:23.570
newfound electrical damage plus taro

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:26.780
cloth I'm gonna try to beat this whole

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:28.040
wave without having to leave so we can

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:31.880
take advantage of this you know like

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:33.169
seven almost eight actually damage here

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.540
but if we can do this I think we're well

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:37.130
on our way to having a successful floor

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:38.930
here and for now we're not even looking

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.250
at the long tail you know we're not

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:41.540
thinking about what we're gonna have for

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.590
Christmas dinner yet we're thinking

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:45.260
about what we're eating tonight

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:47.630
I don't want to have another dinner of

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:52.450
you know saltine crackers and Kraft

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:52.450
singles overlaid on a single paper plate

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:58.270
appreciate that red heart instead we're

00:08:55.810 --> 00:09:01.740
looking to you know maybe dress up a

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:04.150
little bit he does chicken cordon bleu

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.010
sorry that's a little too spicy for me

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:09.550
can I just get a glass of milk and

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:11.050
peanut butter sandwich once you get a

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:16.390
little bit more HP we can handle the

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:19.240
capsaicin we're handling this pretty

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:21.190
well though I was gonna say I thought I

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.130
saw like a little pin face appear for a

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:28.960
Flickr window equals onload function

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:30.700
parentheses curly braces etc etc so this

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.620
is our deal with the devil wave so you

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:35.470
got to be a little cautious if it's a to

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:37.900
hard deal we just can't take it this

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:39.670
went very well okay one devil card per

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:42.120
floor could do a lot of work for us with

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:42.120
Tarot cloth

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:53.010
what do we need above all else like I

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:57.720
mean making our temporary damage

00:09:53.010 --> 00:10:04.260
permanent would be swell if we could get

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:05.850
a thank you if we could get a tears

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:08.640
upgrade to compensate for the tears

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:12.960
downgrade that'd be something so I think

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:16.080
we got a like science is not worth it

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:17.730
here we obviously just can't take the

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.340
ability to fly at least not yet

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:22.920
I want to try something though take

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:25.260
little horn and then use that I really

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:29.370
wanted that to be an HP upgrade instead

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:31.710
life's looking fairly dangerous we'll

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:34.430
take this HP upgrade don't need a speed

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:37.740
upgrade I don't think we need BFF either

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:39.450
so we basically paid 15 cents for little

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:43.110
horn when you put it that way it doesn't

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:49.530
seem like that bad of a deal as we head

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:52.950
down to the next floor here I don't know

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:54.420
though a little scared it itches dude I

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:56.220
got to look up like what metal plate

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.140
does this willful ignorance has gone on

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.580
too long and ELLs getting the reputation

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:02.460
he doesn't want to learn no I don't want

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:06.360
a metal plate from lowe's canada metal

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:07.980
plate isaac passive collectible grants

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.990
one soul heart enemies shots have a

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.270
chance to be deflected as confusion

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:15.150
causing shots that use Isaac's tear

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:17.220
damage and effects okay that's cool does

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:19.680
it also like it infamies those shots as

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:22.200
well I'm hoping at least so are soul

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.720
heart don't mind giving it up to go to

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.150
that curse room if we have to don't

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:30.930
really want to purchase more HP I'm

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:33.330
drowsy is a great pill actually what

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:35.700
else you got the d1 doubles up

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:37.590
consumable it's not that good not not on

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:42.270
greedier in like the regular game it can

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:44.190
be actually very excellent but I might

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.610
be just being uncreated it might be fine

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:48.490
for us here in this situation

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:50.290
but let's try i'm drowsy really like the

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:53.230
theme of this run is getting a lot of

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:54.370
value out of so far at least getting a

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:57.700
lot of value out of these like

00:11:54.370 --> 00:12:00.880
one-time-use consumables you know that

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:04.930
said the positive of greedier mode is

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:07.990
that you get this one big room if you

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:12.010
can leverage something that has a one

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:13.779
room only use to maybe buy you a little

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:15.370
time to get traditionally strong that's

00:12:13.779 --> 00:12:19.149
pretty cool this is like a strong

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:20.829
tactical decision i'm drowsy is one it's

00:12:19.149 --> 00:12:23.769
not quite a chaos card level obviously

00:12:20.829 --> 00:12:26.350
but it's one of the best single-use

00:12:23.769 --> 00:12:28.180
consumables in the game i think the only

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:31.089
problem is it's usually unidentified

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:32.320
until you actually use it once so you

00:12:31.089 --> 00:12:33.399
know you never know that i mean that

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:37.420
would've been a good opportunity to use

00:12:33.399 --> 00:12:40.000
the d one maybe but you never know if

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:43.180
it's gonna be I'm drowsy until you use

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.279
it for the first time rarely do you get

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:54.720
more than one I'm drowsy pills on the

00:12:45.279 --> 00:12:54.720
same run so this must be the exception

00:12:56.279 --> 00:13:02.230
well first wave when very simply here

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.820
we're still waiting on something like 10

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:05.890
out of 10 items I think I underestimated

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:07.930
little horn it's been doing good work

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:10.690
for us we're gonna keep fighting for now

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:12.970
because it's way way way way too early

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:15.310
for us to leave and have to use our base

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:16.540
damage to kill enemies so it's a red

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:18.220
heart that hopefully we'll never be able

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.690
to use but it is the thought that counts

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:22.300
keep in mind we really don't have much

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.589
of a reason to donate here in fact I

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.790
don't think we have any reason to donate

00:13:23.589 --> 00:13:27.790
because we already got our donation

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:33.269
machine in greed the 999 so while the

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:37.769
999 plus we garnered no value from it

00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:37.769
we're just gonna keep coasting in here

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:45.259
remember when you used to be able to

00:13:43.129 --> 00:13:47.899
gain monstro to occasionally I sleep

00:13:45.259 --> 00:13:49.879
into isaac nostalgia used to just be

00:13:47.899 --> 00:13:51.529
able to go back and forth like you know

00:13:49.879 --> 00:14:01.310
the final track up off of dismemberment

00:13:51.529 --> 00:14:05.420
plans 1999 album emergency and i now

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:07.250
they've retweet does AI and i got to be

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:09.560
honest if you put me up against monstro

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:14.000
two's new AI in an IQ test i don't like

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:15.800
my odds that's why i maintain plausible

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.439
deniability by just skirting the

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:22.879
challenge to begin with dude is alt if

00:14:21.439 --> 00:14:29.060
you put me up against him in the laser

00:14:22.879 --> 00:14:31.069
shooting contest he's got me but in

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:34.459
terms of matrix multiplication who knows

00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:38.329
all I know is the matrix 2 equals the

00:14:34.459 --> 00:14:41.089
matrix 1 multiplied by 0 that's all I

00:14:38.329 --> 00:14:43.430
know about matrix multiplication but

00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:52.990
valuate that expression it comes out to

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:58.519
be true I promise you that please ok

00:14:52.990 --> 00:15:02.990
successfully and successfully handle

00:14:58.519 --> 00:15:04.399
this floor I don't think we can take

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:07.129
cambia conception it's just not that

00:15:04.399 --> 00:15:08.389
good dark matter is like doing crazy

00:15:07.129 --> 00:15:09.559
work for us here from a damage

00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:13.610
standpoint though let's head down to the

00:15:09.559 --> 00:15:17.839
next floor we're still waiting on stats

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:20.779
here mostly rate of fire damage is

00:15:17.839 --> 00:15:25.490
looking good HP we could use a little

00:15:20.779 --> 00:15:28.069
bit more and a 3-cent key would be nice

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:29.329
as well and meat is like HP a little bit

00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:30.860
of damage because of the damage

00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:31.399
multiplier is actually better than I

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.410
expected

00:15:31.399 --> 00:15:35.300
and there's the moneymaker right there

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:38.059
and that might be a little bit of a

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:40.160
moneymaker by itself as well is a blue

00:15:38.059 --> 00:15:43.459
cap for another tears upgrade and then

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:46.009
another tears upgrade I'll summon an

00:15:43.459 --> 00:15:50.569
even larger tears upgrade now this is

00:15:46.009 --> 00:15:53.809
like beyond acceptable blank room I

00:15:50.569 --> 00:15:55.490
think you save this because blank card

00:15:53.809 --> 00:15:58.010
is a history of showing up this

00:15:55.490 --> 00:16:00.020
way that the Barenaked Ladies Steven

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:04.610
page has a history of taking off his

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:05.870
shirt in the song one week blank art is

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:08.750
a history of showing up we've actually

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:10.580
like raised our damage by a lot since

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:12.709
the last time we fired and doubled our

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:15.020
rate of fire so our dps is like more

00:16:12.709 --> 00:16:16.459
than two times greater than it was more

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:26.270
than two times the value that it used to

00:16:16.459 --> 00:16:28.220
be I should say you know what's cool

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.630
or what would be a cool design space

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.940
that I think the game is not explored

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:33.320
yet it's just like they've done a lot

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.450
with Isaac in the fact that booster

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:37.640
packs keep coming out as awesome why are

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:39.380
there not more items though that give

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:41.330
you an effect when you use your space

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:45.470
bar item you know like what about a

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:48.170
passive item that gives you trying to

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:50.209
think of a good example here it gives

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:53.089
you like a damage bonus for the room

00:16:50.209 --> 00:16:54.860
when you use your space bar item you

00:16:53.089 --> 00:16:56.060
know it drops a penny whenever you used

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:59.000
your space bar I was gonna say drop a

00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:01.459
heart but then like that cannibalizes a

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.819
couple items in the game I don't think

00:17:01.459 --> 00:17:13.130
our tear cap has been raised so I don't

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:15.079
really want to buy mr. Dahle yet like

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:16.490
there are other I was just thinking cuz

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:18.140
whenever book of sin gives you a battery

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:21.530
and like feels like a waste of time but

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:23.059
there are items that give you an effect

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:25.040
when you use your space bar items but

00:17:23.059 --> 00:17:28.220
all of those items I to the best of my

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:30.140
memory at least are connected to the

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:33.290
charge itself like you know triple-a

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:34.400
battery gives you well that actually

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:36.050
that doesn't give you a charge when the

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.400
user at a nine volt gives you a charge

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:39.890
when you use your item use you like one

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:42.160
tick towards getting fully recharged

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.160
again

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:48.550
car battery gives you 2 uses whenever

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.320
you use your spacebar I mean that's cool

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:53.380
but it's something a little bit more

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:55.330
boring for the you know for the rest of

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.710
us here put the people that are into

00:17:55.330 --> 00:18:00.300
that sort of stuff gives you a penny

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:00.300
every time you use your spacebar item

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:07.150
you get some broken synergies there you

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:08.560
know if you get like telepathy or

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:09.730
something like that okay maybe that's

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.460
the reason they don't want to put it in

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:13.750
the game lord knows if you had enough

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:15.820
money you can buy whatever you wanted

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:20.830
from the shop including like many many

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:25.090
redundant mapping items got I actually

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:27.250
like a hate fighting scolex we're

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:34.480
getting into NL's complaining hour here

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:40.660
but like this boss is too invincible too

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:42.130
frequently the only time especially the

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:45.090
champion version this is the only time

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:52.900
you can get damage done is right there

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:54.670
is this no this is not deal with it's

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:57.210
not deal with the devil wave my favorite

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.210
genre of music

00:18:59.529 --> 00:19:05.690
so our stats have gotten up there

00:19:01.639 --> 00:19:09.639
admittedly that was done admittedly our

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:09.639
stats don't have to be that that good

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:16.039
because we have Jacob's Ladder it's

00:19:14.179 --> 00:19:18.730
gonna do a ton of extra work for us

00:19:16.039 --> 00:19:21.409
beyond what our you know actual DPS is

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:24.460
but we could really use like a little

00:19:21.409 --> 00:19:24.460
bit more than we got

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:31.340
not even HP like this is just I would

00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:32.809
love to say that cuz I get a you know

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:35.090
some pleasure out of being critical

00:19:32.809 --> 00:19:36.769
about myself as well or at least some

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:37.850
information about it you know I get some

00:19:36.769 --> 00:19:39.200
knowledge out of it

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:40.879
I would love to say that I'm playing

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.789
like garbage here but to be honest

00:19:40.879 --> 00:19:45.889
double cage is just like trash to your

00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:49.250
enemies as well not saying I'm innocent

00:19:45.889 --> 00:19:51.919
but we'll use the guys will hold blank

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:53.929
yeah we should use on Sue's to see

00:19:51.919 --> 00:19:55.070
secret rooms maybe but then take blank

00:19:53.929 --> 00:20:03.590
rune with you because I think that we

00:19:55.070 --> 00:20:07.610
could fairly easily run into a situation

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:09.110
where we get some relevancy there all we

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:11.419
need is blank card

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:14.769
none of these are worth it none of those

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:18.350
are worth it in my opinion at least hey

00:20:14.769 --> 00:20:19.549
I mean you could make a case for batwing

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:22.340
if it comes through in the clutch it's

00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:24.379
gonna be big raaah liver might be worth

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:26.450
it if you buy this first and just see

00:20:24.379 --> 00:20:29.679
what you get you get one everything on

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:31.730
the house or other thing is blank room

00:20:29.679 --> 00:20:34.870
there's a year arune

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:38.590
we now have like eight credit cards and

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:38.590
several batteries let's

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:44.220
okay you're being a little ridiculous

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:48.450
okay I mean it just turned out extremely

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:50.250
well wait two of diamonds credit card

00:20:48.450 --> 00:21:02.990
because the thing on the ground is two

00:20:50.250 --> 00:21:07.370
of diamonds Oh Lord okay this is pretty

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:10.890
excellent to be honest with you

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:13.680
what is this trinket extension cord

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:18.810
charged friends maybe when our familiars

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:20.370
get hit they generate the charges for us

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:22.550
not that we have any familiars to begin

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:22.550
with

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:37.650
so this is basically how you break greed

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:40.410
mode keep in mind we got several credit

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:41.520
cards it's only credit cards but that's

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:51.360
alright because there's one more two of

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:54.360
diamonds that we can purchase now I mean

00:21:51.360 --> 00:22:00.710
we should basically credit card credit

00:21:54.360 --> 00:22:03.300
bye bye and then get a rear old

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:06.750
it's a shame we use so many rerolls but

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:08.640
then you know bye wait wait I didn't

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:10.470
yeah I didn't have to purchase those but

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.940
it's actually fine you still have two

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:18.650
credit cards left in the ground yeah so

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:18.650
let's like buy it buy it

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:28.280
credit card speeds fine we could take

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:30.810
the HP if we want to get starter deck I

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:34.770
was really hoping that'd be another era

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:37.710
but life goes on alright so I think we

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:44.130
should leave the floor with two credit

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:45.510
cards cuz I don't like these items that

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:46.680
much and I'd rather get stuff for free

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:48.480
like right off the bed

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:50.090
so I mean our stats are a lot better

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:53.220
than they were a little while ago

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:55.200
including HP that was just really lucky

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:58.650
that it was you know blank blank rune

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.820
was Yara plus Tarot cloth created a

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:03.270
situation in which we were like

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:05.250
extraordinarily set so keep him eat fine

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:07.680
Guppies head better than book of sin

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:11.510
should have taken hive mind it's a good

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:11.510
lesson to learn and then this guy

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:20.769
it's gonna say don't don't you give me

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:20.769
that two of diamonds again it's too much

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:27.139
okay so with credit card do we want this

00:23:24.499 --> 00:23:27.559
wave yeah I mean you get the mark for

00:23:27.139 --> 00:23:29.659
free

00:23:27.559 --> 00:23:32.149
you gotta check this first though ace of

00:23:29.659 --> 00:23:35.450
clubs not that good maybe we didn't have

00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:39.139
to check it first but um sure yeah so

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:42.879
credit card take the mark it's decent

00:23:39.139 --> 00:23:47.869
take mom's underwear locust of conquest

00:23:42.879 --> 00:23:51.109
it's an ace of clubs and a Hanged Man so

00:23:47.869 --> 00:24:01.700
I'm gonna need hangman Stephen is a

00:23:51.109 --> 00:24:06.320
really nice damage upgrade but we can

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:07.909
also reroll you know what I want to kind

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:12.399
of check in here first we'll lose the

00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:12.399
ability to fly but don't mind too much

00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:17.419
throw a bomb down here I don't think we

00:24:15.259 --> 00:24:19.629
need damage is that okay you know what

00:24:17.419 --> 00:24:22.779
that's a new item so I think I should

00:24:19.629 --> 00:24:25.700
endeavour to take it so we get Stephen

00:24:22.779 --> 00:24:27.289
seven seals why did I think that I've

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:29.570
never seen this item before did they

00:24:27.289 --> 00:24:31.279
change the icon or is my brain finally

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:34.070
broken don't answer that

00:24:31.279 --> 00:24:37.609
um empress he's decent right so try to

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:40.820
get another reroll here shears is lovely

00:24:37.609 --> 00:24:42.879
but we don't need it we could afford to

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:45.259
wait for something a little bit more

00:24:42.879 --> 00:24:47.869
fantastic and honestly Holy Light kind

00:24:45.259 --> 00:24:49.429
of fits the bill actually Tammy's head

00:24:47.869 --> 00:24:52.489
we haven't used it in a little while

00:24:49.429 --> 00:24:54.619
even though usually when we get it we

00:24:52.489 --> 00:24:58.119
use it forever um I think this could be

00:24:54.619 --> 00:24:58.119
a fun set up for us

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:10.289
yeah yeah I can live with this so I

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:14.220
think we've hit that like fairly easy

00:25:10.289 --> 00:25:16.289
section of a run where to be fair having

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:19.879
like a great card helps out a lot like

00:25:16.289 --> 00:25:19.879
the empress is doing work for us but

00:25:21.019 --> 00:25:26.610
we're much much much much stronger than

00:25:24.809 --> 00:25:28.169
the enemies were facing right now part

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:31.769
of that is the extra five damage from

00:25:28.169 --> 00:25:34.110
the Empress card but like even ignoring

00:25:31.769 --> 00:25:35.580
that we're really well equipped to

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:36.690
handle whatever comes our way here I

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:38.610
think we've only got two more floors

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:40.500
this is gonna be probably a successful

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:41.850
run and it didn't always look like it

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:44.129
was gonna be that way so I'm gonna take

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:46.110
some of the credit on this one let's see

00:25:44.129 --> 00:25:48.480
what we get in here we already have a

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:52.320
lump of coal but me a second lump of

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:53.309
coal could be could be worse could be

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.860
crammed as this head which we're not

00:25:53.309 --> 00:25:57.360
gonna touch anyway there's really no

00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:00.029
reason to save money

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.350
there's also no reason in my opinion at

00:26:00.029 --> 00:26:03.299
least to spend money on items that

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:05.100
aren't gonna give us a market

00:26:03.299 --> 00:26:08.000
improvement I'd rather save my money for

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:10.350
a chance to get something really nice

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.990
instead of just like okay well I mean we

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:15.960
can obviously get like all a damage

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:18.750
upgrade dude okay so we got to think

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:21.509
about this here's what I think you do I

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:27.509
think you credit card to get nine lives

00:26:21.509 --> 00:26:29.549
into the ecosystem Sun card is really

00:26:27.509 --> 00:26:35.789
useful but I only want to take nine

00:26:29.549 --> 00:26:37.649
lives if we can actually become guppy

00:26:35.789 --> 00:26:42.990
and I don't see any other guppy items

00:26:37.649 --> 00:26:45.179
there yet so we'll hold off on that like

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:48.120
nine lives is good but it also could

00:26:45.179 --> 00:26:49.950
potentially ruin this run in fact this

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:53.370
actually like if I want to hit peak

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:55.200
boredom this might be the kind of run

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:56.789
where even if we become Gumby nine lives

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.129
it's not the right call but I don't know

00:26:56.789 --> 00:27:01.470
if I want to live in a world where you

00:26:59.129 --> 00:27:03.809
know mr. Zayn chooses not to become

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:06.659
guppy because while it's powerful it's

00:27:03.809 --> 00:27:08.820
dangerous you know you just got to

00:27:06.659 --> 00:27:10.320
remember what Uncle Ben said before he

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.600
founded that rice company

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:14.760
with great power comes great

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:18.240
responsibility you got a responsibility

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:20.670
to not play like an idiot if we pick up

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:23.100
the gup-e set up here but we need to get

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:28.530
it first so that's essentially what all

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:34.380
this money is for the other thing is

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:39.960
like the Sun gives us full HP so to

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:42.840
leave that is potentially pretty bad but

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:46.830
we got to try anyway so first we get

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:54.300
guppy no we get runes blank rune per

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:56.310
throw you got a let's shoot for the

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:57.300
fences forget the Sun card let's put

00:27:56.310 --> 00:28:03.840
ourselves on edge

00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:05.430
start with blank rune no okay well we

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:09.420
got Guppies tail you see you see the

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:13.920
problem here though is the fact that

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:17.100
we've now lost the nine lives per throw

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.520
get do two free crickets head don't mind

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:21.840
if I do

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:26.690
oh oh oh it's copy and it's got me

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:29.010
without the use of without the use of

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:31.320
nine lives so in the end it actually

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:33.360
ended up being way better but the odds

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:36.990
of that working out we're so low so this

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:39.440
is like word you can't get much better

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:39.440
than this

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:48.200
five rate-of-fire nineteen damaged and

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:50.360
were gummy by the way not just nineteen

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:52.520
damage but nineteen damage plus grape

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:53.840
tear effects Holy Light one of the best

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:59.630
single damage to your effects in my

00:28:53.840 --> 00:29:01.310
opinion and then science as well

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:03.350
destroying any enemy who comes in

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:06.830
contact with or rather should we say all

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:09.350
enemies that comes in contact with fear

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:10.730
shot even by itself is sometimes dubious

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:17.030
but if it keeps them away from me then

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:19.130
that's maybe for the best and we become

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:22.280
intimately acquainted with the super

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:25.010
armor mechanic so no matter how good

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:28.130
your run gets here's this games version

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:33.590
of the IRS to say you got to slow your

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:39.620
roll I don't want you to take this HP

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:46.510
please please you're negating so much of

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:46.510
the damage that I've created

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:52.990
I think that here's my problem with

00:29:50.679 --> 00:29:54.460
super armor I'm not necessarily saying

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:55.900
it's a bad mechanic but I think it could

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.190
be implemented in such a way that it

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:59.049
doesn't make the player feel so

00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:01.600
powerless like the way that it feels

00:29:59.049 --> 00:30:03.940
right now is that it almost doesn't

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.320
matter how good your damages when you

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:07.809
come down to the super greed fighter

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:09.789
ultra-green fight it just feels like you

00:30:07.809 --> 00:30:11.860
know if you're doing four damage you're

00:30:09.789 --> 00:30:14.110
gonna do three and if you're doing 18

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:18.250
damage you're gonna do four so it's

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:21.820
probably not fair but there's definitely

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:24.309
like a scaling effect you know like

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:28.470
whatever your damage is actually it's

00:30:24.309 --> 00:30:28.470
gonna be like 60% lower because of this

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:37.120
maybe 60% is a stretch but either way

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:41.429
we're gonna win and I mean I guess for

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:41.429
reasons we should donate but

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:48.270
now the real question is if we used our

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.860
fool card you think we could get out of

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:54.740
here with the win anyway

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:54.740
fighting them again I would rather not

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:11.300
excuse me sir we got hit by an explosion

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:15.110
I think metal plates saved us from

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:16.340
taking that hit anyway he's done we have

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:18.140
no money to donate what happened to our

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:19.670
money we only had six cents to begin

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:21.460
with Plan C has appeared in the basement

00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:24.560
I forgot about that garbage hide it

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:28.610
tonight if I have not missed at all

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:29.570
I understand its use but three cents

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:31.850
donated wait wait wait

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:33.470
yeah three cents donated all right good

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:34.310
