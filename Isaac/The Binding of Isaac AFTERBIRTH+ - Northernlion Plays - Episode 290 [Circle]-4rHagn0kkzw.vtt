##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.819
everybody welcome Exeter the land please

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.760
abiding by zagat with plus due to run so

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.090
far fast runs well sometimes good pace

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.969
great hair I mean look at that why do we

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:22.410
occasionally have a little poop over our

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:24.990
dangled AR h l MH o m ro mahom to you as

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.000
well great rate of fire excel floor not

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.680
an excel floor great rate of fire pretty

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.780
bad damage if I'm being honest with you

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:36.930
speeds okay though flush is an OK item

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.899
looks good the big draw here you know I

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.129
try to find something positive about

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.270
every Eden run because I think it helps

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.370
you focus on the stuff that's going to

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.480
help you win and the big thing for us

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.320
right now I would say is 3 HP 3 HP is a

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.149
lot to work with

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.800
if we can manage to snag ourselves a

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.500
deal with the devil because we started

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.969
with not number 2 but it's but bombs

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.590
because we started with bug bombs we

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:04.170
should be able conceivably to get a

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.790
spirit heart either by using a key to

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.090
get access to the shop blowing the shop

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.770
up and then grabbing or blowing the the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.220
shopkeeper up and grabbing some money or

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.630
by blowing up a tinted rock and picking

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.960
up a couple of spirit arts as a result

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.549
so the keys are on this run we just got

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.930
to turn them in the ignition as if it's

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.759
a car that was built in like you know

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.409
before the year 2008 or something like

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.330
that because now it's all you know

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.040
keyless entry and I don't even know

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.420
anymore I don't know I'm pretty sure

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.650
that I have a car that doesn't have a

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.180
place to put your key into the ignition

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.240
which would make our Kelly very

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.840
displeased but I'm pretty sure you could

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.020
just steal it

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.549
I'm not sure if it locks I think I'm

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.189
pretty like I know it seems like I'm

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.860
inviting despair do the animation is so

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.119
funny when you flush Dingles but I know

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.189
it seems like I'm inviting this I mean

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.350
obviously the car locks I'm just not

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.659
sure of the mechanism sometimes it just

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.009
like lets me in even if capes holding a

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.540
key like you know 20 meters away and one

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.369
time I got it I pressed the start button

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.950
on the car and it was like there's no

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.560
key and it started anyway and I was like

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.050
you know I appreciate that but the key

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.620
is in my pocket and also that's a little

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.060
scare

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.830
I mean I did want to go to the grocery

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.090
store at the time so that was like it

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.140
saved me a little bit of hassle I

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:26.370
suppose what in the world is this but it

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:30.300
was still a little fishies all I'm

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:35.310
trying to say so this is like the

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.410
greatest arcade of all time the way that

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.190
I think we should choose to play this is

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.790
to I mean we got lots of money now our

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:50.430
luck stat is okay try to earn the spirit

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:52.320
hard go down to 15 cents it's a little

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.680
bit of a bummer but we'll do it anyway

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.560
and then blow up slot machines try to

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.330
get HP back use the HP of course to try

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.240
to leverage for more money and more HP

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.130
we get IV bag all right so IV bag is an

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.110
interesting item I think I like it more

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.940
than flush and it does allow us to get

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.220
you know an extra value add out of some

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.050
of these so blow this one up next and we

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.850
get a lot of HP out of that which is

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.770
extremely nice we're looking for blood

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.870
bag I don't know if you can get IV bag

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.210
twice on the same room I never really

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.620
thought about it

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.270
there's our luck upgrade it's one of the

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.210
things we've been trying to work for

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.130
here and with 1.64 luck now we can you

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.600
know play these two bad boys right here

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.670
try to get some more spirit arts or a

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:40.320
better trinket better I don't know ace

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.580
of clubs ace of clubs is actually pretty

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.290
good here I'm going to go down to 15

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.890
cents again just think it's a smart play

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.500
keep ourselves you know we got a goal

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.210
basically 15 cents allows us to you know

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.720
work within the framework of this run so

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:59.850
that was just blew up I want to pick up

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:01.170
keys and I want to pick up nickels and I

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.370
didn't mean to pick that but I do want

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.110
to pick up bombs then I think we ace of

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.670
clubs everything here and you're going

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.320
to blow up the blood bank for me which

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.800
I'm actually admittedly a little

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.440
disappointed by and I'm going to play

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.580
this down too while I was going to say

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.750
until we got a luck upgrade but

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.950
obviously that didn't work out but

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.750
honestly that worked out pretty well I

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.500
mean we picked up a lot of like every

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.500
consumable and

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.430
IV bag is probably a better item than

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:35.300
flush luck downgrade sort of stinks but

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.580
the idea is the IV bag is like a luck up

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.510
generator I think you can get lucky

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.640
pennies out of it at least even if you

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.650
can it enables a lot of items it's like

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.060
a dull razor with a mild cost associated

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.230
with it but also a you know a

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:54.490
proportional benefit so no joke IV bag I

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:57.620
hated for probably like two years I

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.560
didn't want the IV bag I wanted in HP

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.050
upgrade but there are a lot of

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.360
situations in which the IV bag is

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.300
actually vastly superior to @h people at

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.770
speed upgrade and if we get bloody lust

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:14.930
I'll be happy to tell you all about it

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:19.910
crawl space actually a good crawl space

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:22.790
again next booster pack please better

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:27.290
crawl spaces not because I want the game

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:31.510
to be easier necessarily although let's

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:34.490
not go down that road but mostly because

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.660
crawl spaces are like a super rare thing

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.220
and there's nothing more disheartening

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.280
than like oh I found the super rare

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:44.120
opportunity to pick up three cents three

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:47.360
cents great experience but it's alright

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.430
you know that time that was a really

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.110
good crawl space I'm not going to not

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.500
going to insulted urbis merchants good

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.720
name Explorer has been amazing for

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.150
consumables the hope is that you know we

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.590
can take the good luck that we've been

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.470
given in the form of consumables and

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:06.920
ride it or transfer it eventually

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.990
somehow to get in some extra items that

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.240
benefit us like the clicker I do not use

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.280
it on principle I do not use the sytem I

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.930
hate it I don't want to reroll myself

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.420
from being eaten and call an item off

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:23.720
the top of our list here I think it's

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:26.969
bad item and I you know I have to make

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:30.569
my stand as impotently as it may be

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:34.229
I am a content creator and I demand to

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:36.959
be heard let's uh I'm not making fun of

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:39.149
my own station here I'm just saying you

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:43.139
know it's a relatively minor

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:45.869
inconvenience champion belt nightlight

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:48.149
it's okay grab this as well welders

00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:52.439
you're the lovers card yeah I mean we

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:57.389
can use this better if we come across

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:58.979
nice if we come across a blood bank like

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:01.589
two floors from now is probably the most

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:03.749
likely time to encounter one of those

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:05.369
but we might as well use it now we got a

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:08.189
luck upgrade and a luck upgrade is going

00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:10.079
to benefit us for a while so feel pretty

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:12.589
good about that this is a big floor for

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:17.719
us we got ten bombs the bombs are good

00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:22.439
decent at least and can use this to

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:26.729
finance a deal with the devil I will

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:28.259
never not waste at least one bomb when

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:30.239
I'm using bombs on the monstro fight

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:31.559
it's like tradition at this point might

00:07:30.239 --> 00:07:34.559
as well take it it's another luck

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:36.059
upgrade with range as well 2.6 for luck

00:07:34.559 --> 00:07:39.269
nothing to sneeze at and here you just

00:07:36.059 --> 00:07:41.159
go broke like we're going to take both

00:07:39.269 --> 00:07:43.379
of these which means that IV bag is

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:45.179
basically going to be worth junk pretty

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:47.699
soon but it's worth it and if we ever

00:07:45.179 --> 00:07:49.919
get the HP back no problem so we're

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:52.289
actually like we can fly we got good

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:54.179
stats we got a good cat next to us in

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:56.039
the room right now we're 30 seconds

00:07:54.179 --> 00:07:57.659
behind schedule for boss rush but you

00:07:56.039 --> 00:07:59.309
know boss rush for whatever reason

00:07:57.659 --> 00:08:03.539
having been making it as often as I

00:07:59.309 --> 00:08:05.069
normally do now I would love to say that

00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:06.299
that correlates with an improvement in

00:08:05.069 --> 00:08:11.009
our performance but I don't know if

00:08:06.299 --> 00:08:12.389
that's necessarily the case however I

00:08:11.009 --> 00:08:14.309
think we can stop worrying about it

00:08:12.389 --> 00:08:15.329
start start treating boss rush I guess

00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:18.029
for now at least

00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:23.089
that's kind of a special case you know

00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:25.469
it's something that is not every run is

00:08:23.089 --> 00:08:27.749
necessarily built for boss rush that's a

00:08:25.469 --> 00:08:29.009
that's a sentence I would have disputed

00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:31.979
probably like a year and a half two

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:33.899
years ago but now I believe it for

00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:36.389
whatever reason I'm not sure floors have

00:08:33.899 --> 00:08:38.279
gotten longer enemies gotten tanky I

00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:40.120
mean we did spend like two minutes on a

00:08:38.279 --> 00:08:42.010
unique shop and even just unique room

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:44.430
like that not a shop sorry in arcade but

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:46.600
unique arcades like that or unique rooms

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:48.220
can slow you down like the fact that

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:51.040
there's that shop now that has two lucky

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.660
pennies and two green heads usually one

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.279
of them as a champion and you know

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:58.420
fighting them will slow you down

00:08:54.279 --> 00:09:04.870
but it's also sweet so I'm I'm certainly

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:06.550
far from being against that I love the

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:08.830
fact that it slowed him down long enough

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:11.050
for us to actually land some shots dude

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:12.700
you are the worst of all little horns

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:15.550
and you're going to summon yourself

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:17.140
during this boss fight at least like it

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.610
feels like most of the time we fight

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.010
little horn I'm sorry but most of the

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:22.560
time we fight big horn our damage is

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:25.930
garbage

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:29.020
it's like a it's become like a liens law

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:30.520
you know if you ever have terrible

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:33.580
damage on the third floor get ready for

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.830
your big horn fight but this time we're

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:40.089
actually like fairly well equipped to

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:42.010
deal with his nonsense so relatively

00:09:40.089 --> 00:09:43.900
happy about that plus like our speed and

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:45.610
maneuverability mean we're not going to

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.620
get hit by those bombs if we get hit by

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:52.570
those bombs something is gone terribly

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:54.700
wrong could use a good trinket and it's

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:56.709
not really a good trinket we did get a

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:59.830
boss rush enabler I'm not sure if that's

00:09:56.709 --> 00:10:02.500
ever gonna work right you know what it

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:04.959
actually is a good trinket if we have IV

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:06.610
bag it's unlikely to matter much but we

00:10:04.959 --> 00:10:09.940
might as well take it I you know looking

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:11.200
at the numbers here in 33.3% chances as

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:14.589
being a better trinket repeating of

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:17.310
course mostly like our range is solid

00:10:14.589 --> 00:10:21.760
and I kind of think that tapeworm is

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:26.680
it's not quite garbage it's just only

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:28.360
good situationally so I don't think this

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:31.029
is a situation in which we require that

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:33.580
was just awful definitely we want the

00:10:31.029 --> 00:10:34.839
compass why not get mom's coin purse and

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:38.430
just try for some help

00:10:34.839 --> 00:10:40.720
tears up well worth it already health up

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.320
feels like I'm walking on sunshine and

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.170
perks

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:45.910
dude that was an incredibly good haul

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:47.250
now we just need a red heart so we can

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:49.690
start to roll in the money like

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:51.850
straight-up mom's coin purse this is a

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:53.800
very strange sentence to be saying it's

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:56.380
gonna pay for itself then

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.300
ever happens we're probably going to get

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.589
more than 15 cents back as a result of

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.420
swallowed penny and being able to use

00:10:59.589 --> 00:11:05.769
the IV bag with that HP upgrade we got

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:12.519
so may not happen immediately that item

00:11:05.769 --> 00:11:14.170
will in time pay for itself dry baby

00:11:12.519 --> 00:11:16.480
haven't seen you in a long time old

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:19.540
friend how you been doing great little

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.790
orbital does damage across the whole

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:23.740
room when it takes damage itself

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:25.089
sometimes it chooses not to and that can

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.410
be frustrating that can be a frustrating

00:11:25.089 --> 00:11:31.420
experience I'm not going to lie to you

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:32.980
but nice little helping hand we all need

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:35.529
somebody to lean on

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:37.390
a wise band once said that I don't

00:11:35.529 --> 00:11:42.000
remember who was probably one direction

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:48.250
all right let's go that was the worst of

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:50.140
all possible bombs but still got a

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:53.040
spirit art out of it save your fool card

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:57.100
because the fool card is a nice little

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:58.360
boss rush enabler and we're only a

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.490
minute behind schedule I know it's a

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:02.260
boss rush isn't something we should be

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:04.149
doing every single run but it actually

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:07.000
might be something we can do on this run

00:12:04.149 --> 00:12:09.370
at first it looked like it was not going

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.560
to be likely but kind of changed my tune

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:14.410
a little bit I really don't think we

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.300
should use bombs to get money we don't

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.890
need it you know the bombs are more

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.540
valuable as long as we're getting red

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:20.950
hard semi-regularly we got more than

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.170
enough money to do whatever we want

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:25.720
thanks to our other combination of items

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:27.130
here this is going to say a second

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:31.060
secret room but apparently not what

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:32.920
about no okay we'll just go then we'll

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:36.180
just go and this runs popping off I got

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:39.930
to say I think it's mostly the hairdo a

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:43.410
little soft-serve little uh you know

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:47.459
dipped McDonald's ice cream cone there

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:47.459
so they call it down at the barbershop

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.959
hey what can I do for you buster Lily

00:12:51.399 --> 00:12:55.839
ever see a McDonald's chocolate dipped

00:12:52.959 --> 00:12:57.550
ice-cream cone say no more fam so that

00:12:55.839 --> 00:13:01.959
barbers are always saying fam for some

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:03.399
reason I so I don't mean I haven't had a

00:13:01.959 --> 00:13:04.780
haircut in a long time it's been like

00:13:03.399 --> 00:13:08.240
ten years but

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:10.040
the second-to-last haircut I ever got in

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:13.970
my college town there was a barbershop

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:17.600
I'm not going to out them by name but

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:19.910
this one if you're not familiar with it

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:22.940
this will give you a little glimpse into

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:25.010
the world of public masculinity

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:27.200
I'm not going to out the name of it

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:28.550
again because I mean mostly I don't

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.990
remember but if I say that I'm not going

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:32.720
to out them then it just sounds like I'm

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:35.150
being a nice guy about it let's get my

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.580
hair cut and then a lady just like in a

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:39.740
business suit walk down the street I've

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:41.330
never done a family friend of mine that

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.460
was cutting my hair it was a barber I've

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:45.800
never met before in my entire life he

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:49.430
said it looks like she needs a good ass

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:52.250
fucking and I said haha yeah but in my

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:54.290
head I was like oh my god what is this

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:55.940
man talking she's just a nice lady

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:59.540
walking out and about here I don't know

00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:01.550
first off I apologize for the use of the

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.230
language their whole video might get

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:09.880
demonetized as a result but it's worth

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:13.310
it for the purpose of the bit first off

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:19.400
what does somebody look like when they

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:21.890
need a good ass fucking what does that

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:24.320
mean like is that a particular look on

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:25.760
your face is it the way you walk I don't

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.170
understand like I didn't ask him

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.000
questions you guys want to get the heck

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:30.590
out of the chair the dude's got like

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.090
scissors he's cutting your hair you know

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:33.560
you don't want to go excuse me sir could

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:35.930
you explain yourself a little bit more

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:37.340
that's not cool buddy I probably should

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:39.290
have I would love to say that you know

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:41.210
and that's when I stood up and said you

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:42.890
shouldn't talk about people like that

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:44.720
and then everybody in the barbershop

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:47.300
stood up and applauded and handed me a

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:50.080
crisp $100 bill but that's not what

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:54.140
happened is it it's not what happened

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:57.770
but I need to know what does it mean to

00:14:54.140 --> 00:15:02.330
look like you need a good ass asterisk

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:03.950
asterisk asterisk asterisk Inc you know

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:09.170
what I mean

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:10.610
was it I don't understand what I've

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.690
never looked at a person and thought you

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:15.800
know what would really tie their look

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:17.780
together putting my dangle in their poop

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.490
hole I'm trying to get around the census

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:21.290
here okay it's all politics stays me

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:23.030
it's all politics look at that money

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:26.330
that's so good you can't donate any but

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:29.390
that's alright you know what really tie

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:30.770
this look together oh I was reading in

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:33.920
Vanity Fair this month that this

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:35.870
summer's hottest new look is taking a

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.040
dick up your bum hole you know I don't I

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.870
don't think he was talking from a

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.870
fashion standpoint I think he was just

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:44.000
trying to express some sort of you know

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:45.770
verbal dominance in this situation is

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.670
very uncomfortable he certainly assumed

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:51.560
that I had a rapport with him that I let

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:53.540
me put it this way if they had put that

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.490
on like a little waiver that you sign

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:57.320
when you go to the barbershop probably

00:15:55.490 --> 00:16:00.560
still would have gotten my haircut there

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:02.780
cuz like I was already there but then at

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.880
the same time I also would have been

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:07.460
like can I opt out of that condition

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:11.750
because it's a little strange shot it

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:15.710
I should have doubled down I should have

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:17.240
been like oh her that's my aunt's you

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:18.440
think he would have stuck to his guns or

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.390
you think he would have been like oh

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.620
well hey buddy you know I thought it'd

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:23.890
mean oh like that I mean it's just like

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:26.990
I thought she was nobodies am so

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:30.170
would've been like yeah your aunt looks

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:31.610
like she needs to good rogering I don't

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:33.680
know what did they call it in the UK but

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:40.330
it's certainly a better word than I used

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:40.330
for it don't ever zap me you angel

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:47.940
I don't really have anywhere else to go

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:50.100
with that anecdote except that it's

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.540
always been kind of a funny one for me

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.640
ever since it happened it's just like

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:58.260
there's this assumes level of rapport

00:16:53.640 --> 00:17:00.270
that especially like how older

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:04.400
generation men have with one another

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:07.290
it's like uncomfortable a little bit

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:10.620
it's not like I disagree but I don't

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:13.079
know I've never had a conversation with

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:15.150
a friend of mine that's the same age and

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:18.570
been like lady looks like she needs a

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:20.520
good bum fudging maybe it's because I

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:23.339
phrase it like I'm Jack McBrayer or

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:27.120
something like that but it gets like a

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:29.480
that's a born in the 1950s sort of you

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:31.530
know the Golden Age of America sort of

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.840
conversation to have there it's not one

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:36.540
for me I suppose okay where are we going

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.130
on this one this tough call we don't

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:41.510
have any guppy items so I think we go

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:43.830
for Whore of Babylon and probably ignore

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:46.530
Guppies hairball cat you're already

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:49.110
living in a penthouse buddy why just go

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:51.240
back in the penthouse you don't need to

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:53.640
be out the space between the keyboard

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:57.030
and monitor is not where you want to be

00:17:53.640 --> 00:18:00.780
I promise you this we're on the crop as

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:04.140
one man we whipped written didn't even

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:06.450
pick up the key we will really hard I'm

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:11.700
making it the boss rush as predicted I

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:13.410
suppose and then as a result of that

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:16.560
interaction I decided to go bald it

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:18.120
definitely was not genetics it was I'm

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:21.270
not going to subject myself to that

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:25.290
toxic masculinity anymore even if the

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:28.320
haircut was pretty good and also $11

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:30.570
which was a steal back then and even

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:33.900
more of a steal today I mean he's a

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:35.820
hard-working dude I'm not going to I'm

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.500
not going to say that his barbershop

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.450
business deserves to die because he's a

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:44.130
little crass you know people are complex

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:45.750
individuals you know what would have

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.760
been the best is if I had tripled down

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:50.820
the double down is one thing that's my

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:52.350
am or that dough I think what would have

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:56.390
been better is the tripling down be like

00:18:52.350 --> 00:19:00.720
hurt oh I put it in her butt last night

00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:02.940
she doesn't need a good but fudging she

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:07.049
just had one that would have thrown him

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:09.600
for a freaking loop and ass head would

00:19:07.049 --> 00:19:12.179
have spun around smoke come out of his

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:16.850
ears because his diagnosis has been

00:19:12.179 --> 00:19:20.970
rendered invalid by my life's experience

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:23.299
maybe she had like a rash and he comes

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:27.740
like a cortisone okay this is like

00:19:23.299 --> 00:19:30.450
probably getting a little too graphic

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:32.370
there are people who and I don't

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:34.080
encourage you to do this let their kids

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:38.340
watch these episodes under supervision

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:41.130
the important thing is the northernlion

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:43.440
brand is about crudeness and treating

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:44.880
people with respect to things that

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:50.669
appear to be at odds with one another

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:52.380
but don't have to be so kids don't

00:19:50.669 --> 00:19:55.289
repeat many of the words you hear in

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:58.260
this episode like come cortisone but

00:19:55.289 --> 00:20:00.870
then also at the same time treat people

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:02.760
as you want to be treated yourself which

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:04.980
is mostly why I just never talk to

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:09.990
people because I don't want them to talk

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:11.340
to me either strangers at least but you

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:13.679
know strangers just a friend you haven't

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:18.419
met that's what Marge Simpson said we're

00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:23.850
going blank card here by the way blank

00:20:18.419 --> 00:20:26.520
card fool so two rules but less if you

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:28.350
can't make boss rush I mean we've

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:31.799
already done our r.i.p Chris Cornell's

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:33.270
so I mean so that it's a loss man I'm

00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:35.159
not going to deny I'm not making light

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:38.280
of the situation it's a reverential

00:20:35.159 --> 00:20:42.179
treatment I assure you of this there is

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:43.640
real and I know that you know deep

00:20:42.179 --> 00:20:47.159
inside of my head right now I'm going

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:48.840
there is a chance we're going to make it

00:20:47.159 --> 00:20:51.090
the boss rush even as I say there's no

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:54.809
chance in my head I'm going there's a

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:56.900
chance but a really 100 percent requires

00:20:54.809 --> 00:20:59.700
emporer card to show up due to that spot

00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:02.160
no it's just speed ball

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:03.390
Oh Cal Cal Cal can we maybe shouldn't

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.040
have taken black powder but we can

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:07.200
afford to take black powder so I took

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:09.900
black powder and we're going to find

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:12.270
ourselves figuring out pretty quickly

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:14.940
whether that is a mistake or a genius

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:19.200
move spirit hearts please thank you

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:22.350
thank you teleport out one spirit hard

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:25.260
means a lot for me here we're to copy

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:27.360
items away from becoming gummy so very

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.350
unlikely I think just dispenses the

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:33.330
notion that were going to get the boss

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:35.160
rush what we should be doing especially

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:40.170
if we're fighting enemies that don't

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:42.330
really attack quickly like if they're

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:44.940
slow if they Telegraph their attacks I

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:49.380
guess is what I mean to say then we

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:51.990
should put down a black powder circle in

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:54.150
a safe spot seems sensible dude

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:56.340
Polyphemus so good rate of fire went up

00:21:54.150 --> 00:22:02.400
by ten but our damage like quintupled so

00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:05.310
I'll accept it really oh my god this is

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:07.800
so good habit sack boy sack boy might

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:09.600
give us a card secondly did not give us

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.580
a card we bought a card it's a moon card

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:14.070
the moon card is just a gutsy dub fool

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:18.590
card as far as I'm concerned well buy a

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:18.590
key we have missed boss rush

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:27.930
and that's okay we're going to teleport

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:32.240
to the secret room get Black Lotus which

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:35.580
were like thank God we came this way

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:37.020
thank God we came cortisone I don't even

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.190
know if you use cortisone to treat a

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:40.680
rash and that's just irresponsible

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:42.690
reporting on my part you might go your

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:44.280
whole life now you know you're always

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:46.200
going to use cortisone to treat a rash I

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:50.100
wonder why because this idiot said it in

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:52.350
a video one time sorry didn't mean to

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:54.450
affect the the pitch of your whole life

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:56.550
blank card world blank card strength

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:57.750
dude I like blank card world if I'm

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:59.670
going to be a hundred percent honest

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:03.060
with you and the pickup of Polyphemus

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:06.570
first off great book from the writer of

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:08.400
Twilight secondly probably guarantees us

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:09.930
as close to a win as we could guarantee

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.600
here I mean the secret room giving us a

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:14.750
black card would help out a little bit

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:18.540
you know when your heart bet it's true

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:19.020
it's also pretty good right whore

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:20.550
Babylon

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:23.520
I forgot that that is something we

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:25.380
should endeavor to pursue here if only

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.880
our donation machine had survived a

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:32.310
little bit longer like we got some good

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:34.610
stuff to give to it throw down the black

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:34.610
powder

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:42.870
let's go not really dealing as much

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:48.090
damage as I'd like that's a rate of fire

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:49.800
related problem right now I'm hoping

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:51.390
that you know we got like five black

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.610
powder circles I'm hoping the damage

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:56.880
stacks here otherwise I'm feeling a

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:59.880
little silly should not have picked that

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:02.790
up grab this let's go this runs in a

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:04.560
good spot we took risks and honestly the

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:07.080
risks have largely paid off good curse

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:10.590
at a loss like I said risks have largely

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:13.050
paid off you know why give me an emperor

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:16.290
car the game is calling my bluff here

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:24.960
you don't think I'll do it don't you

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:28.530
know I'm Loco above all else for this

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:33.450
entire story I just want to know what

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:36.990
the dude man when he said looks like she

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:39.300
could use a good a effin because I've

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:41.280
never diagnosed the person you know

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:44.160
sometimes you hang out with your friends

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:45.780
and you're like you do a podcast with

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:48.030
them for example and you go looks like

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:51.440
this buddy needs some sleep you know

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:51.440
you have a rough night you feeling okay

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:55.590
sometimes you see your friend you go

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:57.990
this and this is not me sub calling out

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:59.900
like you're subtweeting Invicta at all

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:02.340
you know you see your friend and you go

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:04.200
mean your vegetables lately you're just

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:06.320
looking a little like the fishing

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:08.730
something I don't know I'm not a doctor

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.200
you could use some vitamin K that's my

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:13.170
diagnosis you know eat some green

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:14.790
leafies that's what I call lettuce

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:18.060
that's what everyone in Canada calls

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:19.410
lettuce green leafy don't even look it

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:21.510
up on the internet just go to it can go

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:22.980
to Tim Hortons and say hey give me a cup

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:23.430
of your best green leafy they know what

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:27.540
to do

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:29.670
they will not laugh at you tell them

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:37.850
Canadian Prime Minister Jean poutine sin

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:37.850
you trust me they will not mock you

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:44.660
stop this I've never looked at anybody

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:48.050
and said I think I really use a penis in

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:49.840
their butt and maybe that's a problem on

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:51.950
my end

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.640
sometimes I've been accused of having a

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:54.230
lack of vision

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:57.500
maybe this specifically is what they

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:59.450
meant I doubted though cuz that would be

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:03.530
absurd but that's kind of the premise of

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:05.690
the joke to begin with you cannot give

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:07.490
me nine lives but if you did it would be

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:09.620
sweet okay

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:11.780
self we need to lab we need to have a

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:14.810
little intervention here because the

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:16.670
damage you're taking here is not good I

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:18.590
don't want to be the one to you know

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:20.900
break the bad news to you but you've

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:22.610
taken a hit unlike some fire you take a

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:26.080
hit on some red pooop' and you open to

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:28.190
mimic the mimic above all else like is

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:32.450
unfathomable why you would consider that

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:34.280
as a decent decision it's like I'm

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:37.460
having a conversation with my own brain

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:42.710
it's very strange but honestly a long

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:44.480
time coming no exits here and every time

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:46.670
you get a curse with the lost it's like

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:48.740
the game is made of dead ends it's just

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:50.270
like it must highlight the number of

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:52.040
dead ends that are in the game doesn't

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:54.590
actually increase the amount but it

00:26:52.040 --> 00:27:00.170
always feels like I didn't read a patch

00:26:54.590 --> 00:27:04.490
in more dead ends here they recently

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:06.050
added more hops how to jump is like I

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:08.780
mean we haven't had we started with

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:14.210
flush we haven't had any books we should

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:17.510
take how to jump because it is part of

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:20.330
bookworm but it's not a free exercise

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:22.280
like we do have to beat the room and

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:29.240
it's going to be bosses we should really

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:33.340
crap on them but it does carry like a

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:33.340
small amount of risk associated with it

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:38.580
I don't know this could be a hush run as

00:27:36.869 --> 00:27:41.129
well like I think Polyphemus is a decent

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:42.509
counter to super armor although I mostly

00:27:41.129 --> 00:27:44.009
just say that without really knowing

00:27:42.509 --> 00:27:46.139
what the words strung together in that

00:27:44.009 --> 00:27:51.720
order really mean oh my god I did not

00:27:46.139 --> 00:27:53.909
get hit that is a surprise wouldn't mind

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:56.100
picking up like nine lives

00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:58.169
Abaddon one spirit heart you know

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:59.999
something along those lines over the

00:27:58.169 --> 00:28:02.129
next room or two here HP from the boss

00:27:59.999 --> 00:28:05.730
something okay okay okay this is good

00:28:02.129 --> 00:28:08.009
so we nose Goblin is good lockdown is

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:11.129
not young need me to tell you that at

00:28:08.009 --> 00:28:12.749
this point your existence probably yeah

00:28:11.129 --> 00:28:15.090
knows goblin should be sweet for us I

00:28:12.749 --> 00:28:16.529
don't think we need silver dollar and if

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:20.399
we can only old one trinket which I

00:28:16.529 --> 00:28:22.409
believe is the case I think we should go

00:28:20.399 --> 00:28:24.990
for the one that occasionally sticks our

00:28:22.409 --> 00:28:26.850
shots to enemies because if they stick

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:29.039
I'm not sure if they do a product of

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:31.470
their base damage to the enemy over time

00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:34.499
but if they do obviously like we're

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:39.330
doing a lot of it so feels good blood

00:28:34.499 --> 00:28:42.809
clots nice it's not a HP but it is a

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:44.549
little bit of damage bonus we might as

00:28:42.809 --> 00:28:48.029
well go back and look in our boss trap

00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:49.619
room here and see what we can get don't

00:28:48.029 --> 00:28:51.720
really I mean I want to do the curse

00:28:49.619 --> 00:28:56.549
room but I don't really want to do the

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:57.809
curse room yeah you can you can go ahead

00:28:56.549 --> 00:29:01.649
I'll be done here pretty soon but you

00:28:57.809 --> 00:29:02.999
should start now I am gonna go check it

00:29:01.649 --> 00:29:05.399
out a couple of spirit eyes could be a

00:29:02.999 --> 00:29:08.720
big deal here and actually this is great

00:29:05.399 --> 00:29:08.720
because we'll get a whore of babylon and

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:16.169
the extra damage from sin robes okay

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:18.330
crickets head we already have crickets

00:29:16.169 --> 00:29:20.279
entity why would you stay there it took

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:26.450
the freakin damage you've got nothing to

00:29:20.279 --> 00:29:26.450
worry about good okay just keep going

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:33.419
blank card Wheel of Fortune is better

00:29:31.249 --> 00:29:34.769
especially with sac bully we're going to

00:29:33.419 --> 00:29:37.169
get lots of battery charges so I would

00:29:34.769 --> 00:29:40.860
expect to get like a lot of items on the

00:29:37.169 --> 00:29:41.340
chest we got to make it to the chest

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:43.049
first

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:46.460
it seems pretty likely based on our

00:29:43.049 --> 00:29:46.460
current situation that that'll happen

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:52.650
the last thing that would be like

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:53.580
awesome and I given the amount of time

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:55.020
it's been in the game

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:57.179
okay blank our gear is obviously the

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:58.440
best of all these but given the amount

00:29:57.179 --> 00:30:01.520
of time that has obviously been in the

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:04.470
game I should be aware of how this

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:08.580
combination works but does piercing

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:10.409
shots plus Polyphemus still carry the

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:12.780
detriment of Polyphemus which is that

00:30:10.409 --> 00:30:14.250
like it loses whatever damage it does to

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:16.039
the first enemy when it passes through

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:18.720
to the second and the first one dies or

00:30:16.039 --> 00:30:20.370
does it just do the damage consistently

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:22.230
because if we can get like Sagittarius

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:24.030
or something like that you know I'm

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:25.830
doing like a chef's kiss with my hand

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:28.890
right now it's a great that's not a

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:36.780
maneuver in the bedroom that's like you

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:41.370
know ratatouille that little mouse can

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:43.950
cook but the avenues for which we can

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:46.350
get piercing shots are pretty low right

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:47.400
now once we get down to the chest will

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:50.340
be a little better we've already seen

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:54.090
our deal with the devil I'm not going to

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:56.850
go fight the hush because fighting the

00:30:54.090 --> 00:31:00.539
hush is basically you know health

00:30:56.850 --> 00:31:04.830
related suicide at this point and I

00:31:00.539 --> 00:31:10.289
don't think you trust in my health

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:14.789
related suicide I try to get a streak

00:31:10.289 --> 00:31:16.559
but I and then he goes done good good

00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:23.039
good okay thank you try baby that was

00:31:16.559 --> 00:31:25.770
great work with 19 keys I mean there's

00:31:23.039 --> 00:31:27.990
two things to draw from that oh my lord

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:30.539
the first one is that we need more keys

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:31.740
the second one is that blank card and

00:31:30.539 --> 00:31:33.809
then yera

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:35.159
gives us sixteen chests which is

00:31:33.809 --> 00:31:39.059
probably just about the best we could

00:31:35.159 --> 00:31:40.980
aspire to to open right now so there's

00:31:39.059 --> 00:31:48.360
no real reason to get 64 chests if we

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:50.850
can only open 16 to begin with and I

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:51.780
mean the next level over that is 32 was

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:53.760
worth it honestly

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:55.030
maybe ill-advised but worth it

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:57.130
nonetheless

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:58.780
pretty lucky to not take damage there

00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:00.910
but we shouldn't use the arrow because

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:03.540
we could use Yara with blank card to

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:05.650
double chest to drop from other rooms so

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:06.970
I'd be a little foolish to throw the

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:09.520
arrow rune away although it would give

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:12.100
us a nice quick boost in the number of

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:13.210
items we had so not an idiotic decision

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.950
I think the truth of the matter is that

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:17.110
with the combination of items we have

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:19.240
right now the only idiotic decision is

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:32.800
to neglect to use either of them in

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:37.960
general so we should be fine as long as

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:40.090
we don't overthink things here that last

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:41.560
shot will do it thank you for not even

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:43.510
giving me the option to go to the void

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:47.050
floor I very much appreciate it so I

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:48.190
think we're going to get charged curse

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:50.560
with a blind well that's going to make

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:54.720
things exciting to finish up for certain

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:54.720
and then we'll earn another charge

00:32:56.430 --> 00:33:00.580
surely all the other enemies of Dead

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:02.170
will earn another charge or maybe give

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:05.560
Sackboy to just pay out with one

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:08.200
immediately planned see what an

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:13.960
unfortunate item to get right now

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:19.390
although dudes oh no no no no you got to

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:21.130
kill lust last he has not done it

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:23.230
that was a squandering of doing it

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:27.670
Scorpio for poison tears is just okay

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:29.890
double again that's sixteen I feel

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:32.140
better about just opening these sixteen

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:36.930
question marks let's go four at a time

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:39.970
book of sin into bombs are key okay

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:41.650
disregard my earlier concerns we should

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:43.060
look at all of these now Sagittarius is

00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:45.190
what we asked for in God so we're about

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:47.560
to find out Loki's horns is okay mom's

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:49.390
wig actually excellent now we should

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:53.410
double because we got the opportunity to

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:54.790
get like a lot more a lot more value out

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:55.570
of the doublings than originally

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:58.030
anticipated

00:33:55.570 --> 00:34:02.080
so more sacks into more batteries thank

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:04.020
you 56 so what we have left here 1 2 3 4

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:08.109

that'll be 24 this will be 48 okay

00:34:08.109 --> 00:34:16.019
I was doing four at a time mom's eye is

00:34:12.999 --> 00:34:19.569

00:34:26.769 --> 00:34:33.700
little low-key all right my little

00:34:28.809 --> 00:34:36.579
unicorn nothing special this is more

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:40.149
than four let's see what we got

00:34:36.579 --> 00:34:41.200
game kit less actives please infestation

00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:43.299
that's all right

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:44.679
technology zero cool new item book as

00:34:43.299 --> 00:34:46.869
sin we've already seen it scissors

00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:49.299
terrible just got off a garbage curse

00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:51.700
died that's not great be honest with you

00:34:49.299 --> 00:34:53.379
little chubby telepathy for dummies

00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:55.509
should be bookworm may we already had an

00:34:53.379 --> 00:34:57.999
experimental treatment is spun Libre

00:34:55.509 --> 00:35:00.249
cost us twenty five damage there but

00:34:57.999 --> 00:35:04.480
look at these freaking tears what is

00:35:00.249 --> 00:35:10.059
going on iron bar box of spiders later

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:12.279

item Ki bum don't like it d12

00:35:12.279 --> 00:35:17.349
four-year-olds rocks get out of here

00:35:14.079 --> 00:35:18.880
okay what do we get a little gertie

00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:21.869
nothing wrong with that Irene OTT at

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:25.150
like evens blessings radar we knotted

00:35:21.869 --> 00:35:29.170
conjoin yet spider but pretty garbage

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:31.329
hot bombs decent number too dangerous

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:32.829
for people of duplex I don't know

00:35:31.329 --> 00:35:39.670
strange tears no doubt about that

00:35:32.829 --> 00:35:42.309
bursting sack host hat I mean it seems

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:43.839
like we got a pretty good setup going on

00:35:42.309 --> 00:35:46.499
here would you mind dropping at the gods

00:35:43.839 --> 00:35:46.499
room for me

00:35:49.779 --> 00:35:54.859
sack of pennies is useless little Chad

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:57.589
super bandage alright I mean we could

00:35:54.859 --> 00:36:00.829
use the HP and our final three items I

00:35:57.589 --> 00:36:05.660
think rainbow baby sack dagger and miter

00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:08.089
I mean I don't really feel like Spider

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:09.710
bud is the right choice here when we do

00:36:08.089 --> 00:36:11.900
have blank card sitting around as well

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:13.339
but honestly I'll take what I can get

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:15.829
here this turned out to be pretty good

00:36:13.339 --> 00:36:19.549
and I have no idea what's going on with

00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:23.150
the damage between tech zero and like

00:36:19.549 --> 00:36:27.499
our weird continuum shots but so far it

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:30.410
seems pretty flippin sweet so I'm for it

00:36:27.499 --> 00:36:38.839
even though I don't understand it kind

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:40.400
of like most legislation okay keep

00:36:38.839 --> 00:36:42.200
moving on here we got our boss fight

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:44.779
already we've also got mr. boom we

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:47.480
didn't get sad bombs but it's okay

00:36:44.779 --> 00:36:50.239
sinus infestation we got like mad booger

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:53.660
tears now this booger tears plus

00:36:50.239 --> 00:36:55.400
Technology zero seems really fun I am

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:56.480
going to get the heck out of this run
