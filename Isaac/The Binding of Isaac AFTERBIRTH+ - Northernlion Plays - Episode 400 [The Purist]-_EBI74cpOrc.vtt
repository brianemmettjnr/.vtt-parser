00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
Oh everybody welcome back sir on the

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.230
line please Lenny wise guys with plus

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.730
maybe heard of this game haha we've used

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.030
that talk about a hundred times alright

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.599
so we're on challenges purists all I

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.120
remember the purist was this is the last

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.470
one until we have to do our second pass

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.900
of challenges which will probably take a

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:24.359
break in between if I remember correctly

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:26.220
it's just no item rooms xbv FGL 38 and I

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.890
seem to recall cursing the name of a

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.650
purist many times I seem to remember

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.930
like a new Mannion esque purist

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.110
would cross my lips whenever I thought

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.090
about this challenge but it's been years

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:44.430
you know after birth sorry rebirth came

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.079
out in October November 2014 it's been

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.370
almost three years since I've done most

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:54.480
of these challenges I do not recall why

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.460
like a jilted ex-lover all those

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.649
emotions have dulled with time and faded

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.239
and I don't understand why I was mad at

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.340
this challenge maybe we'll you know

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.680
discover a new why this was so annoying

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.500
oh you better be scared you honestly

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.880
should be afraid I previously I was

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.400
going to open the mimic because we

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.930
looked like we would probably not have

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.250
spirit arms getting in the way now that

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.310
we have spirit arts I don't really want

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.070
to invest in the mimic at the cost of

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.390
our own you know self preservation

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.790
especially if we could possibly get

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.750
deals with the devil in the future if we

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.439
can get deals with the devil in the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.060
future I want to basically lean on those

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.619
because no item rooms it should hold us

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.610
back to be honest with you it should

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:42.180
make things harder

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:43.530
however excuse me sir um it's uh sorry

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.630
did I say no deals for the devil no item

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.740
rooms should debilitate this run they

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.780
should make the run slightly more

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.180
difficult however if it only goes to

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.399
moms hard missing item rooms shouldn't

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.130
be that bad as long as we can get a deal

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.020
with the devil that provides us with

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.610
really like any forward momentum and the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.979
same kind of goes for boss rooms like if

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.170
we can get a boss room item that gives

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.570
us for example if years upgrade I think

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.700
we're off to the races not enough to

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.220
guarantee a win for certain but enough

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.220
to you know we bought a lottery ticket

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.440
at that point

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:19.270
very least good five senses where I

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.280
wanted to be and you know what bad use

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.630
of a bomb but I think my heart was in

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.650
the right place there that's not the

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:30.210
only thing that matters but my heart was

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.930
in the right place all we got to do now

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:37.420
play it cool we get an ability to fly

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.690
after this it should give us a good

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.100
chance on the next floor so I if we

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.750
don't get boss items I'm going to die

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.430
because it's Dacian I thought that that

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.020
might be the the crux of the purist

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.270
challenge is that you just get no items

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.910
ever there might also be no shops now

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.650
that I think about it well no there's

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.840
that's either a library or a shop I

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.010
guess we should be more clear let's go

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.410
back and check on that cuz if it's a

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:04.540
library we might be interested in

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:06.370
invested in disabilities plus I mean

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.780
come on free bomb that we totally could

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.090
have gotten earlier but for some reason

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.940
I didn't anyway listen it's already open

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.480
how did we do that it is a shop so I

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.550
think actually at this point the Pony is

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.810
like a pretty amazing upgrade for us we

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.040
should be relatively pleased I don't

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.950
remember what we get to the purist I

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.769
think after we finished this run might

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.030
do a few like normal runs greed daily I

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.890
don't know you know something along

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.600
these lines just because the challenge

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.459
is I mean doing 20 of them in a row

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.630
roughly I know we still have one left

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.650
like number 19 remember what it is but

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.320
let's not talk like this one's already

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.060
done by the way but it's a lot of like

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.120
gimmicky runs all in a row I kind of

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.970
missed the the inherent saying of a

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:53.080
tabula rasa like blank slate Isaac run

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.730
and Al did you use tabula rasa simply

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.190
because you know it's the name of a

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.620
video game from your past the answer to

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.870
that question is yes the only reason I

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.530
know what tubular Raza means you are

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.530
correct

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.370
I do not know Latin I barely know

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.500
JavaScript

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.780
don't even get me started on this dude

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.860
so I'm not this isn't about programming

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.620
but I actually firmly believe I wouldn't

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.449
say genetically but like cognitively

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.930
I'll do for so in such a good position

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:25.520
here let's go for it even though we

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.930
already have a passive ability or an

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.400
active ability to fly because now we can

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.290
get a better active item and be off to

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:36.139
the races but I think my brain is broken

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.669
visually you watch me play player

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.060
unknowns battleground you go how's this

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.590
guy so blind you watch me you know make

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.520
art in pass part oh when you go how's

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.930
this guy so bad I don't know why I don't

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.479
know you know I think I've told the

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.430
story about how apparently my vision was

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.380
terrible as a child but I had this

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.820
doctor who was like 80 years old and he

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.470
was like ah you know he'll probably

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.160
never be a fighter pilot but he doesn't

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.039
need glasses

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.810
turns out thanks a lot buddy I didn't

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:06.080
need glasses when I went to see the eye

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.660
doctor in like fifth grade he was like

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.400
how was your child not flunking out of

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.770
school like I was actually doing pretty

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.620
well despite the fact that I couldn't

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.660
really see the blackboard chalkboard

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.190
whatever we didn't have whiteboards back

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.169
in the day you know I didn't go to the

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.750
Mark Zuckerburg school for kids who can

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:29.000
read good anyway because you can read

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:30.200
well Superman reads good maybe that's

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.760
what happened maybe my brain was just

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.139
like yeah he's not using his eyes too

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.419
much so we'll put that towards you know

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:38.450
linguistic aptitude or something like

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.889
that but I don't think we need anything

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.389
here but any the whole reason I bring

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.090
that up is because I've been doing this

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:45.500
online course to learn front-end

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.639
development it's called free code camp

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.650
and I would highly recommend it

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:50.300
especially if you've got experience in

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.180
any other programming language including

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.520
HTML or CSS I'm coming from a fairly I

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.110
would say intermediate good fundament

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.510
the good foundational knowledge of

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.099
object-oriented programming and it's

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.900
been nice to do but a lot of it is

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:05.120
front-end stuff like hey make this and

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.400
make it look pretty I cannot do it and

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.570
then I say I can't do it easily I should

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.430
say because I don't want to limit myself

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.229
necessarily I think it's just it's going

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.890
to be a harder skill to learn I'm just

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:17.270
naturally like basically garbage at it

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:19.130
luckily I've got you know talented

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.849
people around me who could help me out

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.230
with stuff like that

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:23.750
Michael al Fox has got

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.640
I for design I don't know why I said it

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.880
as if I was loath to compliment him you

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.590
know we're we're old friends but he's

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.800
got an eye for design no question I

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:36.860
think I'm more the guy behind the scenes

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.510
I'm not the guy you send you know to do

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.310
the presentation I'm the guy who's more

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.960
like well you see you got your sub

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.330
script algorithm million correct here

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.680
you should be using the you know that ad

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.620
method because it checks for bounce

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.290
automatically whenever I make something

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.600
in free code camp it looks like it's

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:56.420
actual trash it looks like a computer

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.160
program from like what people thought

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.930
computer programs would look like in the

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.910
year 2000 when they were making movies

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.280
in like 1960 like everything is just

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.720
like one horrible color in the

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.550
background and then a big old button

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.020
that says like go and then they click it

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.720
and the screen just feels with nonsense

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:14.180
characters that's pretty much me I don't

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:17.210
know what I really I'm being like half

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:19.940
sincere when I say that maybe when I was

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:22.010
younger and I didn't get glasses when I

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.900
should have probably despite going to

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:26.030
the family doctor my mom you know I've

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.590
fairly vivid memories of my mom being

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.510
like he doesn't see what he sees that

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.370
well and the doctor just you know old

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:33.500
school like probably World War two

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.880
veteran guy you know just like I you

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:38.630
know we don't want to give him glasses

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.310
the kids'll make fun of him joke's on

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:42.740
you doctor I went to a very progressive

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.510
high school and you're probably dead

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.070
because when you were my family doctor

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:48.380
you were already like 80 I'm not saying

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:50.060
I wish he's dead I mean he had a medical

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:52.250
license I'm assuming he's pretty good at

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.690
his job for the most part just should

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:57.590
have sent me to the optometrist a little

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:58.910
earlier anyway I digress and maybe my

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.420
brain was just like he doesn't need this

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.630
anymore

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:05.740
I wonder about that sometimes because

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:07.730
visually it's kind of hard to think

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.380
battlegrounds like everybody sees

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:11.450
everything unless they're the one in

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.500
control of the camera because the first

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.670
thing control the cameras got like

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:17.030
different things in their mind they're

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:18.380
like I'm gonna die right but still I'm

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.420
like sometimes I go back and watch

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:23.260
footage of the shows and I'm like am i

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:26.810
blind and what do I do about it

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:30.110
it needs like brain surgery like insert

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:31.460
more brain into the visual part but you

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:33.030
know what it is our differences that

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:37.620
make us strong as a

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:39.360
as a society I believe in that glad we

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:41.730
don't have a monoculture I'm glad

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:44.760
they're the idiots like me visually

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:46.500
speaking I don't know what I was going

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.640
to tie that up with I'm just glad

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.380
there's idiots like me because I'm one

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.740
of them I suppose but yeah like no I

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:54.390
mean I am in no danger of ever wow I

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.820
can't believe he went over the man-made

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:58.170
bridge there that's pretty cool I'm in

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.790
no danger of taking your job as a

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:02.090
front-end developer graphic designer

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:04.920
there's no question about that

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:06.900
just leave it at that I don't know what

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.400
I miss you I'm very lucky that YouTube

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:12.390
and twitch exist because my skill set is

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:14.700
uniquely well shaped to do that I can

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.230
get lost in a video game for hours at a

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.200
time

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:21.930
relatively apt at talking to myself over

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.090
and over and luckily as you know born in

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:26.940
the right time I'll tell you if I was

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:29.640
born in like you know the 1920s I don't

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.590
know what I'd try to like be a assistant

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:35.040
manager at a speakeasy or something like

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:37.710
that there's anything wrong with that

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:40.770
too a dime let's pop it because we

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:42.960
should like having money on this

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:46.980
challenge is a very important thing I

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:53.010
don't think I want Pops's I don't think

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:56.190
I want to have magic fingers just

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:58.410
because I don't think it matters to be

00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:00.360
honest with you I don't think magic

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:02.730
fingers is good enough to get rid of the

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:06.390
ponies active effect unless we get mega

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:10.890
rich and our damage is awesome why did

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:12.780
we teleport right there did I touch that

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:14.910
I must have touched the chest at like

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.830
the exact time that this went down okay

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:18.630
bad trip that's horrible balls of steel

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:20.220
more than makes up for it but I'm still

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:23.250
kind of cheesed if I'm being honest with

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.600
you so we'll blow this up I don't know

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.860
why I'm looking at this and I'm like are

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.540
we going to make boss rush you're the

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:31.770
sane about a boss rush you've got a good

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:33.900
run going on purist that's like where

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:35.820
you just shut up and ride this bad boy

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.920
till the end because like straight up

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.960
this is a gift from above we got some

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.600
very good items defensively offensively

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:45.480
and then we got

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:47.069
damage good rate of fire not ten out of

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.290
ten but probably like in the sevens or

00:10:47.069 --> 00:10:50.579
eights when you consider managing much

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.899
plus our tears I've grades I'm not

00:10:50.579 --> 00:10:53.040
trying to ruffle any feathers by saying

00:10:51.899 --> 00:10:55.019
it's a seven or an eight I'm talking

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.670
about a Harvard seven you know I

00:10:55.019 --> 00:10:59.600
wouldn't know what that means because I

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.600
didn't go to an Ivy League school

00:11:00.769 --> 00:11:07.319
because you know I'm Canadian so I mean

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.060
first off I wouldn't have gotten in I

00:11:07.319 --> 00:11:11.009
was the kid in high school I was like ah

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:14.310
I mean just this now sounds

00:11:11.009 --> 00:11:16.470
braggadocious but I would like I'm just

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:18.449
gonna get aids I kind of like the

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.889
Canadian education system I feel if

00:11:18.449 --> 00:11:22.769
you're an American high school student

00:11:19.889 --> 00:11:26.639
right now I actually kind of feel bad

00:11:22.769 --> 00:11:28.920
for you I mean I don't feel bad as a 28

00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:29.790
year old because you have your youth you

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:33.300
know and I don't

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:36.209
or it stayed in so you know enjoy that

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:38.100
however me as like a 16 year old feels

00:11:36.209 --> 00:11:39.269
bad for you if you're a Canadian and

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:42.600
you're probably going to go to a

00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:45.240
Canadian University pretty much all you

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:50.639
got to do is get AIDS if you can get

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:52.680
like all A's or like 90% A's and a

00:11:50.639 --> 00:11:53.880
couple B's you're going to be fine over

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.170
the course of your high school career

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.360
you can get in anywhere in Canada

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:58.740
basically almost any program probably

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:02.250
not quite any program at all most a

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:04.800
program admittedly I mostly only have oh

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:06.870
I have a few American friends were you

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.389
know my peers of that age and then I

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:11.730
have you know American media that I

00:12:09.389 --> 00:12:13.560
watch but I know one of my friends in in

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:17.370
Canada at least when I went to school in

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:24.089
the province I went to our advisors told

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:25.529
us like 98% of your of your application

00:12:24.089 --> 00:12:27.779
process was the marks that you got in

00:12:25.529 --> 00:12:30.149
the eleventh grade and then like 2%

00:12:27.779 --> 00:12:31.319
academically speaking was like the marks

00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:33.600
that you got in the first semester of

00:12:31.319 --> 00:12:35.130
twelfth grade one of my friends I was

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.110
talking to he was like third in his

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:40.259
class and he's a genius he's an actual

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:41.880
like literal doctor now he was like yeah

00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:45.269
I can't give valedictorian in my school

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:47.189
because I got a B in ninth grade it's

00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:48.600
like what that's kind of a lot of

00:12:47.189 --> 00:12:50.699
pressure to put on a thirteen-year-old

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.990
hey we're going to like this is a new

00:12:50.699 --> 00:12:53.370
era for you you know you're going to be

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:55.620
interacting with your peers you're going

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:57.810
to be small fish in a big pond again

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:59.430
by the way you got a b-plus in gym so

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.990
I'm sorry but you ruined your academic

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.790
career this institution not to say that

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:05.339
you've ruined it if you're you know not

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:07.680
becoming valedictorian yeah he was like

00:13:05.339 --> 00:13:09.600
well I basically can't get into Harvard

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.980
Yale or you know any of these Ivy

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.970
League's so I got to aim a peg lower

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:16.139
dudes average in high school was like 98

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:17.879
and I think it's good in bed you know

00:13:16.139 --> 00:13:19.800
because I'm going to be straight up with

00:13:17.879 --> 00:13:21.149
you if you're in high school you're not

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.129
going to like what I'm about to say and

00:13:21.149 --> 00:13:24.629
you're going to you're going to rebuke

00:13:23.129 --> 00:13:26.189
it and I would have rebuked it as well

00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:27.839
but I firmly agree with what I'm about

00:13:26.189 --> 00:13:30.290
to say regardless it's getting a little

00:13:27.839 --> 00:13:34.170
frame e there huh

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:36.569
you have most of you if you look at like

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:39.029
a base high school student you got so

00:13:36.569 --> 00:13:41.040
much free time and I don't I'm pretty

00:13:39.029 --> 00:13:42.930
rich coming from me I'll admit but at

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.920
the same time you don't realize like

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:48.329
your life fills up really fast

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:51.089
especially as you become an adult you

00:13:48.329 --> 00:13:52.559
know not even like let's assume you work

00:13:51.089 --> 00:13:54.899
in a job where you have set hours you

00:13:52.559 --> 00:13:57.689
know that's like you say it's 35 hours a

00:13:54.899 --> 00:13:59.100
week but really it's not 35 hours a week

00:13:57.689 --> 00:14:00.389
cuz you've also got a you know go to bed

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:03.509
at a certain time get up at a certain

00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:05.160
time commute you know get ready for work

00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:06.629
like as soon as you wake up if you wake

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.459
up at 6 a.m. you got to be to work at 8

00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:10.589
a.m. you don't get 2 hours of free time

00:14:08.459 --> 00:14:11.069
before work that's work time you got a

00:14:10.589 --> 00:14:12.750
shower

00:14:11.069 --> 00:14:14.100
you know you got to get in your car you

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.420
got to drive there it's that I'm not

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:19.139
complaining I'm just saying that's how

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:21.059
it is and then you know you have a

00:14:19.139 --> 00:14:22.680
spouse you're spending time with your

00:14:21.059 --> 00:14:25.500
spouse you know that's at least a few

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:27.120
hours a day for most people I'm not

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.620
complaining again I'm not saying that

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.920
eats up your free time I'm just saying

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:34.319
it's an obligation for better and for

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.910
worse that you got to keep in mind that

00:14:34.319 --> 00:14:37.500
if you got oh ha but you ever wonder why

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:39.540
it's like if you're an adult it's

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:41.550
impossible to get people together even

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.740
to do like recordings for YouTube it's

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:46.350
impossible to go like Mathis and I were

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:48.029
supposed to meet like 36 minutes ago to

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:49.620
record some Escapist and he was like can

00:14:48.029 --> 00:14:51.029
i delay it by an hour and I was like I

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.110
don't know I got obligations tonight you

00:14:51.029 --> 00:14:53.189
know I got to go grocery shopping and

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:56.040
got these dinners that are going to go

00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:57.420
bad I got to cook them you know you like

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.610
I got a Kate and I are going to go see a

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:01.050
movie or something like that please take

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:02.610
this and then he's like ok ok how about

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:03.720
Friday and I was like no Friday we got

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.699
the battlegrounds thing that we got a

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.809
record so I can do Friday and I'm like

00:15:05.699 --> 00:15:07.950
how about Thursday and he's like no

00:15:06.809 --> 00:15:10.800
Thursday I got my own

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:12.330
so like life fills up fast and as a as a

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.940
teenager you don't have all those

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:16.710
responsibilities so most people at least

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:19.230
now some of you you might be in like a

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:20.940
difficult family situation or you know

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:22.320
you've got to take care of your brothers

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:24.540
and sisters or something like that but

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:27.120
on average I'd say that that's that's

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:28.410
not the norm not that I'm telling you

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.180
you know how to live your life that's

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:34.830
the item we're looking for right there

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:38.280
we will take that so it's good I think

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:39.810
to keep kids occupied you know keep

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:42.030
young adults occupied give them things

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:43.140
that kind of push them out of their

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:46.800
comfort zone and encourage them to

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:48.360
generate new skills for example on the

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.440
other hand I also you know I struggle

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.550
with the idea that kids should be kids

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.380
you know maybe we shouldn't be

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:54.060
overloading kids with homework like

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:55.860
crazy and oh by the way if you ever want

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:58.350
to get into like a bead to your Ivy

00:15:55.860 --> 00:16:00.390
League school you ever want to go to

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:03.840
brown no offense we go to brown I mean

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:04.800
it's better school and I went to and if

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.350
you're watching this and you're going

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:10.500
excuse me later one two look up you know

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:12.750
schools in Canada I know since I didn't

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:15.540
go to a bad school I'm not insulted in

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:17.850
the you know the tartan shades of Queens

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:20.850
University oil flying a banner getting a

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:23.100
bandwagon que ah you know you taught me

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:26.610
Gaelic at least you know four or five

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:29.010
words of it like that's that's tough for

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:30.960
a kid to be oh sorry I can't be a kid

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:32.970
tonight I got to go to like you know I

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:36.540
don't know what a teenagers do these

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:38.130
days calligraphy class I got to do eight

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:40.950
years of calligraphy class so I'm not

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:44.520
lying on my entrance essay that I write

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:48.960
to try to get into trying to think of

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:52.200
other non Harvard Yale Princeton is

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:56.970
probably an Ivy League plus we all know

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:59.070
it's about Caltech anyway like I don't

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:00.780
know anything about Caltech except that

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:02.700
Alex from Modern Family wanted to go

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:05.190
there in one of the last seasons that I

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:08.760
I wouldn't say watch but like it was on

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:11.160
well I was in the same room like that

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:13.290
show started real nice and then I just

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:15.870
got a little like a couple seasons and

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:17.430
it was just like every characters got

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:20.089
their own little beat they have to hit

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:20.089
every single episode

00:17:21.689 --> 00:17:25.449
anyway I digress

00:17:23.649 --> 00:17:27.100
we're on sister biz we're actually

00:17:25.449 --> 00:17:31.090
crushing this right this is a joke run

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:32.440
for purist we have not needed any item

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:34.419
rooms because our shops and deals with

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.789
the devil have like predominantly been

00:17:34.419 --> 00:17:38.260
extremely good so we'll finally use our

00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:39.970
deal with the devil here I mean I'm kind

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.950
of tempted to get book of Belial but I

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:44.409
actually just don't really think it's

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:45.880
necessary plus I kind of like having

00:17:44.409 --> 00:17:47.289
Krampus instead it's going to allow us

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:51.549
to easily like cheese up these bosses

00:17:47.289 --> 00:17:53.080
and I think that I have a hard time

00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:56.620
believing that we're going to lose this

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:58.179
one with two floors remaining here this

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.620
will be a nice like capstone to our

00:17:58.179 --> 00:18:01.480
challenges here we did lose a couple of

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:06.309
challenges on the first pass but I think

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:08.049
that's relatively okay one of them if I

00:18:06.309 --> 00:18:11.740
remember correctly I basically threw

00:18:08.049 --> 00:18:13.630
away for no reason so did you kind of

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:15.870
owe myself a what's the opposite of a

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:17.890
debt of gratitude it's like a credit of

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:21.940
ignorance something like that what's the

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:25.720
opposite of gratitude gratitude is when

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:28.120
you're thankful for something the dead

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:30.730
of resentment there you go plus sounds

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:34.029
like a great name for like a Titus

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:36.610
Andronicus album it can come after a

00:18:34.029 --> 00:18:38.289
more perfect union kind of dated myself

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:40.419
on the hipster scale I think that albums

00:18:38.289 --> 00:18:43.510
from like 2008 great album though dude

00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:46.770
great album lead singers got a beard

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:46.770
like Richard hammer as well

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:56.260
where we off to we are possibly going to

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:58.540
be able to make the shot that I don't

00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:00.070
want to do these Ches possibly going to

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:01.720
be able to make the shop work I will

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:04.090
probably check the curse room as well I

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.470
mean we're just hitting the obvious kind

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:07.210
of touch stones at this point this is

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:11.320
easy money

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:15.580
we'll grab this key and we will grab

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:17.950
this card that can be the first title

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:20.110
off of credit of gratitude or credit of

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:25.080
resentment dead of resentment sounds way

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:27.100
better but credit of resentment focus

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.790
turns into like a deviantART account

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:33.610
okay so we definitely want Guppies head

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:40.330
12 out of 12 item you can take then we

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:42.610
wind it back and at this point to be

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:45.550
honest with you what I'm mostly looking

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:46.570
for is an opportunity to either bust it

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:49.720
wide open which I don't think we're

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:52.150
going to have or something to be a

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.710
little zany on this one like we can't

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:56.230
really do this but I was looking at that

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:59.050
self sacrifice room like it that could

00:19:56.230 --> 00:20:00.450
be fun but we don't have enough HP to do

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:03.220
that

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:06.090
Emperor cards would also be pretty sick

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:09.310
mapping of any sort would be pretty sick

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:10.870
if we went outside with wet hair we'd

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:14.590
probably get pretty sick or is that a

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:20.500
mint I don't know you guys have myths

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:22.120
that you you have heard like reputable

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:24.150
sources tell you are false but you still

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:26.140
cling to because that's one like I

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:27.880
wouldn't say we get an arguments about

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:32.650
it I had this discussion with Kate all

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:33.580
the time no she'll be like you know why

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:35.440
are you going outside without a jacket

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:39.790
on you're going to catch a cold and I'm

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:41.860
like well actually it's spread by you

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:43.330
know germs it's not actually just being

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.920
in an environment where you're cold and

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:46.840
she goes yeah but being under dressed

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.490
for the weather can you know inhibit

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.140
your immune system and suppress it and

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:51.910
as a result we be more open to infection

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:54.310
and I say wait a minute you weren't

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:56.440
supposed to use knowledge against me I'm

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:58.030
supposed to be the one with the you know

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.440
the infallible knowledge here and here

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:00.490
you are Eddie hidden me with facts and

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.999
then I put a coat on because I know

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:04.779
what's good

00:21:00.999 --> 00:21:07.509
but none of these are really good enough

00:21:04.779 --> 00:21:09.489
Libra is kind of fun but we'll save that

00:21:07.509 --> 00:21:12.849
for our future zane once we get whatever

00:21:09.489 --> 00:21:14.499
is unlocked in the purest but my parents

00:21:12.849 --> 00:21:16.449
are like that you know i have to go back

00:21:14.499 --> 00:21:18.369
in time here because it's when i had

00:21:16.449 --> 00:21:21.489
hair but okay well that's like really

00:21:18.369 --> 00:21:22.869
fair really appreciate that um they were

00:21:21.489 --> 00:21:24.309
like you know you have to dry off your

00:21:22.869 --> 00:21:26.649
hair before you go outside and i was

00:21:24.309 --> 00:21:29.079
like that's not the way that's that's

00:21:26.649 --> 00:21:30.789
not how it works but they they adhered

00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:32.499
to it regardless i'm kind of that way

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:34.509
with swimming to be honest with you

00:21:32.499 --> 00:21:36.279
apparently it is and don't quote me on

00:21:34.509 --> 00:21:39.189
this because if you die i don't want to

00:21:36.279 --> 00:21:40.809
be held responsible but apparently the

00:21:39.189 --> 00:21:44.049
wait thirty minutes before getting into

00:21:40.809 --> 00:21:45.729
the pool because you'll cramp up truism

00:21:44.049 --> 00:21:48.969
is not a true wisdom at all it's

00:21:45.729 --> 00:21:51.039
actually an old wives tale but

00:21:48.969 --> 00:21:52.659
definitely in my head I'm still like

00:21:51.039 --> 00:21:54.489
would I go into the pool right after

00:21:52.659 --> 00:21:55.959
swimming no not necessarily because I

00:21:54.489 --> 00:21:57.639
think I'm gonna die but because you know

00:21:55.959 --> 00:22:01.029
I'm I'm worried I'm gonna cramp up and

00:21:57.639 --> 00:22:04.869
be uncomfortable I think everybody's got

00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:11.409
some like that I kind of feel that way

00:22:04.869 --> 00:22:14.439
about like home remedies to like the one

00:22:11.409 --> 00:22:15.489
that gets me is a drinking ginger ale

00:22:14.439 --> 00:22:17.289
when you're sick

00:22:15.489 --> 00:22:21.039
I always drank ginger ale when I was

00:22:17.289 --> 00:22:22.719
sick now ginger I believe can help you

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:24.789
know boost your immune system now I know

00:22:22.719 --> 00:22:26.529
as soon as you say boost your immune

00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:29.439
system it sounds like pseudoscience and

00:22:26.529 --> 00:22:32.649
it may be but I thought that ginger was

00:22:29.439 --> 00:22:35.859
like a real for whatever reason its

00:22:32.649 --> 00:22:39.219
therapeutic in times of you know mild

00:22:35.859 --> 00:22:41.679
illness that being said most modern

00:22:39.219 --> 00:22:43.599
ginger ale at least you know non craft

00:22:41.679 --> 00:22:45.669
sodas don't have any ginger in it they

00:22:43.599 --> 00:22:49.089
got like ginger flavoring they made as a

00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:51.419
you know food factory in Mississauga

00:22:49.089 --> 00:22:51.419
Ontario

00:22:52.350 --> 00:23:00.110
shoutout to the former you know site of

00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:00.110
the Palladium kind of like seven seals

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:05.400
there there there used to be a gray in

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:08.250
town it was he that's me trying to sing

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:11.970
seven times in a row kiss from a rose as

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:14.460
seal not really going to work but but

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:16.740
still when I get sick I don't do it

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:18.150
because I like I want to this is where

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.309
I'm breaking my superstition and not

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:24.169
passing it on to the next generation but

00:23:20.309 --> 00:23:26.520
I am like oh dude chaos card thank you

00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:28.740
whenever I'm sick I'm like I should get

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:31.140
some ginger ale like I know that it

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.100
doesn't help but it would feel really

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:35.580
nice to have ginger I think I just

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:38.100
sometimes want to get sick as an excuse

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:40.110
to consume ginger ale and I don't know I

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.970
mean Schweppes in Canada dry you guys

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:45.500
have got your your talents into me deep

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:48.120
somehow I don't know how you did it but

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:49.500
apparently though and we learned about

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:51.210
this in school which doesn't necessarily

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.559
make it true but it means that there's

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:54.960
probably a source out there that

00:23:52.559 --> 00:23:57.150
somebody can point to apparently though

00:23:54.960 --> 00:24:00.650
chicken noodle soup when you have a cold

00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:03.299
or flu is actually like it has a mild

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:06.270
proven scientific benefit for whatever

00:24:03.299 --> 00:24:07.590
reason maybe like soup loosening mucus

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:11.429
and your throat and alleviating symptoms

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:12.659
or something like that but something

00:24:11.429 --> 00:24:15.480
along those lines

00:24:12.659 --> 00:24:18.150
I know truth is stranger than fiction I

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.880
think people have these ideas that you

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:23.400
know the home remedies are somehow purer

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:25.409
than medicine and sometimes that's maybe

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.730
true and sometimes it's not like one

00:24:25.409 --> 00:24:29.309
time Caden I went out to dinner and I

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:31.740
was clearly getting sick like my voice

00:24:29.309 --> 00:24:33.809
was really hoarse so when we paid the

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:35.130
the server was like by the way you know

00:24:33.809 --> 00:24:37.140
if you got a sore throat I got the

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:39.000
perfect remedy for you and she basically

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:40.860
gave me like a recipe off the top of her

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.720
head that was like a shot of whiskey

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:48.360
like half of a juicer lemon black pepper

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:50.549
cayenne pepper ginger orange juice and

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:55.230
like a celery stock and I was like oh

00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:57.000
the same mardi-gras I'm ill I don't

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:58.500
think that that I mean I I do appreciate

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.669
your desire to help another human being

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.870
but I'm at the same time a little bit

00:24:59.669 --> 00:25:05.100
incredulous maybe because I'm a little

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:05.980
bit of a jerk do I care about chaos

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:08.470
cards here

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:09.930
my god what I need to do is go home you

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:12.400
know get some sleep

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:14.170
stop spreading the virus that I have to

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.460
other people and you know take two days

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:18.310
off or something like that and then

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:20.170
we're going to be good if anything you

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:21.940
should be like mad at me because I came

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:23.140
to your restaurant with a mild cold I

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:25.420
could infect like the whole place

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:26.680
including yourself if I infect you

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:28.410
you're gonna infect like 200 people

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:31.410
because you have a forward-facing job

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:34.120
yell at me not unlike a weird you know

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:35.680
King shaming sort of way anyway weird

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.180
dude the purists was actually like the

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:39.550
easiest thing in the world here we got

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:41.500

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:43.600

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.080

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.540

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:48.790

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:51.070
