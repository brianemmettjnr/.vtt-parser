00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.689
everybody welcome back to know the land

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.700
please the binding of issac actors plus

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.030
we're the last two runs have just been

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.280
like the easiest runs in my history on

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.179
planet earth and I'm not saying that to

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:19.980
be braggadocious you know this is zz9 PE

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.850
W ATS all I'm trying to say to you which

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.689
let me try again

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.420
ZZ man PE w ad find out what the scene

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:33.440
is gonna waiting it up find out if it's

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:36.329
a great scene VZ 9 p w ad where's my

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.620
magic machine give it to me give it to

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.250
me give it to me give it to me give it

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.930
to me give it to me get anyway they've

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.309
been you've probably turned off the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.850
episode by now so now that we can talk

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.390
you know one to one it's uh it basically

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.789
just had great seeds and you know I

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:57.149
can't complain whatsoever about this his

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.230
bad time for a framerate dip if you'll

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.840
excuse me

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.110
we're going to close that and get good

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.510
to go here alright

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.189
Samson easy money and by that what I

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.640
mean is if we get money the run could be

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.549
easy

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.150
we basically need five cents try to get

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.710
a blood bag sorry a blood bank I in my

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.939
head I said don't say the wrong thing

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.729
and I said the wrong thing probably

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.640
because I was overthinking it but if

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.950
we're able to make that happen

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.930
Marzuki I can see forever also very good

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.790
and you know I don't mind an orbital at

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.860
this point even if it's not the ten out

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:37.380
of ten best orbital we'd ever expect to

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:40.799
see if we get an IV bag I had to check

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.600
if we get an IV bag we're usually in a

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.810
pretty good spot as Samson as long as we

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.990
can you know keep ourselves in rocks in

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.270
relatively good shape health-wise

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.520
because we can basically mill our own HP

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.720
for damage which you know tends to work

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.689
out pretty well

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.610
mom's razor it's better and I don't like

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.310
this style of orbital but I'll talk

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.930
about it anyway it's better defensively

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.570
than it is offensively because it just

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.080
doesn't do that much damage

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.129
all those feels nice I'm excited largely

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:18.659
irrelevant probably

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:20.950
well hold tears down so that at least

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.260
don't you guys don't spawn into other

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.610
things to you at least if we somehow end

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.840
up getting PhD then it'll become a tears

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.170
upgrade but the odds of this are very

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.420
very low and I accept that fully so

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.090
Larry it's going to calm Larry David

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.980
Larry jr. a little dangerous with I'm

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.450
excited but obviously we sorted it now

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.599
we're looking like we're in a great spot

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.010
actually even with the tears downgrade

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.420
which is pretty bad we all we wanted to

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.519
see is an arcade and that's exactly what

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.709
we got so we're going to crank on this

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.060
and the thing is even if it only works

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.150
for us on this floor

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.950
ie it doesn't give us IV bag with any

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.629
reasonable length of time or within any

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.269
reasonable length of time it's still

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:03.810
really good for giving us like one full

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:07.030
floor of having like five devil cards I

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.560
can see forever is also fine I'm going

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.109
to blow you up which I shouldn't have

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.200
done that quickly but that's fine

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:19.120
because now we have like I mean not like

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.500
we have literally ten damage so I'm

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.540
feeling very very good about this

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.940
situation oh you guys have I'm excited

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.799
active right now despite the fact that I

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.569
popped that on a previous floor know no

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.989
harm no foul don't worry

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.989
that's my bad in some way that I'll find

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:38.310
a way to justify later still in a good

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:42.819
spot do need to be very worried about

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:45.879
apparently about I'm excited popping if

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.849
I remember correctly I think bleed makes

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:51.099
enemies take more damage so it can be

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.739
nice I guess to inflict a bigger enemy

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:56.530
with the with bleed and then take them

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.959
out but it's not going to work all the

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.419
time here and there is a little bit of

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.650
danger inherent in it oh yeah I just

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:04.900
wanted I was going to give you a key

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.340
anyway so don't even sweat it out every

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.699
time I see a key bagger I go give him a

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.949
key come on be nice he's he's worked for

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:14.639
it he's not going to spend it on locks

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.639
immediately

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.729
it's going to be like a very small

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.840
subset of the population that's going to

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.340
hear that joke and be like I don't get

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.590
it why is he talking about smoked-salmon

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.699
I'm not talking about smoked salmon I'm

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:31.280
talking about the thing that you insert

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:35.750
a key into key value pair no not a not a

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.220
multiset you nerd nerds have their pants

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.120
pulled down they're spanked with moon

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:43.070
rocks normally I wouldn't think it's the

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.110
biggest priority for us to you know use

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.360
a bomb to get a red heart but because of

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.490
the chance of getting IV bag and that

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.470
having like potentially enormous

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.560
implications I did it back there and

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:58.729
I'll do it again right here if we have

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.169
to what we do we have I can see forever

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.509
so we know where our secret rooms are

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.620
likely to be either way again this is

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.750
the thing with Samson if you can get

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.669
that Arcade sure you get the chance at

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.440
an IV bag or blood bag either which

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:12.440
would be fine

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.789
varying from fine to great you also get

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.349
the damage bonus on the floor which I

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:17.120
talked about but even if you get the

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:19.160
chance to just play it a lot either way

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.720
you get a bunch of money so we can go to

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.190
our shop and hopefully pick up you know

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.780
the ideal combination would be like

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:28.310
Steam sale restock or something like

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.870
that but we got 52 cents so this is

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.060
actually like a really really good

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.009
situation to be in I don't know if I'll

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.349
walk back to play the blood bank once I

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:39.979
acknowledge completely that that one

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:41.840
play may well be IV bag but at some

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:44.210
point you know saner heads have to

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:49.370
prevail so like both of these are pretty

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:51.919
horrible a bunch of red hearts not a

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.550
bunch of red hearts Guppies tail nothing

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:56.539
wrong with that

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:59.449
gobs tail Oh woohoo mostly good for

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:00.919
enabling transformations well this is

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:03.830
not the syllabic structure of this I'll

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:07.190
tell you what for two cents I'll go back

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.349
try go check on that bombs are key I'm

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.900
pretty much irrelevant at this point I

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:13.509
really don't want to buy the Bible 15

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.159
cents to a naval book worm and fly

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:19.370
occasionally it's just like not very

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:21.889
good we know we're going to get an

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.449
arcade though or not an arcade sorry I

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:25.099
deal with the devil unless we die we'll

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:26.539
get a deal with the devil so we're not

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:28.490
going to play this guy anymore I'm sorry

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:28.880
you did I don't need to apologize you

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.320
did great

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.780
work you got me up to ten damaged

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.640
unfortunately we're going to be Bank

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.920
down to three point five after the end

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.530
of this floor but you know you made this

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:44.270
floor nice and I respect that and I

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:50.150
appreciate that thank you let's try our

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:53.810
strat here I want him to bleed he's not

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:58.700
bleeding I'm not bleeding yeah you will

00:06:53.810 --> 00:07:00.620
not bleed I don't understand well you

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.570
know what quirks of the game probably

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.700
because of the Lord the deep monster

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:10.460
allure I'm unaware of definitely will

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:10.820
take mob deployed nice little damage

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.400
boost

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.960
I basically accidentally walked into

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:19.720
betrayal don't tell anybody

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:23.900
mom's coin purse has X lakhs tears down

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:26.240
tears up I guess we'll take tears down

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.430
with us so if we're not able to use our

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.960
HP with IV bag will use our HP to pick

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.610
up deals with the devil instead betrayal

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.800
sucks and there was basically no reason

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.580
to pick it up but mob the void is

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.240
wonderful

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:42.290
and I'm glad we didn't take a bad space

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.760
bar item from the shop because we got a

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.680
bad space bar item right here for the

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.350
low low price of you know on the house

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:51.200
it's much better

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:52.730
but even 5.19 damage is not a bad

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.490
position to be in by any stretch of the

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:57.350
imagination especially with the added

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:59.720
you know ring from mob the void dealing

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:02.810
a bunch of damage we hadn't room to grow

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:05.060
and it is fair to remember that on like

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:07.610
the previous episodes I mean by the end

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.290
of three episodes ago or something or

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:12.670
the end of the episode two episodes ago

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:18.110
it's going to charge buffs rotten head

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:21.260
we had 75 damage or something I know on

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:23.270
one of them we got I believe every

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:26.390
damage multiplier you can get now I know

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:27.650
that after the first one they don't

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.750
actually help you out that much I'm just

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:31.060
suggesting you know we were spoiled for

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.169
choice

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.610
we're also we're starting to run out of

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:36.680
keys

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:41.469
no wouldn't say it has me too concerned

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:43.969
but something to keep an eye on here I

00:08:41.469 --> 00:08:45.380
thought this was an Excel floor like I

00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:46.930
thought that was an arcade for a second

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:49.130
I was freaking out

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:54.680
very surprising we got out of that

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:55.610
without taking damage mom's bottle of

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.100
pills

00:08:55.610 --> 00:09:01.420
basically bad I forgot another we don't

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:03.500
have to worry about our keys that much

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:05.600
well we'll take it I guess if it tears

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:10.220
up pills in a rotation we'll take it in

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:12.700
balls of steel but it's not that bad

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:15.279
because we can use our keys to open

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:17.810
chests as long as we're using

00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:19.279
pay-to-play to open doors which we don't

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:22.579
have a choice we're going to have to do

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:24.290
that which is awesome so I think we can

00:09:22.579 --> 00:09:31.870
actually afford to go down to Keys zero

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:37.010
if we want to keys a row zero our key

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:40.790
containers and B C we don't need many

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:43.880
keys keys el0

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:47.510
C that's que sera sera but instead of

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:52.329
que sera sera I've changed into Isaac

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:55.100
related lyrics what a did comedy genius

00:09:52.329 --> 00:09:59.540
well I mean you said it not me and in

00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:02.750
you know the Royal you okay people are

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:04.220
shop here I'm assuming and oh we don't

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:06.940
pay for Blue map I'm not particularly

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:10.329
thrilled about the prospect of it but

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:12.620
probably should pay for a key as well

00:10:10.329 --> 00:10:14.720
blue maps not doing much for us right

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:22.100
here but you know I've got my innate

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:24.430
sense to handle that stars cards well we

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.690
would probably keep a strength card

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:28.730
because the Stars card at this point

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:34.760
saves us literally a single penny so

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:36.290
it's not high on the food chain ended up

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.709
being a surprisingly good value right

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.050
there

00:10:36.709 --> 00:10:42.140
how about boss rush I think there's a

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:44.330
there's a genuine chance

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.860
the boss rush could happen it would be

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.270
nice if we if we sort of beat the odds

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:52.580
and got a deal with the devil on this

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:59.150
floor the odds aren't great but they

00:10:52.580 --> 00:11:01.460
aren't bad whoo I didn't deviate from

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:04.580
the path quickly if I should have you

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:09.590
are very fast we beat the odds okay

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:11.060
no Krampus um I mean they okay here's

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:12.470
the deal we'll take this I don't think

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.360
little delirium is great but then we'll

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:15.980
pop our strengths card we'll pick up I

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.630
of Belial I think this item is actually

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:19.730
quite good and then we'll take our HP

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:23.360
upgrade anyway and I don't care about

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:28.510
the diaper so that ended up being a very

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:32.180
very good strength card I would still

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:33.740
absolutely love IV bag which means I

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:35.180
probably should not play the demon

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.880
judgement first that's a little bit of a

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:39.530
silly play even though the demon

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:41.690
judgment could also give me great stuff

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:47.900
so the key beggar-like I'm sorry buddy

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:50.390
you just got no chance more HP is

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:52.970
exactly what we need right now so we're

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:55.040
like you know what let's play the demon

00:11:52.970 --> 00:12:00.440
judgment first I want to see what you

00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:02.450
got I think it's debatable what could be

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:05.380
better here we're still getting the

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:07.910
damage bonus on this floor either way

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:11.570
and if he gives me gimpy or something

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:13.010
like that we're solid so I know I know

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:14.660
we probably shouldn't be doing this part

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:17.300
but I'm gonna do it anyway because you

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:19.520
know no no no wait till I get my money

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:22.910
right I'm just you can't tell me nothing

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.740
experimental treatment largely not that

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:26.240
bad

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:28.220
the damage decrease may eventually be

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:36.260
heinous but for now you're like eh we're

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:38.570
still at 11 damage cares you don't need

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:42.580
it as much damage with piercing shots of

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:42.580
course I'd always rather have more but

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:52.990
I'm excited please stop with these these

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:52.990
awful pills I have no interest in

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:57.620
Satanic Bible is lovely we're going to

00:12:56.150 --> 00:13:00.020
get bookworm here which also helps to

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:02.840
compensate for the damage downgrade book

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:05.810
of sin she's given us a red heart pretty

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:08.000
much the ideal payout I mean we should

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:09.290
go with Satanic Bible is kind of the

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.180
more boring choice but it's also

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:13.910
definitely the right choice and weirdly

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:16.540
enough this run is kind of like a little

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:19.460
bit of one of those ones where we should

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:21.410
adhere to best practices stats are good

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:24.020
and maybe I'm only thinking this because

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:25.580
it's slightly worse at least it's not as

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:29.900
good as quickly as the runs we've had

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:31.370
recently but we shouldn't really be too

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:34.940
concerned about the way things are going

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:37.370
here because it's like the easiest run

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:39.980
we I mean I know I'm just verbal

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:41.720
diarrhea it's been a long day IV bag

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.490
that's what we're looking for and we

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.410
even have the HP necessary to make it

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.970
work so as far as I'm concerned you know

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:50.720
deals with the angel are my new best

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:56.450
friend deals with the devil are no

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:57.950
longer my best friend by the way the

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:59.840
better our damage is we're not going to

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:03.830
get any deals with the Angels unless we

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:05.360
get duality but the better our damage is

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:06.680
the better mob the void is because it

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.270
kills things faster and when it kills

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.940
things they can drop black hearts so

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:12.080
really this is like it's a run where the

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:16.280
rich are just going to keep getting

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:19.040
richer ideally at least the only thing

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:21.920
and this is undone more Sampson runs

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:24.260
than I'd like to admit the only thing

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:30.350
that's very dangerous in this situation

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:33.050
is the oh I don't know maybe this is

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:37.520
good I had a tangent that is now

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:40.670
irrelevant every time we use the IV bag

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:44.810
we're going to get a incredibly small

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:49.430
all stats upgrade what a weird concept

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:50.800
okay so Libra and it's still good don't

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:53.390
get me wrong

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:56.600
not not Libra necessarily but like our

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.360
run is still good but I think the Libra

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.269
pickup was

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.769
big question mark and it's a big

00:15:00.269 --> 00:15:04.019
question mark that's also given us the

00:15:01.769 --> 00:15:08.120
middle finger it's like the edgy

00:15:04.019 --> 00:15:10.200
question mark deaths touch razor blade

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:11.190
this was highly debatable whether or not

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.649
we should have even done this because

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:15.959
now we have no HP with which to use IV

00:15:13.649 --> 00:15:18.540
bag so our steps might be horrible on

00:15:15.959 --> 00:15:20.820
the next floor but we did get a little

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.620
HP which is nice and we did also get

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.390
deaths touch which was a good stats

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:30.899
upgrade for us to begin with I think at

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:33.290
least so we use this once and this is

00:15:30.899 --> 00:15:36.690
the moment of truth honestly I'm very

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:41.910
eager to see how things work out for us

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:44.430
here but it's I don't know if we've ever

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:47.100
had we probably had this before but it's

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:49.350
still a strange run child's heart is

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:53.339
going to potentially pay huge dividends

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:54.779
for us here and it's a tempting is

00:15:53.339 --> 00:15:56.610
actually blood bag would be very nice

00:15:54.779 --> 00:16:01.860
the speed upgrade would be and all stats

00:15:56.610 --> 00:16:04.260
upgrade you got a try it's not like

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.940
we're using the money for anything this

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:08.279
is why I like Libra you don't have to

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:09.899
Libra is like very shy it always shows

00:16:08.279 --> 00:16:11.399
up with these curses of the blind am ia

00:16:09.899 --> 00:16:14.790
don't need to do that it's okay

00:16:11.399 --> 00:16:19.709
I would I love you just the way you are

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:25.170
when I see your face and know my stats

00:16:19.709 --> 00:16:33.810
are gonna change cuz Libra balances your

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:34.920
stats constantly this is where normally

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:36.930
you'd be saying alright he's going to

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.029
say the second part that's actually

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:40.620
going to make this relevant but I think

00:16:39.029 --> 00:16:46.740
I've just lost it on that one I think

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:48.480
that one's just dusted yeah yeah bust a

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:51.690
botch bit hey it happens from time to

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:54.510
time at least I'm not a surgeon not that

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:55.920
there's any danger of that gosh if it

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:57.420
means something a lot different if

00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:01.529
you're working in the you know the

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:04.150
surgery department means a lawsuit high

00:17:01.529 --> 00:17:06.770
voltage

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:08.990
where's our item room

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:10.910
I'm always resentful these days when

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:13.100
they put the item room far away from the

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:15.800
boss room and far away from the shop for

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:18.110
that matter like what am I supposed to

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.459
just spend my whole life exploring how

00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:20.839
about you just give me the item and we

00:17:19.459 --> 00:17:25.120
leave it at that dude we're getting

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:27.140
every deal with the devil like I I can't

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:32.059
avoid a deal with the devil it's a

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:33.230
wonderful situation that's dude can't

00:17:32.059 --> 00:17:35.179
believe there was still two pills we

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:37.670
hadn't seen at this point we've been

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:41.510
pretty vigilant about getting as many of

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:43.960
them as we can Sookie I'm sure I'll tell

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:46.580
you what we'll use one bombs of key I

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:51.080
only say one because there were actually

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:54.020
two back there I think it's pretty clear

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:56.240
that this run is still still pretty good

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:59.140
it's still pretty hot I'm trying to

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:03.190
bring back that's hot well actually like

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:05.059
Michael al Fox said that hot on Twitter

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:08.900
and I'm trying to appeal to a younger

00:18:05.059 --> 00:18:10.910
audience I was 15 when the simple life

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:13.309
14 or 15 when the simple life started

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:15.290
airing with you know Nicole Richie and

00:18:13.309 --> 00:18:18.980
Paris Hilton I just called him the : P

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:24.080
hilts which is unintentionally ironic

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:29.240
given a rise to fame but either way if

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:30.440
that show really appealed to me for many

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.300
reasons

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:34.100
then I'm now trying to make up on the

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:36.800
fly because obviously it was like a

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:38.620
garbage piece of entertainment uh I was

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.059
so stupid of me

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:43.190
yeah yeah you know Paris Hilton she has

00:18:41.059 --> 00:18:45.440
it's very common phrase that's hot and

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:47.120
I'm like you know should bring that back

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:49.179
because it just says is everything

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:52.480
World Peace achieved in the West Bank

00:18:49.179 --> 00:18:52.480
that's hot

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.810
don't you worry about a thing cause

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.070
every little thing is going to be

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:01.290
alright oh that's hot

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:06.660
McDonald's all-day breakfast oh it's hot

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:08.520
as hell it's like the exact opposite of

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:13.440
that don't impress me much remember I

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:15.030
had a friend who actually he's at he's

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.500
like a literal genius and I don't mean

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.910
that in the way that like I'm gonna

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.380
insult him so I'm gonna compliment them

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:21.840
first so you don't think I'm a bad guy

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:24.510
you guys actually a straight-up genius

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:27.890
who does some genius work right now but

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:31.590
when it comes to culture he's a little

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:33.420
he'd be surprised what he's into I guess

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:35.160
and that's not things into shameful

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:38.280
things necessarily I'm just saying like

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:41.430
I remember he was talking to me it was

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:43.380
like 12 years ago and he's like dude the

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:46.140
press is not being very nice - Paris

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:48.330
Hilton that song stars are blind is

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:51.240
actually like a really good pop song and

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:52.830
am I feeling okay one of the smartest

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.780
dudes I know and you you think that

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:59.540
Paris Hilton's music career is going to

00:19:54.780 --> 00:20:03.330
take off here's the thing Paris Hilton

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:05.910
that was like the playbook in 2004 is

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:08.670
like get famous maybe first fellatio

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:12.390
maybe not doesn't matter and then you

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:15.630
know spin it out model actress music

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:18.230
career but if you're gonna be Paris

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:23.490
Hilton and your whole brand is

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:24.900
predicated on trashiness and I this is

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:27.090
not Paris Hilton now I don't know what

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:32.610
she does now okay and it's better this

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:35.040
way that was the brand for her in like

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:36.450
2004 was basically language you know she

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.940
goes out and parties all the time and

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:40.620
then you know her TV show is like I'm

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.180
gonna go work as a welder and then

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:44.190
they'd be like put on this welding mask

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:46.200
and she'd be like this doesn't match my

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:48.240
outfit and you're like come on nobody's

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.320
just stupid I know you're not this but

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.540
you're playing it up for entertainment

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.830
but your brand is nothing your brand is

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.780
worthless I'm just saying your brand is

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:58.260
trashing us and then the song comes out

00:20:54.780 --> 00:21:00.900
Italy even if the guys are crazy even if

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:04.040
the stars are blind if you show me we

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:06.830
love baby I'll show you man

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:08.600
yeah okay it's just two it's two Disney

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.860
Channel I don't know what your

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.140
consultants were thinking you should

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:16.490
have come out with like some peaches

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:18.050
level just raunchy I would have had and

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:19.850
I think this goes to the public at large

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:22.400
I'm not saying it would have been a hit

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:23.810
but neither what stars are blind because

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.750
it turns how people are happy to watch

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:31.490
you for free but not necessarily to buy

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:34.610
your single on iTunes either way if she

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:37.250
had just come out and if she had Lady

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:39.290
Gaga's like disco stick or something

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:40.790
like that you know let's have some fun

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:43.070
this beat is sick I want to take a ride

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:44.540
on your disco stick I think that would

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:46.970
have been like so much more applauded

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:49.670
about instead she got famous for having

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:51.530
a tape in which she engages in fellatio

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:56.660
and then sexual intercourse or so I hear

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:59.750
and then you know it TV show where she's

00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:02.150
just like basically a jerk to

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:06.680
working-class blue-collar folks and then

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:09.590
oh but they got Union rail third Union

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:12.380
rail that's a some cool with John golf

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:14.330
stuff no they got there they got paid

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:17.660
scale for that so don't tell me they

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:20.180
weren't getting their share okay let's

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:21.290
let's go in here I know we could go for

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:24.560
the Guffey dream but I'm just a little

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:25.880
nervous about the whole HP situation

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:29.630
right now which is why I also have not

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:31.580
used IV bag on this floor anyway you

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:35.240
can't come out and then do a song that's

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:40.060
like what the woman needs now is love

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:43.070
sweet yup you got trash it up you did it

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:44.930
we don't need that I know a shield of

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:46.430
Tears could be good here but you did an

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:52.460
ad with Carl's jr. where you put on a

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:55.100
like a bikini basically and then ate a

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:58.550
Carl's jr. like you know jalapeno popper

00:22:55.100 --> 00:23:00.680
Baconator well getting like soaking wet

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:02.060
washing this car and then you know what

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.860
do you want for your first single Paris

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:05.120
should it be you know let's have some

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.980
fun this beat is sick I want to take a

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.550
ride on your disco stick that seems on

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:10.760
brand

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:13.160
now do the one about wholesome real love

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:15.890
I think that's what the Paris Hilton

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.630
brand represents right now anyway you

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:21.470
know I don't work in the industry

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:22.940
mostly so I am I'm not going to tell her

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:26.300
what to do but I will tell her that her

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:30.950
experiment failed I don't wish or any

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:32.960
ill will you know anymore in 2004 I

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:36.910
wouldn't say I wished her harm in 2004

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:39.050
but I was like hey have you guys seen

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:40.970
adaptation it's a really Charlie

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:42.590
Kaufman's done it again and then

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:45.560
everyone's like I just watch The Simple

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:50.420
Life and I'm like why can't other 10th

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:53.300
graders be intellectuals this is exactly

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:56.090
the right time to be having these sorts

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:58.040
of discussions we're getting our

00:23:56.090 --> 00:24:02.000
learner's permit next year we can drive

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:06.190
to the independent movie theaters what

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.190
is my voice become this I don't know

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:12.650
what do you got for me nothing okay I

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.510
mean I mean I sort of want to open that

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:19.820
but at the same time I'm not sure that I

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:25.250
do know I'm glad I did so we're gonna

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:27.680
keep cranking on like IV bag here case

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:30.500
it's not abundantly clear I basically

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:32.540
it's it seems like we're not getting as

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:36.020
much out of it as I thought that we

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:37.760
would like yeah we're not even getting

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:41.030
stat bonuses anymore like we're already

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:42.410
at the max and I'm not talking about you

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.510
know the colloquial neighbor t.j.maxx

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:47.960
that we all know and love I have no idea

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:51.560
what TJ Maxx is I live in Canada we

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:53.090
don't have PJ max we got Tim Hortons we

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:59.510
don't have JC Penney

00:24:53.090 --> 00:25:01.220
we had zellers temporarily until they

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:03.980
got bought by Target and then went out

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:06.020
of business in a very strange business

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:08.620
deal that nobody understands to this day

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.620
effectively

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:20.560
hey stop that a great name for a show me

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:24.590
walking around today on hey stop that

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:27.170
you know then it's like some guy on an

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:28.550
airplane moves your carry-on into a

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:30.230
place where it's getting crushed to put

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:32.900
his carry-on up there and then I just

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:34.490
walk up hey northernlion from hey stop

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:36.710
that here just wanted to say hey stop

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:44.090
that and the whole plane turns to them

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:46.040
hey Seth dead guy in a BMW cuts you off

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:49.070
without using a single life you know

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:51.920
sirens we will it would seems to be the

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:53.630
problem officer hey stop that the whole

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:56.900
you know traffic turns to him hey

00:25:53.630 --> 00:26:00.080
stepdad dude I'm telling you it's gonna

00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:01.160
they may and also that it's great idea

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:04.760
for a show everybody wants to feel

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:13.310
superior remember that's the best Tears

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:20.300
for Fears song I want more damage please

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:22.940
I know it's not that easy but let's go

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:25.340
that's a stat increase nice actually a

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:27.890
pretty good one and we're goofy the

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:36.430
world is our oyster the world is our can

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:36.430
of salmon we're good to go

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:46.130
I mean we're still like stat-wise this

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:50.390
run is very unlikely to ever be elevated

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:51.950
above like just being pretty good but in

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:53.480
terms of like the the other stuff we got

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:55.490
going on the thing is it can't be

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:59.600
anything worse than pretty good in every

00:26:55.490 --> 00:27:01.400
category plus we're covered so the

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:04.550
things we got going for us right now is

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:07.100
like as long as anyone stat is good all

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:10.910
of them are pretty good the other thing

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:12.650
is all right we're gonna starve flies

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:15.350
that destroy our foes for us so we're

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:16.520
going to crack into this you might as

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:19.340
well take it none that we can do about

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:20.840
it so and then we'll hopefully we're

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:23.990
trying to use our keys for good

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:25.280
basically settled we're not going to get

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:30.380
too much out of it but I think it is

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:32.060
better and even the the Steven upgrade

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:36.250
is not that good from a raw damage

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:36.250
perspective but we got the win like

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:44.420
maybe slow down the key usage ever so

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:47.750
slightly but it is going to be tough for

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:50.950
us to to carve out a loss from a fairly

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:53.540
easy victory here I think at least

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:55.010
infamy is also great completely

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:56.960
justifies coming in here in the first

00:27:55.010 --> 00:28:05.630
place we do have to slow down our key

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:07.430
usage load dude so I'm going to de swell

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:13.010
him a dice shard all this stuff on the

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:16.790
ground might as well you know get a

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:18.610
little more mojo out of his dice Sharna

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:21.110
I mean we're still using keys because I

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:25.430
basically can't be trusted keep my word

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:27.560
here but got a verb pill gives us I can

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:30.080
see forever that was the last pill I

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:32.510
thought was like 20 years ago I took

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:36.080
that I couldn't see forever pill I like

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:38.380
floor to when that happened it's been a

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:43.270
while

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:46.630
I think at this point we have we have

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:50.500
now broached unstoppable ax t we might

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:51.910
be above any sort of consequence which

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:57.460
is not a good position to be in because

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:58.900
it breeds kind of like complacency is

00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:00.610
the word I'm looking for it breeds

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:02.530
complacency because you go you know King

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:04.840
Kong ain't got nothing on me that's that

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:08.080
was my original audition for training

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:10.540
day by the way it's you can see why I

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:12.670
got the part and then selflessly gave it

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:14.860
up to a young actor Denzel Washington

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:17.620
who I mean I was already established in

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:21.310
the industry so I thought you know give

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:23.170
this up and coming you know yeah he had

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:25.900
shops but it was raw talent you know he

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:27.100
needed to hone it in so that's what I

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:28.720
told him I went up to him and I said

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:31.690
Denzel you got this job but you got to

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:35.500
hone it in its alright that's that's my

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:37.420
Denzel Washington impression how you

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.680
doing that's not a very good Denzel

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:42.430
watch it's not as good as my little

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:44.880
Wayne so why not like the rapper that's

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:48.010
you can get better than that

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:49.960
from somebody who's not me okay les

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:53.080
doppelgangers please because there can

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:54.040
be mostly just annoying not that we

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.570
should be taking this damage in the

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:58.480
first place but you know we're kind of

00:29:55.570 --> 00:30:00.820
mild void is dried up free agency market

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:02.980
is not as good as it used to be so not

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:04.660
picking up these uh these hearts to the

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:10.210
same level we were during the Golden Age

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:12.160
here no the problem is you actually like

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:14.050
we can take my shadow and actually

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.640
synergizes okay here I'm not going to

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:18.940
fight hush because we're a little light

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:25.750
on HP but my shadows synergizes like

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:28.890
very very mildly with with IV bag so we

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:31.210
can use that to our own benefit here

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:34.080
that took away our eternal heart that

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:34.080
was not a smart play

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:41.250
but we gotta use it like this

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:43.500
I need the I need the damage I need the

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:47.780
speed even if it's not very much speed

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:51.000
per per play I still need the speed I

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:52.230
don't know dude I the more the further I

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.380
get into this run the more I'm like

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:59.070
Libre actually wow that was amazing

00:30:55.380 --> 00:31:02.400
Libre actually sort of screwed us so

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:04.410
actually like the sentence sounded

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.430
remarkably like the intro to pretty fly

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:08.820
for a white guy

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:11.070
you know Libre actually sort of screwed

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:14.850
us - dude come come come come get it to

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:17.490
me baby he it's you know you don't don't

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:22.950
waste your time editing that to work it

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:24.720
just works red hearts please I mean I'm

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:26.670
not going to sit here for 10 hours and

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:29.310
do that we only have one luck I don't

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:35.790
want to be here I did that to myself

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:39.170
times like a thousand you're alive such

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:43.110
a thing if I can't even open that dude

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:45.030
all right I'll play until you won hard

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:46.080
now because that's what I lost well I

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:48.270
don't know that could take a while plan

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.420
till 85 cents look I got things to do

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:50.420
today

00:31:54.399 --> 00:32:00.379
let's go okay the Isaac fight should be

00:31:59.809 --> 00:32:04.850
fine

00:32:00.379 --> 00:32:06.529
we're not rolling in red hearts great

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:11.600
name for a country music album themed

00:32:06.529 --> 00:32:17.619
around The Binding of Isaac I'm rolling

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:21.499
in Red Hots and metier status down my

00:32:17.619 --> 00:32:29.679
familiars has miles but I'll add to his

00:32:21.499 --> 00:32:33.230
frown that got a poor speed stat and bad

00:32:29.679 --> 00:32:36.889
DPS but faster beat the mom fight I

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:39.710
guess look it could have been a lot

00:32:36.889 --> 00:32:47.210
worse all things considered it started

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:52.609
off on kind of the wrong foot bear for

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:56.600
an at run-time song generation can live

00:32:52.609 --> 00:32:59.090
with it not the right run to go to

00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:01.700
delirium I'm not been salty about the

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:03.649
Libre pickup either like at least it

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:05.179
made it more engaging if we didn't have

00:33:03.649 --> 00:33:06.859
the Libre pickup we would have like 20

00:33:05.179 --> 00:33:08.989
damage right now and I'd be like I don't

00:33:06.859 --> 00:33:10.580
know well this runs good but instead we

00:33:08.989 --> 00:33:12.289
got to talk about something you know

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:14.299
slightly more dynamic which is nice

00:33:12.289 --> 00:33:16.249
I just wish above all else I wish our

00:33:14.299 --> 00:33:21.499
Luck's that came along for the ride with

00:33:16.249 --> 00:33:23.690
us you know it's we didn't need to take

00:33:21.499 --> 00:33:25.989
dad's key in here but I wish the lux dad

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:28.970
came along for the ride with us because

00:33:25.989 --> 00:33:30.889
one luck on the chest not a particularly

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:34.309
exciting time to be alive did you see

00:33:30.889 --> 00:33:39.259
the fly Menace that we created and

00:33:34.309 --> 00:33:43.989
unleashed upon daddy dad date there that

00:33:39.259 --> 00:33:43.989
was uh that was outrageous

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:50.860
I think I just got him to dome himself

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:57.430
seems positive to me

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:58.960
oh yeah just walk right into that no

00:33:57.430 --> 00:34:00.310
problem I mean honestly it actually is

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.510
no problem because we have bad trip

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:07.840
which is the whole reason I put this

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:10.510
down here but if you use dad's key

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:12.580
against dad who is actually Magus Aidan

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:16.240
I don't know why I changed that verbiage

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:17.650
up it's just the game theory he

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:20.230
shouldn't die instantly because that's

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:23.680
way too easy but he should you know go

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:27.070
like nice try scumbag and become like

00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:27.970
super Satan super Satan that's

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:31.660
ridiculous

00:34:27.970 --> 00:34:34.480
Satan only has two possible forms Satan

00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:36.550
and magazine where would a super Satan

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:38.560
even fit in would he be like is he

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:42.430
better or worse than mega Satan I don't

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:44.380
