00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.180
well boy howdy this is really nuts I

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.010
keep losing in the binding of issac

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.960
after birth plus maybe I shouldn't have

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.570
done too keeper runs in our last video

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.640
but you know here we are try we'll do a

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:21.210
lobster run instead I'll send an SOS to

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.830
the world a 3/4 FW h4j basically not up

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.099
play better you know we got a pretty

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.599
simple set of requirements here and you

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.539
know what just like I so can't you

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:35.660
freakin oh I swear to god this is doctor

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.480
who taught from mantis games oh this

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:43.170
freaking threw it I don't care

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.700
about Peter Capaldi Malthus I'm a

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.469
self-confessed

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.899
Doctor Who neophyte anyway let's get out

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.940
of here just like last run you know we

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.280
played as the keeper and I thought if

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.530
you're going through hell keep going

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.539
framerate looks much smoother now same

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.619
situation applies lost is much easier to

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.689
win as but I have whiffed on at least

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.530
one lost run recently which was the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:14.850
daily possibly more I think I might have

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.049
died on a lost run earlier than that I

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.939
mean obviously at some point in my life

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.290
I'd died on a lost run earlier than that

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.090
but we need to get our sea legs back

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.970
underneath us it's the simplest thing in

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.590
the world you know maybe you throw for

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.799
homeruns the coach pulls you out of the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.240
game I don't have that luxury I know you

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.560
don't throw home runs you know what I

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.150
mean you throw the pitches that lead the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.369
home runs you left us some bloopers out

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.140
there crack of the bat smell of the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.170
pitch cetera baseball everybody's

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.049
favorite pastime I don't have that

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.119
luxury you know I'm starting to games

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.549
the night here and trying not to get

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.590
myself blasted but Tommy John surgery

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.240
before I get that big payday from the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.030
New York Yankees you know one good

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.680
season I can get a 120 million I don't

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.939
know anything about baseball okay that's

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.799
the thing that I'm trying to get here

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.360
that's the general gist of these

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.799
messages is that I don't know anything

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.170
about baseball but I do know something

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:12.239
about parasitoid egg tears low Dae the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.840
egg either way our face is looking like

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.080
Wilson made

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.190
Hinch after he gets stung by that bee

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:23.220
drop a bomb I'm using bombs to look for

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.500
spirit hearts from tinted rocks but it's

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.549
not necessarily the right decision

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.629
because only because I say spirit are

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.160
something to rush I'm looking for a

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.069
small rock that's the only thing that

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.530
can provide me with the advantage which

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.420
I seek right now from tinted rocks or

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.040
golden chests but a golden chest is more

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:46.010
variable because you know we get to

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.010
choose whether or not we want to get it

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.720
once we approach the you know the golden

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.860
chest itself I don't know what I'm

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.709
talking about all I'm trying to do here

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.910
is focus on not dying against champion

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.440
version of monster it looks like he's

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.239
going down pretty easily Thank You

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.230
parasitoid tears for being nice now we

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.090
want tears upgrade belly button is okay

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.319
doesn't immediately synergize with our

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.849
existing trinket because we could get

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.720
rid of Isaac's head and been barely care

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:15.319
about it but it does indeed give us the

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.670
ability to hold two trinkets

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.160
unfortunately not that it's necessarily

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.359
bad but unfortunately I don't believe

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.280
that we can beat the system by then

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:30.959
getting mom's purse and being able to

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.549
get three trinkets I don't know if I've

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.829
ever had the opportunity I kind of

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.180
absent mindedly by mom's purse sometimes

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.230
so it wouldn't surprise me if we have

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.940
had the opportunity actually plays

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.819
continue moving on here tears upgrade is

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.109
the big one but if you want to give me a

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.880
really really good damage upgrade that

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:50.099
would be something as well I just really

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.810
I don't need a win I want to earn a win

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.120
if we have to get three more losses to

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.010
get an earned win that's fine by me any

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.019
win is the lost is an earned win even if

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.940
it's I know it's a complicated set of

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.410
rules I'm custom fitting to our exact

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.459
situation right here but you can you get

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.829
the idea any win as The Lost is an

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.500
earned win all we have to do is ensure

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:13.410
that we you know play our cards right to

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.329
try to minimize risk in the early game

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.530
until we can pop up hopefully on this

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.639
first deal with the devil but sometimes

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.370
that doesn't happen until a little bit

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.830
later so yeah I mean I genuinely I do

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.360
feel bad when I play bad and Isaac you

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.990
might think you know I have something of

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.720
an aloof nature you might

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.970
think I'm half asking the episodes and

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.060
then you know who cares the sheep will

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.759
eat it up anyway no it's not my

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.400
perspective whatsoever you know I I

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:40.930
would love to mystery sex fine including

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.789
fact very good I would love to pump out

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.110
non-stop bangers you know win after win

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:49.780
after win exciting commentary you know

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:54.819
references to Iggy azalea's 2013 Summer

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:59.139
Jam fancy unfortunately there's been

00:04:54.819 --> 00:05:00.639
some bad plays lately all we can do is

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.289
make sure that they have the lowest

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.030
chance possible to happen to us this

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.710
time I don't think we'd really care

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.690
about going to our shop I do care about

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:12.639
killing this guy this is a nasty guy

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:15.009
right here if we don't pay attention his

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:18.039
bombs hit us underground I also think

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:20.650
that if he throws a portal at us

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.690
no if he throws a bomb through a portal

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.280
it can hit us with almost without

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.550
actually animating where it's going to

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.550
go like it hits before it lands or like

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.139
at least concurrent with when it lands

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.240
caffeine pill is fine as the lost balls

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:37.659
of Steel is obviously irrelevant this is

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.810
a dangerous situation though good news

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:45.550
is it's a big room you don't always get

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:49.030
that on a on a Krampus fight so just

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.800
keep him at bay we try to stand on like

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.139
the twenty two point five degree angles

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.300
so we're actually safe from whatever he

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:56.560
sends after us and if you rotates we got

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.840
time to get out of the way we get lump

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.759
of coal which is fine yeah we're good to

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.860
go all right so so far so good we're

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:04.509
definitely not stacked and not getting

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:09.969
double room precedent is really bad as

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:11.949
the lost because we wanted but we did

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:14.860
pick up some good stuff for free

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:16.539
basically but it's kind of like a false

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.009
equivalency because we actually just

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:20.020
can't pay for deals with the devil as

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:21.310
well lost anyway so any anything we get

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.000
from a deal with the devil is obviously

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.860
going to be free

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.270
in fact if nothing else we probably paid

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.219
the greatest cost of all by having to

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.770
fight Krampus and possibly risk dying

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:31.750
luckily we got out of that feeling

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.949
pretty good feeling switched on what's

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.080
weird is like there are times when I

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:36.370
play I is again I feel like I'm not

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.020
seeing the board well like I'm playing

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.050
the game just happens for whatever

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.760
reason

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.080
you know you probably haven't see you

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.750
you're playing like a fighting game for

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.760
whatever reason you're not you're just

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.590
not feeling the instinct the same way

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.620
you normally do I have not felt like

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.210
that recently and maybe that's like not

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.770
only might not see in the board but the

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.350
connection between my eyes and my brain

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.730
is you know messed up to the point where

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.140
I don't even know that I'm not seeing

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:02.240
the board you know they've taken my

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.530
sensors offline like Luke Skywalker at

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:11.450
the end of Star Wars and New Hope

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:14.360
spoilers or maybe we've been screwed by

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:16.010
undo variants it is I know I don't want

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.870
to say guarantee like I don't to say

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:21.140
it's definitely what happened but it is

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.790
plausible that you know some of the runs

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:27.860
that we've done recently have been

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:31.970
pretty tough you know oh god go for it

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:33.890
oh that's what happens when you get a

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:38.210
little self pitying there okay you know

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:41.840
what here's our seed 60w 2d sxj I really

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:46.160
should you don't spawn flies you shoot

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:48.860
bullets um we really should do like an

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.500
Isaac run and stop this needless bravado

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:54.800
we're at a minus five streak hilarious

00:07:51.500 --> 00:08:01.190
but also my insecurities flaring up in a

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:04.190
big way so what do we need to do just be

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:07.340
battery I beg you and for God's sakes

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:08.990
try to lose some weight we are getting a

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.610
little unlucky but at some point you

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.440
know if you get unlucky six times in a

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:14.660
row you should have been able to make

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:18.410
one of those six times work that's my

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:19.610
two cents there sorry Larry King we're

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.860
going to take these you're going to take

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:23.270
these and then inside of our shop we get

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:25.520
box of friends which we don't care about

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:29.960
two of ours is also bad

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:32.420
keep moving on here I shouldn't need you

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:36.770
know brimstone Polyphemus to win the

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:38.720
game that's the thing I should you got

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:41.210
to survive a little bit of uncertainty

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:44.570
at the start of Isaac grunts to make it

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:48.570
work in the end I'm just play offs I'm

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:50.970
just hoping I can win a run now I think

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:53.340
I think I've got it in me to pull out

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:55.740
the W over you know this video at some

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.480
point I do still have a conspiracy

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.910
theory that the recent booster patch

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.830
actually made the booster pack I should

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:04.230
say actually made the game harder what

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:08.730
do I have to back that up absolutely

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:10.800
nothing I have no basis bases have no

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:14.850
basis with which to say that except that

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:16.590
my results are worse lately so we got a

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:19.500
it's up to us we got to purge our own

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:21.810
world of this salt save me from the

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:27.480
nothing I've become I don't I don't

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:29.700
succumb to despair easily so I'm still

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:32.430
feeling you know as hopeful as ever as

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.900
hopeful as I was 9 minutes and 24

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:37.230
seconds ago that this video is going to

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:39.450
come through in the clutch force ok look

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.860
at that dodge see he's still got it okay

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:43.320
but then you dodge right into the enemy

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:48.990
there I'm also wondering if maybe like

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:50.340
somehow I've dead cells myself like I

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:52.200
don't know whether you can't really use

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.480
that as a verb just you know as is but

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.950
you know if by playing more dead cells

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:59.850
you know another rogue light up kind of

00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:01.470
compromised my Isaac's skills it's

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:03.330
something that has happened before like

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:05.010
when I got into Gunjan sort of gun

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:11.400
shinned my Isaac's skills got to the

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:13.740
point where you know I was careful doing

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.240
a lot worse than Isaac and not really

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:20.150
doing that well in guns you to begin

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:22.560
with but do it a lot worse than Isaac as

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:25.800
a result of those games being just

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.930
similar enough to like have an

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.700
overlapping skill set and yet still

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:34.680
different enough to throw you off you

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:36.210
know so I'm the grasping at straws when

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.100
it comes to excuses here but I also you

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:41.070
know I keeping with what I was saying on

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:43.530
like the last floor I'm not proud of

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.880
these of my play in these runs

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:47.310
you know the commentaries been on point

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.110
in in some of them but I'm not proud of

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:51.540
my eyes performance I'm a little

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:55.830
embarrassed if anything else or if

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:57.780
nothing else rather Keys no keys $0.03

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:59.690
why even bundle three cents up in a sack

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:02.769
man's just

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:05.389
it's just misleading is what it is a

00:11:02.769 --> 00:11:07.370
secret room actually think that you know

00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:09.470
let's focus on the positive for now

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:12.800
brown nugget is an item we haven't had

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:14.630
enough time to experience or enough

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.509
opportunities to experience in this game

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:19.579
and it is potentially a pretty good

00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:21.410
space bar item compare it to oh I don't

00:11:19.579 --> 00:11:25.910
know my favorite punching bag monster

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:29.810
man well probably don't want that huh

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:33.410
it's actually maybe like 1.5 million

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:36.410
times better that's a library way back

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:40.990
when no keys but there's a library way

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:43.490
back there it gives you multiple

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:45.589
familiars per room of a consistent

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:53.480
quality now the consistent quality is

00:11:45.589 --> 00:11:55.670
not you know little grim if it's one of

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.170
the few items in Isaac that actually

00:11:55.670 --> 00:12:00.110
gets better the longer you spend on a

00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:02.240
room so it's like a design space that is

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:04.040
very little attention paid to it and

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:07.180
Isaac to be honest with you usually I

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:09.920
mean I guess you could argue Taurus but

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:11.600
usually things get a lot harder for you

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.759
the longer a run goes thank you for not

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.709
giving me Krampus will take pentagram we

00:12:13.759 --> 00:12:17.329
got deal with the devil president 5.19

00:12:15.709 --> 00:12:19.730
damage not crushing the run but not

00:12:17.329 --> 00:12:21.949
doing too badly no keys means you know

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:26.389
who cares about the item room let's just

00:12:21.949 --> 00:12:28.600
get going here is it always a champion

00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:31.600
or is that just to denote that it is our

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.600
familiar

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:37.040
in the end I suppose it doesn't really

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:45.380
matter let's go peep it I'm not ever

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:47.300
scared spirit hearts tears up extremely

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:48.320
useful we haven't been hit so we can

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.210
leave I don't know why I went back for

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.460
the card though locust of pestilence

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:54.350
also good we're starting to construct a

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:58.520
workable run unfortunately we've thrown

00:12:54.350 --> 00:13:01.280
away like a lot of good runs lately so

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:02.750
this is far from like us being in the

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:06.130
driver's seat right now I'm still having

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:10.240
to play pretty reactively pretty

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:10.240
intergalactic of planet airily

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:17.380
half-heart not super stoked about our

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:20.240
lack of keys but you know there's always

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:21.620
there's always room to grow there could

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.600
always use more consumables we never

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:27.230
want less consumables if for being

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:29.750
honest that's not a key there's a secret

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:31.520
room it is a secret room these are also

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:34.520
not keys in fact in many ways these are

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:37.660
anti keys and I don't think we can skirt

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:40.370
around them unless maybe you from school

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:46.130
squeezed behind them now okay so we're

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:47.870
trapped outside of our item room if we

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:50.840
get good deal with the devil look like

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:53.420
there's no mythical being that allows us

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:56.830
to sacrifice things like this maybe one

00:13:53.420 --> 00:14:01.850
day Elon Musk I'm sure is working on it

00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:03.890
however there's no mythical being to

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:05.600
which we can sacrifice item rooms for

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:07.010
guaranteed deals with the devil but I

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.690
would do it you ever want to know how

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:10.910
much I value go ahead on the character

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:12.410
like a loss I would give up all of my

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:13.910
item rooms for the rest of the game to

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:16.820
get a guaranteed deal with the devil per

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:18.740
floor we could get the deals with the

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:22.040
devil regardless but I don't even want

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:24.560
to leave it to chance I will I will take

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:26.420
the security over having a having a

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.460
guaranteed deal with the devil over the

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:32.270
plausible good stuff we can get in an

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:33.800
item room instead definitely I mean why

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:35.300
even pick up the spear at hearts at this

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.620
point you're just playing the games game

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:38.620
and that's lame lame

00:14:40.029 --> 00:14:48.649
so we need keys dude black gold Texas

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:50.480
keys that's what they call them keys

00:14:48.649 --> 00:14:53.830
open doors that's what clips said I've

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.830
been repeating it ever since

00:14:55.750 --> 00:15:04.100
off of their 2006 album the hell hath no

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:06.170
fury or is that wait that might be off

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.279
we got it for ladies we got it for

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:14.769
cheaper now if you know it doesn't

00:15:07.279 --> 00:15:14.769
matter the point is push it to the end

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:25.060
caves one means I'm gonna go shop

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:28.670
because we could buy a key and an item

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:29.810
there is a key for sale we definitely

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:31.850
want to go for broke here because

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:39.290
neither of those existing items are that

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:41.360
good uh red candle is a good option here

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:43.070
and you might be saying but NL what

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.560
about the whole brown nugget thing

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:48.740
oh yeah like that item is good but I

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:52.010
mean red candle is it's an a-minus item

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:54.589
at worst you know it's high-quality you

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:56.899
normally care about teleport it also

00:15:54.589 --> 00:15:58.910
blocks shots but we really need some

00:15:56.899 --> 00:16:00.770
extra damage and we'll always need some

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:02.000
extra damages the loss because it's one

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.410
of the few ways in which we can actually

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.720
improve the odds of winning a run you

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:07.160
know we can't really get more HP more

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:10.450
defense admittedly can be useful but

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:12.920
more damage or DPS whatever you know

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:14.360
terminology you want to use for it is

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:17.510
what's going to get the job done for us

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:20.270
here so BP odds 38% deal with the devil

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:24.290
you know what to my canadian eyes that

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:26.329
looks pretty close to 50/50 50/50 I've

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:29.000
got confidence so let's make that 80/20

00:16:26.329 --> 00:16:30.199
and 80/20 is basically a hundred zero so

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.550
I'm pretty sure that we have a hundred

00:16:30.199 --> 00:16:33.140
and ten percent chance of getting a deal

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:34.550
with the devil here you're laughing at

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.529
me right now saying look at this idiot

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:38.269
get ready get ready for the deal with

00:16:36.529 --> 00:16:39.769
the devil not only deal with the devil

00:16:38.269 --> 00:16:43.630
I'm calling it deal with the devil with

00:16:39.769 --> 00:16:43.630
Abaddon I want that for your shot

00:16:44.639 --> 00:16:51.519
you were scared for a second weren't you

00:16:48.449 --> 00:16:54.839
I'm not superstitious but I would say

00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:57.459
I'm a little officious both cadet okay

00:16:54.839 --> 00:16:59.230
great spot now we have another floor to

00:16:57.459 --> 00:17:00.189
get a joker card so we can this floor

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.600
we're not going to get a deal with the

00:17:00.189 --> 00:17:02.579
devil we got to get an artificial deal

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.679
with the devil one way or the other

00:17:02.579 --> 00:17:09.990
virus is not that useful but I'll take

00:17:05.679 --> 00:17:12.669
spun no okay I found pills is not

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:14.649
deleterious by itself so I'm okay with

00:17:12.669 --> 00:17:16.630
this we're actually in a very good spot

00:17:14.649 --> 00:17:18.010
fate is meaningless but we'll take it

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:20.159
nonetheless takes it out of the golden

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:23.889
chest pool so we got more time to get

00:17:20.159 --> 00:17:26.110
Guppies head Tammy's head a couple

00:17:23.889 --> 00:17:34.059
couple of other head related items head

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:36.269
PE we raise hell just wanted to see

00:17:34.059 --> 00:17:38.019
sometimes you can get different

00:17:36.269 --> 00:17:40.240
combinations in there sometimes you can

00:17:38.019 --> 00:17:41.590
get a bad in those rooms now that I

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.970
think about it why was I excited about

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:45.510
getting a bed in those rooms that's not

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:48.309
going to do too much for us

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:49.630
we got good pace it's one of the rare

00:17:48.309 --> 00:17:51.610
situations in which I will straight-up

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:53.559
look at this run and say even though our

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:55.480
stats don't look that good this run is

00:17:53.559 --> 00:17:57.250
better than it looks most of the time

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:59.139
I'm going to Ellie have a damaged but

00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:01.539
our rate of fire is you know 2% less

00:17:59.139 --> 00:18:03.010
than I'd like it to be so we suck but no

00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:04.210
I'm looking at this one and going you

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:06.010
know the steps don't tell the full

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:12.880
picture in the positive direction here

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:15.700
nice we could be under estimating the

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:17.980
quality of this run better to you know

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:19.990
under under-promise over-deliver right

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:22.269
that's what they say that's what you

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:24.460
repeat when you're arguing about video

00:18:22.269 --> 00:18:26.230
games on the internet you go what was

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:28.830
this company thinking you always over

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:31.240
promise or under deliver wait you always

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:35.169
under-promise and over-deliver it's good

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:36.970
advice though you know I'm a very

00:18:35.169 --> 00:18:40.179
important businessman as I'm sure you're

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:44.320
aware from my my place on the internet

00:18:40.179 --> 00:18:46.720
probably you know one of the top 300 or

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:48.309
400 thousand businessmen in Canada

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:51.100
specifically so you know we're climbing

00:18:48.309 --> 00:18:53.559
that ladder slowly but surely very

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:56.260
important in business you know to be

00:18:53.559 --> 00:18:57.130
honest which is why whatever companies

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.440
approached me for

00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:02.740
to the content I say you know I make

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:05.170
garbage right like it's trash it's funny

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:07.600
trash but it's like it goes in the trash

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:10.030
can if it had a house its house would be

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.590
you know my roommate would be Oscar the

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:13.210
Grouch that's all I'm saying

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:17.470
I almost called him Oscar the grump

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:22.000
that's not his name deal with the devil

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:23.770
told you know deal with the devil fly

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.260
it's always important to be honest in

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:29.530
the business world you know and then

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:31.720
when it's like compost instead of

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:33.190
garbage they go wow you know he told us

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.990
to be garbage and then delivered one

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:37.300
tear higher than that maybe compost is

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:42.580
worse than garbage I don't know garbage

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:44.650
has a smell that's what a compost also

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:46.930
has a smell but then you also when you

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:49.840
smell it you go that's the sound of me

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:54.160
saving the world you know one bucket of

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:56.320
coffee grounds at a time garbage just

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:58.690
smells like oh you know any we mix all

00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:01.710
colors together you always get brown how

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:03.880
is it that all garbage smells the same

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:05.830
maybe it's because I'm only smelling my

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.720
own garbage and I largely you know

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:09.100
consume the same things on a weekly

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.900
basis so that's why my garbage all

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.310
smells the same then no I you know you

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:16.720
ever passed by a dumpster it smells like

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:18.460
garbage all right I'm feeling

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.370
comfortable in this run I'm not feeling

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:22.750
that much pressure Joker cards told you

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:25.120
I'm not feeling that much pressure again

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:27.280
it's good just playing loose feeling

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.510
comfortable open this up don't get

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:32.370
anything out of it could have saved that

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:35.290
fool card for a better situation but

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:39.040
whatever no big deal go to our shop I

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:39.940
hope it's read it is not greed it's an

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:43.360
ace of clubs

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:47.130
that's not greed that's my Pratt

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:50.500
Tallmadge is coming this fall on ABC

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:53.140
taking the last man standing spot that's

00:20:50.500 --> 00:21:00.550
my proctologist starring Brad Garrett as

00:20:53.140 --> 00:21:05.320
my proctologist and wait Gilbert

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:07.990
Godfried is Z butthole yeah what were

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:09.730
you expecting Tim Allen that's not a

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:10.040
very good Gilbert Godfried impression

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:11.540
but I

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:19.000
want to ruin my voice for the rest of

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:19.000
the day retro vision full health

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:28.660
this would be a nice floor for us to

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:30.130
kind of kick it into gear wouldn't want

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:34.360
to suggest that we're in a horrible

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:38.620
position I should have tried to kick

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:40.240
that I know you want to kick pit clubs

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:42.460
tell you what we got this we got this

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:44.560
payout with a single penny you won't you

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:46.150
will you will I guarantee it you're

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:49.870
being mine flooded right now

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:53.110
SHP I don't want HP dude grow on HP for

00:21:49.870 --> 00:22:00.760
it if I wanted HP I'd be playing a judge

00:21:53.110 --> 00:22:03.550
oh that explains it so it's a bit of a

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:05.380
cheap play there you know a key is not

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:07.330
necessarily worth the sacrifice we could

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:09.250
have gotten more out of this but you got

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:11.020
to look because if it's a black market

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:13.570
you basically get six items or more for

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:16.590
free so five items I don't know

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:16.590
somewhere in that vicinity

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:25.490
so as far as I'm concerned it's kind of

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:27.050
a no-brainer it might be like a 5%

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:28.910
chance or less of being a black market

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:30.770
but you know if it pays out it's pretty

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:32.180
good like if I give you a 5% chance of

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:32.960
winning the Powerball lottery you'd be

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.970
like sign me up

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:37.280
I'll buy 20 tickets and I'll say nah

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:39.920
that's not how it works but you know I

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:45.440
see you have a cursory understanding of

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:47.060
statistics and as a result you're hired

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:53.120
that's right it was all an elaborate job

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:54.770
interview today's day and age you never

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:58.180
know when you're going to be hired do

00:22:54.770 --> 00:23:00.530
jobs are just popping off everywhere

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:05.090
can't leave my house without somebody

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:10.130
offering me a job got to be like Nick at

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:11.540
the car dealership Silent Assassin we

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:12.950
have not been to our item room on this

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.810
floor did we even go to our item room on

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:20.630
the less we did it was an active item

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:23.810
that's right I recall now dim bulb gives

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:32.540
us a stat bonus for approximately half

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:34.790
of one Earth second I don't like when he

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:38.030
positions himself into the corner it

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:42.260
makes it very tough for us to do what

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:44.540
needs to be done got him that was

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:46.550
extremely close dude the tiers upgrade

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:49.760
is actually very very good we got keys

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:50.810
so don't forget to go to your your item

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.340
room on this floor but yeah now we

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:54.020
almost died a couple times there

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.460
honestly I caught a break got pretty

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.350
lucky maybe that's what we need to get

00:23:55.460 --> 00:24:00.730
back on the horse I can live with it now

00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:00.730
it's up to us not to squander it

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:12.620
what's your least favorite curse like

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:14.600
I'll start curses the blind is the best

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:17.809
curse because it has impacts on gameplay

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:20.269
curse the unknown the same curse of the

00:24:17.809 --> 00:24:24.010
lost might be my least favorite I also

00:24:20.269 --> 00:24:29.419
do hate curse of darkness though like

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:31.250
that one I'm just like I can't see it's

00:24:29.419 --> 00:24:36.039
like being drunk in a video game you

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:38.870
know okay I get it but like stop please

00:24:36.039 --> 00:24:40.220
luck food is fine we have to luck I mean

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:41.630
it might matter on the chest it doesn't

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:43.549
matter too much right now but I'm

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:45.289
telling you on the chest and might pay

00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:46.549
dividends but for now we're down to the

00:24:45.289 --> 00:24:48.799
next floor without a way to get out of

00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:53.029
boss rush so we're probably not going to

00:24:48.799 --> 00:24:54.470
do boss rush but probably want to blow

00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:58.159
that up as well though with only one

00:24:54.470 --> 00:25:00.380
bomb maybe we don't I think we've made

00:24:58.159 --> 00:25:03.350
the right decisions on this run you know

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:07.070
we've got a great rate of fire red

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:09.350
candle was the right call I feel a

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:11.110
hundred percent about that dim-bulb is

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:14.409
kind of garbage for us because we only

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:21.529
temporarily get the stat bonus but

00:25:14.409 --> 00:25:23.029
probably better than nothing what was

00:25:21.529 --> 00:25:27.019
our other treat that we I thought we had

00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:30.409
another one dim bulb could be great in

00:25:27.019 --> 00:25:35.720
fact it's not even far at all from being

00:25:30.409 --> 00:25:39.669
great all we need to do we opened our

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:42.080
shop okay

00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:46.190
maybe after we go to item room curse

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:47.510
room and shop we'll come back see I mean

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:48.740
if we can't get out of boss rush we

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:51.039
don't really care about getting to boss

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.039
rush

00:25:56.139 --> 00:26:03.559
the curse room is worthless got a long

00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:05.899
way to go though should be stoked

00:26:03.559 --> 00:26:08.269
actually we got out of the double key

00:26:05.899 --> 00:26:12.470
room thanks to a teleport which means

00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:14.600
that we actually got two free keys or at

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:16.759
least access to that room for free and a

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:18.379
forget-me-now room is not a useless room

00:26:16.759 --> 00:26:21.019
you know it's an extra item room and

00:26:18.379 --> 00:26:22.580
extra shop and an extra deal with a

00:26:21.019 --> 00:26:24.139
double chance so you could say extra

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:27.409
boss item but considering we're fighting

00:26:24.139 --> 00:26:29.179
mom you know it's sort of semi unlikely

00:26:27.409 --> 00:26:31.100
that's going to matter that much so

00:26:29.179 --> 00:26:33.379
here's the here's where I separate the

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:36.169
clever boys and girls from the the wise

00:26:33.379 --> 00:26:41.299
boys and girls what do you take here red

00:26:36.169 --> 00:26:44.240
candle or did I get hit I might have

00:26:41.299 --> 00:26:48.200
been here red candle or dimbo red candle

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:51.100
or book of Belial my hypothesis is you

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:54.559
take red candle because it's more useful

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:56.779
even though I fully acknowledge that

00:26:54.559 --> 00:26:58.999
with book of Belial you'd get some dim

00:26:56.779 --> 00:27:01.669
bulb stat bonuses but only for the floor

00:26:58.999 --> 00:27:03.200
I mean once every three rooms if you use

00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:04.519
it once every three rooms you would be

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:06.470
stacked because you get a nice stat

00:27:04.519 --> 00:27:08.570
bonus from dim bulb on the same room in

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:10.700
which you use book of Belial but

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:13.220
immediately after that room you'd be in

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:15.409
a tough spot again well you'd be in the

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:16.850
same spot if that was a tough spot you

00:27:15.409 --> 00:27:19.269
would be back in a tough spot let's

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:19.269
leave it at that

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:34.029
how many special runes are there on this

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:35.049
floor I just want to go to where I want

00:27:34.029 --> 00:27:37.690
to go thank you

00:27:35.049 --> 00:27:41.350
9 volt ampere this is great stuff we

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:42.999
could actually skip boss rush now so I'm

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:44.799
thinking the forget-me-now room is not

00:27:42.999 --> 00:27:47.289
the way we do this and it's really like

00:27:44.799 --> 00:27:49.029
we might be able to chance it blank art

00:27:47.289 --> 00:27:50.769
did show up earlier and blank our damper

00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:52.299
it looks pretty solid right now but

00:27:50.769 --> 00:27:56.739
would we have lived this long if we

00:27:52.299 --> 00:27:59.590
didn't have a gimbal that's just useless

00:27:56.739 --> 00:28:03.599
now thanks to 9 volt but small price to

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:08.220
pay for more rapid charges I'd say I

00:28:03.599 --> 00:28:08.220
think we go for boss rush right away

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:15.789
let's go

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:17.349
save some time here yeah I think we go

00:28:15.789 --> 00:28:19.690
for boss rush right now basically

00:28:17.349 --> 00:28:21.369
because we can and also because it's

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:24.279
less finicky and also because I'm on a

00:28:21.369 --> 00:28:26.109
minus 5 streak right now so I think you

00:28:24.279 --> 00:28:28.599
know lend me your energy I need it

00:28:26.109 --> 00:28:30.399
apparently and we all need somebody to

00:28:28.599 --> 00:28:32.919
lean on I've always said that I believe

00:28:30.399 --> 00:28:41.820
I was the first person to say that don't

00:28:32.919 --> 00:28:47.259
let the media tell you lies trusting me

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:51.220
trusting you just in me yeah I'm just in

00:28:47.259 --> 00:28:52.929
you I don't know where I'm going I mean

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:56.859
it we could use the red candle as a

00:28:52.929 --> 00:29:00.940
teleporter here but I think I would

00:28:56.859 --> 00:29:03.789
rather use red candle as a way to murder

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:05.109
enemies because eventually we can

00:29:03.789 --> 00:29:06.460
teleport until we get into the boss

00:29:05.109 --> 00:29:09.999
fights but eventually we have to kill

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:12.009
some bosses you know definitely want the

00:29:09.999 --> 00:29:15.070
Polaroid keep this penis it's worth it

00:29:12.009 --> 00:29:18.609
it's worth it maybe it's worth it ok

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:22.899
nice good job we got some speed upgrades

00:29:18.609 --> 00:29:24.549
magnet serpents kiss and we got b1 it

00:29:22.899 --> 00:29:27.029
take serpents kiss his servants kiss

00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:29.799
that good for us no I don't believe so

00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:31.480
because we don't really want the spirit

00:29:29.799 --> 00:29:34.529
hearts but the poison damage is at least

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.529
not worth nothing

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:42.650
so Belial tiers with a good rate of fire

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:47.360
we have a great shell for beating rooms

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:50.030
that have a lot of enemies kind of an

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.570
ideal item for us right in the ad for us

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:52.790
right now

00:29:50.570 --> 00:30:01.730
not item for us but an item for us right

00:29:52.790 --> 00:30:05.150
now is a lusty blood we can kill enemies

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:08.840
easily it's just that our raw stats are

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:10.670
pretty bad so if we could you know start

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:12.500
by being in a bad place

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:15.920
kill one enemy and then start to ball

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:17.990
out of control that would be as close to

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:20.450
ideal I think as I can muster for like a

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:22.700
one-off item dude this is actually this

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:24.170
is the dream come true play your cards

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:26.060
right and also keep your heart three

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:27.980
stacks keep your heart these bosses are

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:29.840
smart play your part we're going to blow

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:32.330
this up that's not a second secret room

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:35.300
or crickets head it is a luck upgrade we

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:46.540
can fly so momma Gertie is fairly not

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:46.540
awful for us to fight let's go we don't

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:51.080
really care about blow sense at all I

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:52.760
mean that goes for real life as well I

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:55.690
think people talk about placenta from

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:58.940
time to time ago you know Tom Cruise ate

00:30:55.690 --> 00:31:00.710
Katie Holmes placenta after they had

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:03.830
their kid out that's I mean honestly

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:05.330
that's weird as hell it's also like a

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:07.520
ten year old reference I don't know it

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:09.680
might literally be a ten year old

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:12.110
reference that placenta is ten years old

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:16.480
at this point although it's long since

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:16.480
been turned into actual shit obviously

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:24.620
let me focus for a minute here thank you

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:25.640
rotten baby just keep the keep the

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:27.620
damage coming here

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.760
good blocks buddy good blocks I was

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:30.080
hoping for a deal with the devil I was

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.730
hoping for a lot of stuff here we didn't

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.160
get it but what we did get is

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:35.810
effectively an eihwaz room and hear me

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:38.570
out here we obviously did not actually

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:40.130
get an a waz room that would be very

00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:41.630
useful on that floor who evolved

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:42.650
actually would be useless because of the

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:44.690
fact that we would have gone to Sheol

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:49.269
instead but

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:52.399
we managed to get through two floors in

00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:53.629
almost no time flat so I'm very very

00:31:52.399 --> 00:31:56.570
happy about that

00:31:53.629 --> 00:31:59.239
I also at the risk of Tooting my own

00:31:56.570 --> 00:32:02.690
horn right before you know the Titanic

00:31:59.239 --> 00:32:06.139
goes down here we kind of have a crappy

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:07.340
run it's a great run if we were any

00:32:06.139 --> 00:32:13.399
other character because we could use

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:15.619
black hearts like willy nilly willy

00:32:13.399 --> 00:32:19.759
nilly sounds like a van that got busted

00:32:15.619 --> 00:32:21.559
for lip-syncing willie nelson songs nice

00:32:19.759 --> 00:32:23.299
speaking of ten-year-old references that

00:32:21.559 --> 00:32:24.440
reference is uh three times older than

00:32:23.299 --> 00:32:27.349
ten

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:29.330
that's milli vanilli me livin in a told

00:32:27.349 --> 00:32:30.799
me it Oh blame it on the rainbows of the

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:32.059
rain can be blamed I don't remember the

00:32:30.799 --> 00:32:35.960
rest of the especially barenaked ladies

00:32:32.059 --> 00:32:36.289
a song coincidentally from like 20 years

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:39.379
ago

00:32:36.289 --> 00:32:47.950
Oh a nice dodge buddy these guys are no

00:32:39.379 --> 00:32:50.749
joke the run though is kind of bad as

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:53.950
the lost at least it's also like

00:32:50.749 --> 00:32:57.229
particularly bad for dealing with bosses

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:59.119
because the Belisle tears are not very

00:32:57.229 --> 00:33:01.279
good at well they don't give you much

00:32:59.119 --> 00:33:04.190
bonus unless you're dealing with a boss

00:33:01.279 --> 00:33:05.570
that has multiple segments and I'm not

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:07.399
talking about phases I mean like

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:08.419
literally he's a segmented enemy like

00:33:07.399 --> 00:33:14.869
he's an analyst

00:33:08.419 --> 00:33:21.139
like Larry jr. or something short of

00:33:14.869 --> 00:33:23.710
that what kind of like we're really low

00:33:21.139 --> 00:33:23.710
on damage

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:31.020
and not really crushing it in any other

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.940
department obviously then on top of that

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:35.460
we got HP problems but we have holy

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:44.400
mantle which is saving the day for us of

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:45.870
course this boss fight is going to it's

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:49.380
going to be an interesting time in my

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:53.250
life I think if we make it through this

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:54.210
phase without losing holy mantle all

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:55.440
right you know what I'm not gonna finish

00:33:54.210 --> 00:34:00.180
that sentence because we lost holy

00:33:55.440 --> 00:34:01.710
mantle but I think we made it through

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:04.400
that phase without losing holy mantle

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:04.400
we're fine

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:15.000
100% we could still be fine but it's

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:20.850
more like a oh oh I actually don't

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:23.760
believe it like another video ends in

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:25.169
losses but we're going to come back

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.750
we're going to an isaac run I think

00:34:25.169 --> 00:34:31.020
today's run was at least we performed it

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:32.220
was performing we got to get a win

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:34.409
though I got that means I got to stop

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:37.020
with the randoms temporarily do one

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:38.909
Isaac run reset our Universal karmic

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:40.350
clock and then come back for success for

00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:41.880
now thanks for watching as I go on as
