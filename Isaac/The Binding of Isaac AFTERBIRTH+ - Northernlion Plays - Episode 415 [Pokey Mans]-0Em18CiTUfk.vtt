00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.080
hey everybody welcome enter in the lamp

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.790
was minding my scattereth plus we're

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.970
rolling through these after birth plus

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.790
challenges sort of I don't know how to I

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.790
don't really know what to say about the

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.109
April's fool challenge it is uh it was a

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.170
little weird but we got through it

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.340
we got pokey mans 3003 which is the year

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.650
that I'm living in right now that's

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.000
right 986 years from this point onwards

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.119
are you impressed with my subtractive

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:37.260
skills the four years at a public

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:39.300
university let's go we are going to the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.180
Cathedral on this one I don't think that

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.300
I don't remember pokey man's being a

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.680
tough challenge but I also like it's six

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.730
or seven months ago at this point but I

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:54.270
sort of feel like it was one that I had

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.879
to do twice for some reason I might be

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.230
misremembering to be fair it also

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.510
strikes me as the kind of challenge

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.619
where I wouldn't be surprised to see

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.420
that we don't have item rooms because we

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.830
are starting with two items one of which

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.299
is actually quite good in the form of

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.030
wait no I've got the dude I swear to

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.920
it's mom's perfume that gives you the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.670
tear delay downgrade I'm going through

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.840
like weird that is a huge enemy like

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.210
anterograde amnesia or something with

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.829
Isaac we're like one day there's just so

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.340
many items of the game that I like don't

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.170
understand what they are for like for

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.210
videos I was like why isn't the sentir

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.060
delay downgrade whenever I got mom's eye

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.030
shadow and now I'm like okay right

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.399
that's it's mom's perfume perfume is not

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.729
a shadow that explains why I've given

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.560
myself permanent cornea damage I don't

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.369
know I don't wear eye shadow either not

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.079
that there's anything wrong with it we

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.600
should try to capture an enemy but I

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.479
actually I think the pokeball is kind of

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.899
like a wasted item it's a it's a really

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.899
cool concept but it just never really

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.849
executes as well as as well as you'd

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.310
think it could given the circumstances

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.989
like it kinda reminds me the d-10 where

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.530
like not being able to re-roll bosses

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.810
makes it

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.020
useless not being able to capture bosses

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.940
sort of screws with the okay go a little

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.090
bit but there are the pokeball I should

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.130
say cuz poke a go is actually fine but

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.080
there are some enemies that are top tier

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.840
and there are some enemies that are not

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.580
very good at all I almost feel like this

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.840
should get like a to room charge or

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.540
something like that just to make it more

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.930
usable but either way we're starting in

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.610
an okay situation little horn was the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.780
best item we got on that floor and then

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.890
the best item we've got on this whole

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.040
run without a doubt

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.440
you just want enemies that are not gonna

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.660
die immediately like we want tanky

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.970
enemies don't kill the ones you the ones

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.840
you charm you got a charm um first let

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.250
them kill like all the other enemies

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.959
[Music]

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.519
problem solved

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.470
yeah I mean it would be really nice to

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.550
sight-read all the chat why is it's not

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.709
really sight reading considering we've

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.420
done them once before but to do all the

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.890
challenges in after birth plus on our

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.209
first go cuz I'm starting to see the

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.350
light at the end of the tunnel

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.190
we haven't actually even gotten oh it

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.480
doesn't break rocks

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.190
I thought the science tears broke

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.010
everything but maybe they only break

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.720
everything if they if they hit an enemy

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.400
in the meantime or it doesn't really

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.690
matter what a what I mean is we're

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.630
almost done with the challenges here

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.950
although we still have several that we

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.000
failed and a few that we haven't even

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.130
unlocked yet we're almost to the point

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.510
where we can at least start to you know

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:50.190
begin the quest for a million in 1%

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.350
inauspiciously if you will I would like

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.359
to get an extra nickel by blowing that

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.010
guy up I would have loved to have bought

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.380
a spirit heart to be honest with you

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.150
because really this this strikes me as

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:04.310
one of those challenges where the the

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:07.380
actual gimmick is kind of nonsense

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.079
really our ability to succeed or fail

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.350
here is likely gonna come down to

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:20.030
whether or not we're able to get a good

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:23.030
run what it went over the enemies or we

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.030
hello

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:30.939
is this our starter Pokemon because if

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.939
so dude this is a pretty good start

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.770
you got enemies leaving creep everywhere

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:40.460
you guys just oh you're not moving is

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.240
you have no agro that actually makes

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:46.909
sense uh this is actually like pretty

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.169
good I didn't know if the first time you

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:50.300
use that you got something unless I

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.189
actually captured something last time

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.840
and just didn't know but I don't think

00:04:52.189 --> 00:05:01.069
that I did oh good I blew up all of my

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:03.020
okay go buddy's here low odds let's try

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:05.569
to capture one of these it bounced off

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.310
the wall wait a minute no I've got it

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:08.930
totally backwards we actually just get a

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.490
random one every time we use this we're

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:17.990
not meant to capture enemies we kind of

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:19.550
got like fake poke a go right now which

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.409
I'm okay with because getting random

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.569
enemies is definitely going to be more

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:25.310
valuable this isn't how the pokeball

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:28.849
works most of their monster ball works

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.860
most of the time is it I thought for

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:33.520
sure I have memories that I don't

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:36.409
believe have been planted there of

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.389
capturing enemies that are like ideal

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:42.370
and then sadly many more that were

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:44.659
suboptimal using the monster ball but

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:49.060
just be smart here we're actually like

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:49.060
now in a very very good position

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:55.009
we've got an okay Pokemon along with it

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.860
although he is now dead just don't get

00:05:55.009 --> 00:06:02.689
hit towards the end of this and we are

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:04.699
sitting pretty okay Joker card non Joker

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:14.360
card emperor card not bad

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:17.509
ooh it's a little rough but let's I'm

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.909
gonna take little brim cuz it's the best

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:28.099
item in here so what I'm gonna try to do

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:30.439
is well is sure get you to pay out with

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:33.830
something you paid out with something it

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:37.459
was not particularly good I cannot

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:40.129
justify going to the curse room yet but

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:42.800
I can justify going to the boss Trap

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:46.269
room and if we get nothing useful we

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.269
could fight it or we could teleport out

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:50.889
actually we could go to the curse room

00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:53.889
and teleport out as well which might be

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:53.889
advisable

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:05.930
decent get I think

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:05.930
I'm also kind of holding out hope that

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.480
maybe we can get to 15 cents I don't

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:14.190
think would be that useful to buy the

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.930
9-volt but there's a lot of items that

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:18.270
it could be quite good for so watch out

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:20.010
we got pin here should be very easy

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.600
especially with the you know the

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:24.170
brimstone shots that we got going on

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.170
here just

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:30.199
easiest money ever made I think we

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:35.719
should go for the curse room in an

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:37.279
attempt to kind of save ourselves here

00:07:35.719 --> 00:07:41.059
we got two spirit hearts so now I'm

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:42.499
gonna save it's a little complicated I'm

00:07:41.059 --> 00:07:51.789
gonna save this we'll get the heck out

00:07:42.499 --> 00:07:54.499
of here we'll try to find another penny

00:07:51.789 --> 00:07:56.089
we do have a bomb I think we might be

00:07:54.499 --> 00:07:58.819
able to oh there we go we might be able

00:07:56.089 --> 00:08:01.939
to blow up the greed statue in here as

00:07:58.819 --> 00:08:06.710
well but we've actually sort of made

00:08:01.939 --> 00:08:07.339
this work okay I'm okay with it I'm okay

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:10.969
with it

00:08:07.339 --> 00:08:12.529
full stop grab nine-volt we can have

00:08:10.969 --> 00:08:13.909
more than one pokemon at the same time I

00:08:12.529 --> 00:08:17.749
think so we might as well start tossing

00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:19.999
these around I think we got a good

00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:21.349
foundation for ourselves here we're a

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:22.789
little bit behind schedule I'd rather

00:08:21.349 --> 00:08:24.680
save the emperor card for the chance of

00:08:22.789 --> 00:08:26.240
getting through boss rush but I got to

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:30.529
be honest the run has actually made me a

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:32.449
believer now that I've seen the actual

00:08:30.529 --> 00:08:36.740
effects of the Monster Ball in this

00:08:32.449 --> 00:08:38.300
situation like I'm a happy boy that

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:45.860
being said I know I said I'd rather save

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:48.170
the Emperor card for for boss rush now

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:50.079
I'm like man come in here see what you

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:53.630
get

00:08:50.079 --> 00:08:55.370
grab all this teleport out not at all

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:58.430
concerned with the deal with the devil

00:08:55.370 --> 00:09:01.060
here in fact I might better not have a

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:03.589
deal with the devil just because of the

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:08.300
amount of risk it puts on me from an HP

00:09:03.589 --> 00:09:10.579
perspective but I actually think that

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:12.530
the ghost brimstone is like one of the

00:09:10.579 --> 00:09:17.010
best

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:19.200
payouts we could possibly have it's not

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:21.120
very likely that it oh thank you it's

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:25.440
not very likely that it actually hits

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:28.650
anything unfortunately but it is it is

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.390
doing a number when it does hit

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:33.210
something so we want to continue

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:34.770
exploring because there is a is a huge

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:37.830
incentive for us to get spirit hearts

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:39.420
and we did just get one here try a check

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:41.970
for like secret room but also blow this

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:48.780
guy up and we got Steam sale and secret

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:52.530
room which is great well go for broke

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:56.850
here aid Alex I appreciate that you're

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:58.620
playing f1 2017 but maybe you could not

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:00.420
sight it's kind of unreasonable hey

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.430
could you stop signing in to play video

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:05.300
games in your off hours like it's a

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:09.150
little unreasonable

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:10.800
now we can buy a two-cent playing card

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:13.800
in there which could be a deal with the

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:16.410
devil in and of itself actually feel

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.930
like the nine volt and I don't even know

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:20.580
what this is called like the bobby pin

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:24.500
or something it's it's a great choice

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:30.060
for us we're just getting like mass

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:32.850
monsterball spam and without being

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:34.590
forced to like find enemies myself I

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:36.810
think this is pretty good now it is also

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:38.700
completely mine flooding me like I can't

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:40.500
pay attention at all to what enemies are

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:43.920
mine and which enemies are the the games

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:47.520
but it's working I can't deny that it's

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:49.350
working not to mention I hope you still

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.560
got one there but we still get a charge

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:58.710
like any time any of our familiars died

00:10:52.560 --> 00:11:00.750
so we are kind of approaching absurdity

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:02.370
here I can't believe I went through like

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:04.380
the first two floors without using it at

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.230
all that was a bit of a a silly choice

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.360
in hindsight

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:11.470
okay plenty of money locked up lock up

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.470
lock up no lock up

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:19.880
not an ideal enemy who is now a friend

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.770
you know what they say though the enemy

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:24.480
of my enemy is my friend and the enema

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:31.060
of my enema goes in my end

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:34.279
[Music]

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:37.370
sure let's buy trinkets melter jennxpenn

00:11:34.279 --> 00:11:41.480
I need your strongest trinkets and then

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:43.310
this as well ace of clubs basically we

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:46.459
treated High Priestess for a bomb not a

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:47.690
good trade but not a terrible trade we

00:11:46.459 --> 00:11:50.089
had another trinket back there but it

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:51.770
wasn't that strong if I remember

00:11:50.089 --> 00:11:53.360
correctly it wasn't one of the big like

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:54.620
five trinkets so we'll ignore it and

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.149
hopefully we'll have a chance to get a

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:58.339
better one later we basically paid seven

00:11:56.149 --> 00:12:03.230
cents for mom's purse which is actually

00:11:58.339 --> 00:12:08.630
a good deal we might have just lost half

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:17.120
of our poke a girlfriends there we still

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:18.529
got brimstone angel fetus though picked

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:22.820
up another spear and hard it's actually

00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:24.320
like low key high key I don't know which

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:28.520
kind of key it is I was never that good

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:29.540
at music as a kid but well I mean if

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.420
you've heard me sing that's not gonna

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:34.790
surprise you too much one of the

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:36.770
strongest runs we've had on challenges

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:38.480
and that's kind of cool because I went

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.800
into this one being a little skeptical

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.170
being like oh this is one of the ones

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:44.630
you just sort of you know you probably

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:47.270
win fairly easily and then you move on

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:49.160
and that looks like it might be the case

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:51.560
here but we also have like one of the

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:54.440
more unique and engaging sort of

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:57.529
challenges that we that we've seen not

00:12:54.440 --> 00:13:00.160
quite as transformative as April's fool

00:12:57.529 --> 00:13:04.660
where you know every single enemy is

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:07.459
float and also all the items lie to you

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:09.279
but more than just a cheap gimmick here

00:13:07.459 --> 00:13:12.079
I think it's kind of a fun challenge

00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:15.829
after this bye I'm taking my sweet time

00:13:12.079 --> 00:13:18.410
on this challenge because I know that

00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:22.430
the next one is ultra hard and ultra

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:24.770
hard is probably I mean I I don't I'm

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:28.820
old enough to not make salty tweets most

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:31.399
of the time I understand my role as an

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:33.410
entertainer and for the most part any

00:13:31.399 --> 00:13:36.500
concerns of my life are relatively petty

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:40.400
so I actually thought you were my friend

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:43.270
now our relatively petty so I don't

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:45.700
tweet video game related salt very off

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:48.010
I remembered tweeting some salt about

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:52.360
the ultra heart challenge which tells me

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:55.780
everything I need to remember you're my

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:57.690
friend who is my enemy then nobody the

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:59.710
doors are open okay

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:01.300
tells me everything I need to know about

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:03.010
the ultra hard challenge I remember I

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.510
tweeted about the Speed Challenge as

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:07.240
well there's a little bit of salt built

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:08.170
in dude the brimstone ghost never

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:12.010
disappears

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:13.180
it's beautiful should have a good chance

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:15.280
at a deal with the devil you're the

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:17.530
little brim pick up you know continues

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.930
to essentially be a very very smart get

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:25.510
and this could be ideal it didn't give

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:27.280
me really much of anything but the

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:29.980
spirit art is nice and if we'd gotten a

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.510
a guppy item out of it I would have been

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:35.260
happier but mostly like we just don't

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:38.730
have much HP so that guys probably

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:41.290
dusted we don't have much HP so to

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:43.720
garner anything for free is pretty

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:47.430
positive although we just lost our HP to

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:50.110
begin with for no reason I guess

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:53.350
stationary enemies all spawn on top of

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:57.130
one another which is fine by me as long

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:58.570
as they don't hurt each other because

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:01.270
like we're all supposed to be friends

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:05.500
here for now at least we'll go back to

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:09.450
hating each other eventually but we owe

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.450
it to ourselves to unite for this run

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:19.560
we did you know let's blow you up I'm

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:22.860
just worried about it because I don't

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:25.440
want to blow up my own Pokemon in the

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:27.000
meantime we managed to succeeded that at

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.170
an extra eight percent chance of a deal

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.210
with the devil you know what they say

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:32.130
though eight percent great percent a

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:33.960
hundred percent no thank you

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:36.330
it's not supposed to rhyme it's just

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:38.340
suppose cm it's not really

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.810
hey eight percent is the difference

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:41.970
between getting a forty two and a fifty

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:46.290
we're good fifty of course being a

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:50.370
passing Canada I don't know if I have I

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:52.860
gone on my academic rant yet about I get

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:54.810
annoyed because I told everybody on

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:57.300
Twitch then in the province where I grew

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:59.610
up like eighty is an A and everyone goes

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:02.340
well doesn't everybody have 4.0 and I go

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:03.540
well we don't use GPAs where I grew up

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:05.970
because it's stupid you just get a

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:07.440
numeric average and then as a result

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:09.240
you're just competing on the strength of

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:11.520
your numeric average instead of a GPA

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:15.780
like a I don't even understand the

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:20.550
concept of a GPA versus Necropolis one

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:22.740
versus just having a number that tells

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:24.690
you what percentage you got in the class

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:27.210
but admittedly I'm not like I don't work

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:30.930
for the school board so I might be the

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:35.490
fool in this situation but yeah yeah and

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:38.340
Canada most places at least a 50 is a

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:40.650
pass and an 80 is an a-minus I know

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:42.030
you're like jealous but it still doesn't

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:43.680
make sense because when you compete for

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:46.560
it like spots in college you got it

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:48.780
I still got it you know beat out other

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:52.500
people you want that you want to know

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:56.340
some weirdness though I have taken some

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:58.020
classes I'm gonna do this because I want

00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:00.750
to keep the fool card we're ready to

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:04.770
cheese boss rush here I have taken some

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:07.050
classes in programming where a 50 is a

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:08.850
pass but you need a 60 to take the next

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:11.550
class in the track so it's basically

00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:13.830
like hey you know if you get a between a

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:15.540
50 and a 60 we'll give you the credit

00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:19.350
but you also have to drop out of your

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:21.429
program luckily I haven't come too close

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:23.900
to skirting that metric

00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:25.280
because I'm an adult and you know what

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:27.829
am I supposed to it's not like I'm going

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:30.260
to parties here I record video games and

00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:34.190
then I go to class and then I come home

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:39.669
and record video games easy enough

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:39.669
don't try me buster

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:46.700
it is wild I mean I'm not a full time

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.590
student but you know going to going to

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:51.620
college is a 28 year old very different

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:53.210
than going to college as a as an 18 year

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.860
old I was actually 17 in my freshman

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:56.780
year of college for the first like three

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:59.450
months every time I tell people that

00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:02.720
they go why you lying no it's not you

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:07.490
can do the math yourself but I turned 18

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:09.890
like three months into college I think

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:12.080
you know my birthday better than I know

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:14.570
myself you it's not that long ago my

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:16.309
memory hasn't faded that much sometimes

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:18.500
I talk to my classmates so I would you

00:18:16.309 --> 00:18:20.630
do this weekend at all dude it was sick

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:23.000
you know we were up at the Roxy it's a

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:24.590
townie bar in Vancouver that's you know

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.100
a little sketchy but I guess for the

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:28.549
youths

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:29.929
a good place to go now what did you do

00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:32.830
this weekend I was like all dude it was

00:18:29.929 --> 00:18:38.630
sick me and my wife went out for dinner

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:41.660
had two beers and a chicken sandwich

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:45.799
with a side salad it was freaking crazy

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:50.419
man but I don't miss the end I don't

00:18:45.799 --> 00:18:52.640
miss the the earlier days I like the the

00:18:50.419 --> 00:18:55.220
more domesticated life it's not like I

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.450
was ever living like you know a rock

00:18:55.220 --> 00:19:00.950
star or anything like that

00:18:56.450 --> 00:19:01.940
obviously but I I was looking to see if

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:03.440
maybe we could find a way to get more

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:05.090
spirit hearts out of this cuz apparently

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.500
like the other challenge of this run is

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:11.870
that HP just doesn't exist

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:13.760
but I like the more domestic life man it

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:15.169
sounds like I'm like searching for

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.830
something to justify it but I don't

00:19:15.169 --> 00:19:24.720
really need to justify it

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:28.649
I like the I like the routine we don't

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:31.380
want to yera okay a woz is irrelevant

00:19:28.649 --> 00:19:32.700
here on Zeus is nice and we actually see

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:36.149
that there's a library which is worth

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:37.679
going back for yara perthro we should

00:19:36.149 --> 00:19:39.659
there's two per throws because of the

00:19:37.679 --> 00:19:42.110
yarrow rune we use with blank runes so

00:19:39.659 --> 00:19:44.700
here's how we do this we take per throw

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:47.039
and we go to our library we still got

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:49.980
not plenty of time but a decent amount

00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:51.690
of time bad trip not good enough we go

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:55.279
to the library we hope that there's like

00:19:51.690 --> 00:20:00.389
Satanic Bible and Book of Revelations

00:19:55.279 --> 00:20:01.010
well Book of Revelations is kind of good

00:20:00.389 --> 00:20:04.320
enough

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:06.690
we doesn't we've done it no we don't

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:10.169
quite get bookworm there so we take

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:11.250
friendly ball back / throw again we get

00:20:10.169 --> 00:20:12.779
book of sin which should give us

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:15.870
bookworm gave us a red heart

00:20:12.779 --> 00:20:17.220
unfortunately and now we work our way

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:19.440
towards this boss fight I'm still

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:21.090
hopeful here's the how the next step of

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:23.539
this should go we get the fool card we

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:25.590
teleport out of boss trash after

00:20:23.539 --> 00:20:27.779
teleporting out of boss rush having

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:29.220
taken an item we go back and get well

00:20:27.779 --> 00:20:30.570
actually now I think about it the yarrow

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:37.110
rune is not that valuable because this

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:40.409
run cannot go to the chest that being

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:43.110
said it's still valuable because you can

00:20:40.409 --> 00:20:46.019
get you know like a second or third and

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:48.990
fourth spirit heart out of it but not

00:20:46.019 --> 00:20:52.370
quite as valuable as it is on on your

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:52.370
average kind of normal run

00:20:53.130 --> 00:21:00.120
I still think school should work

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:02.820
backwards well sort of I think you

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:07.020
should you should have kindergarten and

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:09.690
then college six-year-olds have nothing

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:11.309
better to do than learn all the time I'm

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:13.320
not saying like kids shouldn't be kids

00:21:11.309 --> 00:21:14.940
quite the opposite I'm just saying like

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.700
you know what at what else is a

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:20.340
six-year-old have to do play with Lego

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.960
oh it's good for their brain no you know

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:23.940
what's good for their brain learning

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:26.700
like quantum mechanics at that age and

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:30.350
then when you're 25 you learn long

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:32.789
division it's the way it should be

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:35.250
against school gets easier as time goes

00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:37.890
on so do we want adrenaline takes us

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:40.260
closer to I mean X placebos pretty good

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:42.510
here as well I do want dogtooth which is

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:45.150
also solid I mean there's four okay

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:48.360
items here I think I'm gonna go X plus

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:51.470
Evo and the reason in the end ends up

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:56.340
being that our damage is not that good

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:57.990
by the way as always I am all right at

00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:00.809
brimstone I don't need X plus Evo that

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:02.520
was actually very stupid um but I forgot

00:22:00.809 --> 00:22:04.289
that I had just picked up brimstone mere

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.520
seconds ago which is actually worse

00:22:04.289 --> 00:22:11.429
because it should have been fresh in my

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:14.070
mind but as always I am stupid however

00:22:11.429 --> 00:22:17.010
I'm smart in that I know that I'm stupid

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:20.270
which I think sets me apart at least in

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:22.950
in some way No

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:28.080
so I recognize that this backwards

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:30.840
school idea probably pretty dumb can't

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:35.039
say for certain might as well take mom's

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:37.350
purse I guess can't say for certain but

00:22:35.039 --> 00:22:40.110
it strikes me as a pretty foolhardy idea

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:42.419
but it like many of my ideas if you

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:44.309
never offer up like any form of scrutiny

00:22:42.419 --> 00:22:47.100
for it it actually sounds pretty sick

00:22:44.309 --> 00:22:49.610
right I think credit card could be the

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.610
era here

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:55.429
okay utero one

00:22:58.789 --> 00:23:04.590
what Sarge

00:23:00.179 --> 00:23:07.499
it's our endgame it's our side game well

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:09.210
I mean the end game is pretty simple as

00:23:07.499 --> 00:23:11.039
with most of these challenges we're

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:17.429
pretty much just gearing up for survival

00:23:11.039 --> 00:23:19.499
I love that as soon as we kill the

00:23:17.429 --> 00:23:23.190
enemies the angel fetus starts shooting

00:23:19.499 --> 00:23:25.169
at us is like he recognizes we've got a

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:26.850
unite to face a common foe but as soon

00:23:25.169 --> 00:23:28.740
as there's no other aggro on the screen

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:31.970
he's like I hate you I just want you to

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.970
know nothing has changed between us

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:38.700
feels kind of like against the spirit of

00:23:36.029 --> 00:23:42.480
the run to change spacebar items I tried

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:44.879
to move but screwed myself just get

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.080
dusted please and then we get this which

00:23:44.879 --> 00:23:47.490
means we might have been better off

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:53.299
taking the era room but we got through a

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:58.070
floor basically free of charge so we are

00:23:53.299 --> 00:23:58.070
eager for a deal with the devil

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:13.820
how does one cement a deal with the

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:16.520
devil into existence well beat this boss

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:26.480
without dying probably does the best

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:28.130
thing for us the gods also good that

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.360
might have been enough to like cement

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:31.880
the victory for us sorry I haven't been

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:39.760
using a monster ball as much as I should

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:39.760
probably uh excuse me is this allowed uh

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:43.790
oh okay

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:46.520
so I definitely like should not have

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:54.410
done this room nine lives is the

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:56.300
ultimate life saving item I love that

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:58.429
you can either get a ghost that shoots

00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:01.940
brimstone lasers as you're a friendly

00:24:58.429 --> 00:25:04.550
ball option or you can get a single corn

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:08.270
fly that flies harmlessly into the enemy

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:13.360
and explodes into a wisp of arthropod

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:18.170
guts in about a quarter of a second

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:19.460
anyway the the nine lives pick up might

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:24.380
have been the bailout that we needed

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:26.630
thanks lee iaccoca we only have one

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:31.000
guppy items so the cursed room is

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:33.170
essentially a a room non grata right now

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.830
which i don't think is the way that that

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:40.790
expression works but the only Latin I'm

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:45.220
familiar with is Lou Bega's musical over

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:45.220
us so great name for a twitch channel

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:56.810
please I need these friends of mine to

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:59.840
help me destroy you stop destroying them

00:25:56.810 --> 00:26:01.520
in turn we will not be fighting hush we

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.500
will be becoming guppy right here

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:06.230
guaranteed despite the impossibility of

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:07.820
it and if it just goes to show you dude

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:10.010
it's the same thing that always happens

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:12.110
when I have credit card it's not

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:13.760
plausible to use it correctly when I

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:15.860
don't have credit card it's like hey

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:22.370
here's four too hard deal with the

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:25.450
Devils I don't like you cuz you just

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:27.680
kind of stick around especially you

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:30.320
you've got to be like in the running for

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:32.420
worst I mean he's gone now but like the

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:35.000
worst possible payout from friendly ball

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:37.430
right literally all you do is stand

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.220
still and if an enemy touches you they

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:44.360
take damage but you will also die it's

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:47.810
like you're a mind sorry it's like I'm a

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:50.240
mine Wow

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:51.440
you know what great I can't code you

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.570
know what can I say you did a good job

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:57.380
there

00:26:52.570 --> 00:27:00.080
so again nine lives basically bailed us

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:01.040
out okay I'll tell you what we'll

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:05.180
probably try a different direction

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:13.310
because my indignity knows no bounds

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:20.060
here we should still be highly you know

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:22.130
very extremely fine but we should you

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:24.350
know dial in to put it in battlegrounds

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:25.520
terms it's time to dial him one of the

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:29.920
ways we might want to just get through

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:33.620
this room is to throw a bomb down oh

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:37.070
that was extremely close and then

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:43.250
just don't die on this room and you're

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:44.510
free similarly like by the way

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:49.190
apparently it's the only enemy that

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:52.070
exists in this challenge is these stupid

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:54.860
ghost flies so your gun not really flies

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:57.559
really ghosts they do fly but so do most

00:27:54.860 --> 00:28:00.200
ghosts untethered from you know this

00:27:57.559 --> 00:28:02.059
mortal coil it turns out that everybody

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:06.050
can do David Blaine's teleportation

00:28:02.059 --> 00:28:09.559
trick you guys ever realized that David

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:12.830
Blaine is basically Hugh Jackman from

00:28:09.559 --> 00:28:16.900
The Prestige dude sick year 2000 David

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:19.390
Blaine blew my mind how he pretended to

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:21.950
levitate six inches above the ground

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:23.510
basically by optical illusion

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:25.420
positioning his feet in a weird way and

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:27.950
then raising himself up on his tiptoes

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:31.850
how did David Blaine blow my mind in

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:35.410
2016 and you're like its 2017 no the

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:37.850
backlogs not that big I promise you but

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:41.090
you know that his special I think came

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:46.010
out in 2016 oh you know he stabs himself

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:49.570
through the hand and throws up like live

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:57.400
minnows into a bathtub he's become like

00:28:49.570 --> 00:29:02.590
he's gone too far he's been consumed no

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:02.590
whole it was so unnecessary

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
stop

00:29:14.309 --> 00:29:21.580
like he's a ma he is Hugh Jackman from

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:23.590
The Prestige not not Edward Norton from

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:25.600
the alou's illusionist cuz that movie is

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:27.460
like it's a little bit of it I gotta be

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:29.260
honest when they first came out my

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.940
interpretation was that the illusionist

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:33.070
was better respected than the prestige

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:35.830
but I think that as Chris Nolan has made

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:37.960
more films the prestige has definitely

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:40.679
racked up who shall I say a certain

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:43.210
level of the Christic boom that's me

00:29:40.679 --> 00:29:45.010
ending this run before the punch line

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:47.049
good challenge though dude I'm glad we
