00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.130
everybody welcome a grown lion play

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.400
spawning baskets with plus do you have

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:12.139
to get greed mode to 990-n sense do you

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.630
have to get greed mode to $9.99

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:18.180
let's see fastest way to get green

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.180
machine green machine green machine here

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.609
we go the green machine appears after

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.990
every ultra fight greed sorry every

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.890
ultra greed fighting greed motor

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.579
greedier mode it's shared if it's shared

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.489
between them then we're okay

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.930
the machine has a much lower Jam rate in

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.750
greedy your mode that's fantastic let's

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.789
do it alright alright alright close this

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.980
up that means we can do greedy your runs

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.489
starting right now and we can because

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.530
everybody's got it except brain dome yes

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.300
okay why don't I play some Isaac greedy

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.329
or dude I'm excited we finally ascended

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:05.220
pass baby mode curse of the unknown

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:07.350
doctor ha FFG to torn photo a lovely

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.180
choice to begin with and a little bit of

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.070
extra HP never hurt anybody either so

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.180
I'll admit I don't really know the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.700
difference or at least I don't really

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:20.100
recall the difference between greed and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.030
greedier without the financial rewards

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.990
were a little bit less apart from that

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.780
I'm a little stumped enemies are more

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.770
difficult more champions due to $0.03

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.189
key is a good deal I will sign up for

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.829
that

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.450
let me try maybe we'll get lucky here I

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.850
think it's not a bad use of a bomb even

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.259
though it ended up hanging out with

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.250
absolutely nothing so we're gonna head

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.460
down all right

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.360
and I do think actually once we get 3

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.950
cents step on the thing we got HP let's

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.780
not waste a charge that we might want to

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.969
prefer to use on our deal with the devil

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.930
for example if we get a garbage item

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.159
just try to make the best use possible

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.500
in d6

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.350
moreover like this might be overkill you

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.390
might not have to played this astutely

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.399
not that I'm Tooting my own horn here to

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.560
beat greedy or mode on an average seed

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.910
but make it a little bit more

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.520
interesting on ourselves now that we're

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.180
in the the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.750
big leagues you know can't be doing

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.210
bush-league

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.940
chaos strats over and over so you got a

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.730
look at this you run like a cost-benefit

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.570
analysis once every four waves are gonna

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.820
get a coin

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:32.830
I think it's once every four waves it's

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.080
probably like twenty cents over the

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.850
course of a run sir sure I'll take it I

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.050
don't think it's necessarily that good

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.600
but all it has to do is pay out with

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.650
like one nickel or one dime and I'm a

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.390
happy camper

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.010
if it exclusively pays out with pennies

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.140
it's like we're trading our early game

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.300
item for maybe one to two items in the

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.740
late game and that might not be great

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.790
because that you know the less items you

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.320
have the more each one matters but plus

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.850
the longer you get to use an item that's

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:04.120
really good like torn photo for example

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:06.250
which we already got but I'm gonna I'm

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.620
gonna err on the side of it occasionally

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.240
giving us a nickel and thus blowing the

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:16.120
value chain like completely wide open

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:17.590
for us think we got an extra penny out

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.660
of that so might be once every two waves

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.880
actually now keep in mind you've also

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.030
got curse of the unknown so we should be

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.350
a little cautious about the way our HP

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.660
looks right now we know we've probably

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.100
got two or one-and-a-half somewhere in

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.470
the vicinity of that at the very least

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.620
but I'd rather Oh

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:39.310
if possible try to avoid catastrophic

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.900
loss of HP so really love to be able to

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.310
buy an item before we fight our bosses

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:48.220
but I don't think that that dream is

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:50.140
gonna come to fruition so I'd please I

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.300
do remember the problem with greed mode

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.180
by the way or sorry greedier is that you

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.560
get all these tanky enemies to spawn and

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.300
if you don't get a damage upgrade right

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.150
off the bat it becomes a huge uphill

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.380
battle luckily we did get a damage

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.790
upgrade right off the bat I'm just

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.790
dodging like garbage right now

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.110
DPS upgrade you know what I mean it's

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.520
all the same oh it all funnels back into

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.170
the same thing which is you know

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.950
destroying an enemy's health pool please

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:20.040
don't mess with that TNT I need that to

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.260
live we're gonna have thirteen

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.510
since not quite enough to get the job

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.510
done but all right not bad not bad

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.030
who knows what that half heart means to

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:37.980
us see what we get first a 14 second

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:44.520
lead time to deal with the haunts but I

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:49.530
don't really want to you know step on

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:54.260
the button maybe once we kill the haunts

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:57.180
little ghost friends he will brimstone

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.890
dukkha flies and for the cost of half of

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.430
a hard which is what we would have spent

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:04.470
a step on the thing anyway he'll get

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.790
dusted for example that was like

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.680
literally exactly the same situation

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.720
except we didn't have to pay the

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:15.510
half-hour that time it did dang it okay

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:17.100
that's fine though not too bad I think a

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.540
lot of our hopes live and die with this

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.800
first floor deal with the devil I didn't

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.240
even look at the items that were in the

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.550
shop they couldn't have dazzled me too

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.870
much I suppose if we didn't I if they

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.760
didn't catch our eye right off the bat

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.160
but well we'll go in after this and look

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.750
you might be able to buy an item and a

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.190
battery charge if we're really paranoid

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:36.810
about making this first deal with the

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:40.980
devil work starter deck is probably

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:45.590
worth it let's grab that question mark

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:49.050
card and then we'll buy this actually

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.700
yeah yeah I can live with this there's a

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.540
reroll machine as well this is good this

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:57.780
is actually good Lucca flies is no

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.820
problem I actually he's such not a

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.470
problem I actually felt bad about using

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.720
a bomb against him but now that he's

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.780
gone we basically despite envy if we can

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.900
get from our first deal with the devil

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.210
here any item that ups are damaged or

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.250
our rate of fire without pushing us past

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.170
the tear cab in thus incurring a little

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.330
bit of an opportunity cost I suppose I

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.950
mean let's be honest that was those were

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.960
a lot of big words that are not becoming

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.060
of me what I will probably do is look at

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.310
the item wait for my brain to be like I

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.780
like it or I don't like it and then take

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.790
it and then two seconds later after

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.370
picking it up I'll evaluate it and go oh

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:35.910
that wasn't worth the cost at all

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:38.730
it's more my speed to rooms huh on soos

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:42.540
and haggle eyes on soos is a useless

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:44.340
rune might show us the secret room

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.350
that's it so we couldn't spend a bomb to

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.260
find the secret room hoggle Oz is

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:53.790
potentially sort of useful probably not

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:56.130
very good but not necessarily bad so we

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:58.440
get child's leash out of that might make

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.949
a sack of pennies follow closer behind

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.860
us

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:04.650
what an amazing thrill that will be okay

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.910
still though first floor now Ben we got

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.010
to deal with the angel chance we have

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.080
speed plus range upgrade I think it's

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:12.750
worth it

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:14.040
that is not though get lemon mishap also

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:17.520
not really worth it I'm gonna use our

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:19.680
question mark card you get nightlight I

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.780
think you can make a case for night life

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:25.650
HP is a little on the low side

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:28.470
thank you very much we're gonna blow

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:31.320
these up not necessarily it's not quite

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:32.760
enough to make me excited I guess no

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.710
bombs for sale so let's let's think

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:38.360
about this logically I think you grab

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:40.350
this you start playing a little bit here

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.930
kind of swinging for the fences

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:46.110
excellent we got synthol out of it pay

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:50.760
three cents for that no problem and and

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:52.110
then I think we just go to town well we

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.720
didn't need to use hog allows this guy

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:56.340
blew himself up damage rate of fire I

00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:01.169
would say there at a level appropriate

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:03.900
standard I know you're like man he's got

00:08:01.169 --> 00:08:05.729
such a way with words he looks like an

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:08.610
accountant but he talks like a poet I

00:08:05.729 --> 00:08:11.789
think we have a build that's conducive

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:13.830
to our prison organizational aims let me

00:08:11.789 --> 00:08:15.539
run this by the Comptroller in due time

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.490
and we'll see I don't know what a

00:08:15.539 --> 00:08:19.919
comptroller does I believe they control

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:21.470
I believe that comptroller is what I

00:08:19.919 --> 00:08:24.450
meant to say no I believe they

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:28.380
administer

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:30.600
the infrastructure of a city like the

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:32.160
Comptroller is like yeah you can build

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.960
that there the Comptroller is like nah

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.640
you can't build that there that's an

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:40.170
antiquated word we got to get rid of the

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:41.610
word comptroller its gatekeeping the

00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:43.470
only people who would ever run for the

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:45.600
position of Comptroller already know

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:47.910
what comptroller is I don't want my

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.690
ignorance to reduce my ability to get a

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.340
better job

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:52.230
so as far as I'm concerned is not called

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.760
comptroller anymore you might say what

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.380
should we call it well the answer is

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.580
that as soon as I get a free second here

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.320
I'm gonna look up what a comptroller

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:00.570
actually does and I'll rename it myself

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.970
live on camera for the good of myself

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.670
but also mankind you got to be careful

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:08.370
with rerolls

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:09.990
because if we use one we'll have to pay

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:14.460
for another one to have one ready for a

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:17.550
deal with the Angels slash devil and I

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:20.670
would prefer to keep it keep it going

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:26.550
here we'll probably have to buy some HP

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:29.850
as well you got to go for spun see what

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:32.880
else we get mostly good we got a luck

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:36.570
downgrade ancient recall is a few cards

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:38.970
fool death pool two of diamonds two of

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:42.410
diamonds is a lovely card we got to grab

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:46.440
this did we then take our fool card oh

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:48.570
you know what Hogg allows this Ike we

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.190
ask yourself son I'm gonna enter this

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:55.880
room that worked out quite well we're

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:55.880
gonna fool card out of here sure

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:02.680
to a dime it's got to keep it fool

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.270
there's value in the fool card there is

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.760
some value in the death card but I would

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.660
say the fool card is probably I

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.340
understand how to use it a little better

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:13.650
I think the two of diamonds we just

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:15.640
saved for essentially as late as we can

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:18.750
rest assured I haven't forgotten about

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.750
the Comptroller business

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.590
I'm keeping the the green nub alive down

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:27.460
here

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:29.890
or as I call him The Incredible Hulk so

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:32.830
that what it would a needless shot at a

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:36.730
great Marvel property no the reasoning

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:38.140
is he could kill some enemies for us at

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:41.590
some point in this run we're gonna need

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:46.510
some HP that time is possibly like

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:48.780
rapidly approaching thankfully not there

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:48.780
yet

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:58.390
14 cents shouldn't take jarrah flies we

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.560
actually don't need any speed so I don't

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:01.030
think we buy anything else here do we

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.200
have we do have a rear ol machine but we

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:05.790
don't we're never gonna get to fifteen

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.790
cents so nothing to worry about

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:10.930
this shouldn't be too rough we're

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:13.330
fighting three enemies and and they kind

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:17.230
of hide from us they obfuscate if you

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:20.680
will but on the bright side they're also

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:23.680
extremely not tanky so there we go

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:27.550
easy money deal with the angel huh where

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:30.430
we get stigmata unexpected but fairly

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:33.430
positive you need the HP as mentioned so

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:35.019
sure not that bad that would have been a

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:37.450
better choice for hog Allah is probably

00:11:35.019 --> 00:11:39.790
right there could have gotten magic mush

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:41.560
you never know first things first I

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:43.180
think you coming keep this situation

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:49.959
right here it's not bad takes us to 15

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:51.550
cents fool card out more HP not 10 out

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:54.610
of 10 probably should be a little bit

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:57.730
more liberal using the mmm that's

00:11:54.610 --> 00:12:06.070
actually tempting hear me out here five

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:07.269
cents two of these we lost not the run

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.220
but we lost a little bit on that

00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:11.170
transaction because we got to buy

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.880
another key that's right uh I could I

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:17.440
could be persuaded to take potato peeler

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:22.930
for a bit anyway sulfur tears or acid

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:26.260
tears I don't love them but I'm gonna

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:29.250
bank on them being better than nice well

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:32.050
very smart decision bank on them being

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:33.399
plausibly useful here

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:35.200
they've only got to provide us with

00:12:33.399 --> 00:12:39.730
fifteen cents of value that's not that

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:41.410
much to break even I mean I guess we

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:43.180
would probably want done fifteen cents

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:44.770
all right five cents I guess we would

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.360
probably want them to provide more than

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:51.970
five cents where the benefit considering

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:54.399
you know item rooms are limited we've

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:56.079
taken a lot of like 5050 items I think

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:57.699
like sack of pennies has worked out

00:12:56.079 --> 00:13:00.310
better than expected wouldn't be

00:12:57.699 --> 00:13:06.370
surprised if acid tears end up a little

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:08.170
bit worse I overate tier effects even if

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:10.899
they stink most of the time one

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:13.750
exception being that eyeballs that just

00:13:10.899 --> 00:13:16.480
sort of rolled around but I caught a

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:18.220
little heat for that in the comments so

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:21.000
I don't know maybe maybe we'll get the

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:26.339
right synergy to make that work one day

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:29.290
for now though just feel like I'm

00:13:26.339 --> 00:13:32.260
referencing some Spanish when I say for

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:35.890
now though it's like close to Fernando

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:38.890
but not quite there don't call my name

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:44.560
don't call my name for now though

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:47.319
doesn't really work okay we got through

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:49.630
the first set here pretty easily no

00:13:47.319 --> 00:13:51.610
battery charges for sale and one bomb

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:53.260
remaining I'm gonna say no at a potato

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:55.270
peeler even though it burns me up in my

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.829
soul a little bit and then you got a

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:58.720
look at this you gotta say come on blank

00:13:56.829 --> 00:13:59.709
art two of diamonds who says no to blank

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.940
card to a diamonds

00:13:59.709 --> 00:14:05.380
I mean I'm gonna think about I'm gonna

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:07.810
think about it for a bit cuz we're in an

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:13.660
okay situation I don't like to lose the

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:15.990
d6 and also financially we're kind of

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.990
okay

00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:24.999
especially considering like recently we

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:26.709
had a run we donated like 70 cents they

00:14:24.999 --> 00:14:27.209
grew up to like 880 or something like

00:14:26.709 --> 00:14:31.029
that

00:14:27.209 --> 00:14:36.430
for green mode which again hopefully

00:14:31.029 --> 00:14:38.410
carries over with greedier so I don't

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:39.910
think money is necessarily that

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:41.889
important although of course we do use

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:44.079
that to buy items as well and if we can

00:14:41.889 --> 00:14:46.600
cross that threshold we can buy infinite

00:14:44.079 --> 00:14:50.079
items more or less so we probably should

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:52.389
it's probably like idiotic not to I just

00:14:50.079 --> 00:14:54.309
don't like losing the d6 it hurts me

00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:55.920
deep in my soul so I'm thinking that

00:14:54.309 --> 00:15:07.870
maybe the first thing we should do is

00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:09.670
just finish this wave off then then we

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:11.379
can reroll our deal with the devil or

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:12.999
angel hopefully re-roll it into

00:15:11.379 --> 00:15:14.139
something useful if we have the reroll

00:15:12.999 --> 00:15:15.279
and of course the alternative would just

00:15:14.139 --> 00:15:20.829
be getting something good right off the

00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:22.689
bat and then we could feel better I

00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:25.689
think about taking it Plus you know if

00:15:22.689 --> 00:15:27.699
you take a blank card 2 of diamonds and

00:15:25.689 --> 00:15:30.069
you have literally like 5 cents left

00:15:27.699 --> 00:15:31.029
after that cost you a few doublings to

00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:33.009
get to the point where you can actually

00:15:31.029 --> 00:15:35.110
purchase stuff again this way we'll buy

00:15:33.009 --> 00:15:36.459
eleven nineteen cents go back up to 38

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:43.800
not too far off right

00:15:36.459 --> 00:15:43.800
it's okay it's alright

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:53.689
two of back up to 38 cents I think we

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:56.360
want to just like try to get ya I mean

00:15:53.689 --> 00:15:58.939
that'll do and then if we can buy a five

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.899
cent battery charge I'd be very happy it

00:15:58.939 --> 00:16:01.749
might look like we're throwing money

00:15:59.899 --> 00:16:04.429
away but if we get one battery charge

00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:06.829
that can respawn effectively we have

00:16:04.429 --> 00:16:08.720
unlimited money from that point onwards

00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:10.699
so I think the faster we can do that the

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:16.850
happier we're gonna be I've got a 15

00:16:10.699 --> 00:16:18.829
cent battery there we go so now know we

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.309
litter owner enough whoo yeah yeah we're

00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:21.769
good

00:16:19.309 --> 00:16:23.149
it's like we literally hit P exact

00:16:21.769 --> 00:16:26.119
amount that would make it possible

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:28.519
okay so weird like completely set so

00:16:26.119 --> 00:16:30.050
obviously we're gonna buy like whatever

00:16:28.519 --> 00:16:31.970
stock is useful for us we could even

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:35.839
take the d6 after this once we get

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:38.720
unlimited everything already like

00:16:35.839 --> 00:16:40.490
immediately up to 99 cents we should buy

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:48.290
all the actives because we candy 6 them

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:49.819
it will cost us our use of the blank

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:51.499
card but if we can use the blank card to

00:16:49.819 --> 00:16:53.839
give us like unlimited items right now

00:16:51.499 --> 00:16:57.920
than like who cares right just throw

00:16:53.839 --> 00:17:00.319
that over there use that grab this Jesus

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:03.679
juice is half price belly button allows

00:17:00.319 --> 00:17:06.649
us to hold two trinkets slow worms not

00:17:03.679 --> 00:17:10.370
very good but you know why not Cracker

00:17:06.649 --> 00:17:12.110
Jacks quality is never gonna do anything

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:13.579
for us I don't even want to touch like

00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:15.399
the oh maybe I will touch the coin purse

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:18.199
items in hindsight so we're like

00:17:15.399 --> 00:17:20.899
completely set we found that we found

00:17:18.199 --> 00:17:24.289
the cheese stop that I have never seen

00:17:20.899 --> 00:17:25.970
it before I've never seen matchbook give

00:17:24.289 --> 00:17:30.649
us four troll bombs to the best of my

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:32.149
knowledge at least at this point I'm

00:17:30.649 --> 00:17:35.990
like not even thinking about the items

00:17:32.149 --> 00:17:38.210
forgetting but you gotta just get in

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:39.570
there right I mean how could you not you

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:42.600
got a trinket

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:44.639
but really not very great trinkets so

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:48.960
far Wheel of Fortune High Priestess

00:17:44.639 --> 00:17:52.919
fool card chariot card justice card I

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:55.880
would say no no game changers in there

00:17:52.919 --> 00:17:55.880
so let's not sweat it too much

00:17:56.419 --> 00:18:01.380
mom transformation has already happened

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:03.360
so we're not sweating that I will buy

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:07.110
seven cent stat upgrades until the end

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:09.360
of time though if you let me we doubled

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:15.539
the wrong thing that's actually still

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:16.860
completely fine mmm really want thunder

00:18:15.539 --> 00:18:25.019
thighs but I'll pop it out of the queue

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:26.759
at least even things that only mildly

00:18:25.019 --> 00:18:29.519
improve our stats I'm okay with

00:18:26.759 --> 00:18:32.309
especially at half price here so we just

00:18:29.519 --> 00:18:35.720
got the fungi transformation 22 cents

00:18:32.309 --> 00:18:41.789
fired two of these we're back in this

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:45.000
unlimited keys unlimited damage and you

00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:46.830
bet I'm gonna like maximize our value on

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.870
this one make sure you're holding to a

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:54.299
diamonds that's a just want to make sure

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:56.519
you're set there why wouldn't I at this

00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:58.710
point well you might say you know maybe

00:18:56.519 --> 00:19:00.809
you don't want to take 100 million years

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:02.429
to finish this greedier run I've got no

00:19:00.809 --> 00:19:05.009
places to be you got places to be

00:19:02.429 --> 00:19:06.539
we don't break a run like this too often

00:19:05.009 --> 00:19:11.009
that might be I thought that was gonna

00:19:06.539 --> 00:19:15.139
be Beelzebub there it was not sneak in

00:19:11.009 --> 00:19:15.139
here to diamonds

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.369
[Music]

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:33.420
I think we got bookworm it's hard to

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:36.010
tell it happened pretty fast

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:43.450
this should be Beelzebub and we already

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:46.660
had it okay you know what pop the hanged

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:51.700
man get get some of these garbage cards

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:53.830
out of here stop me see if I care what

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:55.330
else we got question mark card I don't

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.710
even want to think about what happens if

00:19:55.330 --> 00:20:00.340
you use a blank card question mark card

00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:04.300
that seems very confusing to me ace of

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:09.970
clubs don't do that cuz we need our 2a

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:14.140
diamonds here there you go if you could

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:16.090
just sneak okay maybe this will be like

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:17.490
the last wave that will bye for now cuz

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:22.080
I think it's getting a little ridiculous

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:22.080
shots are looking pretty wild

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:28.590
that's bookworm so actually we probably

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:28.590
got the Beelzebub transformation earlier

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:35.920
we gotta get crickets body weary

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:40.540
throughout the battery you idiot oh well

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:42.430
I mean we still got blank card unlimited

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:45.820
money if we want it but let's take

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:52.960
crickets body I think I'm gonna do six

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:54.460
everything I want more items sure we

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.870
lose blank card might lose out on some

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:58.440
money as a result but I think it's more

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:58.440
fun this way

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:05.710
I think blue map is worth taking x-ray

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.390
vision sure well we didn't need both of

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:10.270
them in hindsight I think the battery

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:11.890
could be worth taking everything else

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:15.550
get rear old one more time thanks to

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:17.200
9-volt co k go is horrible but we'll

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:20.980
take it is only horrible in this mode by

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:23.050
the way mom's box of trinkets if you can

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:25.530
give me a better trinket or two that

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:25.530
would be fine

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:34.840
blind rage I guess is okay they picked

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:38.050
up the charge with the wrong one there

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:40.810
and two of diamonds is gone forever but

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:42.910
I mean like beyond okay with this

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:48.490
especially with the existence of the Sun

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:49.810
card so I would say we're in a great

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:52.750
spot as a result of this but that's

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:54.310
probably abundantly clear I do wish our

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:56.590
damage was a little higher I'm surprised

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:58.390
we didn't pick up more in that vein but

00:21:56.590 --> 00:22:00.750
I mean the whole world is in our hands

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:00.750
at this point

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:08.440
bloodshot I do not really surprise

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:10.120
there's even passives left but lucky us

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.830
to be honest because magic mush is not

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:14.410
just a passive it's a damage multiplier

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:16.330
so I think at this point unless we get

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:20.010
something incredible we'll probably save

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:23.890
all of our money because we want to

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:26.170
ensure that we can donate as much as

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:28.150
possible like we sure with blank card we

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:29.980
could have donated a ton blank card 2 of

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:32.080
diamonds but you never know when the

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:34.090
machine's gonna Jam I think carrying

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:37.530
$0.99 is about the best you could

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:37.530
conceivably hope for in most situations

00:22:42.409 --> 00:22:46.769
probably a little bit of value and

00:22:44.399 --> 00:22:48.690
bringing the Sun card with us but forgot

00:22:46.769 --> 00:22:51.719
we had roon bag all we need is a nalgas

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:56.129
room and then the sun card is a lot less

00:22:51.719 --> 00:22:58.229
useful the shots never die so enemies

00:22:56.129 --> 00:23:03.570
are essentially dying as soon as they

00:22:58.229 --> 00:23:06.359
come into existence yeah all you might

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:08.249
expect go relatively deep on this one HP

00:23:06.359 --> 00:23:09.869
is not really much of a problem ma the

00:23:08.249 --> 00:23:11.700
void can give us some damage and Rawdon

00:23:09.869 --> 00:23:16.440
baby can give us quite a line as well

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:20.579
and as much damage as I thought but see

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:22.229
what we got on soos worth nothing ace of

00:23:20.579 --> 00:23:27.029
clubs worth less than nothing

00:23:22.229 --> 00:23:34.750
said a year Arun it is so the way I see

00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:36.289
we should probably use a year of roon to

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:38.399
[Music]

00:23:36.289 --> 00:23:39.809
double our money on the next floor

00:23:38.399 --> 00:23:42.450
although we're probably gonna have

00:23:39.809 --> 00:23:45.779
enough to get $2.99 regardless about you

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:47.429
two hearts the tower temperance is a

00:23:45.779 --> 00:23:50.839
little value but not much

00:23:47.429 --> 00:23:53.669
take Gera ace of clubs why ace of clubs

00:23:50.839 --> 00:23:55.799
literally absolutely no reason except

00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:58.109
that we could dump it ASAP guilt-free so

00:23:55.799 --> 00:24:00.059
I can't believe you still got a couple

00:23:58.109 --> 00:24:02.940
floors left here because we are rolling

00:24:00.059 --> 00:24:05.519
I actually do not want Taurus chemical

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:07.469
peel is a much more valuable pickup

00:24:05.519 --> 00:24:09.239
because I never want to not be shooting

00:24:07.469 --> 00:24:10.679
I don't want to go 20 seconds without

00:24:09.239 --> 00:24:12.239
having their shots be out there and I'm

00:24:10.679 --> 00:24:16.109
gonna break my own rule by the way to

00:24:12.239 --> 00:24:18.779
take soymilk which only triples our rate

00:24:16.109 --> 00:24:21.899
of fire and takes our damage down by

00:24:18.779 --> 00:24:24.619
like 1/6 but for absurdities sake I

00:24:21.899 --> 00:24:24.619
think is worth it

00:24:26.559 --> 00:24:38.179
yeah so this seems pretty good even if

00:24:31.399 --> 00:24:40.369
soymilk is not really helping out I love

00:24:38.179 --> 00:24:45.049
making a soy milk run work just feels

00:24:40.369 --> 00:24:51.169
right so you know what yera

00:24:45.049 --> 00:24:52.869
all these many perthro runes we hadn't

00:24:51.169 --> 00:24:55.159
picked up too much of the money I think

00:24:52.869 --> 00:25:04.700
$0.99 should not be a problem many per

00:24:55.159 --> 00:25:06.139
Cano ruins sure why not I'm not even

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:12.979
worried about the pecan Oh rooms but

00:25:06.139 --> 00:25:15.259
like take the per throws alright so this

00:25:12.979 --> 00:25:16.999
is our last floor before the ultra greed

00:25:15.259 --> 00:25:18.589
fight all I remember about the like

00:25:16.999 --> 00:25:20.929
super mega ultra and he's really really

00:25:18.589 --> 00:25:27.169
bad this time we promise greed fight is

00:25:20.929 --> 00:25:31.609
that he shoots explosive shots so we

00:25:27.169 --> 00:25:34.369
should keep an eye on those to be real

00:25:31.609 --> 00:25:38.899
with you we could probably afford to

00:25:34.369 --> 00:25:42.679
take an item at the very least

00:25:38.899 --> 00:25:44.059
especially if it gave us I mean tall

00:25:42.679 --> 00:25:45.769
razor varicose veins would be good but

00:25:44.059 --> 00:25:46.489
we passed up varicose veins especially

00:25:45.769 --> 00:25:49.070
if it gave us

00:25:46.489 --> 00:25:52.339
explosion immunity however we didn't get

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:53.479
those and then beyond that you might be

00:25:52.339 --> 00:25:54.950
saying why did you take crickets head

00:25:53.479 --> 00:25:58.059
well we already have a damage multiplier

00:25:54.950 --> 00:26:01.629
so that's that's the big reason there

00:25:58.059 --> 00:26:01.629
another per throat

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:09.100
it would have given us some damage but

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:10.870
not very much at all this is one of the

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:12.760
runs in like my history of playing this

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:16.740
game where I would be the most stunned

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:20.110
if we lost I would I would lose my mind

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:23.980
not out of anger more out of like how

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:27.640
did it happen it's unfathomable to me

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:34.720
that we could lose this the damage

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:37.240
output is just insane another gear a

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:41.770
room as well so check the devil deal

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:44.230
it's not good enough the gods give us a

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:48.880
spirit heart so you know don't don't

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:50.800
they say too hard can definitely buy a

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:52.660
free item is anything here worth buying

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:54.520
I mean you know something to be said

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:56.590
about the shears I guess piercing shots

00:26:54.520 --> 00:27:02.559
are shots are already basically piercing

00:26:56.590 --> 00:27:05.020
they live at least sure 2020 basically

00:27:02.559 --> 00:27:09.730
doubles our rate of fire well grab all

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:12.460
this you might say why not yera we don't

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:15.910
need it yet I've got so many greedy boys

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:19.110
over here $0.99 should still be

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:23.650
plausible am i maybe not my play for

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:26.920
there we go my play Ferrara is actually

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:29.200
to like donate a little on the next

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:31.330
floor and then hopefully yera

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.309
money that's on the ground and get a

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:35.620
bunch out of it but whether it works or

00:27:33.309 --> 00:27:38.880
not remains to be seen but also doesn't

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:38.880
really matter that much

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:47.420
it'll quite probably Jam before $0.99 to

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.420
begin with

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:56.670
now we're not really actually I was

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.290
gonna I was gonna say we're not really

00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:00.420
taking out his HP that quickly but we

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:03.150
really are but the real strength beyond

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:04.740
that is he can't summon anything because

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:06.630
anytime he brings down coins they're

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:15.240
gonna be dead you know before they even

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:18.030
know what hit him so it's very nice for

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:19.500
us that our first fight against super

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:21.360
greed was actually like our easiest

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:30.860
fight against greed since restarting the

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:34.220
the series here he has a second face I

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:34.220
totally forgot

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:42.750
it's probably been like a good few

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:46.260
months since I did a greedier mode run

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:47.340
so I have to learn these patterns all

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.680
over again I remember having some

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:53.580
problems with greedier like apparently

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:56.790
the number one technique for greedier is

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:58.800
you just stay in the corner and then

00:28:56.790 --> 00:29:00.540
when he jumps resist your temptation to

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:03.510
go exactly where he just was like I just

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:06.180
did it's like learned muscle memory when

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:09.150
monstro jumps you go to underwear he

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:12.320
just was because he's never jump in

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:12.320
there you know you're gonna be safe

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:22.180
when superduper 100% really for real

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:24.970
this time guys greed gets mad it might

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:26.200
not be that applicable I suppose the d1

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:29.650
has appeared in the basement there's

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:38.140
value there can these tears just be gone

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:41.620
please regard the era took us literally

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:45.280
to 100 cents but our donation she's

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:46.630
definitely at 866 so the greed machine

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:48.040
is carried over so I don't think we did

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:49.900
the wrong thing here by playing greedy

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:52.930
or mode plus we had a fun run like

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:54.820
genuinely these don't always happen the

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:57.840
loss now holds holy mantle but who is

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:59.950
the lost I have no idea

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:03.070
sometimes greed or greedy or can be a

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:04.810
slog not this time it was a it was a lot

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:07.630
of fun we tailored our run nicely and it

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:14.140
can't complain so we can actually get it

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:23.860
to like 970 something right here of

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:30.930
which I cannot complain but I would like

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:36.280
for you to please allow me to bulk

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:42.220
donate charities would get much less of

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:49.260
poured if Penny's worth the unit of

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:55.690
currency that they accept it exclusively

00:30:49.260 --> 00:31:01.030
this is bordering on TD young one day we

00:30:55.690 --> 00:31:05.050
all will die and um I won't be thinking

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:10.980
fondly of the time I pumped sent after

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:17.230
sent into the arbitrarily machine

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:19.920
restricted that was big though posted is

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:19.920
coming together

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:32.750
he needs bottom-left mega satan he needs

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:34.279
far-right which is the lamb and he needs

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:36.380
void which is the stuff around the

00:31:34.279 --> 00:31:39.769
outside which I think like yeah maggie

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:40.549
has weirdly enough and Eve but for now

00:31:39.769 --> 00:31:41.539
