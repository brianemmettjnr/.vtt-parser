00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.100
hey everybody welcome back to northern

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.649
lion places binding of issac after earth

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.889
plus I just like we got progress as

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.139
lilith the world is good i guess we'll

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.030
do some grete apollyon you might be

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.730
saying NL mix it up these green mode

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.980
runs the too easy for an eyes a player

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.359
of your stature and I say first off

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.859
you're too kind is very nice of you

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.269
people tell me that all the time and I

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.140
appreciate it but I always say stop

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:32.520
you're too kind people have never told

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.170
me that uh I got to think about this we

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.910
have to buy the item in order to suck it

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.879
up so we need some money to get keys and

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.410
then we're good okay okay um in fact

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.969
let's step on this right away so we can

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.950
buy a key and get into the item room and

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.149
then we'll see where the world goes from

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.750
there even though it costs us a little

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.960
bit that's okay I don't want to do greed

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.739
after greedier because I worried that I

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.719
won't know if I've done greedier sorry I

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.780
worry that I won't know if I've done

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.739
greed if I can't see it that easily you

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.680
know what I mean like greed manifests as

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.470
the the sent icon on the posted note and

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.640
then greedier puts a red outline around

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.130
it so I think that I would rather do

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.780
greed first on everybody just so I know

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.100
or at least on every individual

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.330
character just so I know that I've

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.119
already done it before so that's like

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.220
the most boring plausible tangent to

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.220
begin an episode of Isaac with but you

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.220
get the general gist of it I don't want

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.590
to just I don't want to make a mistake

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.750
with my planning that is gonna manifest

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.079
in me being like why don't I have the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.049
psalm locked 20 years into the series

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.500
here I also do need to acquiesce that we

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.200
did an Eden run no wait I didn't Azazel

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.390
run on the show today on the N LSS and I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.600
unlocked Abaddon because I'm a silly boy

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.009
who forgot that this is not a 100% save

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.920
file so I was getting different stuff

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.180
versus the average run but anyway so

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.420
Abaddonn is unlocked

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.369
Abaddon could show up if not on this run

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.930
then and on you know some run in the

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.420
near future that was a great little

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.700
deflection there credit where credit is

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.770
due you know I always say real

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.290
recognizer

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.080
and I am recognizing I am recognizance

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.440
at right now does that work is that the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:25.970
expression make any sense not to you to

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:33.350
the dictionary of course we're at 16

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:37.000
cents so I'm gonna buy a bomb not every

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:41.600
M not everybody's favorite choice

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.960
dealing with a little lingering sickness

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.760
here it did work though so we got up to

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.340
we got a little bit of HP which is very

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.980
important we got 22 cents out of it as

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.990
well I love the idea of buying a cheap

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.980
hivemind unfortunately it doesn't help

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:03.110
us out that much right now but I think

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:09.350
we should still get it we also should

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:10.970
know where the secret room is because of

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.410
dogtooth I guess it's it must be

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.230
adjacent to the room at the bottom oh

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:21.710
dude half price pay to play is amazing

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:23.450
and then mr. musics not really pay to

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.100
play now means that we don't have to buy

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.720
keys anymore which is really really

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.120
useful for us also it gave us enough

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.650
money to buy maybe two items we might

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.580
want to consider there's like some game

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:41.390
theory like probabilistic stuff to run

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:43.370
would we like to buy mr. musics which I

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.630
forgot the actual like literal canonical

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.280
name oh so that's one thing in the Pro

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.570
column I can maybe remember its name

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.400
from this point onwards cut me some

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:54.020
slack it was added in a semi recent

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.300
booster pack we could have the item as

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.670
part of our arsenal

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.350
thanks to void even though I think using

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.800
it once every now and then is not worth

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.630
like anything at all really and we could

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.950
get another half-price item which might

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.750
be where in fact we can get to half

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.500
priced items cuz we're at 21 cents right

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:17.870
now I always say like you don't want to

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:20.180
buy like question marks cuz a question

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.739
mark is only or with chaos in particular

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.480
you don't want to like take a deal with

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.890
the devil item most of the time because

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.270
the deal with the devil items cost you

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.430
HP whereas you could always get them in

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.590
the shop anyway the difference here in

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.030
this situation is that everything is

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.270
half priced so I kind of think it's

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.370
worth buying a crappy item and it did

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.420
give a starter deck which is quite good

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:44.500
actually along with the goz and the

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.910
sprinkler so I think we will take void

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.800
it'd be nice to get the d20 but it's not

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.210
plausible and will suck up these two

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.040
items that are gonna do anything oh we

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.240
could have stolen something probably not

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.750
the d20 because we couldn't have sucked

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.430
it up anyway but um yeah so we can use

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.590
that to steal an item so actually every

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.080
time we use this is worth like 15 cents

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.030
I suppose we could use it endlessly to

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.300
steal battery charges over and over if

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.460
that would even work but just something

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.140
to note I'm gonna hold the goz we could

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.170
suck up starter deck or something we got

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:20.180
the creative juices of the green mode

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:21.770
flowing right now not that apollyon is

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.300
like the most difficult character to

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.430
rock with in greed mode to begin with

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.930
but got an easy setup here we actually

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.030
had a really really good first floor

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.550
like the halo is obviously a good pickup

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.230
and probably kept us alive and then

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.630
dogtooth on top of that I think it's a

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.010
little overrated at least for greed mode

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.230
because secret rooms are not that

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.760
plentiful they're hard to get to and you

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.410
don't always have bombs unless you buy

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.480
them I'll take out these color this is

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.670
why we bought hive mind so that that

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.010
could have a chance and then we'll try

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:52.250
just you've got a little bit of capital

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:54.020
here the one-cent is actually great to

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:58.340
start with because it means that we can

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:00.170
go to our our item room yeah there is a

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.640
secret room here so we can go to our

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.590
item room right off the bat on the next

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.390
floor for one cent instead of having to

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.490
spend five cents on a key or you know

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.710
wait until we get enough money to go in

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.960
in the first place so we'll use our

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.660
penny and we get butt bombs which are

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.900
probably but there's a secret room in

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:21.860
here as well probably worth taking so I

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:24.950
will take and then I'll try up here that

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.230
might have been slightly off it wasn't

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.840
okay lucky yes we got a half red

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:33.470
hartford effectively one bomb which is a

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.870
pretty bad deal and coming to our cursed

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.650
room here one copy item we didn't get it

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.630
but one copy i

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.750
would have been like an unbelievable

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:44.210
turn around so there is blank card I

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:48.680
can't help but notice we also got the

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:57.410
coupon the coupon can be used over and

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:59.509
over so I think we want to get the

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.240
batteries charged hear me out here

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:05.660
you're gonna grab the battery charge for

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:08.449
free you're gonna use this to steal

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:11.090
blank card and coupon got sucked up it

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:12.440
do not steal it we're still gonna get

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.210
the money and we're still gonna take

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:18.979
blank card cuz blank card the gauze is

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:25.990
like unstoppable it's extremely good as

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:25.990
a bad Dodger my apart also not very good

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:32.389
in the end I I do want to use sprinkler

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:34.849
but we can we can wait to use sprinkler

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:37.759
until like our fire rate and you know

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:39.590
tear bonus and etc etc tear the stats I

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:42.410
should say are good tear effects that's

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:44.360
the word I use I gotta admit if I'm

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.340
playing bad Isaac today like it this

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.740
room has been pretty terrible but also

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:54.250
on the LSS I was just I was playing like

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:54.250
straight garbage I don't understand how

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:59.210
the the stealing works with this item

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.010
but sometimes it seems to work and

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.930
sometimes it doesn't I don't know if

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:06.010
it's I don't like dice rolls in my eyes

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:08.780
at gun less there's a literal dice but

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:11.389
maybe there's coin flips maybe they want

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:13.360
to they want to massage it that way we

00:08:11.389 --> 00:08:16.280
could use a little bit more on the

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.800
damaged side I'll admit decent rate of

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:21.370
fire HP is okay and luckily we keep

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:28.520
getting more after trading some away but

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:31.010
good sauce could certainly use a little

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:34.219
bit more damage a little bit more DPS in

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:35.750
general actually but dole make me buy

00:08:34.219 --> 00:08:37.719
something no no this is okay because

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:41.020
we'll buy blank card

00:08:37.719 --> 00:08:45.470
we'll use blank card with the guys and

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:47.150
then we will grab the void suck up blank

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:48.970
card which will also use the gauze once

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:51.310
so we're safe there

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:54.240
and it also used the coupon and it also

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:57.580
stole spelunker set for me so we got a

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:59.770
key out of that this got High Priestess

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:01.540
ends Poloncarz hat but when it steals

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:03.130
the item it's gone forever so we can't

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:07.090
actually replenish it so there is like a

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:09.570
mild negative associated I saw an enemy

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:12.970
I didn't like and I used High Priestess

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:17.710
very okay with that sure could be a

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:19.030
blank card High Priestess absolutely so

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:22.870
we actually have to be careful with the

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:24.490
the theft but the end of that

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.950
conversation by the way was gonna be

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:29.160
that I'm much more of a blank card the

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:32.140
gauze fan than a blank card

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.660
High Priestess fan but I got to admit as

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:38.440
I take 80 years to kill this champion

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:42.010
version of people doesn't seem so bad no

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:45.690
neuro watched it that second bomb could

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:50.020
have saved us a lot of time instead

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:53.440
champion peep and me 12 rounds all he

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:56.440
does is jump not sure if that's merciful

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:58.360
or punishment because he spends about a

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:02.830
third of his time not being able to be

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:04.240
hurt I really thought we were safe but I

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:06.190
shouldn't have just stood there you got

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:09.690
to break your own slump here NL you're

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:12.280
playing like garbage for no reason

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:14.890
it's not even laziness which as we've

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.750
said many times is like Oh reason you

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:18.310
get a benefit out of laziness you get no

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:21.580
benefit out of just taking damage like

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:25.990
an idiot do not like paying attention

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:28.860
properly that's one of my pet peeves is

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:31.390
when people are like you know they've

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:33.700
got to calculate a tip or something and

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:35.590
they're like what's 15% of 22 when they

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.520
go I'm not even gonna try you know you

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:38.260
haven't doing anything else you're

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:40.230
sitting here at the restaurant might as

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:42.580
well work on the old noggin and try to

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.720
you know work it out like I mean we will

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:48.280
work it out right now with the

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:51.400
transitive property 10% of 22 is 2.25

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:52.990
percent is half of that it's 1.1 a 15%

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.550
tip would be three dollars and 30 cents

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:56.650
there you go see you know you might be

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:57.880
saying why is he so slow with that well

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:59.020
that's because I'm doing commentary on

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.600
the side you might be saying why is he

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.930
so fast at that that's just cuz I as you

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.200
know it

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:06.580
an only child i amused myself you know

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.740
you don't have a brother or sister to

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:12.070
pinch you and and pull your hair well at

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:15.850
last so instead i had to do arithmetic

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:17.410
in my head when you say it like that it

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:19.570
makes it sound like I live with tortured

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:23.050
life but that's not really the case and

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:24.700
I'd rather have acumen and arithmetic

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:27.130
than a family member with whom to share

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:29.470
experiences with for the rest of my life

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:31.209
for anything okay but not that's not

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.380
being ridiculous first off I have you

00:11:31.209 --> 00:11:34.600
know seven hundred and something

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:36.250
thousand of you and then also I'm

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.529
married and I have two cats so I got

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:39.430
more than enough social interaction on

00:11:38.529 --> 00:11:43.779
that level for sure

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:45.490
okay that's BS that's actually unfair

00:11:43.779 --> 00:11:47.620
what you've done to me there and so was

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:48.610
that so I have to use the gauze I don't

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:52.779
see a way out

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:55.240
apart from that Krampus is annoying in

00:11:52.779 --> 00:11:57.180
that there are almost sometimes if your

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:59.500
damage isn't high enough when you

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.760
seriously just cannot avoid taking

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.830
damage from him because he doesn't

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.390
Telegraph the direction he shoots so

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:06.970
that's a big loss for us we take a lump

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:09.220
of coal we're just out down in the next

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:12.190
floor with a modest damage boost from

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:14.980
lump of coal and we'll probably peep the

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:19.060
shop first because we could spend

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:24.310
fifteen cents right off the bat here do

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:28.779
we want to I mean there is HP Meccano

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:33.640
haggle eyes neither are amazingly useful

00:12:28.779 --> 00:12:35.740
for us we could suck that up and make it

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.330
a stat upgrade which is almost tempting

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:39.190
but why would you suck it up but you can

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:42.700
get an item for free from the shop you

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:45.700
know belly button has given us blind

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.520
rage which is not bad I'm gonna check

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:50.470
this we got HP now so we can afford to

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:53.490
there is a secret room adjacent here but

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:53.490
we can't do anything about that

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:59.730
okay steal me the Cuba meet please

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:08.230
thank you it also gave me a key for free

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:10.870
which is not worth very much I'll tell

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:12.430
you what I'll buy the HP we're gonna

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:19.390
need it at some point we haven't quite

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:20.440
reached like breaking levels here you

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.940
know what I'm thinking though I was

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.590
looking at those rooms and I was like if

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:26.710
we can just get blank card ierra we're

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:28.720
like we got unlimited money and that's

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:30.820
important because we're trying to you

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.340
know give this donation machine in a

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:35.320
good state as well so it turns out that

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.310
we probably will not need blank card

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.130
hoggle oz here

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:41.980
that did the damage dude but I actually

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:43.990
there's at least there's a productive

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:50.740
reason for some of this damage now and

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:53.350
it rhymes with shmoop Amin Cuba meeting

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:58.020
jr. now David joke doesn't make any

00:13:53.350 --> 00:14:01.270
sense that was very risky but I believed

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:03.010
and I've been acquiesced as a result I

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:05.140
don't think we care about using the

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:07.390
sprinkler like right off the bat there's

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:11.800
math to be done like basic arithmetic if

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:14.080
we use a charge right off the bat do we

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:16.090
get a second charge like use the charge

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:18.640
in this room fight every single way from

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:20.230
wave zero onwards do we get a second

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.850
charge by the end of the deals with the

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:23.950
devil that we could use in the shop the

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:30.040
answer has gotta be yes there I can't

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:37.330
believe that it wouldn't be I mean you

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:39.370
could steal me the speed upgrade I think

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:41.530
maybe he just dies before he gets to the

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:43.090
item because I'm not placing it properly

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:47.680
I will take a liberty cap as well I

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:49.600
figured like why not have him steal

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.010
items and then we can spend money on

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.450
anything else or we can actually just

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:53.680
save it for donation machines in the

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:55.120
future the problem is that they don't

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.650
replenish but we don't have enough money

00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:00.490
to care about them replenishing anyway

00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:02.200
so feel like that's a relatively minor

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:05.710
loss and the whole scheme of things

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:07.180
that's very good so I think the way I'm

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:11.590
looking at this run right now is I could

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:14.110
really use an item that gives us HP

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:15.460
randomly like a gimpy payout or

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:17.980
something like that or even just the red

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:19.720
hearts from gimpy we could use another

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:21.100
de gAHS room and I squandered the last

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.440
one but I also kind of feel like that

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.940
one was a little out of my control

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.070
although I probably could have avoided

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:29.170
taking the damage before Krampus that

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:31.000
caused me to be in a bad spot on Krampus

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:34.410
you know an ounce of prevention is where

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.410
the pound of cure is what they say

00:15:38.889 --> 00:15:45.620
and I say could you please make that

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.420
into the metric system because your

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:49.510
metaphor does not make sense to 98

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:51.339
percent of the world as a result of your

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:54.529
unincluded

00:15:51.339 --> 00:15:59.720
naming system here so we have but bombs

00:15:54.529 --> 00:16:01.579
that are also poison or toxic bombs each

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:07.639
one of these bombs is actually very very

00:16:01.579 --> 00:16:10.040
potent if only through aggregates so I'm

00:16:07.639 --> 00:16:11.149
gonna give as many of these as it's

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.160
necessary to get through this here I

00:16:11.149 --> 00:16:16.670
think that worked out very well I deal

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:21.470
with the devil is pretty much garbage so

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:22.459
we're just gonna abandon it yeah yeah

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:24.350
that's what it comes down to I don't

00:16:22.459 --> 00:16:26.329
need to speed upgrade from 1.4 I

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:28.190
apologize we're a little like commentary

00:16:26.329 --> 00:16:32.029
focused here but this is actually not

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:35.899
like a 12 out of 10 run so I gotta I

00:16:32.029 --> 00:16:37.970
gotta think things through here as we

00:16:35.899 --> 00:16:40.730
get a little bit closer to the end here

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:43.010
so we don't know what this is sister

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:45.139
Maggie there's a two secret rooms here

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:46.610
oh no no there must be like a crawl

00:16:45.139 --> 00:16:49.430
space or something because the dog went

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:53.120
off off we want to protect that at all

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:54.949
costs so it's not there I will probably

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:58.310
buy bombs to find the crawlspace if

00:16:54.949 --> 00:17:00.709
necessary speedball it's okay but it's

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:02.959
not very good and we don't know what any

00:17:00.709 --> 00:17:06.140
of these items are so you know part of

00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:07.819
my brain is going save money part of my

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.410
brain is going just steal it when you

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:11.030
get a charge and I think that that part

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:16.549
of the brain is gonna win out I feel

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:18.110
like we have to peep this I don't think

00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:22.669
a hug allows is that good so it becomes

00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:25.880
what's more valuable death or pacano

00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:27.970
even with hive mind we're gonna use two

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:32.990
of clubs every time so I think we got it

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:35.900
we got to go I think I think it doesn't

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:37.309
matter I think maybe the death card is

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.750
better than Burke ah no because we can

00:17:37.309 --> 00:17:40.610
use it to clear out a lot of enemies

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:42.590
whereas Baccano is only ever gonna give

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:44.750
us these flies it's not a great synergy

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:47.779
like once every six rooms to pop off

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:49.729
there so we're definitely going to roll

00:17:47.779 --> 00:17:51.320
two of clubs because once we get over

00:17:49.729 --> 00:17:53.269
like a certain number of bombs we're

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:57.349
actually completely set and I'm gonna

00:17:53.269 --> 00:17:58.909
test my my arithmetic here I think we

00:17:57.349 --> 00:18:01.489
have enough rooms to get another charge

00:17:58.909 --> 00:18:05.330
before the shop can get one item for

00:18:01.489 --> 00:18:06.469
free and if we can get 99 bombs out of

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:08.450
this all of a sudden I think we got a

00:18:06.469 --> 00:18:10.820
much better chance offensively than we

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:12.469
had previously plus it's a good chance

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:16.989
to use sprinkler an item that I actually

00:18:12.469 --> 00:18:20.029
like in terms of like theming like a lot

00:18:16.989 --> 00:18:21.559
not always a perfect choice and I think

00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:27.349
that's that's part of what makes it real

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:28.929
cool we may die here endeavor not to its

00:18:27.349 --> 00:18:38.119
creep dude enemies with creep are the

00:18:28.929 --> 00:18:40.549
the worst okay we're safe sadly I think

00:18:38.119 --> 00:18:44.450
I got to leave this sprinkler go buy

00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:46.789
some HP even though believe you me I

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:49.399
would rather not to Malthus games has

00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:51.679
signed on to play divinity original sin

00:18:49.399 --> 00:18:56.529
Matt all you shouldn't I use the Bobby

00:18:51.679 --> 00:18:59.419
moron man that's you cheating on me

00:18:56.529 --> 00:19:01.609
we're in divinity original sin together

00:18:59.419 --> 00:19:05.119
you're gonna go play you know five hours

00:19:01.609 --> 00:19:07.159
of it tonight spoil all the surprises

00:19:05.119 --> 00:19:11.469
that me and you can get into in our

00:19:07.159 --> 00:19:15.499
games just a terrible place to stand

00:19:11.469 --> 00:19:17.059
brains broken are there battery charge

00:19:15.499 --> 00:19:18.739
all we needed I guess is one battery

00:19:17.059 --> 00:19:20.929
charge on the shop as well and then

00:19:18.739 --> 00:19:22.429
we're in a great spot we also have

00:19:20.929 --> 00:19:24.950
coupon so we could actually get two free

00:19:22.429 --> 00:19:27.229
items battery charge no battery charge

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:31.909
well if there's no battery charge let's

00:19:27.229 --> 00:19:33.950
re-roll this no battery charge battery

00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:37.999
charge okay why is this important so we

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:39.679
double our bombs we get a free item we

00:19:37.999 --> 00:19:43.639
need to go deeper it's pretty pretty

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:46.219
much trash what is this mr. Dahle where

00:19:43.639 --> 00:19:48.429
did that come from I don't know but I'm

00:19:46.219 --> 00:19:50.450
not gonna ask questions grab this I

00:19:48.429 --> 00:19:53.960
wonder if our reroll machine would

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:56.570
refresh all these items two of clubs has

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:58.849
been used again we got something for

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:59.779
free it's a red heart not bad and we got

00:19:58.849 --> 00:20:03.129
another thing for free

00:19:59.779 --> 00:20:03.129
our lair came from

00:20:04.879 --> 00:20:10.620
it does refresh it okay so then we don't

00:20:08.279 --> 00:20:12.000
have a battery charge so we may want to

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.039
buy something but we might want to wait

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.289
until we just get another battery charge

00:20:14.039 --> 00:20:21.000
I think car batteries a little bit of a

00:20:16.289 --> 00:20:22.139
dangerous one not that any of this

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.779
really helped

00:20:22.139 --> 00:20:26.610
so we'll buy this and it's two of spades

00:20:24.779 --> 00:20:28.200
we don't really need more keys I just

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:30.059
wanted to check we don't need to hold

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.379
the battery charge we didn't get quite

00:20:30.059 --> 00:20:33.840
as much out of this as I wanted to

00:20:31.379 --> 00:20:35.940
actually but we're in a better spot as a

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:40.019
result we kind of I think found the seam

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:43.200
that that can break this wide open just

00:20:40.019 --> 00:20:45.149
don't use bombs yet every bomb you don't

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.350
use now it's like cutting off a family

00:20:45.149 --> 00:20:48.120
tree it like your great-great

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:53.340
great-grandfather that dude could have

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:57.539
like 128 ancestors by now if it weren't

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:59.970
for the damn you know lumber mill not

00:20:57.539 --> 00:21:01.649
caring about workers rights so what we

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:03.299
got to do here is just anybody later you

00:21:01.649 --> 00:21:04.769
say that's too soon it's a fictionalized

00:21:03.299 --> 00:21:07.200
account of whatever I happen to learn

00:21:04.769 --> 00:21:09.240
doesn't go for mom excuse me sir I was

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.799
about to murder this guy I'm very

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:15.629
offended by the damage that I took there

00:21:10.799 --> 00:21:17.220
because I don't think I should I don't

00:21:15.629 --> 00:21:19.710
think I should have I should say but

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:23.490
it's playing cool here we're almost

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:27.259
almost almost at the the seem that you

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:29.220
know makes the world our oyster here

00:21:27.259 --> 00:21:30.929
make sure the two of clubs is your

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:33.889
active item there did we forget to do

00:21:30.929 --> 00:21:36.330
that like 10 times no I think we only

00:21:33.889 --> 00:21:39.350
that we only doubled twice in there so

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.350
that's correct

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:45.770
by the way lord knows I would love to

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:48.780
use bombs right now instead I'm gonna

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:51.240
force myself not to and instead I'm

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:54.419
gonna use Cuba meat not really that much

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.500
better but our stats are leaving a

00:21:54.419 --> 00:21:58.620
little bit to be desired

00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:00.809
four point two nine damage is not really

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:04.110
anything to write home about this late

00:22:00.809 --> 00:22:06.419
in the game which is why ninety nine

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:08.190
bombs are so important especially if we

00:22:06.419 --> 00:22:09.780
don't have to spend any money to get in

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:10.799
fact especially if we never have to

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:14.960
spend money cuz we're getting these

00:22:10.799 --> 00:22:16.919
handouts from from coupon and from

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:18.330
stealing an item from the shop every

00:22:16.919 --> 00:22:20.340
time which we should be paying more

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:22.200
attention to but my brain is apparently

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:25.200
I isn't broken right now need to warm up

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:27.419
again okay so we got it one more little

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:32.720
setup here and it's two of these boys

00:22:27.419 --> 00:22:40.230
this would be a really really good time

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:42.720
to use bombs they're not even spitting

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:44.789
out the enemies they normally spit out

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:47.780
that make them easier to kill so am I

00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:51.419
like am I missing something here

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:57.840
Mayans SuperDuper hard mode why are you

00:22:51.419 --> 00:22:59.970
so tanky rarely will I say this I think

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.200
this was not the right time for us to

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:03.419
care about a deal with the devil in

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:07.429
green mode so first I've used the death

00:23:03.419 --> 00:23:07.429
card that did almost nothing

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:21.270
but it did almost nothing to two of them

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:23.640
so almost nothing times two so what am i

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:25.470
complaining about this is this is broken

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:29.940
this is not right okay

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:34.620
eat my bombs no stop stop eating the

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:35.720
bombs actually oh my god well you know

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:39.000
what

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:40.830
we lived and I should really be

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.679
unbelievably thankful for that and I

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:45.120
assure you that I am there's no deal

00:23:43.679 --> 00:23:48.990
with the devil to be had anymore just

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:51.120
get the heck out of town that we were

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:52.890
not equipped to handle that not without

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.929
using cuba mean to like ridiculous

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:57.480
degrees anyway alright we got again we

00:23:54.929 --> 00:23:59.610
gotta get like fed here we found our

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:02.450
secret room i don't want to use bombs to

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:02.450
do it we got cat-o'-nine-tails

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:08.640
and get a rate of fire increased not

00:24:05.429 --> 00:24:10.980
quite good enough i think you buy

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:14.820
battery baby even though it's a little

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:16.830
pricey and the idea is battery baby will

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:19.230
allow us to double our bombs alive then

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:22.730
we use bob's rod net which i do not care

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:25.799
if we get that as part of oh that's

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:29.010
extremely good being able to have

00:24:25.799 --> 00:24:31.080
piercing shots here is like 10 out of 10

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:34.289
blank card judgment case to be made

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:37.230
admittedly now this is over aggressive

00:24:34.289 --> 00:24:38.730
you should not do this you got to sneak

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:41.010
in a few extra plays because of blind

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:42.529
rage but it's still not worth it never

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:46.669
do this if you're watching along at home

00:24:42.529 --> 00:24:46.669
it worked but never do it

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:53.180
it's not always piercing shots with the

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.290
razors maybe it's only occasionally

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:59.990
either way

00:24:54.290 --> 00:25:02.480
it's a situation that has improved our

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:05.950
situation fairly drastically here so we

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:08.660
want to blank card 2 of clubs always

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:10.580
we're not stealing anything we could

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:15.800
hurt enemies of mr. musics but it's not

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:18.290
that important just waiting for battery

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:22.210
baby to pay out and it did now if it can

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:27.260
start taking us to thank you

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:29.090
it can start taking us to 99 bombs I'm

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:31.490
very happy the sprinkler gets put down

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:33.800
on top of the shovel which is so

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:35.240
valuable because we don't want to

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.610
accidentally walk through that shovel

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:40.130
portal I've almost called it a shovel

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:44.240
hole and it just felt wrong so I think

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:46.550
is this various students very nice of us

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:48.770
to not have to accidentally have the

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:50.030
chance to fall in there so oh oh and

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:51.590
it's still closed you know we're in a

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:53.240
good spot ok so we're just gonna

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:55.790
continue to get charges here I think

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:58.040
when you start just like mainlining the

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:59.180
waves and greet mode you're set or at

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.190
least you're well on your way to being

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:04.130
set you know the world's your burrito

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:09.140
here so we are now like blow those up

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:10.760
please get anything got a card it's

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.980
another two of clubs which I'm just

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.570
gonna use to expedite our process here

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:17.390
even though it would be much more

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:21.100
valuable to use it a little later it

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:21.100
would also require some mental energy

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.400
things are going very well we're have

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:30.070
216 bombs

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:30.070
it's the doubling is happening so slowly

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:35.750
probably because I continue to use bombs

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:38.060
but the fight against the the double

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:40.430
carry and Queen I will never apologize

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:42.260
for trying to use bombs there we were

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.940
gonna be on that fight for 20 million

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:46.910
years we just Oh Guppies collar like a

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:49.940
great deal of thanks for resurrecting us

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:52.270
and saving me from a little bit of an

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:52.270
aptitude

00:26:53.850 --> 00:27:01.900
just kind of trash deals with the devil

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:05.530
except for guppy admittedly you know the

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:08.200
d20 is very good but I kind of feel like

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:08.530
we should just bounce like get out of

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.350
here

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:13.150
we got one more floor we can get good

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:15.280
stuff in the shop believe you me I'm not

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:19.450
really trying to save money so that we

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:22.360
can make you know super greed or when we

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:24.040
beat super greed we can donate so much

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:26.170
more to the the shop that's not a

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:30.370
donation machine it's not really my my

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:33.370
goal here let's just start by getting as

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:35.110
many doubling as we can my goal is is to

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:36.700
win this run and if we could donate more

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:41.380
then you know the more the merrier is

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:43.690
what they say but I'm not yet convinced

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:46.060
that word at the power level required to

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:49.860
beat him I think we got a good chance

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:49.860
and I think it's gotten better

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:58.720
but I'm not like ten out of ten

00:27:54.460 --> 00:28:00.190
convinced by the way a battery baby as

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:03.910
far as I'm concerned paid for itself

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:08.170
already just via the number of bombs

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:12.550
it's giving me we could probably afford

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:15.490
to give up after the next double because

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:18.310
we can just use two of clubs to get

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:19.870
$2.99 and I mean we could persistently

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:21.930
stay above that number but we're so

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:24.820
close to the end of the game it probably

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:27.280
is functionally the same you know we

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:28.690
don't need to worry about being above

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:34.090
that many bombs but anyway for now we

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:35.920
can start dumping them for free which is

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:41.100
why I'm gonna just continue to tackle

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:43.840
this here might as well throw bombs in

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:45.520
did those spelunkers headlight looks

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:51.030
jacked up on our head for whatever

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:51.030
reason that was very dumb of me

00:28:54.840 --> 00:29:00.120
oh there they are even if the bombs

00:28:57.090 --> 00:29:09.480
don't hit they can't not hit more or

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:12.240
less because of the cluster bomb but

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:19.440
bombs synergy I yeah I was I should not

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:20.850
be in this corner lucky yes and you know

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:24.150
we got sprinklers we might as well fight

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:25.020
the final wave here this is the annoying

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:28.590
one

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:38.970
every time battery baby just got us a

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:41.130
charge it seems fair we might just want

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:42.810
to buy out the stock of spirit arts like

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:47.340
it's not the most exciting way to finish

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:50.610
the game but I think it is a guaranteed

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:52.950
win where we got high priestess to a

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:55.140
hearts okay we can use 2 of hearts I

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:58.380
think we should take High Priestess with

00:29:55.140 --> 00:30:00.210
us ok double 2 of clubs if we use more

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:02.730
than 99 bombs against green something's

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:05.760
wrong we got two high priestess for the

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:09.180
greed fight and then whatever we can do

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:10.380
in here which has to start with rerolls

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:14.640
and we got to be careful cuz it's

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:15.600
cluster bombs and then we get a battery

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:18.230
charge here

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:20.670
so I think you get a battery charge

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:23.700
we've got stompy for free

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:26.550
please steel PhD for me thank you

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:28.800
you worked I was very good ok now that

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:30.810
we got that we got starter decks it's ok

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:34.440
that's actually excellent I think we

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:37.200
should grab the HP use 2 of diamonds

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:40.010
let's just grab that for simplicity sake

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:42.990
let's grab that for simplicity sake

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:46.620
then we're gonna buy the battery charge

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:49.700
we're gonna steal the HP and turn stompy

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:49.700
into a stat increase

00:30:50.759 --> 00:30:55.649
you stole on the HP and you know what we

00:30:53.759 --> 00:30:57.690
can turn the HP into a stat increase as

00:30:55.649 --> 00:31:00.029
well and if we feel like we don't need

00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:03.089
any more HP which i think is relatively

00:31:00.029 --> 00:31:06.690
fair but first why don't we reroll

00:31:03.089 --> 00:31:11.009
everything on this show I'll even do

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:13.349
with money what do I care I don't think

00:31:11.009 --> 00:31:15.479
we really care about this one so let's

00:31:13.349 --> 00:31:17.969
just move I don't think we really care

00:31:15.479 --> 00:31:19.349
about this one this amount of money

00:31:17.969 --> 00:31:21.359
shouldn't make much of a macro

00:31:19.349 --> 00:31:28.619
difference all right so that's the end

00:31:21.359 --> 00:31:31.849
of that do me a favor and steal let me

00:31:28.619 --> 00:31:31.849
steal squeezy

00:31:33.349 --> 00:31:38.549
we aren't under the tear cap we got to

00:31:35.789 --> 00:31:40.829
spear at hearts we don't want clicker

00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:46.109
wheel of fortune we're just gonna blow

00:31:40.829 --> 00:31:49.109
up and I'll buy the card the card is two

00:31:46.109 --> 00:31:52.619
of hearts I think we should be fine with

00:31:49.109 --> 00:31:55.799
High Priestess eye priestess and then

00:31:52.619 --> 00:31:59.629
we'll just bounce yeah yeah let's let's

00:31:55.799 --> 00:32:02.699
get out of here so it's been like a long

00:31:59.629 --> 00:32:06.299
greed mode run it's because I never

00:32:02.699 --> 00:32:08.519
really felt particularly safe here I

00:32:06.299 --> 00:32:10.319
would love to get another charge if we

00:32:08.519 --> 00:32:12.499
can get another charge I'd be a happy

00:32:10.319 --> 00:32:12.499
camper

00:32:13.069 --> 00:32:17.879
that way we could actually use sprinkler

00:32:15.959 --> 00:32:20.279
but I don't think it's an enormous

00:32:17.879 --> 00:32:22.529
concern got a little bit of money back

00:32:20.279 --> 00:32:26.909
here you might as well just dump High

00:32:22.529 --> 00:32:28.889
Priestess like get rid of that one get

00:32:26.909 --> 00:32:30.089
rid of that one it's not quite as good

00:32:28.889 --> 00:32:32.879
as I thought it would be I'll just tell

00:32:30.089 --> 00:32:36.869
you that right off the bed neither is

00:32:32.879 --> 00:32:39.059
our damage by the way and there's our

00:32:36.869 --> 00:32:41.639
battery charge okay like just dump some

00:32:39.059 --> 00:32:43.589
bombs in here first before you use this

00:32:41.639 --> 00:32:45.839
just so you can get like maximum value

00:32:43.589 --> 00:32:47.050
probably overly concerned with it but

00:32:45.839 --> 00:32:48.850
that's okay

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:49.840
maybe we shouldn't use the other high

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:52.210
priestess because we could have gotten

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:53.680
like infinity versions of them but

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:59.740
that's a look mr. meeseeks brought me a

00:32:53.680 --> 00:33:04.420
penny thank you I'm not like

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:07.570
accidentally in greedy or am I just feel

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:10.480
like our stats are okay but the the

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:12.640
damage I'm doing is not as much as I

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:18.250
would normally expect I'm very happy to

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:21.250
have these 99 cluster bombs almost dodge

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:22.180
right into it bad habit either way it

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:24.160
looks like we're gonna come through in

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:26.290
the clutch here but this was uh this is

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:28.000
a tactical game more tactical than I

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:29.800
usually have to be anyway maybe again

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.380
it's cuz you probably have to be a

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:36.550
little smarter the worse you play and I

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:37.810
didn't play that well it's a testament

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:41.590
to the quality of the seed that we're

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:44.860
still in here now back to the 99 bombs

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:52.080
put down another sprinkler somehow did

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:54.550
not get hurt by that explosion bombs

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:56.290
irritate me about 0% if you could just

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:59.970
make those instead of anything else I'd

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:59.970
be acquiesced

00:34:04.809 --> 00:34:09.629
I think if we just drop enough bombs we

00:34:07.659 --> 00:34:11.859
can keep him from making the keys here

00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:14.079
it's like snacking all day instead of

00:34:11.859 --> 00:34:17.310
eating a big meal turns out that you

00:34:14.079 --> 00:34:19.990
know not recommended by many doctors but

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:21.369
at the same time if against the job done

00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:23.200
in a pinch you know when I moved to

00:34:21.369 --> 00:34:26.319
South Korea didn't really speak the

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:29.020
language I'll admit I might have had a

00:34:26.319 --> 00:34:30.700
can of beer some Bologna and Pringles

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:34.540
for dinner more than once in that first

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:37.329
week or so it speaks more probably to my

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:38.950
school's failure to integrate me right

00:34:37.329 --> 00:34:41.349
after I landed in the middle of a long

00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:43.210
weekend but you know everybody they got

00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:44.829
their own things to take care of I know

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:46.329
I don't disagree with that

00:34:44.829 --> 00:34:47.679
you know what if I'm being honest I kind

00:34:46.329 --> 00:34:52.569
of liked it it was nice to have an

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:57.240
excuse to have a Pringles lunch maybe

00:34:52.569 --> 00:34:57.240
not four days in a row but hey you know

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:06.120
please just be gone what a medieval word

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:07.560
that's a tangent for a future episode

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:10.560
Navy okay

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:14.700
Brown nugget is not good but we did

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:17.130
succeed here and our donation counter is

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:19.560
reset so we are like good to go here 400

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:21.060
since we gotta get it to explode so

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:22.860
we're approaching that a halfway point

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:23.310
and it looks pretty likely we will cross

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:27.410
it

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:30.650
well no no half of 999 is not 450 that's

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:36.660
500 basically Oh

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:39.090
sexually for other 99.5 well you need to

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:40.470
put 1000 cents into it now that I think

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:43.770
about it so you know what I was right in

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:46.740
the first place either way this was like

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:50.370
the most tactical we've no holds razor

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:53.040
blade is extremely important this was a

00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:54.240
an actually like tactical greed mode run

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.290
I had a good time trying to figure out

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.670
the puzzle here and figure out how to

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:58.440
make it happen instead of just like oh

00:35:56.670 --> 00:36:00.180
we got chaos were copy we steamrolled

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:01.740
not that I would kick that kind of

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:04.710
rudder out of bed for eating crackers

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:06.390
you know what I mean but all right we're

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:08.550
free to go I don't think we can blow up

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:09.660
anything else so I will escape and

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:11.280
