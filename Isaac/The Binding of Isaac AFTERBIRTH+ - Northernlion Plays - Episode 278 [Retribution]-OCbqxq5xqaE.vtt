00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.270
everybody welcome enter on line please

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.670
binding of issac address plus hey what's

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.090
that negative one win streak I am

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.969
building a dossier by the way you didn't

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.080
miss any runs for four NL for four NL

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.330
more like q q NL j76 for um just

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.800
god-awful starting stats but this is

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.789
irrespective of what I was going to

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.070
bring up anyway which is I'm building a

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.230
dossier for my conspiracy theory that

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.019
they've just like made every enemy tank

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.850
here in this game just watch the run

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.559
with a non-biased mind that's all I ask

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.379
watch it with the idea that there is you

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.270
know what we can do this that there

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.820
might be not that there is that there

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.850
might have been a change recently in

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.980
Isaac that amped up the amount of damage

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.199
that enemies were able to take I feel

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.780
like over the course of the past week

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.190
have I played terribly there have been

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.930
some runs that have been pretty bad I

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.270
mean some of the dailies in particular

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.059
just had like no chance but I'm starting

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.330
to I'm starting to feel like Wynonna

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.420
rider in stranger things man like these

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.220
enemies didn't use to take this long to

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.520
kill this run is already a bad example

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.740
and I want to be fair to the game first

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.390
off their games they want a passion to

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.130
make it harder that's fine I'm just

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.990
saying I'm starting to put together the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.909
pieces that this might be an Arg for

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.170
which you know where all the victims

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.610
basically but mostly me three dollar

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.780
bills helping us out a lot here we did

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.229
just come off a run in which we were

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.450
invincible but even that run felt like a

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.030
little underpowered or a mine maybe I'm

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.229
losing my my disc just keep your eyes

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.729
peeled I'm going to focus on the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.079
commentary I'm going to focus on staying

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.560
alive which has never been more

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.049
difficult I think the booster pack might

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.229
have changed something I know that rest

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.899
assured we've talked about the Mandela

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.570
effect okay that was not my fire so that

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.030
idea but we've talked about the Mandela

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.979
effect on the NL SS before and both Nick

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.409
and I are of the opinion that is I mean

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.240
no offense men but like I'm going to say

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.910
a word that's going to offend you if

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.090
you're a belief first to Mandela effect

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.420
but I think it's idiotic and the idea

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.130
that the whole

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.349
universe must must have changed because

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.250
you miss remembered something is very

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:23.590
egotistical however I'm asking you to

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.180
buy into my Mandela effect right now I

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.030
can understand why you would be hesitant

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.440
just play some Isaac for yourself if you

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.140
a lot of people probably watch these

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:39.480
episodes don't play the game themselves

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:42.640
anymore that's fine yeah I got no no

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.690
problem with that whatsoever just place

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.130
some Isaac yourself you're probably

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.140
watching this and going man and Al's

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.720
been playing pretty bad lately maybe

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.459
you've been playing yourself and going

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.530
you know and held still playing pretty

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.540
bad lately and the game has not changed

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.010
I just want somebody get out the spider

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.299
mod if you're interested if you're not

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.850
don't let me waste your time if you're

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.430
interested get out the spider mod get

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:07.540
out the cheat engine figure out what

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.870
happened are these enemies they the same

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.549
level of tankiness that they used to be

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.769
because something don't feel right in my

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.510
world anyway I'm going to use forget me

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.570
now and I'm going to focus on now the

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.950
run starts over I've got personal loss

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.750
on the first floor so we can't afford to

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.070
go to our curse room and we got the Arab

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.019
which I will not

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.140
in all likelihood hold until the end of

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.000
the run this run by the way if we're

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.910
evaluating it at least the HP is good

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:40.540
and three dollar bill can get us out of

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:42.579
some jams but you know real talk we got

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.370
a serious problem with our damage and we

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.200
got a serious problem with our with our

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.150
tears and those are like the two most

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.840
important stats once your HP is above

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.390
zero which it obviously is so this is

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.850
one in which I would not expect to be

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.140
able to make it the boss rush it's weird

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.420
to say that on the first floor I mean we

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.730
did do the first floor twice but the

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.630
idea is I also had no keys so it seemed

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.000
like a sensible approach I know I keep

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.700
coming back to this but I made a poll on

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.250
Twitter and the poll was like you know

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.229
has Isaac gotten harder or the poll just

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.169
said what happened but then selection

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:22.720
one was has Isaac gotten harder or have

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.849
I gotten worse seventy-five percent of

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.860
people said I got worse that's the

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:31.330
overwhelming majority

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.680
if you had that on a ski audience

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.300
approval by the way I'm not offended by

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.580
this I'm aware of my performance lately

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.659
but if you had that on ask the audience

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.259
and Wants to Be a Millionaire

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:43.000
you would be like I'm going with a I

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:45.069
would have to I would have to be an

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.080
idiot to you know go against the

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:54.099
audience on this example right here and

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:57.490
yet I find myself mendel it man not you

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:58.870
know unjustly thrown in prison it's

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.789
going to be really bad for a rate of

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:06.129
fire but flippin sweet for dealing

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:07.020
damage but rather all Jesus it still

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:10.120
works

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.469
but rather just thinking am I the only

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.979
one living in this alternate universe

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:18.370
where it's every enemy and Isaac is

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:20.740
quintuple the HP they used to have just

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.629
just think about it's all I'm asking all

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.250
I'm asking you to do is do the research

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:26.710
and if you don't agree with me then just

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.409
keep your mouth shut if you do agree

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:33.339
with me singing from the highest point

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:41.500
you can find now Kilimanjaro if you got

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:43.569
it now if they really if the conspiracy

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.659
theory is out in full force they will

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:49.659
give me the greatest run of all time

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:53.259
here to deflect you know keep the elites

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:56.620
happy and then you know they'll spread

00:05:53.259 --> 00:06:00.069
the kool-aid to the masses right I don't

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:02.589
know what I'm talking about or to why

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:05.050
I'm this is starting to border it is

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:10.449
crossing the border line from satire

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:13.680
into genuine illness so let's just kill

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:16.199
this enemy who is totally not angry fly

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:21.849
in different proportions

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:25.419
please Lord a tears upgrade even more so

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:27.129
than a damage upgrade right now the

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:29.759
widow is like one of the you know

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:32.199
famously one of the least tanky bosses

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:35.310
number one when it shows up as an

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:35.310
enormous helper

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.730
six minutes to get through the first

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.010
floor but is the first floor for a

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.630
second time

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.370
give me an orbital or something okay

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.320
tears up shots me down I can live it

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.580
that is a unless three dollar bill

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:57.750
rolled over to something else at the

00:06:51.580 --> 00:07:00.400
same time as a 34 tears up pretty solid

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.560
yeah it actually seems like I'm able to

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.030
shoot enemies now so it's a good start

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.160
we get a deal with the devil

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:09.310
I like our chance again I want to point

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.840
out even if the game got harder doesn't

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:15.790
mean they're like trying to pull one

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:17.530
over on us I'm just maybe I've tilted so

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:20.440
far that I've gone permanently

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:22.450
off-kilter maybe I've been playing dead

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.190
cells and dead cells you know you get

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.440
calibrated to the fact that enemies die

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.850
in about you know a quarter of a second

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.950
you just go up to them and you know

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:31.300
right trigger left triggers that you

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.130
know they're done right and then you

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:38.290
died soon after if you play as badly as

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:41.169
I do but I don't know maybe it's this

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.680
new haircut not for me but for eating

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:45.520
this gummy

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:48.970
it's got me flipping out here man what I

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:51.310
mean what is this it's like a Ringo

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:53.140
Starr but also a helmet that quake guy

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.630
wears and we got four eyes popping out

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:58.450
of it's like geez four eyes I know it's

00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:01.320
an insult but in this case is almost the

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:05.320
most charming thing about this visit not

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:07.120
you don't fit society's standards of

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.250
beauty I'm not saying that I'm not into

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:13.360
it but you know you can draw for

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:16.150
yourself let's go okay we get a dime

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.250
that's top of the line very valuable for

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:20.020
us right now

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:22.330
we need almost everything you know what

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.770
forget the shop this is about an

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:27.700
investment in rerolls that's way too

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:31.090
dangerous for us to take it's not good

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:32.560
enough for us to take that is good

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:35.830
enough for us to take the mind is a

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:38.830
terrible thing to waste buddy so forget

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:41.370
the shop I'm like extremely content with

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.370
this reroll

00:08:41.889 --> 00:08:48.879
Cambell undies isn't garbage but we like

00:08:44.679 --> 00:08:50.769
we need gas we need good stuff that's

00:08:48.879 --> 00:08:53.230
not what gas stands for doesn't make any

00:08:50.769 --> 00:08:58.589
gas is just fuel you know we need we

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:58.589
need things that make this run pop I

00:08:59.429 --> 00:09:05.799
would kill for like a permanent

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:08.259
number-one that's the Holy Grail right

00:09:05.799 --> 00:09:11.350
now from three dollar bill we're gonna

00:09:08.259 --> 00:09:16.149
get a deal with the devil in spite of my

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:18.939
poor damage we're gonna get a shot speed

00:09:16.149 --> 00:09:23.519
up it's actually fairly okay you don't

00:09:18.939 --> 00:09:25.569
need a world card this is pretty good

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:27.549
shade doesn't matter but it's a

00:09:25.569 --> 00:09:30.339
value-add here and then Abaddon for the

00:09:27.549 --> 00:09:32.919
damage upgrade still not great damage

00:09:30.339 --> 00:09:35.169
and our rate of fire is going to be a

00:09:32.919 --> 00:09:38.799
poor selling point for us on this run

00:09:35.169 --> 00:09:42.369
but we're actually way better off than I

00:09:38.799 --> 00:09:43.720
would have expected given how long it

00:09:42.369 --> 00:09:45.129
took us to make it through those floors

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.850
like we're only like three minutes

00:09:45.129 --> 00:09:47.199
behind schedule

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.669
I guess that's exactly how long you'd

00:09:47.199 --> 00:09:54.699
expect to be behind schedule if you did

00:09:48.669 --> 00:09:56.350
one extra floor so how would fold NL

00:09:54.699 --> 00:09:57.999
play this he would play it like that

00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:01.029
which is why I'm playing it like that I

00:09:57.999 --> 00:10:04.179
got to get back to that mindset even if

00:10:01.029 --> 00:10:05.739
I am about you know 20% confident you

00:10:04.179 --> 00:10:08.709
know I'm not saying it's a guarantee I'm

00:10:05.739 --> 00:10:10.239
like 20 percent confident that I maybe

00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:13.209
I've changed the gun worse but I think

00:10:10.239 --> 00:10:17.259
the game may have changed as well you

00:10:13.209 --> 00:10:20.439
know it could be a both scenario I could

00:10:17.259 --> 00:10:21.910
be bad and dealing with tanking your

00:10:20.439 --> 00:10:26.110
enemies just saying do the research

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:28.029
saying check out our dice room you know

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:31.410
what I'll throw out a reroll here that's

00:10:28.029 --> 00:10:38.160
fine see what we got over here

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:40.749
petrified poop ended up being pretty bad

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.879
not petrified too specifically like I

00:10:40.749 --> 00:10:48.549
mean faded Polaroid petrified poo poo

00:10:42.879 --> 00:10:52.650
cares both have decent uses but the loss

00:10:48.549 --> 00:10:57.160
of keys there is is the real hard part

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:59.800
what is this 101 tear delay a $3 bill

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:02.770
affects what drastically it one of the

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:05.070
easement Skara I got to see if it

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:09.970
doubles our damage during that period

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:15.100
okay so first step item rooms kidney

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:17.020
stone I got a kidney stone but I don't

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:20.860
like kidney stone anymore I had it in a

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:23.890
daily recently kidney stone is no longer

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.460
my best friend the mind is my new best

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.020
friend

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:29.980
I hate kidney stone now because of the

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:32.590
speed downgrade stop and this is how you

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:35.710
know I'm on Full Tilt Poker there's

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:39.610
still Hellmuth but stop putting speed

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:42.430
downgrades on cool items why does small

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:43.660
Rodney to speed downgrade why does why

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:45.370
does kidney stone need a speed

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:47.190
downgraded don't say because if you have

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:50.800
a kidney stone

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:54.310
you can't run fast why does it just give

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.600
you a freaking zero speed because you

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.400
got a kidney cell you don't want to run

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.350
at all oh that would be bad for the game

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:02.440
well then die think that maybe this is

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:05.080
bad for the game too I don't want to go

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:07.060
so I want to take fun items if an item

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.220
is good give it a speed downgrade to

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:11.110
make it slightly worse I understand you

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.880
know riot League of Legends balance

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:14.260
patch I don't know what I'm talking

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.940
about is the thing but if I talk really

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:23.950
fast maybe your brain will recognize

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:25.510
that I just said that what that was

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:28.000
kidney stone I think or a $3.00 bill

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:33.460
into kidney stone somehow yeah okay

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:38.710
we'll take that the kidney stone kidney

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:41.080
stone is a marginal choice and you're

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:44.950
punishing me for a marginal choice for a

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:46.720
margarine choice I don't disagree I like

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:51.550
the full fat flavor of butter you know

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:53.620
real butter pay2win gives us a reroll

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:56.790
machine in every item room that's very

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.790
good if we can get some bombs

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:11.840
copy items eased on it you know what

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:16.490
what would old NL have done here he

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:20.030
would get rid of Guppies paw for Guppies

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:22.940
head use Guppies head use the pills hope

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:28.850
for speed upgrade or a deer's upgrade

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:31.010
for that matter bad very very not good

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:32.450
that was so much worse because it was

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:35.360
the second time but I was trying to get

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:38.720
shade up there to deal some damage okay

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:40.150
we got Yara we can always and maybe we

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:44.720
should do it right away

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:48.590
trade red hearts for absolute HP in the

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:49.520
form of spirit hearts rate of fire still

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:57.910
kind of killing me

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:57.910
oh it was very very close

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:04.390
good work okay you know what I'm gonna

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.950
do it I'm gonna do it right away

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:08.110
keep ourselves alive and you know what

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:10.360
go for the real time guppy dream didn't

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:13.680
work but that's fine we did get we got

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:16.960
better as a result of it anyway

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:22.750
now the 101 rate of fire does not come

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:28.210
with a damage bonus why what is what is

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:32.350
having our rate of fire in order to give

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:34.000
us no benefit it can't be my reflection

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.350
even though all signs are pointing to

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.930
that right now it just doesn't seem

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:42.630
plausible it's like the pieces aren't

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:47.920
adding up it's like why in the world

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:50.230
would Peter Weyland go into the space

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:52.420
engineers this is not an alien covenant

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:54.970
spoiler by the way movie that movie

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:57.130
recently came out so people would be of

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:59.320
the opinion perhaps that I'm spoiling a

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:04.980
new movie this is prometheus came out in

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:09.130
2012 just saying does it make sense why

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:13.930
the biologists would get lost with the

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:15.370
geologist who controls the maps we're

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:19.210
supposed to be smarter than that

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:23.920
he's making us all look bad not that I'm

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:29.880
biologists subtle distinction let's go

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:32.050
okay oh but you know he had a was

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:33.730
very--it abate of personality he was

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:35.860
trying to impress the dude by letting an

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:39.550
aliens freaking snake crawl up the

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:42.000
urethra yeah right sure all I'm saying

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:44.950
is do the research alright let's go

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.450
we're still like a million percent

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:52.000
relying on to your effects to deal

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:57.360
damage here but we are slowly putting

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.360
together the pieces of a potential wind

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:05.450
we got three flies per room that's

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:10.279
honestly a decent amount of like

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:11.480
guaranteed damage rated the outset give

00:16:10.279 --> 00:16:19.910
me smaller rock I don't care I'll take

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:23.660
the screen down grave got a 67 percent

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:26.690
chance of a deal with the devil let's go

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:29.480
we need the HP no matter what and we

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:30.830
definitely a million percent one death

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.779
touch that's just I was going to say

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:34.550
gonna hit us but we got lucky to get out

00:16:32.779 --> 00:16:36.110
of the way we're not concerned at all

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.459
about boss rush because we can't make it

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:39.860
at this point so what we're going to do

00:16:37.459 --> 00:16:41.330
is try to get to our shop and definitely

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.529
our item room item room is more

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:45.070
important than the shop we can use our

00:16:42.529 --> 00:16:50.209
bombs there to accomplish great things

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:53.930
so a guaranteed deaths touch is a very

00:16:50.209 --> 00:16:57.050
solid get here we have a 127 rate of

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:58.010
fire sometimes so that's I would say

00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:00.020
that that's probably our biggest

00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:06.110
weaknesses that we fire once every like

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:08.290
four seconds sometimes sometimes we fire

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:12.850
a little bit faster than that

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:14.990
thank you shave this is not good enough

00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:16.970
save your bombs we might need them for

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:19.579
combat that's not good enough even if it

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:21.589
is wait what okay you know what it is

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:24.709
good enough if it's wait what because we

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:29.090
get hot there's all I needed was a real

00:17:24.709 --> 00:17:31.490
machine not a real machine machine sorry

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:33.020
all I needed was a donation machine and

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:35.059
then I had unlimited money to use on the

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:36.260
reroll machine this is this is fine we

00:17:35.059 --> 00:17:38.620
still don't want wait what Gabby's head

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:41.620
is going to be better for us I think

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.620
technology

00:17:44.019 --> 00:17:51.049
technology with a bad rate of fire

00:17:46.039 --> 00:17:53.120
scares me crystal ball is nice if you

00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:54.980
get you know good passives sorry good

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:58.639
actives on route to getting a passive

00:17:54.980 --> 00:18:08.539
that you actually want to hold tech

00:17:58.639 --> 00:18:10.309
point five is very very good it's weird

00:18:08.539 --> 00:18:14.509
because we made the run like a lot

00:18:10.309 --> 00:18:16.970
better here but I don't know

00:18:14.509 --> 00:18:17.899
first off wise are shot curving I must

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:20.840
have been some kind of three dollar bill

00:18:17.899 --> 00:18:23.330
effects but I don't know if we made it

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.919
good enough because the stance that

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:27.289
we're missing are still so mission

00:18:24.919 --> 00:18:29.179
critical but it's okay we got some mind

00:18:27.289 --> 00:18:31.519
trying to see we do want to go curse

00:18:29.179 --> 00:18:34.070
room we've got to check every room that

00:18:31.519 --> 00:18:39.350
could give us a chance of finishing the

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:44.960
guppy dream and at this point I would

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:47.840
actually go so far as to suggest again

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.490
boss rush irrelevant so we don't need a

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:53.480
teleport card I go so far as to suggest

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:59.210
that tech point five is the main damage

00:18:53.480 --> 00:19:07.909
and our monstros lungs is actually like

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:10.370
the the bonus damage I do okay my bad

00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:13.730
but if you're making other enemies give

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:18.710
us batteries as a dream come true as far

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:20.600
as I'm concerned okay we got to check

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:25.309
there's an Isaac's room as well so if we

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:27.559
can we can get into the Isaac's room we

00:19:25.309 --> 00:19:30.230
can get some HP back there secret room

00:19:27.559 --> 00:19:31.759
does not border it but still and you

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:33.950
know what we've done all the sacrificing

00:19:31.759 --> 00:19:38.720
we need to do on this floor so stop

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:40.490
taking damage we need two bombs get in

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:43.220
here we got two bombs on this room so

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:45.649
that's easy money three spirit arts for

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:47.360
sleeping don't really care whether it's

00:19:45.649 --> 00:19:50.259
a clean room or a dirty room as long as

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.259
we get our HP back

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:58.160
and honestly I got to be real with you

00:19:55.010 --> 00:20:01.010
on this run I'm not really feeling the

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:03.320
conspiracy theory enemies seem to be

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:05.690
dying in a in an appropriate fashion

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.190
maybe I have on tilted myself somehow or

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:08.870
maybe it's because we have monstros lung

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:10.910
and you know enemies tend to die in one

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:15.910
hit of that no matter what so we'll take

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:15.910
SMB super fan that's on everything up

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:21.740
although it used to not be a speed up

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:30.050
that has been fixed for like a year and

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:31.700
a half I think possibly more maybe like

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:35.210
three years now that I think about it

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:37.790
you know time times the flat circle man

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:39.770
year and a half three years a year and a

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:41.180
half is just three years divided by two

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:45.830
so I don't know why you're getting all

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:47.120
uptight about eternal heart guppy item

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:49.250
no okay

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:52.250
so right can't be salty one red chest

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:56.900
doesn't work out in your favor gotta be

00:20:52.250 --> 00:21:00.080
more you know open to getting

00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:01.430
disappointed than then still holding

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:03.950
this ieru and I call the rate of the

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:05.270
start of this run I was like we are not

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:07.610
going to hold this year in the whole

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:11.510
time halfway through the run still

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:14.560
holding the era room that's a good thing

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:18.620
though this is our moment

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:23.260
give me the world's greatest deal with

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:26.900
the devil guppy and then whatever else I

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:32.600
don't care what's on the pizza just give

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:36.650
me a thin crust marinara some mozzarella

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:37.760
cheese basil olive oil Italian sausage I

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:39.920
don't care what else you put on it

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.810
besides that but there does have to be

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.590
all a little bit of chili oil it really

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:45.140
ties it together

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:47.390
prosciutto if you got it if not Parma

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:49.370
ham I know they're the same thing I was

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:51.590
trying to trick you alright so while

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:53.900
we're here if you maybe like some

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:55.640
caramelized pears or something like that

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:59.720
I don't mind getting a little nouveau

00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:03.490
riche with a flatbread I know I don't

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:03.490
mind having stairs ah

00:22:03.999 --> 00:22:15.519
now this probably something we should

00:22:09.289 --> 00:22:18.080
not be doing we didn't pay much for it

00:22:15.519 --> 00:22:20.600
we didn't get much out of it we didn't

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:26.720
pay much for it so everything is

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:29.960
forgiven we could go to the to the boss

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:33.499
trap room we'll get a lot of charges mr.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:35.480
e sacks good by the way I just I mean

00:22:33.499 --> 00:22:37.340
telepathy is lovely okay I'll tell you

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.749
what there's a great case for that we

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:41.809
don't need the whole guppy said the

00:22:38.749 --> 00:22:47.559
finger again is borderline magic mush is

00:22:41.809 --> 00:22:49.279
the Savior so telepathy what's the deal

00:22:47.559 --> 00:22:52.909
with telepathy

00:22:49.279 --> 00:22:56.740
dude we have now we've ascended this run

00:22:52.909 --> 00:23:00.259
is now extraordinarily winnable um I

00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:02.929
knew it the conspiracy they wouldn't let

00:23:00.259 --> 00:23:07.429
me lose on this run what did I tell you

00:23:02.929 --> 00:23:09.679
wake up sheeple we're now like dominant

00:23:07.429 --> 00:23:13.789
not dominating yet but we're in a

00:23:09.679 --> 00:23:19.369
dominant position got good trinkets we

00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:21.200
nearly made it through try buddy we

00:23:19.369 --> 00:23:22.639
nearly made it to boss rush in spite of

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.409
the fact that we got no business doing

00:23:22.639 --> 00:23:28.129
so now they give us gummy just to rub it

00:23:24.409 --> 00:23:28.909
in told you that's duality old NL would

00:23:28.129 --> 00:23:31.129
take to Ally

00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:35.509
I got to get the new NL he's gone off

00:23:31.129 --> 00:23:38.899
the rails in Issac okay it's curse of

00:23:35.509 --> 00:23:40.909
the labyrinth not what I would consider

00:23:38.899 --> 00:23:43.029
to be a hush worthy run at the present

00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:43.029
moment

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:54.669
I real think that telepathy is possibly

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:57.280
one of the greatest items in the game if

00:23:54.669 --> 00:23:58.360
the only criticism you can lobby against

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:00.490
it is that it doesn't make you

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:02.740
invincible against all kinds of damage

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:04.299
you know I think it's it's pretty clear

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.980
you're dealing with a special item there

00:24:04.299 --> 00:24:07.840
so I actually think this might be like

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:10.929
the best active item they've added into

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:12.580
the game well that's not fair is it

00:24:10.929 --> 00:24:14.919
tough I'm moving the goalposts

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:16.539
the best active item that operates in a

00:24:14.919 --> 00:24:21.299
traditionally strong Aven if you know

00:24:16.539 --> 00:24:25.570
it's like because crooked penny is

00:24:21.299 --> 00:24:27.100
actually incredibly strong even if you

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:28.960
feel that it's kind of what's weaker

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:30.549
than it used to be inning you might also

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:34.690
think that it's kind of overdone at this

00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:38.470
point but like it's a good freaking item

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:41.260
man is the thing if this as good as

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:42.960
crooked penny it might be we got to

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:45.580
check this this is a great use of a key

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.990
unfortunately it actually wasn't but if

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:49.330
it an ad book of revelations or

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:52.770
something it would be so how do we pull

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:55.750
a loss out of our likely win here

00:24:52.770 --> 00:25:00.700
basically stop standing so close to

00:24:55.750 --> 00:25:04.380
enemies the occasional fire mind is

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:14.039
enough to widdle you down to death so we

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:14.039
like really really need to not do that

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:22.630
mom gets just completely screwed by

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:24.400
telepathy as well as does Isaac although

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:28.590
the beams make him a little bit more of

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:31.120
a of a challenge this is a tough one

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:34.059
that hurts me deep in my soul cuz that

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:36.429
was just I don't don't know what you're

00:25:34.059 --> 00:25:38.860
supposed to do to avoid the bomb there

00:25:36.429 --> 00:25:42.190
all right just remember that when you

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:43.539
shoot him he dives spawns enemies that

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:45.490
will also die because you tier is so

00:25:43.539 --> 00:25:48.400
large those enemies when they die will

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:49.809
spawn a bomb which will then be here by

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.490
the tier that still exists on the screen

00:25:49.809 --> 00:25:54.360
and then you know it Bob's your uncle

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:54.360
you're getting hurt as well

00:25:54.780 --> 00:26:07.020
old NL would have done this I would like

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:07.020
to be a little bit more cautious

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:17.920
and no good deed goes unpunished it's

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:21.350
actually completely fine because we have

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:26.900
this secret room I know we have we've

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:28.280
left the era room back there what if we

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:31.460
could have caught that we should have

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:37.640
used telepathy it screws the bonis over

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:39.200
as well so like really look for tinted

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:45.559
rocks I don't think we saw one there

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:47.750
should probably just use it whenever

00:26:45.559 --> 00:26:50.210
it's off cooldown just on principle and

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:57.410
walked on the creep what do you what do

00:26:50.210 --> 00:27:04.850
you try to pull here ahead of the keeper

00:26:57.410 --> 00:27:08.929
is not a an urgent get potentially

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:10.370
sorted nice that's about it though we

00:27:08.929 --> 00:27:13.520
got our red heart back which is the

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:15.530
whole reason we went there I don't know

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:19.250
man like the Isaac fight should not be

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:21.110
that bad I'm going to these rooms not in

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:22.970
the hopes of getting the guppy item the

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:24.950
hopes of getting a spirit heart it's a

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:26.690
pretty modest task and then that spirit

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:30.800
art gives us the ability to feel good

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:33.650
about going with the going to the curse

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:36.890
room but maybe not maybe we should just

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:39.800
play this how would all it old and I'll

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:43.520
play this he'd dial in battleground

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:45.170
style you know and said so like

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.640
french-canadian when I said that thanks

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:48.020
a lot I've mine really appreciate that

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:50.210
and by hive mind I mean fire mind

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:56.360
although hive mind would be nice right

00:27:50.210 --> 00:28:02.179
now donor me bagging you oh it heard me

00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:03.770
a little bit it did okay dial in let's

00:28:02.179 --> 00:28:06.309
do this just don't stand too close to

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:06.309
the enemies

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:26.550
good use of telepathy the thing is we're

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:26.550
all human beings here I've exploded

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:37.180
thanks to fire mind here's what I'm

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:43.810
going to do we're going to do Ana's asel

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:45.820
run you're witnessing the satirical

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:50.620
descent of a man into madness

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:52.450
I might this might just be a level of

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:54.990
tilt I've never experienced before in my

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:54.990
adult life

00:28:56.130 --> 00:29:03.580
maybe I've like you know professional

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:03.970
athletes they need to retire at some

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:06.520
Pole

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:08.260
okay that one's pretty bad professional

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:10.870
athletes you know they need to retire at

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:13.930
some point eSports athletes brain gets

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:20.080
less sharp am I just as I get older more

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:23.020
handsome wiser better with money more

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:24.730
socially competent just better in

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:26.830
basically every way now this is meant to

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:29.920
be sincerity as well maybe I'm just

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:32.200
getting like I'm getting phased out of

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:34.600
the Isaac existence you know the kids

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:38.560
are coming up from behind James Murphy

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:41.560
said a Best 2005 losing my edge but if

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:43.330
we can't win Ana's asel run that's how

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:45.690
I'll know that's how I'll know that

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:50.650
we're in it we're in a dark place here

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:52.900
that run was actually it was good but it

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:54.370
wasn't perfect no Isaac run ever is

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:57.790
though so it's kind of like a false

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:59.860
dilemma there but we need to start

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:02.410
putting wins on camera or we're going to

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:04.920
enter like a spiral from which there is

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:04.920
no escape

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:13.440
I am being like I'm semi-serious about

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:16.890
me thinking that the game has actually

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:19.350
gotten clandestine harder like they've

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:21.000
secretly like added a little multiplier

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:23.850
to enemy HP or something like that if

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.960
I'm wrong I'm wrong I would like to be

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:26.060
right it would be a very convenient

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.290
explanation

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:29.610
some people have echoed my anecdotal

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:31.080
evidence but that doesn't mean I'm right

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:35.910
I'm a skeptical person to begin with

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:43.290
we're all skeptical people so much to

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:44.610
give Marvin Gaye let's go but if we

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:48.150
can't win in two days we'll run that's

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:49.770
where it's all going south man and I've

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:51.420
gotten a lot of tweets that between you

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:54.390
know salted Lee about Isaac cuz I'm ten

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:56.970
years old and people have been like yeah

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:58.140
you know I stopped playing Isaac when

00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:00.600
afterbirth came out I think they made it

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:03.090
so hard it wasn't fun what's weird is

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:05.100
that I respect that opinion but I did

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:08.690
not feel that way at all I thought that

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:11.130
like after birth plus was a pretty good

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:15.930
expansion after they ironed out the

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:18.450
early kinks however am I the only person

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:22.560
experiencing the post booster pack like

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:23.970
madness here if I am I am and I'll you

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:29.100
know I can endeavor to change from

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:32.460
within to make that better but her it's

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:34.320
kind of fun sprinkler I should say I

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:36.240
don't think it's that good but maybe as

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:38.220
as asel it's excellent because it'll

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:40.740
shoot a brimstone beam or maybe it won't

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:47.820
but you know we'll figure it out soon

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:49.400
enough nonetheless it does shoot a

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:53.180
brimstone beam

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:54.980
it shoots in about a millisecond out in

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:59.530
front of it which is not a measurement

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:59.530
of distance or magnitude

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:05.580
if it catches an enemy it'll destroy

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:08.910
them though this seems awesome on

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:12.000
stationary boxes or that box right there

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:14.429
who is actually highly mobile we've got

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.480
a key back but I think we just go for it

00:32:14.429 --> 00:32:20.400
here yeah anyway mostly like I'm doing

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:22.020
it as either on here I want to win I

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:25.250
want to get some confidence back I also

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:28.559
feel guilty like this is more Isaac

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:30.360
losses than I've had in like a million

00:32:28.559 --> 00:32:33.150
years first off that was too bad plays

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:34.679
in a row there so I should go back in

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:36.480
for that key as penance but I'm a little

00:32:34.679 --> 00:32:44.100
worried about my HP despite the fact

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:46.080
that you wouldn't think it careful does

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.490
that thing could blow up one of those

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:51.299
guys in your face but yeah like I want

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:54.000
to get a win on video man say I got to

00:32:51.299 --> 00:32:57.000
come back to play an Isaac tomorrow that

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:00.809
vork killed could have heard us and I

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.159
want to be positive I think you know one

00:33:00.809 --> 00:33:03.570
of the best things you can this a

00:33:02.159 --> 00:33:05.100
four-room item for some reason I thought

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:06.780
it was three rooms but um one of the

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:09.929
best things you can do to maintain like

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:12.179
you know good work environment and keep

00:33:09.929 --> 00:33:13.370
yourself as productive as possible not

00:33:12.179 --> 00:33:15.450
that that's the be-all end-all

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:20.400
necessarily but you know it can be

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:24.720
important is leaving yourself like a

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:27.390
good set up for tomorrow's workday and I

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:29.010
know that you know my work is playing

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:30.809
video games so that doesn't mean it's

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:33.179
you know there's not elements of it that

00:33:30.809 --> 00:33:35.309
are more fun than other elements so I

00:33:33.179 --> 00:33:37.289
think if I was like a never go to bed

00:33:35.309 --> 00:33:38.730
angry but for The Binding of Isaac sort

00:33:37.289 --> 00:33:40.500
of situation I want to finish the day

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:43.590
with a win so I haven't had the greatest

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:46.490
runs today I got to come back and play

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:46.490
the daily tomorrow

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:56.370
this could be good

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:58.830
and I want to be psyched to play the

00:33:56.370 --> 00:34:00.510
daily in spite of the fact that a lot of

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:03.540
dailies are say me a lot of them are

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:04.860
annoying I like them that's the thing

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:07.560
I'm not going to sweat that speed

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:10.580
downgrade when we have a you know the

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:10.580
ability to fly here

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:18.790
so I want to be in a good mood for

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:20.650
tomorrow's runs stop the bleeding if

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:22.030
possible we haven't been to our limit or

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:22.510
shopping we might not want to go to our

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:24.550
shop

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:31.050
we're in stats as far as those asel runs

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:32.830
go except we could use some real HP

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:34.929
because we're going to have a deal with

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:37.060
the devil probably on this floor we're

00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:40.990
also not exactly crushing it from a key

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:42.580
standpoint this is a good trinket for us

00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:44.560
though as we are working towards guppy

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:47.050
and the extra spirit hearts could come

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:49.210
in handy so yeah like this is I'm

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:50.590
pulling the veil back here a little bit

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:54.040
and throwing myself out through the

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:59.080
freaking moon door but let's go I am

00:34:54.040 --> 00:35:02.320
like amazed at the poor track record

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:05.020
recently in Isaac not in a good way like

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:08.920
you know Lone Star was baby I'm amazed

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:10.960
by you who don't make me take this just

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:12.610
so it never shows up again I'll never

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:14.650
forgive you probably should have saved

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:18.610
this health upgrade and then used it

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:21.760
after a potential deal of devil hey you

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:24.850
come down here you're not quite close

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:27.600
enough to get hay problem oh I'm excited

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:27.600
it's popping off

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:32.109
was going to try to force him to spawn

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:37.060
close enough to the sprinkler but I'm

00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:43.510
not sure if I really can okay seem to do

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:45.690
a pretty good job just one more just one

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:45.690
more

00:35:48.519 --> 00:35:52.609
kind of surprised me you can get hit

00:35:50.569 --> 00:35:58.309
there to be real with you but okay move

00:35:52.609 --> 00:36:00.319
it on out and I think in like the fact

00:35:58.309 --> 00:36:01.940
that every day like since I've been

00:36:00.319 --> 00:36:03.890
slumping and Isaac it's not like it

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:07.309
racks my brain and nice it's like I

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:09.650
don't need you to tweet me and be like

00:36:07.309 --> 00:36:11.329
NL I support you like I know this is

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:13.640
hard you know in the end it's bad

00:36:11.329 --> 00:36:15.140
playing a video game for recreational

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:17.839
purposes you know no one's got their

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:19.339
csgo skins riding on me or anything like

00:36:17.839 --> 00:36:22.069
that probably if you do is stop betting

00:36:19.339 --> 00:36:23.450
on this this is a terrible idea you're

00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:26.029
going to lose all your money well you

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:28.819
expect me to fail I succeed you expect

00:36:26.029 --> 00:36:36.529
me to succeed I fail you know it's I'm

00:36:28.819 --> 00:36:39.259
the great negation operator I mean

00:36:36.529 --> 00:36:41.550
here's the thing we'll dust is due in

00:36:39.259 --> 00:36:45.020
two seconds

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:45.020
to get them to hang around

00:36:47.709 --> 00:36:53.229
might not be worth it but we've done it

00:36:50.289 --> 00:36:54.579
nonetheless we've done it but yeah every

00:36:53.229 --> 00:36:55.839
day I've woken up a minute okay today's

00:36:54.579 --> 00:37:00.309
the day I'm going to like start being

00:36:55.839 --> 00:37:01.959
better at Isaac and it like start being

00:37:00.309 --> 00:37:03.699
good at Isaac again I should say you

00:37:01.959 --> 00:37:06.759
know we got that three thousand hours of

00:37:03.699 --> 00:37:09.189
stored experience and every day it just

00:37:06.759 --> 00:37:12.579
you know maybe one good run and the rest

00:37:09.189 --> 00:37:15.969
of them end up being junk so I'm

00:37:12.579 --> 00:37:24.279
searching my soul for the for the

00:37:15.969 --> 00:37:26.039
proximate cause and we'll see maybe this

00:37:24.279 --> 00:37:32.019
is the run that pulls it all together

00:37:26.039 --> 00:37:34.269
pulls it all together we'll take it

00:37:32.019 --> 00:37:36.549
headless baby is basically the

00:37:34.269 --> 00:37:38.109
definition of we have no choice but it

00:37:36.549 --> 00:37:41.019
exists and is not horrible

00:37:38.109 --> 00:37:45.549
it's very roundabout and for both

00:37:41.019 --> 00:37:48.999
explanation for this item but not

00:37:45.549 --> 00:37:51.789
terrible sprinkler it's on the verge of

00:37:48.999 --> 00:37:57.009
becoming like bosses and tough rooms

00:37:51.789 --> 00:38:00.309
because sadly it does possess no ability

00:37:57.009 --> 00:38:01.989
to the locomote so on a large room like

00:38:00.309 --> 00:38:03.819
this it's not useless because we could

00:38:01.989 --> 00:38:07.420
we could go to enemies and going on top

00:38:03.819 --> 00:38:10.359
of it but it's not too useful we're on

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:14.589
the caves to here so boss Rush is a real

00:38:10.359 --> 00:38:18.880
possibility the question is largely

00:38:14.589 --> 00:38:23.799
going to be how we actually feel about

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:25.420
going to boss rush being honest kind of

00:38:23.799 --> 00:38:27.099
interested throwing down sprinklers

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:29.140
seems pretty sweet we just got a Guppies

00:38:27.099 --> 00:38:34.150
hairball kill so clearly we can't be

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:37.929
that bad at the game carrion Queen she's

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:40.150
an ugly thing please go in no matter if

00:38:37.929 --> 00:38:42.339
these are not the lyrics to Gary and

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:44.369
Queen all right we can use the Sun card

00:38:42.339 --> 00:38:47.499
to get a red heart deal to the devil

00:38:44.369 --> 00:38:50.950
which I think we should just do so

00:38:47.499 --> 00:38:56.470
they're red hearts when we go in yeah

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:59.319
okay so turrets like good I'm going to

00:38:56.470 --> 00:39:04.569
grab this for the completely needless

00:38:59.319 --> 00:39:09.089
but a little two percent Zane option

00:39:04.569 --> 00:39:14.160
here for bookworm it's not horrible

00:39:09.089 --> 00:39:16.900
but it is admittedly fairly unnecessary

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:18.160
so the Emperor here is awesome because

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:21.190
that actually allows us to go to boss

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:25.240
rush and get out for free and then we

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:27.460
have a real library on which I don't

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:30.579
think we want anything but we'll take

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:35.700
all the books just in case one day we

00:39:30.579 --> 00:39:38.049
might be able to create a a winnable

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:42.299
well-done winnable but like a quad

00:39:38.049 --> 00:39:42.299
library that actually has items in it

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:47.380
okay so the guppy dream is still low

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:51.809
percentage but plausible

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:51.809
we got the HP necessary to burn here

00:39:54.359 --> 00:39:58.109
turns out on that last run maybe we

00:39:56.410 --> 00:40:00.369
should have gone to the cursed room

00:39:58.109 --> 00:40:03.339
stars will be the stars in the Emperor

00:40:00.369 --> 00:40:06.670
I'm going to stick with the stars it

00:40:03.339 --> 00:40:09.099
really doesn't matter too much the

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:10.390
emperor has advantages it can get us to

00:40:09.099 --> 00:40:12.609
the boss room if we're going to slow

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:15.730
we're probably not going to be too slow

00:40:12.609 --> 00:40:22.960
on today's run well I'm the second run

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:25.000
of this video however the stars car

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:26.500
doesn't allow us to have that shortcut

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.030
so it is a disadvantage but it also

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:30.130
allows us to get out of boss rush

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:31.420
without going straight back to the room

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:33.390
that we can't get out of which is the

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:36.040
boss fight so I've got to check this

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:37.480
this run has popped off the other thing

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:40.349
we could do is just stars card like

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:40.349
right now

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:49.130
just try it just flip and try it copies

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:54.170
hairball is going to leave you in a

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:56.569
world of hurt brother 33% chance of the

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:58.400
deal with the devil here so not banking

00:40:56.569 --> 00:41:03.980
on guppy dreams or like a full-blown

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:05.270
brimstone wouldn't turn up my nose you

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:07.660
got to throw that out there just so the

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:11.000
game knows I wouldn't turn up my nose

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:15.079
this is actually a ranged downgrade but

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:17.720
I take it because we are very very small

00:41:15.079 --> 00:41:20.299
and then if I'm being honest I forgot

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:21.740
that it was a range downgrade until just

00:41:20.299 --> 00:41:23.089
about the moment I picked it up and so

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:26.720
range downgrade because it just lowers

00:41:23.089 --> 00:41:29.500
sorry raises your heights of your tears

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:33.740
so they spend more time in the air but

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:39.890
lowers the actual distance they travel

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:44.210
so for a beam it just lowers it 100% at

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:46.910
being said say a lot of things about

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:49.660
this run you can't really talk too much

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:52.930
guff about our speed stat right now

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:52.930
sister viz

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:57.210
it gets super lucky I was going to say

00:41:55.650 --> 00:42:02.250
we might not even have to touch Larry

00:41:57.210 --> 00:42:05.940
jr. just better for both of us honestly

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:08.099
now just get dusted give us a deal we've

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:10.890
done it magic mush we don't need to take

00:42:08.099 --> 00:42:14.160
magic mush it it would have been better

00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:15.569
knowing that it's Krampus but it could

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:18.450
have gotten a deal for free like a

00:42:15.569 --> 00:42:21.720
double pay deal for free lump of coal

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:24.210
may or may not work damage is now 12

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:25.890
okay so this run is looking like it's

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:27.630
going to pop off and could be the

00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:35.160
foundation I need underneath me for a

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:37.740
little bit of confidence we'll see if we

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:39.480
get or with our luck continues to flow

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:41.790
on this ride is weird I'm 12 minutes in

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:45.839
but I'm actually 42 minutes in I'm like

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:48.530
why am I like speaking exhausted like

00:42:45.839 --> 00:42:48.530
repeating myself

00:42:48.859 --> 00:42:53.790
there was one failure of a run appended

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:55.079
to the front of this one well not

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:56.910
appended and we're appending though

00:42:55.079 --> 00:42:59.579
hopefully winning run to the end of this

00:42:56.910 --> 00:43:03.180
one it's like doing an n LSS segment so

00:42:59.579 --> 00:43:05.130
now we're long just imagine we're moving

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:09.359
on to golf with your friends and you

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:11.660
know 18 minutes here proud eighteen

00:43:09.359 --> 00:43:16.710
minutes seems conceivable at this point

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:19.520
this run is poppin off probably I will

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:23.790
exercise my constitutional right to not

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:25.770
fight the lam I'm sorry well not by the

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:30.030
lam probably but not fight hocheiser

00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:32.940
copy copy dreams okay I can see forevers

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:34.800
nothing wrong with it so second secret

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:38.579
room it is a second secret room I

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:40.859
actually don't want HP right now to is

00:43:38.579 --> 00:43:44.210
good enough and might want to try to

00:43:40.859 --> 00:43:46.460
snag permanent polaroid invincibility

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:51.530
dead onion

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:53.869
I think is meaningless it gives us a

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:56.180
range upgrade actually was not

00:43:53.869 --> 00:43:59.119
meaningless but it's pretty much

00:43:56.180 --> 00:44:00.710
meaningless 0.25 range upgrade might be

00:43:59.119 --> 00:44:02.690
affected by modifiers but shout speed

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:05.810
obviously doesn't do anything for us so

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:08.060
we just dusted lockups would be nice but

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:10.250
I'm still loading on the freaking Guffey

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:12.680
dream dude come on never has one man

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:15.200
desire to guppy dream more than this

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:16.520
guppy dream right here is a donut always

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:22.520
seem to go you don't know what you got

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:24.170
till it's gone sort of moment we are

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:29.560
actually strong enough that the

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:32.599
sprinkler is completely irrelevant now I

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:34.790
don't need to so it's kind of a tough

00:44:32.599 --> 00:44:36.410
sell this is not good enough none of

00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:39.080
those are worth even messing around with

00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:43.250
again maybe I could make an effort to

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:45.589
get the I could make an effort to get

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:48.380
the mom transformation but the mom

00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:50.030
transformation is worth you know about

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:52.580
the price of a big bite hot dog is

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:53.990
7-eleven if you ask me I don't know how

00:44:52.580 --> 00:45:00.109
much that is when I was in college it

00:44:53.990 --> 00:45:01.640
was $2.00 or just coupons so I have to

00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:03.950
assume that this probably like you know

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:05.780
290 or something at this point has been

00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:09.230
like you know eight or nine years since

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:11.450
I was buying 7-eleven Big Bite hotdogs

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:13.930
on the regular but man that was one heck

00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:13.930
of a summer

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:24.920
deels were out of control it might have

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:27.650
been too big bite hot dogs for two

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:29.360
dollars I know I'm getting mired in the

00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:33.020
minutia of this anecdote at this point

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:34.670
but I'm like a $2.00 hot dog in 2008

00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:37.940
doesn't seem like that good of a deal

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:39.740
it's not it's not pricey I know every

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:41.660
time you say like oh I paid $2 for a hot

00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:43.850
dog oh I get him for 35 cents out of the

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:46.070
garbage can next to my house okay look

00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:47.420
who are you paying because you should

00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:50.450
just get him out of the garbage can if

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:52.160
that's the case get them for free man

00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:55.640
you're paying someone for access to

00:45:52.160 --> 00:46:00.980
their garbage can is that where society

00:45:55.640 --> 00:46:03.020
is at now is a man not entitled to the

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:05.170
garbage of his neighbor's I guess not

00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:07.250
probably try pulling that one in court

00:46:05.170 --> 00:46:09.800
neighbors will buy a paper shredder in

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:12.470
approximately negative 20 seconds torn

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:17.120
photo lovely for the damage bonus and

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:19.490
buy damage I mean VPS because the faster

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:21.710
charge we gotta look for the Goffe dream

00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:24.290
and I was incredulous when I started to

00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:25.490
save and then we got the closer to the

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:28.700
guppy dream and now I'm not incredulous

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:29.210
anymore but we should know no I'm

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:32.300
excited

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:35.810
take that we should take the sprinkler

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:39.290
because it's more fun it's more unique

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:42.920
than guppy says all the sneeze is unique

00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:45.950
in that it left me great as I was about

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:50.180
to experience it now I got like one eye

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:51.620
closed trying to get back now that our

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:54.380
rate of fire is increased it's actually

00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:58.700
a lot better as well it's firing all the

00:46:54.380 --> 00:47:00.440
time speed down one makes you small

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:03.620
cables take that to the point of

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:05.240
absurdity good luck no money guess we

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:07.610
didn't really need money to begin with

00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:10.280
we're one item away from the guppy dream

00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:12.770
with the left hand and a 72 percent

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:16.310
chance of a deal with the devil so if

00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:19.910
there is a benevolent force above the

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:22.460
side within you know wherever I don't

00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:24.560
care all I want to do is abuse your

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:27.950
deification for personal gain

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:30.230
give me Guffey this is my moment this is

00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:32.720
my like rebirth how ironic

00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:34.250
and I'm it's so ironic I'm not even

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:36.200
going to mention that I had the booth

00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:45.130
she had the chronic and/or the Lakers

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:49.119
beat the SuperSonics ridiculous no yes

00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:51.970
no yeah whatever

00:47:49.119 --> 00:47:54.920
no big deal help down is actually good

00:47:51.970 --> 00:48:01.940
although we may not want at this point

00:47:54.920 --> 00:48:07.430
to generate HP take it on a case-by-case

00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:11.329
basis it's good to use a key or worse

00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:12.740
things to get here I'm going to take the

00:48:11.329 --> 00:48:17.210
left hand if we don't become Guffey I

00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:18.680
think the left hand could could still

00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:21.560
fulfill our guppy dream for us you know

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:22.970
what it's an is asel run like even

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:25.220
though I desperately need something in

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:27.859
the win column anything I can do to get

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:29.570
like a little Zane on an Azazel run

00:48:27.859 --> 00:48:39.890
feels a little bit better though than

00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:42.440
72% James denied let's go now the

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:44.690
cathedral has been like the source of my

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:47.240
greatest failures lately for a floor

00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:50.060
that probably like two weeks ago I would

00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:53.300
have said like this floor doesn't have

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:55.609
any reason to exist it's always pretty

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:57.920
easy you just bomb your way through the

00:48:55.609 --> 00:49:00.500
rooms you don't want to do doesn't give

00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:02.990
you any items not really a skill check

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:09.710
like all the sudden haven't even my you

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:10.880
know mental words like crazy lately this

00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:13.280
time it's not going to happen though

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:19.130
this run conceivably is too strong to

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:21.140
mess up even you know have my worst so

00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:23.980
little all there we go where the Guster

00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:23.980
life is good

00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:29.850
now if we mess this one up I have to

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:33.720
quit playing The Binding of Isaac

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:36.660
forever that's the rule so you know root

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:43.200
for a loss if you never want to see

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:47.850
Isaac again this is like the gray moment

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:51.060
of truth such an easy win with 12 damage

00:49:47.850 --> 00:49:52.730
no hive mind admittedly but you know who

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:55.080
cares

00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:56.010
effectively now let you know drop this

00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:57.210
because we don't need the left hand

00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:59.090
anymore unless we want to become super

00:49:57.210 --> 00:50:01.920
guppy doesn't exist I could see forever

00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:03.420
- its diamonds - all talk to a diamonds

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:04.980
we're not holding anything you know we

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:06.780
do have we don't have Guppies tail but

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:08.850
we might as well take an extra key here

00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:10.380
okay I can't tell you how much of a load

00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:13.340
this is off my shoulders you know this

00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:15.570
is I having an argument with somebody

00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:17.160
you want to get that sword before you

00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:19.080
fall asleep you know the sleep is this

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:20.910
some place where feelings are cemented

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:23.190
wake up in the morning you're still mad

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:26.330
you're going to text them again fuck you

00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:28.470
you know apologies for the YouTube

00:50:26.330 --> 00:50:32.160
advertisers for the f-word there but I'm

00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:36.030
selling a wholesome family message it's

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:38.369

then another pheromones now I get the

00:51:54.560 --> 00:52:00.620
offer hold no more Isaac forever if I

00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:02.060
lose and try not to think about the fact

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:05.120
that if I really didn't want to play

00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:10.070
Isaac again ever I would just not upload

00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:11.870
this video and try not to think about

00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:14.750
the fact that wait a minute isn't that

00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:17.330
exactly what he would want you to think

00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:20.390
do the research people I'm just saying

00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:21.860
through the research that's it stats can

00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:23.450
you approach the research with an open

00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:25.460
mind and an open mind in this case means

00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:30.340
agreeing with me on a percent otherwise

00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:30.340

look at that the prophecy foretold of a

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:50.480
man who would stand in a sea of tears

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:53.390
yet remained dry as bone that man has

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:54.620
arrived and his name is and then he

00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:58.610
slips on a banana peel

00:52:54.620 --> 00:53:04.370
