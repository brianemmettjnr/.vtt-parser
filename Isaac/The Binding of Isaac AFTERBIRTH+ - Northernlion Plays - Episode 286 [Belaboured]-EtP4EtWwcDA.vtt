00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.840
hey everybody welcome magazine land

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.460
plays The Binding of I began with plus

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.839
encoding overloaded consider turning

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.970
down video settings are using it in

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.280
faster coding preset Knives fixed let's

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.040
go we're good at Isaac again or at least

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.230
decent at Eden which is the different

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.160
subsets of skills but I'm feeling better

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.910
about myself hey look it's HP what

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.640
that's mom's coin purse it looks like

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.900
the world's worst eyebrow job and then

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.340
dad's key which is an interesting item

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.219
paralysis and then two of the same pale

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.800
nice hairdo as well range down luck up

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:43.710
and range down luck up fair trade I'd

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:47.760
say rate of fire is good damage is bad

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:51.239
I'd say they basically balance out speed

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.129
is not good but not really bad but

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.239
certainly the fact that we have more

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.579
than you know one HP makes this not a

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.949
too difficult of a situation to imagine

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.309
that we can succeed I think I'm over my

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.380
temporary Isaac badness or you know

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.119
psychosis depending on your perspective

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.530
so I'm pretty excited about that I've

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.479
been winning runs lately I've been doing

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.409
okay on dailies and it's like it's a

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.780
whole new world

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.770
hello Ruka what do you want buddy I

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.299
don't think is any reason to use dad's

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.189
key in here I kind of thought the secret

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.560
room might be on the north exit in this

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.009
room but no such luck

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.509
I mean dad's key is pretty simple

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.439
spelunker set well I mean now it's

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.700
really simple because we can actually

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.170
just know where to use it but usually

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.090
you're just going to use dad's key on

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.560
rooms that could be the secret room less

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.970
relevant to us now that we've got

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.100
spelunkers hat but we can still get into

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.689
shops and item rooms for free so it's

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.159
worth something and of course like mega

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:56.659
satan is on the agenda eventually I'd

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.880
like to see some living bombs here ken

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.310
you're my you're my pet and I love you

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.350
you can't sit in between the monitor and

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.560
the keyboard though it's a bad place for

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.810
a cat to be because you know there's

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.670
like detron it's up there there's tissue

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.319
boxes you start playing with the tissue

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.879
boxes and you you get to

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.849
distracted easily look you're not

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.680
exactly at least by human standards

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.959
you're not an intellectual you know

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.849
you're a simple creature you like simple

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.400
things unfortunately that leads to some

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.930
difficult situating at my head phone

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.629
cord like you're gonna bite it right now

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.549
and you trying to sell me on the idea

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.049
that you should be up here between the

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.540
keyboard in the butter it's a delicate

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:40.349
place if you buy my hand while I play

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:43.560
this video game I will tweet about it

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.599
later because right now I'm busy playing

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.129
the game in question but you know you

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.260
get the idea okay we're rolling I'm mad

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.549
bombs here here's what you do crack this

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.799
open let's go

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:56.400
crickets head has the keeper also real

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:59.040
good smack this guy down with a little

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.859
bomb action there you go now we're at 12

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.159
cents the shop has already been opened

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:07.019
by us so you come back here I don't

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.299
think you want to buy a 15 cent item

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.669
right now I think what you do want to do

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.349
is buy this and then preserve your

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:16.169
chance to get to the arcade on the next

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.549
floor and then you can really get the

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:20.250
mad money starting there but I'm going

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.810
to use my key it's a range downgrade I'm

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.069
going to use my key on this golden chest

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.500
and we got a lot of money out of that

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:30.810
albeit not quite enough to actually get

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.099
to our 15 cent marker which is good

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.989
because it saves us from buying an item

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.120
that might be terrible and then we're

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.199
going to use a bomb or might be great

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.759
for that matter we'll use a bomb right

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:40.709
here we get another golden chest so I

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:42.449
can't open that but I'm also not going

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.609
to buy a key and if I buy a key I sure

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:47.009
as heck I'm not going to use it to open

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.870
a golden chest considering we you know

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:50.129
might needed to open the item room on

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.349
the next floor although with dad's keep

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:55.379
you probably will not so there is that

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:59.430
15 cents if we get the 20 cents maybe

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:01.109
I'll go back to the shop but dude you're

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.000
not leaving me with too much real estate

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:06.680
here with your endless firehose of

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.680
bullets there we go

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.540
still alive gonna have to do better than

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.700
that born at night but not last night

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.440
got to wake up pretty early in the morn

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.190
a hit me with one of those I don't think

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.210
so sir maybe on my worst day okay I'm

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.440
going to use two bombs because I'd

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.650
really like to get a small rock if

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.590
possible and we didn't get small rock

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.060
but we got two more cents and two more

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.830
spear knots and rotten meat

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.530
all right down to the next floor easy

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.740
money easy money stats are still bad

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.270
except for HP in tears but this is where

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.979
we turn it all around here kind of

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.000
disappointing actually that we don't

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.530
have a blood bank because now we

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.830
probably will not be able to get access

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:55.919
to the boss Trap room either but it's

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:59.430
okay Ace of Spades stay away from my

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:04.770
judgment he's the only son I got down

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:07.080
Donna Donna please give me an HP up he's

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.479
done he dusted himself and then the dude

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.550
next to him was just 10 cents down the

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:15.360
drain I mean we should probably be able

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.950
to recover 10 cents pretty easily all

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.910
things considered another luck upgrade

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:23.610
well worth it

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:26.100
speed downgrade oh god life is pain very

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.220
lucky to get through that shouldn't be a

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.740
secret room there and then now we're

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.110
like onto the actual floor after a

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:38.130
minute and a half of absolute nonsense

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:40.710
we're onto the actual floor here so 0.8

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.600
speed is pretty terrible on paper it

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.050
doesn't look that much worse than 0.92

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:49.169
but you know every every speed downgrade

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.450
starts to matter a little bit more you

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:53.400
know the lower you get here but this

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.950
floor is still it represents hope for us

00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:00.440
you know we've got a good deal with the

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:02.729
devil chance we already had no mapping

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:07.229
we have one cat in the room does the

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:10.440
second cat wish to enter hell Otomo take

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:13.530
your time no it's not like 30,000 people

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:17.690
watching you try to freaking waddle into

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.690
your ramen box here

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:25.260
not watch I guess but listen we're going

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:28.530
to grab key grab bomb

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:34.320
we got nearsighted friend it's terrible

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:36.150
but in fact no there's no but doesn't

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.770
really contribute to any transformation

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.540
it's just kind of an all-around trash

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.940
fire but starter decks pretty solid

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:45.180
starter deck to a clubs I mean for seven

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.800
cents we've you know gotten our money's

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.650
worth there dude give me small rock all

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:53.280
except the speed downgrade for a damage

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.930
upgrade at this point just to be you

00:06:53.280 --> 00:07:01.830
know as absurd in one direction is

00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:04.140
possible and the era ruin so we've got

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.970
four spirit hearts cracked open already

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.190
to the best of my memory still no

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:09.630
smaller rock but you know as long as

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:13.130
they keep givin us spirit arts and not

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:15.630
trash I'm a fairly happy camper here

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:19.080
probably not a secret room but it's hard

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:21.470
to tell because of the amnesia try this

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.470
one

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.790
so our HP is so good like I mean even

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.070
though I'm taking some pretty dumb

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:31.470
damage we're in a great spot the only

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:35.390
thing I will say is we're running out of

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:37.560
time oh oh don't you dare buddy I

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.750
apologize for the petting zoo that I got

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.460
going on here but you know one cat comes

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.930
in he's being all lovey-dovey the other

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.030
cats like hey I want some attention he

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.350
comes in and then the other cat is like

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:48.420
I don't want to be in a room with that

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:50.220
other cat I'm a territorial creature I'd

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:53.040
rather just cede the territory and then

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.240
so it did wants to leave so as I have

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.680
let it leave and now we should have

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.830
reached an equilibrium that we can stick

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:01.640
to for the next 40 minutes or so if you

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:05.250
don't like it you can leave buddy

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:08.400
they light up my life

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:13.890
okay we got like a serious speed

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:17.990
downgrade it's a big floor to like boss

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:17.990
rush might already be a dusted idea

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:22.760
boss freshens old-hat grandpa who says

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.360
ol dad anymore

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:27.320
box rushes old hat grandpa the new

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.420
hotness

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:34.430
you know what just ASA spades this bad

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:39.560
boy I don't I ace of spades the era room

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:40.220
I'm the new hotness is delirium said no

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.740
one ever

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.970
straight up weed to fly probably not

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.380
this floor but within the next few

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:47.660
floors we need to speed upgrade or the

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:50.960
ability to fly or like life is going to

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:52.400
be pain because 0.6 speed is snow it's

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.970
not enough speed to raise a family in

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.770
today's day and age be real here this

00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:03.680
should not be a secret room below us

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:05.690
because the boss room is there so got

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.630
enough bombs to throw in the occasional

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:10.220
one don't think it's going to be a huge

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:13.010
coup for us or anything like that but

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.720
it's something or no why maybe luck is

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:17.450
tied to how many pennies we're getting

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:20.180
out of this straight-up matchbook is not

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:22.490
that good two bombs and a black heart

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:25.130
pretty poor return on our investment

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:27.980
here geez you know I guess we're going

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:30.620
for angel rooms dark Prince's crown I

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:32.480
would take it if we had the ability to

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:34.790
activate it right away but considering

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.470
how bad it is and how finicky it is I

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:38.300
don't think it's the right call so we're

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:40.070
going to go down and I mean we improved

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.410
our damage on this floor and we got

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:48.050
starter deck and we squandered a yellow

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:49.550
rune but all things considered you know

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:53.870
small rock is like the enduring legacy

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:55.310
here and maybe the luck upgrade and then

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:57.710
our deal with the angel chances which

00:09:55.310 --> 00:10:00.380
could pay dividends or could be garbage

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:03.440
I mean then I'm still like jaded like a

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:05.450
mid tier 2001 Aerosmith songs with a

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.910
video starring Mila Kunis before super

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:09.110
stardom although she was on that 70 show

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.220
of the time we need this even though

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.470
sometimes it'll give us a speed

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:14.780
downgrade and make me super angry we

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:18.130
need to take this and hope we get speed

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.130
upgrades on the rooms that are relevant

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:21.680
stars card

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.330
I mean it's boss rush enabler but I

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.790
think I kind of just want to use it

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:27.290
right now to give ourselves a crack at

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:29.240
the item room and hopefully gets

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.680
something that speeds up software makes

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:33.790
it less likely we get hit in general

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:37.040
so we get 5 extra bombs it's something

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:39.020
probably takes those closer to the boss

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.700
fight as well so we might put us on pace

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:43.070
for boss rush will get another teleport

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:45.339
card in all likelihood although also be

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:48.170
irrelevant here dude this is like

00:10:45.339 --> 00:10:50.720
incredible distraction at this point but

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:53.029
there we go I got Skype close now we're

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:55.760
good nothing could possibly interrupt us

00:10:53.029 --> 00:10:57.890
although our kitchen sink did break

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.990
earlier this week so it's it's not like

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:02.480
I'm living a life of chaos just a lot of

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:04.130
stuff going on here that was me turning

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:08.420
on cheatengine so we get a deal with the

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:10.399
angel of Godhead again I load the day

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.959
that one day I make that prediction

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:16.190
correctly and some people will take me

00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:21.649
seriously but but dude I would welcome

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:25.000
Godhead bomb for a key hey

00:11:21.649 --> 00:11:28.100
we're like we're close enough to even

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.589
and honestly this is like the least bad

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:32.740
that 0.6 speed has ever felt I think

00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:35.720
it's probably because we have mad HP

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:39.490
okay damage and like the spirit hard

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:42.910
action is out of control right now all

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:45.920
chain reaction it was like lightning

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:47.959
everybody was frightening and the music

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:51.950
was soothing so we all started grooving

00:11:47.959 --> 00:11:53.770
and so I've always said hey NL sweet

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:57.650
reference buddy

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:59.860
okay battery charge we did find a secret

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.860
room

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:08.620
kind of just want to bounce I do want to

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.170
go to the shop though like a champion

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.910
belt it's probably the item I have the

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:14.560
greatest like level of success in

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:16.990
predicting its champion Bell just

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.640
because there's not that many Shop items

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:21.630
relative to other pools so it tends to

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:24.100
show up decently frequently and also

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:26.080
often times you get two items on a shop

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:28.300
so you know you got double the chances

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:37.630
to look like a dangle genius excuse me

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:41.640
we've been here one but but how I don't

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:44.970
understand key bagger I do not care

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:47.650
chaos now that's an interesting item

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:51.250
chaos has given us another magician card

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:54.880
honestly not that good an ancient recall

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:58.030
which gives us three cards replace the

00:12:54.880 --> 00:13:02.670
magician with Eze go high priestess for

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:05.470
now now I want to get five more cents

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:07.450
good start we will get five more sense

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:10.570
actually ISM a better way to put that

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:11.920
because of a head of the keepers so that

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:15.610
will allow us to buy something from our

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:17.560
shop the Sun card is kind of the best

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.970
place to use it is next floor assuming

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:26.860
we don't get a third curse with a lost

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:30.339
in a row you know just got to modularize

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:32.380
this room every enemy is its own unique

00:13:30.339 --> 00:13:34.720
puzzle trick it into jumping to you and

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:36.790
then pick it up you know no problems

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.620
here we've already done that room still

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:44.230
a bomb for a key is not a particularly

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:47.710
strong trade no exit here I have no idea

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:51.550
where I'm going you've already been this

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:54.310
way okay you know would make this like

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:58.270
less tedious just throwing this out here

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:59.410
what if we had double the speed double

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:01.480
the speed is where I would start to

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.440
consider this like half decent like at

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:05.770
this point I don't even want to go back

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:09.700
to the shop is going to be backtracking

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:12.430
this annoying given the 0.6 speed at our

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:14.580
disposal and I do mean disposal in the

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:16.800
garbage variety

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.760
okay so now we got 16 cents we're going

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.580
to come back here

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:23.010
I don't think off the top of my head

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:25.290
there's no speed upgrade that you can

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:27.660
get from a shop obviously we haven't

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:28.709
been here which means this is probably

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:34.500
not the right way to go to get to the

00:14:28.709 --> 00:14:36.660
shop but I've lost my mind but we could

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.070
get again champion belt we only have

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.630
chaos so we could get a speed upgrade we

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:41.190
need a speed upgrade anywhere so we

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:43.829
really want to go hard on these rerolls

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:45.209
but also be selective because you could

00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:46.769
get any items just because you see a

00:14:45.209 --> 00:14:50.670
good quality shop item doesn't mean you

00:14:46.769 --> 00:14:53.990
should necessarily go nuts like you know

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:55.550
mom's purse whatever black bean

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:59.700
absolutely not

00:14:55.550 --> 00:15:01.500
bumbo for seven senses of temptress now

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:04.589
I'm do I look like the Lord of the Flies

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:09.380
to you my house caucus but let's get a

00:15:04.589 --> 00:15:09.380
little better your mom's eyes insulting

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:15.690
ki beggar is like don't waste my time

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:22.170
and then you have honestly you know I'll

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:23.790
be happy to wait so High Priestess card

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:30.510
I'm going to Ace of Spades it

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:33.390
give me these three keys back give me a

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:35.130
speed upgrade pill I'll write we have

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:41.040
the starter deck so gave us a card

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:43.529
instead well I mean I don't really think

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:47.910
the mom transformation is worth anything

00:15:43.529 --> 00:15:50.130
at all in this life or the next but we

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:53.660
basically paid seven cents to take a bad

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:55.770
item out of the pool while also getting

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:57.839
it's probably not worth it

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:59.250
while also getting a tarot card out of

00:15:57.839 --> 00:16:01.050
it so we paid two cents extra for a

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:02.850
tarot card working towards the mom

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:04.890
transformation isn't worth much but you

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:08.130
know two cents isn't worth much either

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:11.519
so you can see my my opinion here

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:13.050
hopefully I will never find my way out

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:16.470
of this floor this is where I'm going to

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:18.750
die of old age and 0.6 speed poisoning

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:20.310
most people don't believe that 0.6 speed

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:21.720
poisoning is a thing but dude I'm

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.279
feeling the ill effects on the human

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:25.820
body right now I'll tell you that much

00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:29.269
first off in the lays second off the

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:33.199
Pringles third off m'lady

00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:35.759
or sometimes not at all

00:16:33.199 --> 00:16:39.509
it's an Austin Powers joke I always

00:16:35.759 --> 00:16:41.669
thought it was interesting that Austin

00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:43.949
Powers international man of mystery in

00:16:41.669 --> 00:16:45.449
the first movie he makes a joke about

00:16:43.949 --> 00:16:47.279
not being able to bring a woman to

00:16:45.449 --> 00:16:49.079
orgasm now I'm not saying that's

00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:50.429
necessarily anything to be ashamed of

00:16:49.079 --> 00:16:54.329
you know it's important to be open about

00:16:50.429 --> 00:16:59.999
your sexual health Austin Powers but his

00:16:54.329 --> 00:17:02.279
associate a lot of fagina says in Japan

00:16:59.999 --> 00:17:04.259
men come first and women come second and

00:17:02.279 --> 00:17:06.720
then Mike Myers as Austin Powers says

00:17:04.259 --> 00:17:08.459
well sometimes not at all baby and

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:12.750
you're like that's clever but at the

00:17:08.459 --> 00:17:15.389
same time Austin Powers you trying to

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:17.339
seduce this lady not just so you can get

00:17:15.389 --> 00:17:19.649
a slice of that fine bird but also so

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:21.179
you can get the drill plans you know

00:17:19.649 --> 00:17:23.939
because you hear that cat number two's

00:17:21.179 --> 00:17:25.679
into big underground drills but I guess

00:17:23.939 --> 00:17:27.779
it really says a lot about Austin's

00:17:25.679 --> 00:17:30.120
wooing power that he's able to make a

00:17:27.779 --> 00:17:32.429
joke about his own sexual inadequacy and

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:34.289
then still you know she sleeps with him

00:17:32.429 --> 00:17:36.960
anyway although she might just be

00:17:34.289 --> 00:17:38.820
sleeping with him to counter it that's

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:40.169
the thing in these spy movies not that

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:42.929
you know I may not understand Austin

00:17:40.169 --> 00:17:46.409
Powers a satirical for parody at least

00:17:42.929 --> 00:17:48.629
but she's you know she might be sleeping

00:17:46.409 --> 00:17:51.000
with him to discover more you know

00:17:48.629 --> 00:17:56.100
reconnaissance about you know what his

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.970
operation is with Vanessa Kensington has

00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:01.529
got to be Kensington couldn't remember

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:03.690
Vanessa's last name how embarrassing

00:18:01.529 --> 00:18:05.460
couldn't afford afford a car so she

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:07.830
named her daughter Alexis I left those

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:10.440
three cents on the ground because the

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:13.679
serial point six speed poisoning we have

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:17.549
kirsta the loss again why have you

00:18:13.679 --> 00:18:20.250
forsaken me in my heart forsaken me in

00:18:17.549 --> 00:18:25.619
my own taro cloth disregard you have not

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:28.259
forsaken me draw three cards which will

00:18:25.619 --> 00:18:31.049
actually draw 6 cards you're a fun dull

00:18:28.259 --> 00:18:31.529
death do not care fool don't really care

00:18:31.049 --> 00:18:34.200
at this point

00:18:31.529 --> 00:18:39.059
temperance I'm in magician to a Hart's

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:41.669
dude okay this is our moneymaker ancient

00:18:39.059 --> 00:18:42.460
recall actually like a lovely choice

00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:43.990
right off the

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:46.810
at here if we're already going to spend

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:49.210
a hundred years here although 0.6 speed

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:50.470
poisoning has become less as a result of

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:53.320
the fact that we just got we got one

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:56.440
point to speed now okay so a sedan I'll

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:59.470
take a spear in ours first we got the

00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:02.710
full a sometimes we want the Sun you

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:05.860
want back into the room now you

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:07.690
understand this is absurd right used to

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:10.000
opening and closing the doors non-stop

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:11.350
you get up in to go to the cat hotel

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
that's right you're in the penthouse

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:16.270
you should be happy to spend your days

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.310
there ace of diamonds everything else

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:19.780
give me one single penny for these

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:21.970
things that are worth five cents each I

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:23.830
don't even care because I've gotten over

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:25.600
my zero point six speed poisoning I'm a

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:29.620
very happy camper right now you're going

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:31.420
to give me a third blood bag dare you

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:34.480
give me a third blood bag I'm the most

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:40.150
common Ruka they gave me a third blood

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:43.570
bag buddy 1.5 speed it's out of control

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:44.230
he doesn't care at all you don't care at

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:47.470
all do you

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:49.210
it's just a spectacle to you let the

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:54.070
cops cut off my balls because the cops

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:57.040
are always right glad that's the classic

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:59.830
why are you closed video Cadillac favor

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:05.230
you doesn't want me in are you crazy I

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:10.870
just walked over here back in that like

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:13.930
the g8 riot in Toronto we riot up here

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:16.270
sometimes man g8 ride Vancouver losing

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:17.950
the Stanley Cup Finals services

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:21.630
Canadians are polite I mean we know how

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:21.630
to throw a good riot from time to time

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:28.750
the Stanley Cup Finals riot probably

00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:30.220
should not have happened I'm a big

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:32.110
enough man to admit that I wasn't living

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:36.190
in Vancouver at the time in fact I had

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:38.919
never even been to Vancouver at up to

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:40.419
that point in my life but I think I can

00:20:38.919 --> 00:20:42.760
say if someone who's lived here for like

00:20:40.419 --> 00:20:46.600
six years now or almost six years now

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:49.000
probably that was stupid in hindsight it

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.919
was just a hockey game I mean as the

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.600
franchise been doomed to mediocrity

00:20:50.919 --> 00:20:58.990
ever since yes the sighing the riot

00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:01.899
fixed that it just made us the butt of a

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:04.000
joke see you nice property prices

00:21:01.899 --> 00:21:06.309
Vancouver what are you going to do they

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.940
throw a riot over it it's a national

00:21:06.309 --> 00:21:13.860
embarrassment at this point like I would

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:13.860
say I didn't even live here you jerks I

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:22.240
thought that that was actually a stony

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:24.159
but it's not dude I'm begging you give

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:28.750
me the speed and for that I respect you

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:30.970
can you stop giving me curse of the lost

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:32.440
then we use the song car we accomplish

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:35.049
great things we already know it's going

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:39.630
to be a slow run that's okay slow run

00:21:35.049 --> 00:21:41.889
take it easy done done it then innit

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:43.600
there's no need to use that once and we

00:21:41.889 --> 00:21:45.519
definitely like do not care about

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:49.480
getting more HP we got so much on this

00:21:45.519 --> 00:21:51.970
floor there's a pretty sick deal but I'm

00:21:49.480 --> 00:22:00.760
gonna tell you I'm gonna re-roll infamy

00:21:51.970 --> 00:22:03.779
and I'm reroll infamy because that's a

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.779
tough choice isn't there

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:10.940
that's a tough choice I'm reroll infamy

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:12.110
because I wanted something better and we

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:13.070
didn't get anything immediate well

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.540
actually we did give something

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:16.490
immediately better in the form of the

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:23.360
pact but I took copies Collard instead

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:27.050
but you know the dream here that we

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:29.510
actually pick up that last guppy item we

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:32.440
need 15 cents ish to make that work

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:39.890
obviously seven might work in some

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:41.090
unique scenarios we got eight but I

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:42.830
don't really want to use so we have

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:44.690
unlimited bombs but because they don't

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:45.800
really want to use bombs to do the

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:48.830
reroll there if we don't have to I just

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:52.280
punch my microphone my apologies

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:53.510
just cuz i'm so flippin mad the word 21

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:58.700
minutes here i can't find my way around

00:22:53.510 --> 00:23:02.290
this floor for the life of me dude like

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:02.290
obviously we bend down this direction

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:09.890
set our shop that is there let's just

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:12.500
get our reroll all the way and see if

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:16.429
there's a guppy item wery rolled a 15

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:18.640
cent packs into a seven cent pact that's

00:23:16.429 --> 00:23:23.480
actually like the greatest thing that's

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:28.550
ever happened to us so now our stats

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:30.410
improved even more can I get a black

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:36.920
rune please so I can actually know where

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:39.920
I'm going bombs there's no chance you're

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:41.650
going to give me a fourth blood bag on

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:47.270
the same floor it's just not

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:50.240
scientifically plausible I would love it

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:52.640
one point eight-speed don't mind if I do

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.110
we can go down to zero HP as far as I'm

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.510
concerned because unless we get a fourth

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:58.309
curse of the lost in a row we're going

00:23:56.510 --> 00:24:01.070
to pop the sun card and we're going to

00:23:58.309 --> 00:24:03.610
use the sun card the map but also give

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:03.610
us full health

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:12.580
I mean this run is is a new archetype

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:17.050
seems to be showing up a little bit more

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:18.700
frequently in in Isaac it's the one run

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:26.830
that just for whatever reason happens to

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:30.150
be ungodly slow I wish you didn't exist

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:32.350
it offends me on a daily basis when I

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:34.570
have a great run that just takes a

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:41.800
hundred years to get to where it's going

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:44.980
but you know what just give me that give

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:46.240
me magic mush there's got to be at this

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.350
point by the time you finish this run

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.090
you're going to owe me a gold watch you

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:51.070
see the choke there is a gold watch is

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:52.420
typically given after 25 to 50 years of

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:55.840
experience in a company followed by a

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:57.690
retirement and that's how long I feel

00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:00.420
like I've been on this run although

00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:03.280
obviously that's ridiculous because I'm

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:06.070
you know I'm only 28 years old look at

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:08.380
that it's our fourth blood bag on the

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:10.180
same floor we're at 1.8 speed we

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:17.170
literally tripled our speed on a single

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:17.830
floor it's madness and yet at the same

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:20.920
time

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:28.840
never in my life of I felt like a slower

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:30.640
boy all right let's go see so be a great

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:34.230
opportunity to experience these

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:37.510
so-called you know new deals with the

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:39.940
angel which still continue to not exist

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:44.290
you've got to pay one heart for 99 bombs

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:46.300
that's just science definitely you don't

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:47.560
care about that pretty much we don't

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:49.090
care about this either because we might

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:51.370
as well at this point we're gonna have a

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:52.750
99 year long run we might as well fight

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:58.110
mega Satan at the end of it fairly you

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:58.110
know maximum maximum credit basically

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:03.760
given the amount of money we have and

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:05.740
the fact that we have 97 bombs remaining

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:08.760
say there's a pretty good chance that we

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:10.750
find guppy here as long as we don't get

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:12.610
well I mean we need a rerolls

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:18.880
machine on the shop and then on top of

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:20.020
that if we could not have greed which I

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.160
mean I guess you can't have a reroll

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:25.360
machine if you have greed to begin with

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:28.270
and we do have green but steam sale is

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:29.980
pretty much worthless because we're rich

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:31.360
and there's only one shop remaining

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:33.280
because there's no chance for us for us

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:35.830
to ever fight guppy and by guppy I mean

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:37.570
Hoshi and by Hoshi I mean hush and by

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:39.610
hush I mean you know that boss becomes

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:41.770
okay with him the point of absurdity you

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:43.810
get to get the concept of the joke here

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:45.520
good stuff you know really want

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:51.820
counterfeit penny but we didn't want

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:54.130
that key from the inside there nice to

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:57.670
not have curse of the loss for once like

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:59.920
we really are spoiled on this floor to

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:02.650
know where we're going and to be able to

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:05.380
get there and not you know a million

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:07.780
seconds I'll tell you what what's the

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:11.110
good point of having dad's key if we

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:13.240
can't use it properly to skip rooms that

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:14.980
are mildly annoying because my you know

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:18.670
they've got a short fuse as a result of

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:22.270
our amount of time spent on this run so

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:25.240
far it's like the average length of a

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:26.770
dead cells run is less than the amount

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:31.120
of time we spend getting to the boss

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:34.380
life here that was a bad two of clubs

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:34.380
play and I should feel bad

00:27:40.289 --> 00:27:45.820
maybe you think that's funny just

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:47.830
sitting at home in your ivory towers you

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:51.100
don't know what it's like on the ground

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:54.519
here okay struggling you got 99 bombs

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:59.139
the game goes another ten more bombs

00:27:54.519 --> 00:28:02.740
that's an insult no I don't want another

00:27:59.139 --> 00:28:06.700
mint julep I already had a mint julep

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:07.809
now I want a Moscow Mule you idiot I

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:11.710
don't know where I'm going with this

00:28:07.809 --> 00:28:17.049
dude at this point come on five blood

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:20.529
bags that would be crazy I refuse to

00:28:17.049 --> 00:28:22.029
believe that five blood bags is a world

00:28:20.529 --> 00:28:25.259
that will exist here I'm using reverse

00:28:22.029 --> 00:28:30.490
psychology okay they gave us IV bag

00:28:25.259 --> 00:28:32.559
which is actually like acceptable except

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:34.330
I still want to keep dad's key on this

00:28:32.559 --> 00:28:37.269
round we haven't really used it for its

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:41.080
ultimate purpose yet so we'll just keep

00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:42.490
jamming out many consumables as we can

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:46.059
get here I mean it is still plausible

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:48.129
that we could die on this run our HP is

00:28:46.059 --> 00:28:50.110
low and our our stats are not that good

00:28:48.129 --> 00:28:53.649
our HP is amazing but our other stats

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:55.090
are not necessarily crushing it like it

00:28:53.649 --> 00:28:56.440
would be not speaking of crushing it

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:57.909
definitely going to use High Priestesses

00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:02.379
if this is a boss that's even mildly

00:28:57.909 --> 00:29:04.629
annoying but careful careful

00:29:02.379 --> 00:29:06.429
we could use some more damage this is a

00:29:04.629 --> 00:29:10.870
boss that is more than mildly annoying

00:29:06.429 --> 00:29:14.590
so I'm extremely pleased able to skip

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:19.179
the the real nasty stuff damage but the

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:25.840
soul is a really nice pickup basically I

00:29:19.179 --> 00:29:27.340
think like more absolute damage would be

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:29.110
swell but we've been trolled a little

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:30.730
bit on this run and the curse of the

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:34.480
blind gives us a chance to be trolled to

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:37.870
the extreme it's weird because like in

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:39.549
real life I actually I like curse of the

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:42.970
blind it's gonna sound we I don't like

00:29:39.549 --> 00:29:44.139
you know being vision impaired that's

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:45.940
not what I'm trying to suggest that

00:29:44.139 --> 00:29:47.259
would be insensitive but I talked about

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:49.330
this on the LSS and people actually

00:29:47.259 --> 00:29:51.250
asked you know not the stigma

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:54.340
mental illness but they're like is it is

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:59.440
NL okay when I go to a restaurant I

00:29:54.340 --> 00:30:02.440
don't typically look at the menu very

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:04.590
much I just like cuz I think like you

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:06.700
look at a menu we've got 20 things on it

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:07.540
what does it matter you know you're

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.310
going to you're going to talk yourself

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:13.510
into it out of like so many different

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:15.430
things oh do I want the bourbon burger

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:17.530
oh I don't know the Bison steak sounds

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:19.600
good everything sounds good it's a menu

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:21.850
that's what it's designed for so

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.290
typically I just you know Kate decides

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:25.330
on whatever she wants and if she wants

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:27.850
to get something to share to begin or

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:29.860
even there's an entree then we you know

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:31.990
we talk it over get over the Geneva

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:34.140
Convention there I almost made it out of

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:34.140
that one

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:40.570
but then if I'm ordering like just for

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:42.760
myself I don't look at the menu until

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:44.590
the server comes back and then I just

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.540
sort of pop it open you know look at the

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:47.950
main section of the menu and go all

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:52.120
right I'll have one that sounds good

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:53.770
I'll have that I like I live the Seine

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.330
in real life I guess is what I'm trying

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:56.230
to say we should definitely play the

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:58.030
bomb beggar

00:30:56.230 --> 00:31:00.100
she doesn't happen that often but

00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:06.190
doesn't even show up that often to be

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:07.720
fair what a great idea what if there's

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:09.550
an enemy not an enemy what are there's a

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:11.320
familiar we're not really familiar what

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:13.180
if there was a slot machine you put

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:16.390
bombs into it and it gives you a chance

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:19.000
to get bombs back what a novel concept

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:20.920
oh I've given him a bomb he has not

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.050
given me I've given him a bomb and he's

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:25.420
just eating it the rascal look at this

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:29.400
he's so hungry for bomb say I give he

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:31.660
gave me two bombs for my bomb and

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:33.750
finally pays that with mom's pearls and

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:36.380
our mom transformation is complete but

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:40.580
what do you got for me buddy

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:44.540
I like I like to roll in the rear old

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:51.560
button in real life caryl clock is so

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:55.900
good dude I don't really have like a

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:58.040
further justification for my actions

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:59.420
except that I don't know I don't think

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.830
there's like an optimal way to order off

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:04.130
a menu because everything sounds good

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:05.840
the one over set 99 sad bombs is great

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:07.160
here the one exception to that is I

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:09.110
think if you're going to a place that's

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:11.960
famous or something and you don't

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:13.430
dislike what they're famous for you have

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.930
an obligation to get with they're famous

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:16.490
for it so if you're going to a place is

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:18.050
like you know Nathan's Famous hot dogs

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:19.220
and then you look at the menu and you're

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:20.570
looking at something that's not a hot

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:21.890
dog I'm not going to tell you how to

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:24.820
live your life but I think that you're

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:27.290
missing out on an optimal order there

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:28.730
you know there's a restaurant in

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:30.650
Vancouver called peaceful restaurant

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:33.650
it's famous for these peaceful beef

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:36.380
rolls it's like Chinese style pancake

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:38.600
with marinated sweet beef in between the

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:40.790
folds it's delicious Guy Fieri profile

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:43.250
that is highly critical review show

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:44.810
diners drive-ins and dives if you're

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:46.730
going to peaceful restaurant for the

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:49.250
first time and you're going what's good

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:50.750
here I don't really like the concept of

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:52.190
that peace will be Ferol just go down

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:57.080
the streets of the McDonald's on West

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:58.730
4th okay you're wasting your time unless

00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:00.440
you know you really like the soy garlic

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:02.210
spareribs or something like which is

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.800
acceptable you know it's also delicious

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:08.740
so it wouldn't be the coffee's head

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:10.850
let's go we're in this to win this now

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:13.970
but apart from that he was going to a

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:16.160
restaurant and it's like you know Paul's

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:18.410
restaurant you know what give me the

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:21.230
third entree I haven't even looked at

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:26.450
the menu assuming the third entree is in

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:28.310
you know human waste I'll take I'll give

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:29.750
it a try I'll try anything once is why I

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:32.870
find it funny people say I'm a picky

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:33.890
eater anytime I go to a restaurant

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:35.270
especially if it's like a special

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:38.030
occasion because it's normally like a

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:40.250
pretty like a fancy restaurant thing but

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:42.590
if the restaurant or the server is like

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:44.360
you know we have a chef's menu where for

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:47.480
like X amount of dollars we'll just give

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:48.860
you like three random courses I'm like

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:52.400
I'll take that every

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:54.080
time choose for me I don't care if it's

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:55.309
the specials that you couldn't sell I

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:58.790
want them

00:33:55.309 --> 00:34:00.890
oh god those were Yaris dude that's cool

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:05.390
though as you see that we blank rune

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:08.510
used two differents we're going to take

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:10.820
the black runes obviously but blank rune

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:14.389
used two different runes when we popped

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:19.010
it that's kind of cool so this run is

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:20.929
like we will win it took a while to get

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:23.050
to this point but like okay well now

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:25.100
honestly a win is slightly less

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:27.350
guaranteed now but we're still probably

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:29.060
going to win Rawdon baby's great book if

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:31.369
sin takes us closer to bookworm at least

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:32.960
and then we do have a reroll machine

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:34.100
which is amazing we're not going to be

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.899
able to fight hush so it's almost

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:39.490
impossible for us to accidentally mess

00:34:35.899 --> 00:34:42.379
this one up and then if we get a lot of

00:34:39.490 --> 00:34:48.530
active items like these for example

00:34:42.379 --> 00:34:52.369
there's bookworm we will just black ruin

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:53.480
them money equals power all right I

00:34:52.369 --> 00:34:55.520
think we should just black her in these

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:56.869
and that was a nice little statistical

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:58.310
increase there and then we got a little

00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:59.990
tool clubs to go along with it so we

00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:06.070
have unlimited sad bombs effectively

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:08.150
though pretty sweet so yeah I mean if I

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:09.619
I'm not saying you should make this your

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:14.390
business model because I think the some

00:35:09.619 --> 00:35:15.800
extent I'm an aberrant customer but if

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:17.600
there was a menu item that said

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:19.970
literally just pick this and we'll

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:21.859
choose what to feed you most of the time

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:23.750
I would probably take it and it's not

00:35:21.859 --> 00:35:25.760
because I'm a little baby who doesn't

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:28.850
know what he likes you know I know what

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:31.070
I like I just don't know what's good at

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:33.290
your restaurant and I also it is my own

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:34.820
personal foible admittedly I don't trust

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:36.500
when you go to a restaurant you talk to

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.550
somebody go was good I don't think

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:40.790
they're going to give you something

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:44.840
that's bad necessarily but I just don't

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:47.150
think that oh my god we killed it but

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:50.119
your pet killed them I just don't think

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:51.920
that necessarily their taste lineup

00:35:50.119 --> 00:35:53.270
right like I have to go and this is

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:55.040
approaching absurdity if we haven't

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:56.900
already crossed that bridge ages ago but

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:58.670
I have to be like tell me what do you

00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:00.660
like and then what do you like here I

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:02.190
feel like all I'm a vegetarian and I

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:05.190
think lino like the mushroom burgers

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:06.630
good I'd be like you know what send over

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:08.460
the meat-eating waiter I'm in the mood

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:10.200
to be carnivorous tonight I appreciate

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:13.920
and respect your lifestyle choices but

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:17.400
your your selection is not what I'm

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:20.460
going to have here like I remember once

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:22.289
the king of this is Michael al Fox just

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:25.589
to preface this story I went to

00:36:22.289 --> 00:36:32.010
McDonald's with Michael al Fox and Kate

00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:33.059
and we I order an mi olivet MP chicken

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:37.289
nugget or some way I know remember it

00:36:33.059 --> 00:36:39.000
was like four years ago and then Kate

00:36:37.289 --> 00:36:41.520
orders whatever she ordered a mouth goes

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.230
up and he goes mmm what's good here

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.700
it's a presser eyes I mean I use

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:46.980
restaurant loosely but you know it's a

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:48.450
place he's eaten at a hundred thousand

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:50.579
times but he's like well what's your

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:52.079
favorite thing here and he's expecting

00:36:50.579 --> 00:36:53.910
her to say like oh I like the Big Mac

00:36:52.079 --> 00:36:55.980
instead she's like I usually get a

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:58.289
strawberry milkshake at a chicken Snack

00:36:55.980 --> 00:37:00.030
Wrap and he's like all right I'll take

00:36:58.289 --> 00:37:01.829
one of those like the stupid guy's

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:04.980
shoehorn himself in eating it

00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:05.970
and I don't know if he was pleased with

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:11.849
the outcome I don't know if he's

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:13.920
displeased you'll have to ask him but it

00:37:11.849 --> 00:37:15.799
was it was a good experience a fun time

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:18.839
was had by all especially the people

00:37:15.799 --> 00:37:22.049
next to him during this experience um I

00:37:18.839 --> 00:37:24.680
mean I'm just gonna black ruin it it's

00:37:22.049 --> 00:37:26.760
not like we have to but the run is so

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:28.859
unbelievably strong at this point and

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:33.150
dude like full-on mapping I'm so excited

00:37:28.859 --> 00:37:34.770
this run went from slow to fast really

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:37.099
quickly and for that like I'm eternally

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:37.099
grateful

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:46.720
so 2a diamonds means good but we will

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:48.190
never be able to make it to hush on this

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:48.670
one - a diamonds to a diamonds Ace of

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:50.799
Spades

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:53.950
well we should - a diamonds twice oh we

00:37:50.799 --> 00:37:57.579
already have Tarot cloths so the two of

00:37:53.950 --> 00:38:00.940
diamonds is actually like four of

00:37:57.579 --> 00:38:02.559
diamonds which is a strange expression

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:04.299
to say what's wrong with that Mouse

00:38:02.559 --> 00:38:06.579
story by the way I don't know it's just

00:38:04.299 --> 00:38:07.960
you it's putting on airs there's

00:38:06.579 --> 00:38:12.789
something the same night we were at a

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:14.559
bar and you know we were splitting

00:38:12.789 --> 00:38:16.660
rounds with one another alternating

00:38:14.559 --> 00:38:19.000
rounds rather and then you know it's his

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:20.530
turn to buy and the bartender comes over

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.900
and mouths like well what do you like

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:25.390
here and the guys I usually have like a

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:27.039
glass of Jameson neat and he's like all

00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:28.780
right two of those do doesn't like

00:38:27.039 --> 00:38:31.720
scotch it's just it's straight alcohol

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:34.210
so if you haven't cultured to taste for

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:36.039
it it's poison basically you got a the

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:37.569
thing with you know acquired taste like

00:38:36.039 --> 00:38:39.839
that basically you're like I know it's

00:38:37.569 --> 00:38:43.059
poison but like like it after a while

00:38:39.839 --> 00:38:45.640
I'm not insulting scotch by the way you

00:38:43.059 --> 00:38:47.619
know I like a nice glass of neat scotch

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:49.420
or whiskey or scotch whiskey for that

00:38:47.619 --> 00:38:52.180
matter know the terminology as well as I

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:54.160
would like to I'm not a I'm not a a mult

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:56.319
head way to Pete head I don't know what

00:38:54.160 --> 00:39:00.119
they say okay probably the Scotch lover

00:38:56.319 --> 00:39:02.440
is the best way to put it

00:39:00.119 --> 00:39:04.690
Scotch lover sounds like a Nick Cave

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:08.400
song though maybe that's a good thing

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:13.029
let's keep this I want spirit hearts

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:15.130
we're getting milled the dude just like

00:39:13.029 --> 00:39:18.309
set their nurse in this glass of scotch

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:20.710
for like the next hour and a half he

00:39:18.309 --> 00:39:22.539
doesn't like you TV in a way it's very

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:24.640
brave eyo pijn themself up to failure

00:39:22.539 --> 00:39:27.730
and then experienced it firsthand but I

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:30.670
don't know that what's good here maybe

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:32.140
you can backfire I think it works and

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:35.410
I'm not saying Mike is a picky eater

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:37.790
either he's got broad tastes but I'll

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:40.040
eat anything

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:43.580
if you if I went to a good restaurant

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:45.980
and they literally brought out like Stu

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:49.070
served in a garbage bag I would be like

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:51.230
look that's a little ridiculous but I am

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:53.840
going to give it a try ooh nice depth of

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:56.960
flavor you know what the heck hit me

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:57.500
there we should not die if this results

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.790
in our death

00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:06.230
something has gone horribly horribly

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:08.720
wrong even at 1 hp we should be like in

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:16.030
assailable on this run

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:18.710
Oh Bobby that is actually just so bad

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:20.090
okay get your head in the game here

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:22.940
there's no reason to be losing this many

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:24.980
lives lose another couple and I'm gonna

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:26.210
start to worry about our our chances

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:31.070
here you gotta pay attention to the

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:32.660
beams man I just think I'm you know you

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:34.520
might be saying well what if what have

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:35.780
you say just give me whatever not that I

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:37.040
would never go to a restaurant and be

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:38.450
like just give me whatever by the way

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:41.240
unless they have that option on the menu

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:42.740
because it opens it puts too much

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.890
liability on the server what do they

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:46.970
bring you something you're allergic to

00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:48.380
obviously you're an idiot for letting

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:51.890
them order for you in the first place in

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:56.750
that case but you know still let's get

00:40:51.890 --> 00:41:01.010
some HP and then try to fight mega Satan

00:40:56.750 --> 00:41:05.900
here guess we can use homing x' here's

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:13.750
give me cards please what but we already

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:15.860
got mom's contacts that's strange but I

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:17.810
forgot what I was saying it doesn't

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:19.040
matter I would never go to a restaurant

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:21.800
and do that I guess what I'm trying to

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:24.050
say but I kind of like I simulate that

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:25.850
on my own I'm just as you might be say

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:27.320
what does it bring you the entree salad

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:28.610
when you wanted meat well if I want to

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:30.320
meet I would overtime

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:32.030
do most so I gotta be honest with you

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:35.630
I'm going to a place that allows me to

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:37.330
substitute fries for a Caesar salad sign

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:39.950
me up

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:41.990
NL do you know that a Caesar salad is

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:45.830
not necessarily good for you of course

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:49.220
that's why I love it it's like it's fat

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:52.039
and like bread

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:54.530
sometimes bacon Parmesan Reggiano cheese

00:41:52.039 --> 00:41:55.880
is delicious so I just I don't know how

00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:58.730
deep I want to go on this you only got

00:41:55.880 --> 00:42:01.640
three lives left here but I figured if

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:03.920
we're at 1 hp it's not even brave -

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:06.430
potato peeled it gives the appearance of

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:12.260
bravery but it's not brave it's just

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:13.549
correct I know by the way it's starting

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:14.780
to get a trickle in the comments he's

00:42:13.549 --> 00:42:16.099
going to die how is he going to lose

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:18.170
this run I can't believe he's going to

00:42:16.099 --> 00:42:20.750
lose spare me

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:23.720
we might not fight mega Satan because

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:34.190
our HP is low but if we get like 2 HP I

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:36.740
will fight mega same conceivably I think

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:38.960
we could beat mega Satan with 1 HP I

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:42.260
just don't necessarily want to invite

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:43.670
that evil into my life right away I was

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:45.319
thinking with 3 luck we got a good

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:47.950
chance to get some extra items and

00:42:45.319 --> 00:42:47.950
there's one right there

00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:56.079
Book Of Shadows is like real sweet

00:42:57.769 --> 00:43:05.190
gimpy with three luck is really good but

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:06.479
we need to get the spirit hours before

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:07.589
we go in there otherwise we get it once

00:43:06.479 --> 00:43:08.430
we're going to die whether it's pond

00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:12.739
Spirit eyes or not

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:15.499
Oh curved horn four plus two damage

00:43:12.739 --> 00:43:18.119
don't mind if I do

00:43:15.499 --> 00:43:19.470
and dude this is the run that has me

00:43:18.119 --> 00:43:21.809
feeling like I'm back in the saddle

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:24.509
again like it wasn't a tough run it was

00:43:21.809 --> 00:43:27.509
slow and now we're on one HP and I feel

00:43:24.509 --> 00:43:30.479
no terror in my life whatsoever like

00:43:27.509 --> 00:43:34.489
this is just a nice run basically a

00:43:30.479 --> 00:43:38.700
nalgas rune is also an instant win

00:43:34.489 --> 00:43:40.739
especially with taro cloth like with our

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:42.420
stats it'll last us the whole run or the

00:43:40.739 --> 00:43:48.239
whole fight whether it's blue baby or

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:54.420
mega satan but we've got one HP right

00:43:48.239 --> 00:43:56.609
here I say we give it a shot but let's

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:58.940
do our last like three or four rooms

00:43:56.609 --> 00:43:58.940
here

00:44:00.869 --> 00:44:07.099
the idea being you know with 4.0 7 lakh

00:44:03.749 --> 00:44:07.099
I'm expecting some items

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:18.920
you still have 93 sad bombs which is

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:21.950
actually like 160 something sad bombs

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:23.839
because we can get down to 25 and then

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:25.010
you all we've lost to a club somewhere

00:44:23.839 --> 00:44:27.619
but hey the point is we're not going to

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:29.299
use 160 bombs on the fight regard we're

00:44:27.619 --> 00:44:31.809
not going to use 20 sad bombs on the Bob

00:44:29.299 --> 00:44:31.809
site probably

00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:39.260
yeah let's give it a try I think with

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:41.900
invincibility we should be okay

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:51.490
the real catch will be like if we get

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:53.930
hit once but we get the payout from

00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:56.060
gimpy I don't know why I had to think of

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:58.040
like the five different moving parts

00:44:56.060 --> 00:45:00.230
there if we can get hit once as long as

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:02.120
the payout gives us the gimpy payout

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:07.240
gives us a spirit heart like if that's

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:12.110
the case where we're sitting pretty

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:15.200
really like this wave is a joke and then

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:19.190
for the next wave it's all about proper

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:26.540
sad bombs usage and I popped a book of

00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:28.670
shadows as well actually like a fairly

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:30.260
highly suboptimal book of shadows play

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:33.590
but at least it lasted us the whole wave

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:37.670
then we'll get angel statues one sad

00:45:33.590 --> 00:45:43.040
bomb Plus like two hits should mess up

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:46.280
the Angels pretty good this guy stands

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:49.130
literally no chance yeah we should be

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:52.010
totally fine this run got crazy strong

00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:54.980
I'm very happy with that we'll drop a

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:59.690
little bomb up here get him frozen and

00:45:54.980 --> 00:46:02.300
drop another sad bomb up there double

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:05.060
mom's mom's contact not mom's contact

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:08.900
that's I don't know this a really racist

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:10.790
joke about Jamaica or a really lewd joke

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:11.930
about the anatomical name of the mound

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:13.370
above your pubis

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:14.600
for now though thanks for watching hope
