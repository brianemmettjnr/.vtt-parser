00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.179
hey everybody welcome back to normal and

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.670
plays The Binding of Isaac after birth

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.200
plus we've been I thought that said

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.870
continue and I was about to lose my

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.340
freakin mind man no we've been playing

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.710
alright lately this could be a keeper

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.830
run its apollyon

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.940
that is close to a keeper run but it's

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.380
not a keeper run and we start with

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.619
capricorn thanks to our last team whose

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.680
blessing thank God 0 9 1 e RR 9 s let's

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.470
go

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.240
I'm excited apollyon a regular character

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.579
Lee I can take or leave the character

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.380
cap record great starting item and the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.450
thing that makes a apollyon dope is the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.610
void now unfortunately I don't know how

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.920
much good my detonators going to do for

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.890
us with the void but this a labyrinth

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.879
floor it's not we definitely like won

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.420
the lottery in terms of the starting

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.780
items like capricorn is one of the best

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:02.609
possible items we well it's in the top

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.080
like 5% I'd say there's a lot of really

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.570
good items in this game sometimes I

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.939
forget that there's like at least a few

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.439
items that can pretty much if not win

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.909
you the game give you a great start and

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.450
this is definitely one of them like this

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.970
isn't your dad being Bill Gates

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.310
necessarily this is like your dad being

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.960
he owns like eight subways in your

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.409
hometown like you got it you're going to

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.850
be pretty well-off for your existence as

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.900
a youth and then you've got time and

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.759
you're young until years to figure

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.710
things out and let's be honest on your

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.439
sixteenth birthday he's probably gonna

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.820
give you one of the subways anyway and

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.350
even if you run it into the ground who's

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.390
gonna knock you out of business Quiznos

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.869
they've been dropping like flies out

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.180
here might not be true in in all of the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.640
world but Quiznos you know they made a

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.540
big splash when they came to Canada it

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.640
was like we just had Subway and mr. sub

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.430
mr. sub was like you wanted like a plain

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.380
white bread ham sandwich we got from the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.360
grocery store here you go that's a

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.610
little bit insulting but they are a

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.619
slight cut above that so we got a subway

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.119
it was like oh my god subway you know

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.160
we're really getting into the new era

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.800
here then we got Quiznos we were like

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.720
toasted subs and then subway said hey do

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.600
you want to toast our subs and we were

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.550
like yo sub

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.150
competition is the spirit of capitalism

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:23.050
here and then Quiznos was like we didn't

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.490
expect that so ever since then it hurts

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.980
me deep in my soul because I was a

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.140
Quiznos boy as a teenager the Quiznos

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:35.320
locations here have not been crushing it

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:37.840
lately confirmed either way I'm running

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.490
out of sandwich places man Quiznos is

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.600
like in Vancouver at least it's derelict

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.670
Subway's trying to sue the Canadian

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.880
taxpayer like why is it just to make

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.440
sandwiches bad why does the business

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.910
have to be so difficult now it's all

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.860
about making those commercials where you

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.990
got them weird little fuzzy animals

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.460
going eek with no sobs I know you guys

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.920
saw those in your younger don't leave me

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.540
out to dry on that one the easy response

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.340
would be for you to just type dot dot

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.780
dot and then leave me thinking oh crap

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.580
that i overstepped my bounds but i know

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.710
you're going to respond to that one and

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.160
not leave me hanging thanks for full

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:14.430
health

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:19.060
thanks for infamy thanks for the gift of

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.320
infamy cuz you're once twice three times

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:27.180
a lady

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:33.340
I only know three times the lady because

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:35.830
it's sung in Garden State and I was into

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.010
that movie in eleventh and twelfth grade

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.600
and then I watched it as an adult and I

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.140
was like it's pretty good but it's a

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:47.170
little overly precious is like no

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.390
offense Zach Braff you know I was I was

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.980
reading up on that movie non-stop I was

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.950
like I hope it comes to theaters outside

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.240
of NYC in LA and then eventually it did

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.770
but you know I'm like I'm not driving

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.870
two hours to see Garden State so I got

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.180
it on DVD and I was everything I can ask

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.300
for and more and then you know watched

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.760
it as an adult I was like maybe this is

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.260
a little too precious but you're with

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.910
your welcome to disagree with me on that

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.950
one

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:15.220
we're going to take a missing page and

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.739
we are absolutely going to suck up this

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.989
now the danger what not danger but that

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.300
the relatively bad thing about sucking

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.430
up the we want a battery charge quickly

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.250
if possible the relatively bad thing

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.410
about sucking up this item is that in

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.000
makes us want to use it on bosses which

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.800
means that we can't use it to suck up

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.620
other items so you know there's always

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.240
that kind of pull in two different

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.750
directions with void it's like if you

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.390
suck up good space bar items then you

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.600
want to use those space bar items in

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.190
aggregate with one another on important

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:53.080
rooms or you know on any room for that

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:54.640
matter which unfortunately usually makes

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.750
it impossible for you to suck up items

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.220
you know would be a really good synergy

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.780
for this if we have the HP to make it

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.540
work

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.390
sharp plug then we could use a full

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:08.530
charge and pay two HP to get another

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:10.240
full charge from zero that we could use

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.560
to suck up items after we finish the

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.080
boss fight you know it's an interesting

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.480
proposition so we don't really want to

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:21.310
suck anything up here we might as well

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.870
just take and take and I do want

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:28.810
consumables but I'm okay gunning for

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:31.090
stats so let's go it was a damage in

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.860
speed upgrade which is basically to be

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.270
honest with you almost as good as it

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.790
gets it would be nice to have a serious

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:41.440
upgrade along with it but sadly we'd not

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:42.850
so we will just proceed instead one of

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.740
those might be full health but that

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:52.479
might as well be dead to me at this

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:56.169
point of the game grab this and really

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:57.700
we're off to the races here I don't know

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.580
it's one of those idioms I don't

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.660
understand off to the races I've never

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.950
been to a racetrack

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:08.320
I feel like media has really done a bad

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.240
job of representing the opportunities as

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.950
an adult to go to a race track not only

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.470
if I'd never been to a race track I have

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.900
never had someone asked me if I wanted

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.150
to go to the race track I don't know if

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.650
horse racing is legal in Canada like

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.020
betting on horse racing at least I don't

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:27.540
know if it's legal it's just a casino

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:30.010
for horses right it's not a casino like

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.780
that horses go into and go like weird

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.419
when they're like sir I recommend you

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.099
stay and they say I also like to live

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:39.750
dangerously from the first Austin Powers

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:39.750
film they're big fans of Mike Myers

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.590
but it's like you go there and you bet

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.320
on oh it's like a gambling thing right

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.880
right root good the horse-racing or do

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:53.590
you go to appreciate the majesty of the

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:55.480
animal I don't know I've been to casinos

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:59.410
probably in my adult life I have

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:01.570
probably been to the casino like 10

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:04.960
times is my guess like with the

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:06.520
intention of gambling a little bit but I

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.889
always end up I'm unlike the worst

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.389
gambler I'm not like a problem gambler I

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:13.390
just have a problem with gambling which

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:15.790
is that like if I were to win $50 I'm

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:18.190
like this doesn't really change quality

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:20.110
of my life that much and if I lose $50 I

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.930
think to myself I'm a piece of garbage

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:25.810
that $50 I could have bought you know I

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.220
could have bought prey they didn't send

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.150
me a code they just sent me a moldy

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:33.430
banana in the mail it's insulting but

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:37.750
yeah that's why I don't think I'd make a

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:40.080
good problem gambler I'm not making

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:42.639
light of the situation I understand the

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.110
neurochemical poll that like gambling

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:48.340
can have on people I'm just saying for

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:49.570
me personally going a lot of a salt in

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.180
Las Vegas because I've done enough of

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:54.520
that over the past year or something on

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:56.110
in these videos but man it's not a place

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.060
for me like when I'm in Las Vegas and I

00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:01.240
see people having fun I'm like how

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:03.789
though you got a bud light in your hands

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:06.330
9:00 a.m. you telling a story about how

00:08:03.789 --> 00:08:08.919
you lost $1,000 that's like the worst

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:11.289
you've created my own personal nightmare

00:08:08.919 --> 00:08:12.930
because I'm a hipster and I need to

00:08:11.289 --> 00:08:15.280
drink craft beer instead of that

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:17.260
macrobrewery stuff what do you take me

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.760
for and then also 9:00 a.m. come on dude

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.620
I'm a streamer I sleep up till late and

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.110
then you lost $1,000 in years you got a

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.370
smile on your face I'm losing my mind

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.470
anyway we're going to take this

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:28.680
obviously I think we should take this as

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:28.680
well

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:36.490
no more they need to take advantage of

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:40.210
that we didn't go to our item room yet

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:41.919
that's that's a slanderous by the way

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:43.450
not everybody in Vegas has that same

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:46.360
experience oh no I go there for the

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:48.640
shows well that's that's sweet you know

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.990
no complaints there and every time I

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.350
talk about Vegas people go NL you're

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.530
right

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:54.760
Vegas sucks or sorry Vegas rules but the

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.710
strip sucks and I'm like you know what I

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.270
can understand that I try to be more

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:01.000
here's the thing

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:02.530
I'm well-traveled but it's hard to be

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.690
well-traveled without being smarmy

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:06.280
because people go you know we came back

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:08.260
from and it is less and took me a long

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.370
time to learn because I was still

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.870
enamored with the fact that I could

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:11.890
afford to buy a plane ticket now and

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:13.240
then you know that's something that for

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:15.430
like thirteen year old me is like you

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.900
mean I can just tell them I'd like to

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:20.080
buy a plane ticket and they'll allow me

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:22.630
like I'm an actual adult but like you

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.500
know Kate and I got back from e3 and

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:26.770
people were like what do you think about

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:28.930
LA we were like LA shiftable I hate it

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:31.390
you know there's no nature and the

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:33.730
traffic's horrible and you know people

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:35.470
are weird and then I you know a lot of

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:38.350
people were like yeah but I also thought

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:41.050
like it kind of sucks you know what do I

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:43.690
know about LA I spend like four days

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:48.940
there during a convention where like a

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:51.580
million nerds descend on the city and

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:53.920
like you know me and my kind stink it up

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:56.890
for everybody else and then I go I come

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:58.810
back and I go oh yes Los Angeles my

00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:01.420
travels have taken me there but it's the

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:03.520
shithole you know that's like it's not

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.600
really fair I would be offended and it

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.430
happens all the time people go to

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.960
Vancouver and you know you see them

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.640
talking about it and they go oh then cuz

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.440
there's nothing to do in Vancouver well

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.700
there is stuff to do in Vancouver you

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.830
were here for like two days you don't

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:16.390
know what you're talking about it went

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.250
to Stanley Park and I mean wrote the

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:20.500
SkyTrain and that's it TripAdvisor

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:23.589
doesn't have anything else so try to be

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:25.150
more mindful now I'm on a bastion you

00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:28.839
know I I hate the Vegas strip but I've

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:35.010
never been to Vegas proper I would not

00:10:28.839 --> 00:10:35.010
deign to insult the whole city without

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:40.600
giving it it's fair do like Boston for

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.220
example I understand that there are

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.200
people who like Boston I've been to

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:47.320
Boston enough times to now no it's not

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:51.430
for me because I don't like people being

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:53.710
rude to me and then later they give us a

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:56.350
bill and go you know what would

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:58.300
certificate if he not to be rude I don't

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:59.260
harp on the food service thing more than

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.610
I probably should we're going to take

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:04.290
number one even at the expense of our

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:08.680
range that's just not for me

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:10.420
I'm a Vancouver Seattle Portland guy and

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.840
I know that says a lot about me like

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:15.370
whom you you can you can draw a lot of

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:20.200
conclusions about my personality from

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:23.590
that and most of them would be right to

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:27.370
be like hey I bet you like paying $4 for

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:30.040
a coffee right yeah yeah I mean I do the

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:31.840
most the most Vancouver hipster thing

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:34.870
about myself that I'm loath to admit

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:37.180
because it's such a great barb you can

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:39.700
use against me is that one time I

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:41.530
accidentally paid 21 dollars for three

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.970
cups of coffee I'm going to back up a

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:45.100
little bit there I was hanging out with

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:48.420
my friend Cory you streams twitch.tv

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:50.860
slash flack blag he plays pub cthe and

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:53.680
Isaac Daly's where he consistently beats

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:55.270
my scores and gives me quite ornery I

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.500
said order e not the one that starts

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:59.290
with an H and makes you think I got a

00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:00.910
big old boner but I mean that too but

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:02.680
either way he's a big coffee snob

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:04.810
self-admitted and he's like you got to

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.100
go to this place in gas town it's a

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.600
district in Vancouver why is it called

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.280
gas town I don't know dude I didn't name

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.570
the city was like 150 years ago coming

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.850
some slack I'm going to give you some

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:14.950
fuel to make fun of me so you got to go

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:16.210
to this place that's called revolver and

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:18.250
if you've been to Vancouver in your

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:21.310
coffee snob it's well-known one of the

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:24.100
one of the biggest like snob Coffee

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:25.270
Roasters in the city which I'm into so

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.530
anyway he took me there and he's like

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:29.050
hey it's my treat I'll get whatever you

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:30.340
you know you'd like to get and earlier

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:32.920
in the day he told me they had this

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:34.570
thing called like a coffee tasting

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.460
flight where they give you three coffees

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:38.320
served it like varying temperatures and

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.910
then they you know explain to you like

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.960
oh this one's got notes of blah blah and

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:44.020
I was like you know what that sounds

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.400
novel even if I'm a little bit I'm

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:47.230
sounds pretentious

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.560
but I'm willing to give it a shot let's

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:50.200
give it

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:51.850
shot right and I got it and then the

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.620
bill came out for like our three drinks

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:55.060
turned out to be like thirty bucks and I

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.750
looked at the bill and I was like I'm

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.790
sorry

00:12:55.750 --> 00:13:01.360
that's what I accidentally made you buy

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:04.000
me a $21 coffee I got him lunch to make

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.470
up for it but still like that's in it

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.990
you know what I enjoyed it would I get

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:09.730
it again probably not unless it was like

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:11.800
a very special occasion because that's a

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:13.330
ridiculous and also I was kind of like

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:16.000
this one's hot coffee

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:19.690
this one's warm coffee and this one is

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.830
cooler coffee so it was kind of wasted

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.110
on me to some extent but there you go

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:25.240
there's your ultimate if I ever insult

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:27.160
you in chat I'm gonna take speedball as

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.680
well I want the shot speed since my

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.029
range is lower if I ever like single you

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.740
out in twitch chat and go like we know

00:13:31.029 --> 00:13:34.390
blah blah blah blah this guy's a dummy

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.940
all you need to do is go

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:39.120
yeah well Lisa and paid 21 dollars for a

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:41.529
coffee and then you know I'm pretty much

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.880
what is it the kids say these days I'm

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:47.500
BPF owed

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:51.100
I got bounced the free guys out words is

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:53.830
what they say I think either way we want

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:55.120
that let's go puberty not a bad pill in

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.440
hinds away what's going on there was

00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:02.020
something maybe was just a blood-spatter

00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:04.660
in the bottom left there but it's true

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:06.760
you know I like the I like the weather

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:09.280
in the Pacific Northwest and I like the

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:11.020
people is there a level of pretension

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.730
here absolutely their level of

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:14.020
snobbishness absolutely I think that's

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:18.040
why I fit right in you heard the

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:21.070
conversations we have on the LSS I think

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:22.900
I almost have like if I made to my own

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.880
horn I think I'm a good Pacific

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:27.220
Northwest resident because I didn't grow

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:30.220
up here and that's I have knowledge of

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:32.410
how the world works outside of the

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:35.380
Pacific Northwest and that gives me like

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:38.140
a bit of perspective that I think some

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:39.850
people here don't have like there are

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:43.450
people in the Pacific Northwest that are

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:45.100
like don't houses cost a million dollars

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:48.880
each everywhere and you got to be like

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:50.890
not that is a very like in some places

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.209
in the world admittedly you can did you

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:55.900
find some music Oh cities that do that

00:14:52.209 --> 00:14:58.540
but that's pretty much like a Vancouver

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:59.950
Seattle Portland San Francisco sort of

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:03.810
thing going on there is pain

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:03.810
in like way too much money to live there

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:09.490
what do you mean it snows once a month

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:11.410
sometimes it's true outside of the

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:13.210
Pacific Northwest sometimes it could

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:16.630
snow three or four times in a single

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:21.940
week I know it's crazy but you know

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:24.190
there's like a there's a pnw bubble what

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:26.590
do you mean one degree Celsius isn't

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:28.270
cold well you know I mean if it feels

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:30.850
cold then it's cold but there's people

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:32.080
like you know they go out and a t-shirt

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:33.640
and shorts in that if you live in a

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.030
flippin Minnesota you know what I mean

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.370
buddy

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:38.440
anyway that's this is the end of my very

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:40.180
self-serving discussion on the Pacific

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:43.890
Northwest it is beautiful never come

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:48.720
here we got our own problems already um

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:52.300
said someone who moved here anyway

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:58.510
we're playing Isaac how's it going like

00:15:52.300 --> 00:16:00.580
it's great the runs quite good kind of

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:02.350
I'm waiting on that last guppy item why

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:04.840
not a good opportunity to use a poly ons

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:06.310
void item as well nice save no one even

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.440
noticed and I think that's a decent

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:10.450
opportunity even though 25 cents would

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:13.150
be nice it's certainly non-essential and

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:15.930
we managed to snag another one damage

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:19.870
upgrade as a result full health is

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:22.870
unnecessary and we have a battery charge

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:24.490
left over anyway so because we must have

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:26.560
gotten a rate of fire increase there too

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:28.120
and honestly with our shot speed our

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.550
range is not as bad as I would have

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:34.780
expected so in the run is it's not

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:36.880
popping off it's already popped off boss

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:39.030
rush is something I would like to go to

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.780
and teleport out of but we'll have to

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:43.450
love to play that on a case-by-case

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:47.110
basis what I really want to see is a

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:49.270
deal with the devil here because we are

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:50.740
you know one guppy item away from

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.760
basically kicking the Christ out of this

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:56.530
game and never having to worry about

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:58.450
anything again you're a little annoying

00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:03.660
do a demon baby with the clutch assist

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:03.660
there thanks buddy I appreciate it

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:11.350
we got plenty of time we're not hurting

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:14.040
for time kind of a surprise we've made

00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:16.900
it we definitely want to suck that up

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:18.550
it's it's sort of a tough call here I

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:20.500
don't think I want to pay for it I think

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:21.130
we're a little light on HP to want to

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.959
pay for that

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:24.790
we got another damage upgrade for

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:27.130
sucking off a range upgrade so I'm very

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:29.020
content with that as well and we'll move

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:32.500
on to our boss rush floors has become

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:36.220
colloquially known to me and me alone IV

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:39.640
bag IV bag is like it only shows up on

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:41.020
void runs to mess with us if we had red

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:44.230
hearts I'd probably take it because I'm

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:45.550
like my own worst enemy but it's the

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.890
wrong call to suck this up right now

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:52.480
it's a great call for a black room

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:55.210
though what we need on this run at this

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:57.580
point is I know I just rewrote one of

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:59.350
these by sucking it up but like a range

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:04.179
upgrade that came attached to something

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:06.520
else would be pretty swell and then like

00:18:04.179 --> 00:18:09.400
a defensive item it doesn't even have to

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:13.120
be the relic or anything you know that

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:15.190
amazing if it could just be the ability

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:18.720
to fly like this room exemplifies why I

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:23.470
think the ability to fly is important

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:25.510
these guys are jerks it's one way to do

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:27.340
it I guess you guys are jerks is taking

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:30.970
forever for us to kill them and it's

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:33.130
extremely annoying to do so is a vampire

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:34.630
it's extremely annoying for us to do so

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:36.670
because we got to get right up in their

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.809
grills you know - so we're gonna take

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:39.190
two of diamonds we're going to take

00:18:37.809 --> 00:18:41.559
battery baby we're going to take the

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:43.480
spirit heart and we're going to donate

00:18:41.559 --> 00:18:44.860
as much money as possible and not really

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.630
worry too too much about the

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:48.520
consequences in any direction here a

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:50.920
luck upgrade is nice but mostly this is

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:55.030
just about ensuring a proper environment

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:57.100
for us to have future roses we don't

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:59.370
need the money for anything anyway all

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:04.470
right so we got three cents remaining

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:04.470
basically zero for now

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:11.220
lux data one now gives us I don't know

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:13.080
how much more chance of getting

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:15.120
consumables but I kind of feel like and

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:17.039
this is anecdotal don't think this is

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.289
evidence but kind of feel like the luck

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:21.779
stat is almost like a scale like like

00:19:19.289 --> 00:19:23.760
it's a what's the word it's like it's a

00:19:21.779 --> 00:19:25.620
scaling factor it's it's something you

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:29.370
multiply by something else in order to

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:31.529
get the results so you know what it's

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:33.240
save me some time I can spend two bombs

00:19:31.529 --> 00:19:34.980
and definitely get more than we

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:38.490
bargained for back here the thing is

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:42.720
like zero luck seems to give you poor

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:45.630
consumables one luck I think starts to

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:47.190
give you better results and I'm just

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:48.960
wondering like is three luck actually

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:50.580
three times as good as one luck or is

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.990
there a different factor involved there

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.580
I don't know the answer to that question

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:55.039
because we're a little tight on time I'm

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:56.940
going to go slightly faster here

00:19:55.039 --> 00:19:57.600
chemical peel is fine but I'm going to

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.070
suck it up

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:01.710
we got luck and damage out of it

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:03.690
honestly I've gotten such good like

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:05.520
lowercase L luck on this run to

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:10.039
differentiate it from the actual stat

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:12.929
that I almost feel bad like all of our

00:20:10.039 --> 00:20:14.250
void plays have turned into damage to

00:20:12.929 --> 00:20:15.299
the best of my knowledge so far except

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:19.130
for the ones where we sucked up an

00:20:15.299 --> 00:20:21.240
active item that is unusual and

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:23.460
considering how many of the stats are

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:25.110
nearly maxed out or otherwise useless to

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:28.350
begin with like the speed for example we

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:31.830
have no need for any more we really like

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:34.350
struck gold and should acknowledge that

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:39.210
you know variance is on our side right

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:43.380
now doesn't always happen it is sensible

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:46.340
to me to do boss rush because every

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:50.669
couple of waves will generate another

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:54.080
shears charge so there's items worth

00:20:50.669 --> 00:20:56.190
doing it for we should do it I think

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.630
might sound like a little bit like a

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:59.190
truism but the other thing is you know

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:02.039
we're still waiting on that mythical

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:06.450
like octo lottery and I'm not talking

00:21:02.039 --> 00:21:08.490
about what Nadya Suleman dude why do I

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:12.240
have a spot in my brain that remembers

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:15.450
octo mom's birth name like that's just

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.680
too far I don't even have to check I

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:19.350
know her name is Nadia

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:21.210
I'm gonna go check it but okay so we got

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:22.740
that we want to suck up all this I mean

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:31.170
if it can't sprit II good

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:33.950
first off Octomom Natalie Suleiman so

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:40.710
close I almost had it

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:42.330
anyway we give for Stan's upgrades or

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:45.570
wring your piercing shots or we get a

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:46.980
mechanic like it's all good I say we you

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:47.930
know kill em all let God sort em out

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:52.290
there we go

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:53.730
so we mostly got a little damage out of

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:54.240
that by the way was this the right

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:57.270
decision

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:59.630
no no no highly wrong highly wrong if a

00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:02.460
CAC or Sagittarius were great choices

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:04.320
also now every time I press the spacebar

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.690
I'm going to immediately blow myself up

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:08.250
oh no I'm going to blow myself up if

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:10.830
there's an existing bomb as long as I

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:13.140
keep moving I might be fine dude shears

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:14.750
what are you doing like you have the

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:18.200
easiest job on planet earth right now

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:18.200
chew everything

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:25.790
and I need to stop taking damage because

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:32.030
I don't have a ton of HP I don't have a

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:35.570
ton I age and I set it like that look we

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:37.790
got mad shears as if we were on a

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:45.410
podcast called how did this get made on

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:50.630
the Earwolf network all we got to do is

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:52.130
let them do the dirty work for us keep

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:53.420
the two outside

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:55.130
I think it's cuz I was like standing on

00:22:53.420 --> 00:23:04.670
top of it or not moving while I placed

00:22:55.130 --> 00:23:07.100
it no okay so for whatever reason

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:08.840
sometimes I explode and sometimes I

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:10.760
don't I wonder if it's related to link I

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.290
was going to say like mr. boom giving us

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:14.650
a troll bomb but I'm pretty sure that's

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:17.510
it sounds more like a freaking

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:20.930
pictionary card than anything else I'm

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:24.800
just going to live is my goal so I'm not

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:26.690
going to use void anymore I'm just going

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:29.150
to live this is my intention or that we

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:30.650
can use it there that time didn't

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:32.120
explode I feel like I'm missing

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.230
something obvious for the explosions but

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:38.540
I'm not sure if I'm missing something

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:40.220
obvious that's within my control okay I

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:43.460
need you to eat one of these bosses I

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:45.140
don't really care what it is I'm going

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:47.590
to sweet little like Pikmin thing going

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.590
on here

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:59.179
spirit hearts please nice no spirit arts

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:02.360
but nice nonetheless come this way I

00:23:59.179 --> 00:24:04.400
told the to come this way I know

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:06.919
phrasing but that's amateur hour let's

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:11.510
be honest the Aerosmith parody that's

00:24:06.919 --> 00:24:15.020
the true hiyo comedy the final chapter

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:17.030
in the the comedy textbook written by

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:19.220
yours truly That's not me it's actually

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:25.400
a an old vaudevillian performers names

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:29.659
yours truly his first sketch eponymously

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:30.890
named not named after eponymous I mean

00:24:29.659 --> 00:24:32.539
it's called yours truly it's a very

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:40.909
confusing situation that's why the

00:24:32.539 --> 00:24:42.679
chapter is 400 pages long I can fly now

00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:47.330
I could have flown this whole time now

00:24:42.679 --> 00:24:49.970
that I think about it yeah I mean so I

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:51.440
didn't really want to suck it up but you

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:53.690
know at the same time that I'm my own

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:58.190
worst enemy as stated so I pretty much

00:24:53.690 --> 00:25:02.419
had to so now we really are on a tight

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:09.289
leash here we got great damage there's

00:25:02.419 --> 00:25:14.659
no complaints in that department worst

00:25:09.289 --> 00:25:17.510
enemies for us right now the vaginal

00:25:14.659 --> 00:25:23.270
silkworms always always always vaginal

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:24.740
silkworms unless they're dying in one

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:26.870
hit which you know honestly we should

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:28.309
just take a nip attack our decision to

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:31.549
void all those items is coming back to

00:25:28.309 --> 00:25:35.559
haunt us in a big way the other thing we

00:25:31.549 --> 00:25:35.559
could get is just an item like book of

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:47.500
revenue I've done an item like Book of

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:47.500
Revelations just get sucked up

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:56.240
my favorite Canadian punk band and yes

00:25:54.200 --> 00:26:01.910
that was a reference to to effed-up in

00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:03.309
the chemistry of common life but if it

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:05.600
gets sucked up by void then we get

00:26:03.309 --> 00:26:07.820
spirit odds on the regular like I'm not

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:15.860
ready to die here I'm also not ready to

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:19.780
make nice nothing so big outs for us

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:19.780
here obviously if I could get like a

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:24.830
random heart pay out like here that'd be

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:27.260
sick but a second secret room is

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:31.240
probably a more likely Avenue for us to

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:31.240
find you know the gold rush here

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:44.630
teleporting enemies are also going to be

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:49.400
held these guys do teleport not the hoos

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:51.620
guys obviously would check it check and

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:55.220
check oh why did I think that was a

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:57.820
special room for some reason good look

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:57.820
that was tough

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:04.270
spirit cama cama

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:17.220
okay they gotta go one at a time they

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:20.370
gotta go

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:23.820
spirit hearts all I ask for who would

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:27.380
have thought boss rush would have ended

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:30.120
up being this much of a screw you

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:33.360
admittedly that's a lot of damage on it

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:37.310
would wait till it comes back and you

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:37.310
take it paralysis is a good pill I

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:45.660
walked right into it oh he's back it's

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.370
such a tough room because you've got to

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:49.470
like take out the first guy before he

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:51.840
does anything so now we owe a great debt

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:53.550
of gratitude to these guys spawn

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:57.180
silkworms will be careful we all great

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:59.850
debt of gratitude to Guppies color and

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:01.380
if you agree with that fudge you buddy

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:03.260
we paid for Guppies color the fact that

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:06.720
it's actually done something for us

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:08.160
pretty much cost of doing business thank

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:11.040
you so much for providing us with a

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:15.570
little bit of survival skills and this

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:19.680
is where the money gets made because you

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:23.490
know we're getting a freakin red heart

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:28.860
rate here that's not a red heart that's

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:31.650
a lucky foot all right well disregard

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:35.370
but I'm still jazzed okay you can't stop

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:38.930
me from being jazzed I need to institute

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:43.410
like a standing rule rules very simple

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:45.390
all this sucks so why do that because

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:46.950
now I can fly and I can avoid the spikes

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:49.800
is the smartest play I've made in my

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:52.410
adult life sorry buddy

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:54.780
can't do anything here and we needed the

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:57.240
HP anyway so okay

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:59.220
so I think if anything I've redeemed

00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:00.510
myself I made the sacrifice of thinking

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:02.700
pressing the spacebar was going to kill

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:04.230
me and it not actually killing me maybe

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:06.570
all the times that I've pressed the

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:08.610
spacebar and blown up instantly I have

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:10.620
been pressing the spacebar twice in

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:11.100
rapid succession that doesn't seem to

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:14.310
make sense

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:16.750
there is our spirit hearts dude I'm bad

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:18.820
in the center of game

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:23.620
sorry aruch I didn't mean to wake you up

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:25.480
but I mean again is my office so nobody

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:29.490
got respect for the professional

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:32.200
youtuber I was a freaking doctor to be

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:40.179
telling me to be quiet Luka I don't

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:42.130
think so buddy so the loss of the spirit

00:29:40.179 --> 00:29:43.809
are there hurts me deeply the same time

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:45.460
it is very nice to be able to lose a

00:29:43.809 --> 00:29:48.070
spear at heart and still be alive not

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:52.929
that it's what I signed up for a year

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:55.260
but I think although we're lucky to be

00:29:52.929 --> 00:29:55.260
alive

00:29:55.650 --> 00:30:00.909
got to give it up for our boys in blue

00:29:58.809 --> 00:30:07.419
for doing it that's right copy I don't

00:30:00.909 --> 00:30:13.150
know why Guppies in blue but didn't blow

00:30:07.419 --> 00:30:15.429
me up instantly spirit hearts

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:17.500
that's not spirit hearts also those

00:30:15.429 --> 00:30:18.940
aren't pillows do we go for the stat

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:20.650
upgrade I think we just take the bombs

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:22.270
we're probably going to want to bomb our

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:30.520
way through several rooms and the stats

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:36.909
cannot be HP so there we go he's done it

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:39.730
we don't need that unnecessary battery

00:30:36.909 --> 00:30:42.090
baby's hooking us up all right we got a

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:42.090
chance

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:49.220
certainly no unless the deal with the

00:30:45.809 --> 00:30:51.899
devil is incredible no real bed on a

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:53.940
hush by here it's a very awkward way to

00:30:51.899 --> 00:30:56.389
phrase the sentence I don't think I

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:58.590
would like to do a hush fight here but

00:30:56.389 --> 00:31:01.230
so shall it be written so shall I be

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:02.220
freaking dawn body so shall I be freakin

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:04.830
dawn body

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:07.200
thanks for the luck upgrades honestly

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:10.619
the run has been very very kind to us

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:12.029
I've clearly made some misplace I've

00:31:10.619 --> 00:31:15.239
been pretty lucky that none of them have

00:31:12.029 --> 00:31:16.679
been catastrophic except for that time

00:31:15.239 --> 00:31:20.299
we died and had to be brought back from

00:31:16.679 --> 00:31:29.909
the dead but it's par for the course

00:31:20.299 --> 00:31:32.159
today's media environment cool mom's

00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:33.840
heart shouldn't be that hard as long as

00:31:32.159 --> 00:31:37.470
we don't explode instantly upon pressing

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:39.889
the spacebar I feel good this could be

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:41.039
excellent bombs or key irrelevant foil

00:31:39.889 --> 00:31:43.259
lockdown

00:31:41.039 --> 00:31:44.759
not that bad infested and a speed

00:31:43.259 --> 00:31:47.249
upgrade so it's actually like pretty

00:31:44.759 --> 00:31:51.330
terrible I'm going to hold bad trip on

00:31:47.249 --> 00:31:56.159
the off chance that it becomes usable we

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:57.659
get a little bit more HP probably

00:31:56.159 --> 00:31:59.999
should've known at this point if I was

00:31:57.659 --> 00:32:07.379
the key I'll use I mean having 23 poison

00:31:59.999 --> 00:32:10.649
bombs threats something got a look the

00:32:07.379 --> 00:32:13.350
world's probably more likely to be

00:32:10.649 --> 00:32:14.609
useful than bad trip we're going to use

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:15.210
this immediately on the next floor

00:32:14.609 --> 00:32:19.070
anyway

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:19.070
yeah dude give me spawn

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:28.740
there's got to be three there's only two

00:32:25.039 --> 00:32:34.169
bad trip okay I'm ready for my boss

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:35.700
fight mr. deville it's and rarely will I

00:32:34.169 --> 00:32:37.619
say this at this stage of the game this

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:41.940
would be a great opportunity for us to

00:32:37.619 --> 00:32:43.230
pick up an HP upgrade he has not done it

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:44.639
that's all right that's all right he's

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:46.679
got a battery charge you know what that

00:32:44.639 --> 00:32:48.960
means would be pop dad and don't explode

00:32:46.679 --> 00:32:50.490
instantly so that's nice now we got

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:52.470
shears we somehow didn't get hit for a

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:55.799
laser beam or bio laser being pointed

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:57.720
directly at our faces there we go just

00:32:55.799 --> 00:33:02.639
took a second for sheers to figure out

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:05.009
whose side it was on lucky dodge battery

00:33:02.639 --> 00:33:09.659
charge we're off to the races again I

00:33:05.009 --> 00:33:13.350
don't understand that analogy I don't

00:33:09.659 --> 00:33:15.929
have many other casinos stories one time

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:17.669
in college my friends and I thought we

00:33:15.929 --> 00:33:20.639
were smarter than the average person so

00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:22.340
we learned how to count cards we went to

00:33:20.639 --> 00:33:25.350
the local casino and played blackjack

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:27.749
but actually we just involved one too

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:30.840
many adult beverages and like completely

00:33:27.749 --> 00:33:34.169
laws against it's a mentally somewhat

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:36.119
taxing thing to try to keep it all it's

00:33:34.169 --> 00:33:38.309
not like keep the concept of counting

00:33:36.119 --> 00:33:39.779
cards not actually that you'd like oh I

00:33:38.309 --> 00:33:41.669
know what Jack of Clubs is coming up

00:33:39.779 --> 00:33:44.580
next you just you know understand the

00:33:41.669 --> 00:33:46.110
relative likelihood of something showing

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:47.190
up relative to what it used to be so

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:49.350
you're like I you know we've had a lot

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:50.759
of pours in the deck so you know it's

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:52.320
more likely we get a card that's higher

00:33:50.759 --> 00:33:57.480
than a four right now anyway long story

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:59.369
short nobody lost like more than $20 but

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:02.129
at the end of it we were like that was

00:33:59.369 --> 00:34:04.429
kind of like a waste of our time still

00:34:02.129 --> 00:34:04.429
fun though

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:10.599
is actually is a surprising amount of

00:34:08.349 --> 00:34:12.279
like feel-good casino stories I feel

00:34:10.599 --> 00:34:16.869
like that's not that common as you might

00:34:12.279 --> 00:34:19.210
expect when I lived in Korea they opened

00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:22.659
up a casino in the city that I lived in

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:24.490
but it's illegal for Koreans to gamble

00:34:22.659 --> 00:34:27.730
not at that casino just in general like

00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:30.129
I guess gambling in a casino context is

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:31.210
not legal for Koreans so they were

00:34:30.129 --> 00:34:34.029
having trouble getting people in the

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:35.010
door and it had just opened so they were

00:34:34.029 --> 00:34:37.809
like okay

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:40.750
foreigners is basically us no not a

00:34:37.809 --> 00:34:42.309
pejorative you know you can eat and

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:44.260
drink for free in the casino obviously

00:34:42.309 --> 00:34:45.700
you got to pay to play the games you got

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:47.679
to offer up your own money as a stake

00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:49.809
but you get free meals and free drinks

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:51.429
it's pretty uncommon had a lot of nice

00:34:49.809 --> 00:34:53.169
meals of that casino until they plugged

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:54.700
that loophole because they were probably

00:34:53.169 --> 00:34:58.329
like we're losing a ton of money for no

00:34:54.700 --> 00:35:00.910
reason like these guys are not coming

00:34:58.329 --> 00:35:02.799
here and betting $1,000 on a hand of

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:04.960
blackjack they're betting like you know

00:35:02.799 --> 00:35:08.170
five dollars over the course of two

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:11.890
hours and then having four drinks it's

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:15.309
not fair to us anyway one time I went

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:17.109
with my friends to a casino and when I

00:35:15.309 --> 00:35:18.220
walked in they were like hey you know if

00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:20.170
you sign up for like a rewards program

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:21.279
to give you a free $10 so I was like you

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:23.170
know what sure I'll sign up for the

00:35:21.279 --> 00:35:24.670
rewards program never intend to come

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:26.170
back here that's a free $10 in my pocket

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:28.210
who knows maybe I'll turn his ten

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:30.160
billion it's probably not but by the

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:31.539
time I had finished signing up one of my

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:33.579
friends came back and was like I have

00:35:31.539 --> 00:35:34.779
lost $60 at the roulette table and don't

00:35:33.579 --> 00:35:38.109
want to be here anymore

00:35:34.779 --> 00:35:41.309
so we left I just walked in got a coupon

00:35:38.109 --> 00:35:43.720
and then walked out wasn't necessarily

00:35:41.309 --> 00:35:45.250
my favorite casino experience so that

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.930
one just blew up instantly one of these

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:49.289
days I'll figure out what's going on

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:49.289
with that

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:55.589
oh I thought we could make it across to

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:59.150
the safety zone in a hind sight

00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:59.150
definitely should never have done that

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:09.480
that's about it I don't have any like

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:12.030
bad stories I still reckoning if you

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:13.890
like it do it responsibly but like if

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:16.260
you're like I should I should learn how

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:17.970
to play Baccarat I think you're better

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:20.970
off without it the casino can sometimes

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:23.700
be a very sad place even the supposed

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:26.119
glitz and glamour of the strip I'm gonna

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:29.609
take Libra how does this go

00:36:26.119 --> 00:36:31.589
pretty badly for now but I got faith and

00:36:29.609 --> 00:36:33.480
then we got crickets head cool it's a

00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:34.829
pretty big upgrade but I think overall

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:37.760
we got a pretty big statistical

00:36:34.829 --> 00:36:40.589
downgrade as a result of my idiocy so

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:44.000
now one HP or do I want stripped of whoo

00:36:40.589 --> 00:36:46.560
think I want a HP so I messed it up

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.940
especially in Vegas man like I'm not

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.720
these people are on vacation I'm not

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.280
going to tell them how to live their

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:54.150
lives when you go downstairs to get a

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:56.430
coffee and like 9:30 a.m. and somebody's

00:36:54.150 --> 00:37:03.089
down there like on their 12th beer going

00:36:56.430 --> 00:37:04.440
like woo I'm like like 55 years old I'm

00:37:03.089 --> 00:37:06.780
not saying you shouldn't be able to do

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:08.880
it like that's your Platonic ideal for

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:10.710
vacation you work your ass off for this

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:12.869
vacation don't let me stop you but it is

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:15.780
kind of a frightening mirror to be

00:37:12.869 --> 00:37:18.990
looking into of like I don't know if I

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:21.359
want to be there much longer so I only

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:22.710
go there for like high-class eSports

00:37:21.359 --> 00:37:26.599
events that I've been invited to be a

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:26.599
part of like Amazon's Champions of fire

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:35.869
so I can kick butt in Crossy Road choke

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:39.599
in the quarterfinals PhD could be good

00:37:35.869 --> 00:37:44.180
luck up fine actually fine so we want

00:37:39.599 --> 00:37:44.180
the virus for many reasons

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:48.840
it means we probably should not have

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:51.690
blown that dude straight up okay that

00:37:48.840 --> 00:38:01.190
was probably the actual worst phrase and

00:37:51.690 --> 00:38:01.190
you could have used for them okay

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:11.609
we can't really afford to ever use our

00:38:08.839 --> 00:38:16.740
active item ever again

00:38:11.609 --> 00:38:19.020
so that's terrifying there we go we have

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:20.220
so many like decent bombs to just be

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:24.270
able to get them in there is worth

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:25.859
something thanks for all the lifesteal

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:27.390
by the way I really appreciate it I'm

00:38:25.859 --> 00:38:29.510
sure next time I get hit I'll be rezzed

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:31.950
because I have so much over healing like

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:34.319
meet the cop who can't be stopped

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:37.290
battery charge huh that's tempting oh

00:38:34.319 --> 00:38:41.069
look I can end my own life and Isaac for

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:43.579
free what a deal honey where we going

00:38:41.069 --> 00:38:46.079
here going to try smaller rooms

00:38:43.579 --> 00:38:47.550
it's not fair to suggest small rooms are

00:38:46.079 --> 00:38:50.190
always going to be easier than big rooms

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:51.930
but the most annoying archetypes are big

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:53.940
rooms ok so we don't need to go there

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:59.069
now we've been a res twice and I'll say

00:38:53.940 --> 00:39:01.410
Thank You mr. skeletal because being

00:38:59.069 --> 00:39:03.569
raised once is like I paid for that

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:09.450
functionality being read twice is like

00:39:03.569 --> 00:39:11.130
you know what my bad but thank you for

00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:14.280
your generosity nonetheless you didn't

00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:20.220
have to do that this is a big room I'm

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:24.450
expecting HP you've done it tell appeals

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:26.900
that's not HP this room should not be

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:26.900
that bad

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:38.500
I found myself stuck in a corner there

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:40.570
and I didn't know what to do so I tell

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:41.230
appeals it's almost like fear shot not

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:42.730
to blame

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:44.530
you know something else with my problems

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:48.280
here but fear shot left me in a weird

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:49.630
spot there they weren't following me the

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:56.080
way you would expect so I wasn't able to

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:57.520
create like a safe area to be cool but

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:59.950
we tell if Hills their self out we spent

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:01.570
a resource and we got a reward kill this

00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:10.330
guy first to get our spirit heart out of

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:13.170
it you this could be a big room I don't

00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:15.970
expect to get anything like any any

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:18.369
reward necessarily but it could be

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:19.900
adjacent to the boss room call me crazy

00:40:18.369 --> 00:40:22.930
but I think we got a chance to beat the

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:24.540
boss Lou baby is not one of the hardest

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:30.160
rooms to face down here in my opinion

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:34.540
double adversary double cage sometimes

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:36.190
double gate those ones are not nasty I

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:41.050
was going to say nutty that's not what I

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:44.590
meant to say it was rather nutty you

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:47.380
know Austin Powers - that's probably to

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:52.359
me eats the poop into heat seppuku and -

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:54.609
that's true classic comedy bit

00:40:52.359 --> 00:40:59.560
remember when Austin Powers drinks human

00:40:54.609 --> 00:41:00.880
shit passive oh my god he just I love

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:04.650
that movie so much here's what you do

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:07.119
you do it like that you've got a good

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:10.270
boy on your side in the form of this

00:41:07.119 --> 00:41:16.960
year's zero chance absolutely zero

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:19.150
chance we go into delirium we've been

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.470
redeemed in many ways thanks for

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:21.820

to say I don't
