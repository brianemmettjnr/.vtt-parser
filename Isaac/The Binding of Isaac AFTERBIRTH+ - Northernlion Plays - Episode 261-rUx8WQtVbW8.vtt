##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:07.410
everybody welcome back to northernlion

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.700
slow redemption in after birth plus we

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.010
wanted you to swab what an

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.450
accomplishment don't give me as easily I

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.380
was like come on we got to give the

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.599
people what they want

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.949
what's that G got to give them up

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.730
something heck yeah x3 cacl2 Zee City of

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.470
Compton

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:29.910
we got Samson Samson straight up might

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.260
be like maybe my third or fourth

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.809
favorite character to play as it's

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.809
actually you know better than it seems

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.540
so let's place a bomb here I was kind of

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.160
hoping you'd blow it up but this is fine

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.710
like seriously Samson is up there I'd

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.930
rather be Isaac because Isaac has the d6

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.149
and I just like the d6 is a huge hill to

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.070
climb if you don't have it as a

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.780
character because Isaac is always so

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.270
much fun as a result of it and then

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.590
you've got Eden who I am going to

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.600
account for these purposes even though

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.789
they can't be random and then maybe the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.979
lost and that's not just like posturing

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.560
I think the loss is a very fun character

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.330
to play now that it's statistically

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.530
plausible you win the average run or

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:18.030
close to the average run at least but

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.150
Samson is up there cool item built in

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.939
with a neat mechanic that is pretty easy

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.590
to like activate as long as you can get

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.240
over five cents pretty early on and

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.770
around you've got a good chance of being

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.509
able to take advantage of a plus other

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.259
items help out too like I don't know

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.700
dull razor actually helps out but you

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.040
know there's a lot of items that give

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.420
you a benefit for being hit add like

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.850
years ago so that was one of his

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.200
favorite archetypes for mechanics and I

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.420
think Samson is a character that

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.420
exemplifies that even more so than Eve

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.689
hopefully we can find it plausible for

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.159
us to do something akin to that that

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.600
works pretty well here because right now

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.490
we don't really have much of a shot I

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.549
mean we haven't been hit yet we have one

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.869
cent we need to get four more to even

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.640
have a chance of getting an arcade and

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.380
spiel probably on an average room with

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.620
like 10 poops you probably get one or

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.300
two

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:14.040
penny so we got three actually well and

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.270
above the call of duty and for extra

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.470
poops here I'd actually say we have a

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.690
pretty good chance of getting to five

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.680
cents which did not seem likely mere

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:25.740
moments ago sadly none there but it's

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.260
okay even if we had to spend a bomb for

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.540
a penny that's fine we still have our

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.190
secret room presumably somewhere we can

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.730
still teleport maybe that'll take us to

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:40.830
a secret room potentially sort of don't

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:43.500
understand the usual usefulness nothing

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.050
huh of the teleporter in you know

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.340
today's presidents economy we're going

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.900
to get rid of the teleporter either way

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.080
to take the ability to fly here in just

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.470
a second so I wouldn't get too worried

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.810
about it one way or the other I mean the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.970
Headless Horseman or rather the pony

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.820
itself is actually just a pretty good

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.290
spacebar item so I always find this item

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.940
gets underrated because there's passive

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.430
items that do exactly the same thing and

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.640
to be fair flying is extremely common

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.380
that just means you know when we slash

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.150
if we get the passive ability to fly

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.080
we'll be happy to get rid of this and

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.239
pick up something a little bit more

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.620
valuable but for now you know I'm not

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.750
going to bite the hand that feeds here

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.959
plus it's a speed upgrade and you know

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.739
we could actually use that so it's

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.140
realistic that we don't get a another

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.670
penny now it is not now it is not

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.600
realistic because we've gotten that

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:39.150
penny and we should be as good as it

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.709
gets for trying to get an arcade you

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.959
know what there might be some unexplored

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:47.550
design space there we've got trinkets

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:49.500
that give you a an extra item room every

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.239
floor of the womb that's a cool trinket

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.280
one of the best in the game what about a

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.530
trinket that gives you a guaranteed

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.560
arcade on every floor that you old a

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.360
trinket I'm not saying that would be a

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.600
top-tier trinket I think that probably

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.950
stands a chance of being like a B -2 C P

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.730
R trinket depending on the kind of run

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.830
that you've got going on but you know

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.200
situationally could be amazing and we

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.690
did actually manage to finesse ourselves

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.600
into an arcade here which is awesome so

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.799
we should be able like IV bag be darned

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.799
right now we don't care about that

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.759
we can live with the pony as long as you

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.770
want but I would like to get fiebag I'll

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:33.080
settle for the temporary damage bonus

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.050
two hearts one and a half parts one

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.430
heart half of the hearts okay so we

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.409
should be completely okay but now we

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.819
have eight damage I'll settle for the

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:44.180
damage bonus just on this floor but

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:45.919
obviously you know I want more later in

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.800
life it's possible you know we're young

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.240
we're agile right now once this run

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.639
starts to get into middle age we will

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.620
want some security one and a half parts

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.719
I'm just trying to keep it in mind here

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.580
at compound fracture grade item slight

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:00.110
range upgrade but mostly to the parasite

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.860
effect so we're one-and-a-half hearts

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.599
one half a heart it's we're okay being

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.099
here because we have at least one spirit

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:09.830
are maybe one and a half backing us up

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:15.889
right now or the ten damage which is

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:18.199
presumably the maximum and I'm kind of

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:26.630
getting used to ten damage it's pretty

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:29.000
sweet mmm we have no keys anyway so you

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.099
know let's not be idiots come through on

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.569
that side instead I'm kind of getting

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:37.009
used to ten damage you wouldn't mind

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:38.630
picking up the IV bag of course earlier

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.880
I said I don't want the IV bag but that

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.880
was before I realized that you know

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.349
we're not going to get it back when

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.180
anything could have happened that was

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:48.800
like yeah who cares now that we're

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.479
facing the very real consequence of not

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.110
getting that item I'm like no you don't

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:52.789
understand

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:57.650
I said who cares to seem aloof even

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:59.240
though I care a great deal either way

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.159
deal with the devil we don't want to

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.129
necessarily give up HP for garbage

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:05.599
because we do have a blood bag or sorry

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:08.449
we do have to incentive to play the

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:11.810
blood bank polydactyly it's given us

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:17.090
temperance interesting so it's actually

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:19.370
like sort of a tough call because little

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.039
brim is probably the right choice the

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.960
shovel is not at all but I'm going to

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:25.129
choose to take nothing and part of the

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.289
reason for this is because I want to

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:28.520
keep HP for the blood bank but part of

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:31.330
the reason for this the other part of

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.770
the reason it should say should say is I

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:37.130
want to see new angel rooms

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:39.860
the aunt after birth plus booster pack

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.000
that came out purported to change angel

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.470
rooms to make them better and I've seen

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.880
some like anecdotal posts from people

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.770
that are like angel rooms are way better

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.800
now there's new archetypes for them that

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:51.039
are we've got just to be polite more

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:56.419
sensible than some of the earlier ones

00:06:51.039 --> 00:07:04.190
where one and a half hearts I think one

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:07.759
heart half heart so I get a chance to

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:09.229
see those maybe hopefully maybe come on

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:10.490
we got zero luck I can't believe we

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:12.050
haven't picked up a Lucky Penny noski

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.810
toll please notice that use God's good

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.819
soul alright so blow this one up half

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.380
hearts okay we're out of here

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:19.520
I still think that's fine actually no

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:22.460
I'm going to blow it up again to try to

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.190
look for a key no key but where I'd like

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.360
two hearts now so that's pretty good I

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:30.259
would like to go to the shop but life

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:32.270
goes on a lot of golden chests as well

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:33.860
right off the bat here goodbye ten

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:37.490
damaged we hardly knew you I'll see in

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.810
the next blood bank opportunity but yeah

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.610
I want to give angel rooms a chance to

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.969
actually be viable I think that could be

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:45.740
a really huge thing for the game because

00:07:43.969 --> 00:07:47.509
right now the thing with Isaac is lovely

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.300
we're probably in the tail end of it's

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:52.789
like you know huge popularity you know

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:54.560
in the thousands at least of people

00:07:52.789 --> 00:07:57.289
playing it on a daily basis for those

00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:00.139
dailies and by the tail end could be

00:07:57.289 --> 00:08:02.300
like five years but all I'm saying is it

00:08:00.139 --> 00:08:05.569
doesn't new on the horizon so there's

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:09.500
less no business in than business out at

00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:11.750
this point but part of that is because

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.610
it's a little say me you know if you get

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:15.889
a deal with the devil we've gotten to

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:17.810
the point where at least it seemed like

00:08:15.889 --> 00:08:19.430
the appropriate course of action is like

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.680
even if the deal with the devil sucks

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:23.030
unless your HP is in a dire spot you

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.039
always take the first one just to give

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.449
yourself precedent it's a cool strategy

00:08:25.039 --> 00:08:27.919
but at the same time it completely

00:08:26.449 --> 00:08:29.719
invalidates the use of angel rooms

00:08:27.919 --> 00:08:31.310
largely because in you know in

00:08:29.719 --> 00:08:32.919
validating angel rooms was smart because

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:34.940
half of the angel rooms are trash

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:37.190
oftentimes you can go a whole run with

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:40.159
angel precedent or angels waiting at

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:42.709
least and never get a good item so this

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:43.969
is the story of a girl that cried a

00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:45.470
river and drown the whole world but it's

00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:46.760
also something that could be big for the

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.779
game if the angel rooms turn out to be

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.660
viable because

00:08:47.779 --> 00:08:52.699
of taking a crap deal with the devil

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:54.259
item when it shows up not that either of

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:56.540
those items that we had there were bad

00:08:54.259 --> 00:08:58.040
obviously but instead of taking let's

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.629
say we had like you know sister Maggie

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.249
in there is a good example we had three

00:08:59.629 --> 00:09:02.660
HP and sister Maggie but the spirit art

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:03.949
to back us up we probably would have

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.990
taken sister Maggie just for the

00:09:03.949 --> 00:09:07.730
precedent and we still might but knowing

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:10.040
that angel rooms have a little bit more

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:12.110
a little bit more potency now a little

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:15.670
bit more chance to actually you know aid

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:19.160
you and your in your quest to win a run

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:21.709
might mean more varied runs as we see

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:24.290
people not just taking like the the

00:09:21.709 --> 00:09:28.730
token devil item to try to get the

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:32.649
precedent there which would be sick you

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:35.360
know I love the concept of angel rooms

00:09:32.649 --> 00:09:37.249
the idea that you know it opens up a

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.649
whole new item pool that is restricted

00:09:37.249 --> 00:09:42.589
and barely seen the problem is that

00:09:39.649 --> 00:09:46.009
they're just ended thus far to not be

00:09:42.589 --> 00:09:48.740
very good consistently at least not as

00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:54.769
consistently as they need to be okay be

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:57.230
careful here okay yeah I never break

00:09:54.769 --> 00:09:59.000
myself out of that dodge pattern so I'm

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:02.990
amazed that I managed to make it happen

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.170
there I wanted to get both I am using

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:07.939
bombs more for combat notice like

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:10.490
finding it myself and these runs a lot

00:10:07.939 --> 00:10:11.750
now where I have base damage like two or

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.160
three floors into the game that's not

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.110
the kiss of death you know you can still

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.629
make that run work pretty easily but

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:19.420
[Music]

00:10:16.629 --> 00:10:21.709
it's too down just one down there okay

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:23.420
but one of the things we can do to kind

00:10:21.709 --> 00:10:25.100
of supplement our damage there is use

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.569
bombs so I kind of see bombs almost as

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.990
like early game like mini

00:10:26.569 --> 00:10:32.870
get-out-of-jail-free cards ever really

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:34.790
adjusted my play style naturally too

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:37.519
much like I haven't naturalized or what

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:39.860
it might internalize this but seems like

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:42.139
I should I'm complaining about damage

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:45.350
and I have like 20 bombs start using one

00:10:42.139 --> 00:10:48.500
every other room or something

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:49.760
a bomb fell like exactly equal distance

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:54.320
between those two mushrooms and we got

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:57.920
nothing for it life goes on but it just

00:10:54.320 --> 00:11:01.250
kind of hurt me deep in my soul that we

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:03.920
were unrewarded for our basically

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:09.770
extreme act of luck there you know what

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:11.870
let's try this quick okay I mean I'll

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.190
tell you what I will fight the boss I

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:21.980
didn't really wants because I wanted the

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:25.580
pony to be active forsaken is like not a

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:26.810
hard boss fight but it could take a

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:29.900
while if you're not doing a ton of

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:34.040
damage kind of hard to hit with bombs as

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:35.750
well so well except for those two that

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.860
we managed to land perfectly all right

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:40.820
deal with the angel

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:42.440
I got no bomb so no key piece but nope

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:45.320
nothing that's actually fine we don't

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:46.940
expect to get one we only had like a 30

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.740
something percent chance no big deal I

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:50.810
do have to go to the shop though I'm

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:57.680
like in dire need of a champions belt or

00:11:50.810 --> 00:12:00.440
something as much as I'm like pro the

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:02.780
pony man the white pony is like better

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:05.810
in every aspect except for its charge

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:07.490
the fact that you can actually glanced

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:09.170
off an enemy with the pony and not kill

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:11.840
them is one thing also the fact that

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:14.020
only enemies in your line of sight get

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:18.460
hit not even line of sight like

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:18.460
literally the direct path you're taking

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:29.949
all right let's go champion belt exactly

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:32.079
what I asked for it happens from time to

00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:35.350
time let's grab this let's also grab

00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:38.350
this Stars card I actually am quite fond

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:39.819
of that and hopefully really to use the

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:42.970
Stars card to get out of boss rush on

00:12:39.819 --> 00:12:44.740
the last non-daily run if you recall I

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:47.529
made it to boss rush with a star's card

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:49.389
and then use the Stars card on the

00:12:47.529 --> 00:12:51.910
Emperor vault not the Emperor but on the

00:12:49.389 --> 00:12:53.319
boss room and made myself feel like a

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:54.910
bit of an idiot so this is where

00:12:53.319 --> 00:12:57.040
Redemption can happen and so far I don't

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:58.360
think we've been bad on this run I don't

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.740
think we performed badly I guess I

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.259
should say I'm actually going to use

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.880
this not for boss rush because I was

00:13:02.259 --> 00:13:06.069
looking at my keys and I was like you

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:08.620
know what we're a little underpowered

00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:09.790
and we only have two keys we definitely

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:13.029
want to go to the shop we definitely

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:14.620
want to go to the item room let's save

00:13:13.029 --> 00:13:16.029
ourselves one key right off the bat and

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:19.089
hopefully power up a little bit

00:13:16.029 --> 00:13:23.610
you didn't really you know Mongol babies

00:13:19.089 --> 00:13:26.370
just okay it's a little help though I

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:29.170
don't mean okay like sister Maggie like

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:30.370
in concept at least it's better than

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.990
sister Maggie but I don't know does it

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.459
just feel sister Maggie's effect if

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:35.410
sister Maggie is the only familiar we

00:13:33.459 --> 00:13:38.440
have if so then it's kind of not that

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:40.300
great but anyway the big prize on this

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.819
floor is the arcades we're hoping and

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.649
you know we've been stacking up and

00:13:42.819 --> 00:13:46.600
saving all these red hearts tearing the

00:13:44.649 --> 00:13:49.000
tops off of cereal boxes hoping to get

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:51.339
that you know Little Orphan Annie prize

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.230
pack and hoping it's not just a crummy

00:13:51.339 --> 00:13:54.430
advertisement to drink our Ovaltine you

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.040
know what I mean there's a metaphor

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:59.920
that's sensible

00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:02.920
why are those flies so slow scoot oh

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.870
that's right I was going to mention that

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.880
we went into an earlier room it's like

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:08.829
the Flies seem like they're moving so

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.470
slowly that scat ol has been in the game

00:14:08.829 --> 00:14:13.149
for a hundred years as long as you know

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:16.540
Canada has been a sovereign nations

00:14:13.149 --> 00:14:20.529
--get ole has been in the game hive mind

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:23.189
is for later you know what was the other

00:14:20.529 --> 00:14:23.189
item in there

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:30.980
we go back deep pockets deep pockets is

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:32.150
also sort of for later so I don't know I

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.350
don't know if there's a right decision

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:41.530
in a wrong decision yet we'll have to

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:44.420
see how the run goes for right now I am

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:46.700
I'm feeling the heat of the run being a

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:49.870
little on the slow side and that's I

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:51.890
mean with Sampson you got a lot of

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:59.000
fail-safes when it comes to not getting

00:14:51.890 --> 00:15:00.890
good damage you've got obviously bloody

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.720
lust sorry I was focusing on the Dodge

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.730
there obviously you've got bloody lust

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:07.970
but then on top of bloody lust you also

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:09.260
have the thing that everybody has which

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.670
is deal with the devil potential except

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.680
for the keeper I guess where you know

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:14.210
it's a little riskier but we rebuke

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.010
deals of the devil and then we said to

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:17.180
ourselves you know bloody lust we're

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:19.190
going to try to make it work but we're

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:21.590
at the whim of the arcade actually

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:23.030
showing up which is I one day I should

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:27.050
actually look up what the chance is for

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:28.520
an arcade to show up if you if you came

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.720
down with five cents and maybe it does

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:36.430
scale with the amount of money you bring

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:36.430
down I'm not sure I doubt it though

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:40.640
anecdotally I don't think I've noticed

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.960
that but there's a lot of things haven't

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:46.810
noticed about Isaac that turned out to

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:49.550
be real mechanic so I share it for sure

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:50.930
much less annoying room this way we do

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:52.340
have some things going for us though

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:53.300
like I would be remiss if I didn't

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:55.730
mention the fact that we have the

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:58.720
ability to fly it's a really really

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:58.720
important upgrade

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:07.820
and the ability to get 26.69 damage as a

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:09.350
result of just ambient hits that we take

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:12.080
on the floor is very important we could

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:14.600
be playing Maggie right now have half

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:16.400
this speed and then also be stuck on

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:20.060
three and a half damage regardless of

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:21.740
how many times we get hit okay so we did

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:23.900
get an angel room let's see what we get

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.610
I'm not sure if this is a new archetype

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.880
but it's still it's a decent one of

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.880
course

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:35.090
definitely dead guppy said for now and

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:37.670
that's a great chest and that's a great

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:50.570
chest any chest that has a key in it is

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:52.370
good in my book pretty bad I don't know

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:55.460
if we actually want to fight the Angels

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:58.190
since you know anything about the angel

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:59.660
statue fighting has changed but why not

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:01.220
increase our odds of getting a deal with

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:04.970
the angel to experiment more with the

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:07.449
booster pack regardless right 12.5

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:10.339
percent chance normal or abnormal I

00:17:07.449 --> 00:17:11.780
don't know stop you said I mean we have

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:13.819
hive mind so Guppies head is pretty

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.860
useful but I'm going to imma stick with

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:17.810
our speed and our flying right now I

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:19.250
actually think that statistically like

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:22.339
from an attribute standpoint we're in a

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:24.920
bad spot our base damage is not much

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:28.189
improved if any our HP is good

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:33.140
admittedly but our speed is also base I

00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:35.630
think so I do feel like we're better off

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:38.270
just going for basically raw attributes

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:39.860
right now kind of a bomber I want to go

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:41.210
over some cool stuff but you know

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.590
hopefully we'll have a chance to get

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:44.980
some cool stuff later sometimes you got

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:47.030
to study and then you go out the party

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:49.910
that's what I've heard from my friends

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:51.740
who are cool anyway I've never heard of

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:55.040
such a thing studying is a party for me

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:58.390
because when you're learning everybody's

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.390
invited is all I'm saying

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.590
curse of the labyrinth

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:06.890
so bombs Russia actually at this point

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:10.070
basically don't care what I do care

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:12.809
about is

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:15.390
hitting up both of these item rooms and

00:18:12.809 --> 00:18:20.900
like please God at the shop as well but

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:24.090
please God if you can snag me an arcade

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:27.900
again I'm going to say it it doesn't

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:30.900
have to pay out with IV bag doesn't have

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:32.309
to pay out at all of course I would love

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.929
it to and it could save our run if it

00:18:32.309 --> 00:18:35.309
does but don't let that pressure you you

00:18:33.929 --> 00:18:35.910
know you've got to make your own

00:18:35.309 --> 00:18:41.550
decision

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:42.960
your autonomous even blood bag will be

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:46.080
fine if we get a speed upgrade we're

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:47.490
able to get rid of the pony more easily

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.020
if something comes along that could

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:53.850
sensibly replace it but we're not quite

00:18:49.020 --> 00:19:00.600
in that moment yet we don't quite have

00:18:53.850 --> 00:19:02.700
to worry about that yet and then both

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:08.580
item rooms both item rooms are you know

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:11.640
of extreme value this you've got to go I

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:13.470
was extremely bad um but yes they're

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:19.890
they're of almost importance right now

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:21.090
our stats are bad I'm still not totally

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:23.940
sure that there wasn't like a

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:27.720
clandestine update not to my game but to

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:29.550
dug game that like change the item

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.620
balance or not maybe not balanced with

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:33.809
like bit distribution or something like

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:36.420
that because it feels to me like over

00:19:33.809 --> 00:19:38.220
the past month or so I've had more I had

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:46.170
some amazing runs obviously like

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:47.850
amazingly lucky but forgot what I was

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:50.250
going to say oh I feel like I've had

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:53.070
more they were like just the same stats

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:54.420
as basically our default starting stats

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:58.140
by the time we got to this point of the

00:19:54.420 --> 00:20:00.540
game I have we got to check it turns out

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:02.130
we did not have to check after opening

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.480
two chests I've decided we do not have

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:05.700
to check in the least you know we will

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:07.980
do those used ice shard to re-roll

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:10.350
everything and all of a sudden we got

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:11.880
our keys back we got a black card we got

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:14.040
an internal heart I'm going to take the

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.510
eternal heart because I basically will

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:19.140
throw it away on an arcade and a

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:21.030
heartbeat and not care at all one HP is

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:22.260
not likely to matter to too much right

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:24.000
now

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.500
and if we don't find an arcade we got to

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.800
backtrack we're probably not doing boss

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:32.790
rush anyway we're way too slow mostly

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:34.440
from a DPS standpoint we don't have base

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:37.860
damage by the way I was incorrect we do

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:42.500
have a champion belt which is a sizable

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:42.500
damage increase that is not meaningless

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.950
that Blackheart might actually prove to

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:48.750
be the most important thing here like

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:51.660
keep our deal with the devil or an angel

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:54.570
for that matter chance pretty high and

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:56.850
then also that means by the time we have

00:20:54.570 --> 00:21:00.750
exposed red hearts we'll have two hits

00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:02.550
more of damage bonus from bloody lust

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:03.990
which just increases the odds that

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:06.240
anything that could hit us is going to

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:11.880
die in one hit instead so for two hits

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:13.860
instead for that matter don't need it

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.390
yet and my guess is we will probably

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:17.250
have to backtrack we could try to use

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:19.200
the ponies like a fairly bad

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:21.510
get-out-of-jail-free card but I really I

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:24.720
long for the ability to kill these rooms

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:27.180
slightly faster than we're doing so

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:30.000
right now and the bombs could be helpful

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:31.410
there we're due for like how that was

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.530
actually just terrible we're due for

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:39.210
like a special item we're due for an imp

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:40.950
attack or something AK at this point I'd

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:44.340
even take soymilk I mean I always do

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:46.710
anyway that heard me even my soul but I

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:48.330
always take it anyway but I feel like

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:54.150
compound fracture is the kind of item

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:55.470
that synergizes well with it just

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:57.740
getting more tears on the screen

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:57.740
basically

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:06.450
I could also do with lump of coal I'm

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:09.530
just like I apologize it's kind of like

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:12.690
a fallback form of commentary but I

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:14.310
really am searching for the tools that

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:18.360
can help us out here because of the fact

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:20.670
that situations not dire yet but it's

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:28.380
dire some I don't know if that's a real

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:29.970
word it contains some direness we're not

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.530
missing too many of the ingredients but

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:33.840
we're trying to make a soup with water

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:35.850
instead of stock you know maybe we got

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.500
got the whole recipe right except we

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:38.550
didn't have any stock so I just used

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.590
water instead

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:42.450
you know you compromised the whole

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:44.700
flavor of the soup as a result it's not

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:48.210
going to be enjoyable as enjoyable at

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:49.440
least I will take it you know what if

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:53.730
you're going to you're going to force me

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:55.560
down this road I will I will gladly go

00:22:53.730 --> 00:23:01.440
down this road to put more shots on the

00:22:55.560 --> 00:23:05.640
screen it also gives us a was it is a

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:08.720
was it also gives us a version of Ouija

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:13.580
board so not necessarily amazing but

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:15.750
I'll take it looking for black hearts

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:20.490
second secret room is a nice bonus

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:21.870
admittedly okay and we have found black

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:25.860
card so this probably buys us at least

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:30.180
another floor of being pretty bad just

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:31.410
encouraging world card we've gone to a

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.680
heart so I'm just going to pop it and

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:36.840
then hold temperance in the tower so

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:41.370
there is no arcade let's go to the shop

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:43.410
first if we will see how things pan out

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:45.570
if I don't accidentally pop this full

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:47.430
health thing over here because to get IV

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:49.110
bag would probably be worth it but we

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:52.490
don't have to necessarily lose the

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:52.490
eternal heart as the thing so

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:59.710
I think it's I think it's for the best

00:23:56.710 --> 00:24:02.740
to do this even at the loss of the

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:04.870
eternal heart I know we're not getting

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:07.210
any damage bonus right now but blood bag

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:09.810
or IV bag both have like great purpose

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:09.810
for me right now

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:19.150
I'll accept either and be happy to have

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:22.450
them honestly lucky pennies money equals

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:25.510
power somewhere like just ask him for

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:31.810
that I'm asking for the world but the

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:33.520
coupon allows six weeks for delivery sin

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:36.130
Victor told me about the coupon said the

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:38.710
coupon is very very good Peggy said it

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:43.270
was top tier I don't know what it does

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:47.590
but it is a dude that's so good it is a

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:55.090
space bar item my assumption is that it

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:56.590
creates an item from that pool and as it

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:58.960
said it allows six weeks for delivery

00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:01.360
which is how long it took to get sent

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:03.400
something you ordered on the internet or

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:06.850
on television a hundred years ago and I

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:08.740
would know because I was alive so I'm

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:11.830
thinking maybe when it's fully charged

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:14.850
it delivers something like it delivers

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:16.990
us an item from the pool on which we

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:20.380
prototype it you know what I mean like

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:25.960
we use it on the shop in six rooms if we

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:28.330
use it we get an item from the shop well

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:30.460
well I'm not going to be so brash as to

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:32.770
suggest that we'll find out soon because

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:34.270
that may not be true I may be in the

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:38.440
dark about the actual function of this

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:40.720
item for a year but we'll at least get

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:43.150
some clues soon Oh Polyphemus I told you

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:45.730
we were due for a special I could feel

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:47.350
it coming in the air tonight thirty-nine

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:49.990
damage terrible rate of fire but

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:53.170
thirty-nine damage we have been to our

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:55.650
shop of course I guess we'll fight the

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:55.650
first boss

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:02.880
and really if you're looking at this and

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:06.420
you're like why is he so happy you got

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:08.520
blood bag he traded HP to get HP now you

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:13.860
don't understand the HP is the secondary

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:16.410
element here we are now allowed allowed

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:19.460
as a weird word for that we are now able

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:21.750
and I know I see the battery charges to

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:27.420
take a space bar item that's not the

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:29.370
pony as a result of the fact that we

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:37.080
have the speed necessary to not require

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:38.910
the pony speed to function here what if

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:42.990
I just has pretty bad what if I just hit

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:47.160
you with them yeah okay seems like you

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:49.200
will still get hit sometimes if I can

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:52.200
manage to land these right so we don't

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:54.270
really want to pay out here grab these

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.920
two not great payouts there to begin

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:58.200
with let's go to our secret room and see

00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:02.160
what happens here so take very close

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:06.660
note of what this item is I have used it

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:14.640
got nothing what if I use it on the same

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:17.940
room where I used it the first time it's

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:20.370
made these items free maybe it just

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:23.580
makes all the items free in the room

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:25.200
where you are maybe it makes a random

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:27.600
item free in the room where you are I

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:31.860
don't know in the room where you are you

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:34.620
are the room you are well if it makes

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:36.960
items free maybe we'll have a chance to

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:40.920
I mean the coupon making something free

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:42.270
makes a lot of sense seems a little late

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:44.910
for this to be useful but maybe it works

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:46.830
on deals with the devil as well although

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:50.210
we're not necessarily guaranteed to get

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:50.210
one right as well give it a shot here

00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:01.960
dude circle of protection is actually

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:03.910
killing it the ambient damage from it

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:05.080
I've like never noticed as much as I've

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:08.200
noticed it here probably because of

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:09.850
Polyphemus the reflective shots are

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:12.670
doing fine as well okay obviously take

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:14.170
the Polaroid no deals no so what the

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:16.810
heck do we do with the moon card then

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:21.040
we're sorry with a coupon item I

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:26.440
actually do not know what the game plan

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:34.120
is there this run has felt a lot better

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:36.610
though not exempt from bad damage okay

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:40.150
you know I'll just building up the more

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:41.890
more fodder for us to get some sweet

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:44.350
Polyphemus damage as far as I'm

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:46.930
concerned but anyway obviously not

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:49.210
immune from bad damage preventable

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:55.210
damage just got to see if it does

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:57.760
something here did not seem to but some

00:28:55.210 --> 00:29:04.000
Redemption nonetheless plus we're

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:08.860
actually making half decent use of of

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:13.630
the dunce cap not common not for me at

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:15.400
least gotta throw some curves on these

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:18.700
shots to actually get into land

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:20.050
otherwise we're using you know - sister

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:22.270
Maggie's effectively to do all our

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:23.860
damage for us that's moon cards double

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:26.560
secret rooms or something I think I'm

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:28.120
going to neutralize that right now and

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:30.580
just continue to go with child's heart

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:33.990
in case we manage to get you know the

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:33.990
perfect storm is Sampson

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:46.440
so it does ambient damage on the same

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:49.050
frequency as our tears which is very

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:52.670
slow right now but the damage that it

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:52.670
does is enormous

00:29:53.330 --> 00:30:03.570
come on , don't think we really want

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:05.070
pulse worm because it doesn't do

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:06.750
anything for us if we already have an

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:08.790
enormous hitbox I guess I could make the

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:10.890
enormous hitbox even more enormous in

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:12.090
many ways maybe it's actually better to

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:17.700
use it when you already have an enormous

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:19.260
hitbox because it works more but either

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.610
way the fact that we're having that

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:27.840
conversation means we should probably

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:30.810
just stick with this trinket this is

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:32.100
gonna sound rich but I do wish well if

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:34.770
you wanted to sound rich we should say

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:36.930
mmm this is going to sound rich but I

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:40.100
really wish I could find a way to shoot

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:43.020
my shouts more straightly but we have no

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:45.900
grounds to complain considering you know

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:47.760
I took dunce cap but tractor beam would

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:50.730
basically be like getting 20/20 right

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:57.480
now most of our shots would fire forward

00:30:50.730 --> 00:31:02.430
or wherever we pointed at least make it

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:04.790
a little easier to hit this guy darn

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:08.760
shame he doesn't have any weak points

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:10.910
during that attack because I'm am talent

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:15.360
you can see it for yourself

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:18.020
we'd be ending him because like 12

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:21.690
Polyphemus shops deflected at him I

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:23.160
should have had him there we've done it

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:28.080
and we have gotten a deal with the devil

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:30.030
and unfortunately it has no items to buy

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:32.460
so we will never find out if this works

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:37.730
on deals with devil although we did get

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:37.730
a joker card oh my Lanta

00:31:39.619 --> 00:31:42.960
lovable he's done it okay what do we get

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:45.840
here

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:49.980
magician that can go to a spades in the

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:53.669
Joker card crack Jencks gives us a

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:57.539
trinket think we're happier with child

00:31:53.669 --> 00:31:58.830
side so I really would like to test the

00:31:57.539 --> 00:31:59.789
side I'm out I'm going to use the Joker

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:04.200
card right away

00:31:59.789 --> 00:32:07.889
oh and Isaac new game

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:11.759
- exe is stopped working forensic - ng

00:32:07.889 --> 00:32:17.940
dot exe is stopped working so that's my

00:32:11.759 --> 00:32:21.869
bed so the problem is you try to use the

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:23.279
item crashes the game like that's what

00:32:21.869 --> 00:32:25.230
you get for trying to use the items so

00:32:23.279 --> 00:32:27.239
if you'll just excuse Nanna try to use

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:30.090
the item here and come in here and okay

00:32:27.239 --> 00:32:33.090
Isaac new game DXE has stopped working

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:37.139
so we're going to we're going to load

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:40.200
this bad boy up again load me up and if

00:32:37.139 --> 00:32:43.230
you load me up it never stops never

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:45.450
stops never know okay so what's the game

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:47.190
plan then well I'd like to get the mark

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:52.039
you see that's a good item is part of

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:54.929
the issue here what if I use this and

00:32:52.039 --> 00:32:56.460
then we just wait it out and then try to

00:32:54.929 --> 00:32:58.580
use the Joker card later you know what I

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:58.580
mean

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:07.440
like I'm not happy with the damage I'm

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:09.120
taking we should still win this run in

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:11.549
spite of the error like that wood that's

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:13.140
moving the goal posts if we start to say

00:33:11.549 --> 00:33:16.200
Leo well we could have won if they would

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:18.870
run it and screwed us but I would like

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:23.179
to have the mark ASAP it's not

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:23.179
insignificant it's an important item

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:31.679
whipworm almost makes sense here but I

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:34.289
think we have to go for HP now that

00:33:31.679 --> 00:33:40.260
we're in kind of a dire position from an

00:33:34.289 --> 00:33:44.659
HP standpoint and a pretty strong hunch

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:44.659
that would be where the secret room is

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:51.480
homing tears would also be extremely

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:59.700
useful greed fight from a young greed

00:33:51.480 --> 00:34:01.140
perspective lucky pennies will be sweet

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:04.230
I can't but we picked up so much money

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:06.659
on this run we've not gotten a single

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:08.879
Lucky Penny to try to use it again just

00:34:06.659 --> 00:34:10.849
to see I should get one more charge

00:34:08.879 --> 00:34:13.770
before we yeah exactly

00:34:10.849 --> 00:34:15.139
before we go anyway so grab this Joker

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:21.330
card

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:23.099
crashed okay so I guess we just can't we

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:24.720
just can't take that deal with the devil

00:34:23.099 --> 00:34:32.550
so it's like the biggest bummer of all

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:36.270
time it's okay not not as tilted as you

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:38.460
might think I'm like a little tilted but

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:41.520
we also you know in exchange for the

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:45.000
game crash we get some value like for

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:48.089
example that was pretty bad but for

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.649
example I don't have to go to the secret

00:34:48.089 --> 00:34:50.820
room to fight grieve anymore there were

00:34:49.649 --> 00:34:54.419
no lucky pennies in there I don't know

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:57.740
when that's like confirms for when that

00:34:54.419 --> 00:35:01.790
stuff is controlled for I should say but

00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:01.790
surely we got nothing to worry about

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:09.170
in that regard to be I thought we

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.520
reached a dead end up here as a result

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:19.270
we don't to go here in the first place

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:21.260
but yeah we did there's a battery charge

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:22.790
we could use that to accomplish

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:25.600
something if the game doesn't crash I'm

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:25.600
just being petty

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:33.290
just kind of a little bit of an anemic

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:36.350
Samson run here usually I'm used to

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:37.580
popping off I don't want to better deal

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:40.010
with the devil chance to deal with the

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:42.710
devil crash my crash our game especially

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:44.540
considering all of the well both of the

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:46.670
blood banks so all three of the blood

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:49.550
banks we've been able to create or come

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:53.140
across it's really banned as well I'm

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:57.740
surprised that we were not able to get

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:59.240
IV bag this is the this is womb two

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:02.930
though so there couldn't no there can't

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:04.490
be an arcade down here right I so rarely

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:12.650
look for an arcade this late in the game

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:16.490
I have a intelligence deficiency or

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:21.970
whether or not we can actually get one

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:21.970
by like natural occurrences down here I

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:32.270
love these are getting six damage per

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:37.130
hit red hearts are relatively big supply

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:39.710
right now to a spades starting to pop

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:41.210
okay Joker car we can't even use but

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:43.940
hopefully you'll go down to the

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:44.480
cathedral net joke until Karl prove

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.550
useful

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:50.600
hopefully we live long enough to make

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:53.800
that happen now we got again we have no

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.800
excuses with things

00:36:54.610 --> 00:37:00.410
despite maybe the run being compromised

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:02.210
a little bit by our inability to pick up

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:04.220
the mark especially to pick it up

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:05.840
potentially for free I'd be happy to pay

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:10.490
for it if I could just walk in without

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:12.560
the game crashing but don't forget that

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:13.970
tinted rock up there we still have the

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.290
tools it's not a great run but

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:21.770
Polyphemus makes it quite

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:27.740
good and we really don't have much of an

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:29.840
excuse to mess it up so stay strong get

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:31.340
through this floor pop the Joker card on

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:32.630
the next floor I'm not going to even if

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:34.610
we get a deal with the devil I'm not

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:35.810
going to go to it on this floor because

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:39.080
I've already seen that that is the

00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:40.430
potential to crash the game so I don't

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.750
want to lose all of my progress on this

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:44.000
floor for a fourth time

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:49.490
what is this Flint hook well rank Anish

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:50.660
Maggie do you do okay good stuff No Deal

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:51.830
maybe that's the thing it's like you

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:53.270
don't deserve a deal with the devil so

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:54.710
tried to manufacture one out of thin air

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:59.690
then the game was like this room doesn't

00:37:54.710 --> 00:38:02.930
exist there's an error okay they said

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:05.720
the Joker was a wanted man obviously we

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:08.990
like this like oh you only take one as

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:12.710
we only lost the mind and and life goes

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:17.390
on but is that a new angel room

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:25.010
archetype the double angel room I'm not

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:27.650
sure either way very nice as Borat after

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:31.010
he goes through you know American accent

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:33.560
training very nice this is my wife

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:37.100
Pamela I originally hailed from

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:38.900
Kazakhstan so I think I've squandered

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:45.200
like a million percent my use of the

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:51.500
coupon on this run but if it really does

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:53.210
give you free items when used we got it

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:55.790
a little late in the game to be super

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:58.790
useful we had one shop no restock we've

00:38:55.790 --> 00:39:01.960
set it down open I'm shop a oh oh that's

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:01.960
the Rough Riders roll

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:11.660
yes please shooting me enemies the shoot

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:13.130
of me are my new best friends shoot at

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:18.680
me and have your shots be deflected

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:20.029
please if you could get range upgrades

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:23.440
so you can actually hit yourselves with

00:39:20.029 --> 00:39:23.440
the deflections that would be sweet -

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:42.499
you should get that please a little

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:43.940
close ok grab this dude I am so ready

00:39:42.499 --> 00:39:46.609
for this run to be over it's not that

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:53.509
I'm not having a good time just we have

00:39:46.609 --> 00:40:02.299
never crested if we didn't have cramp if

00:39:53.509 --> 00:40:04.069
we didn't have the dunce cap we might

00:40:02.299 --> 00:40:07.130
have crested and by Kressley I just mean

00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:10.359
like rehook like us reach a point where

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:10.359
we're like I'm good to go

00:40:10.869 --> 00:40:17.299
if we hadn't taken dunce cap and we just

00:40:13.579 --> 00:40:18.769
had like normal shots we might be at

00:40:17.299 --> 00:40:21.319
that point although I'm somewhat

00:40:18.769 --> 00:40:25.339
skeptical of that even and dunce cap I

00:40:21.319 --> 00:40:27.680
took for a reason you know I wanted

00:40:25.339 --> 00:40:28.999
double shots so that even if they didn't

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:31.099
aim properly at least forget the

00:40:28.999 --> 00:40:33.319
synergistic benefit of the compound

00:40:31.099 --> 00:40:36.700
fractures you know more compound

00:40:33.319 --> 00:40:36.700
fracture shots will exist basically

00:40:39.519 --> 00:40:45.700
sadly I think in this case the juice

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:45.700
probably isn't worth the squeeze

00:40:49.569 --> 00:40:54.380
we're not doing enough damage off the

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:58.119
compound fractures to justify the

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:58.119
increased difficulty to hit an enemy

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:07.450
which is kind of surprising because we

00:41:03.289 --> 00:41:07.450
have like you know nearly 30 damage I

00:41:08.049 --> 00:41:14.770
got faith we'll figure it out

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:14.770
this run has a chance to pop

00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:24.380
you just need to get the keys what is

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:28.460
the key tractor beam is a key an emperor

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:33.200
card is a key finding anything at all to

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:40.870
do with our to do with our coupons that

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:44.960
might be a key worth let's go okay

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:48.620
these are big moments for us just pop

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:52.100
this right away you want Isaac to hit

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:53.720
himself as much as possible you know

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:56.360
you've got a lot of deflections that you

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:58.310
can send in on him here circle of

00:41:56.360 --> 00:42:02.050
protection is like the ultimate anti

00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:02.050
Isaac item never thought of it before

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:14.030
try not to get hit by as many of those

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:15.770
stupid shots does it deflect with his

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:19.370
damage or my damage I hope it's my

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:21.860
damage do enemies even have a damaged

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:25.670
stent they only do like half or full all

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:28.310
one of them does well I guess I should

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:31.790
say they only do the X or 2x one of them

00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:34.270
doubles X though one of them doubles too

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:36.620
egg what am I talking about

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:37.070
I'm not articulating myself very well

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:38.930
right now

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:40.130
they either do a full heart or a half

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:42.170
heart and then maybe they have like

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:43.760
another double damage property that goes

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:45.440
along with that but only one enemy is

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.970
full heart and double damage and I don't

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:50.960
respect that enemy and I don't speak of

00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:52.580
him just stop I would give it a shot

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.290
well as long as we're doing weird stuff

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:55.910
sure let's take guillotine

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:57.440
let's take X placebo on let's take

00:42:55.910 --> 00:43:00.760
chocolate milk so we're in a weird

00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:03.860
situation where I do not actually want

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:06.050
Expo steve-o shots to land very often

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:08.090
because the necklace steve-o shot that

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:11.210
lands is not going to do damage until it

00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:14.060
explodes when it explodes it should do

00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:16.370
look a ridiculous amount of damage and

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:18.770
honestly Polyphemus chocolate milk is a

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:20.420
great combo as you can see we basically

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:22.790
have piercing shots because any shot

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:24.440
that's been charged for like longer than

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:27.940
a millisecond is going to be doing a

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:27.940
crazy amount of damage

00:43:29.099 --> 00:43:33.880
so it is quite offensively potent I

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:36.430
think this might have given us what we

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:38.589
need and of course if we want to

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:41.349
maximize expose Evo shops on a tanky

00:43:38.589 --> 00:43:43.270
enemy like these guys for example that's

00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:50.650
where like rapid-fire chocolate milk

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:55.210
comes in I can't believe we have a

00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:57.430
serial luck but I can believe that we're

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:59.079
fighting gluttony here and exactly what

00:43:57.430 --> 00:44:03.160
I'm looking for right there this gives

00:43:59.079 --> 00:44:05.050
us a lot of fuel with which to get those

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:09.550
bloody lust bonuses this is a very

00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:11.680
strange run I don't know if it

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:15.280
necessarily made me super happy to have

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:19.180
dunce cap and item still remains kind of

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:24.339
in the strange pile in my world but I

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:26.710
still take it when it's sensible was it

00:44:24.339 --> 00:44:28.000
sensible here and jury's out I think is

00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:29.890
the polite way to put it you know what

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:35.470
sure let's reroll our synergy who cares

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:41.560
dude let's go we roll ours our vision I

00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:43.150
should say yeah okay add this up to 22

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:44.589
damage I mean actually I think the young

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:48.099
heart is better than the coupon here

00:44:44.589 --> 00:44:50.560
I think the coupon might be awesome but

00:44:48.099 --> 00:44:52.900
it helps if you can actually use it I

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:57.300
find that most items are better if you

00:44:52.900 --> 00:45:00.300
can actually use them not all of them I

00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:00.300
suppose

00:45:02.759 --> 00:45:06.460
trying to think you know if you're over

00:45:04.839 --> 00:45:08.019
the bob transformation bob's rotten head

00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:15.069
might be a good item to get but not use

00:45:08.019 --> 00:45:18.519
I really don't care who I kill first

00:45:15.069 --> 00:45:21.369
last whatever here we want red hearts to

00:45:18.519 --> 00:45:26.619
drop occasionally everything else is a

00:45:21.369 --> 00:45:29.499
bonus when the shops hit they pack a

00:45:26.619 --> 00:45:31.210
punch what I mean to say is the coconut

00:45:29.499 --> 00:45:36.819
gun shoots in spurts and if they hit

00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:39.249
they're gonna hurt DK Donkey Kong that

00:45:36.819 --> 00:45:40.989
would be a great algae's all right we

00:45:39.249 --> 00:45:42.759
can't step on that or shouldn't step on

00:45:40.989 --> 00:45:44.650
that that would be great

00:45:42.759 --> 00:45:47.019
algae's it's at the gaas that's still

00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:54.549
pretty good to get a cast

00:45:47.019 --> 00:45:58.089
Dave oh wow darlin step on the creep you

00:45:54.549 --> 00:46:04.989
stupid idiot okay we've got HP back we

00:45:58.089 --> 00:46:06.999
got 37 damage I don't know what finished

00:46:04.989 --> 00:46:13.779
the job there but I'm happy to have been

00:46:06.999 --> 00:46:15.039
a part of it I'm almost glad that didn't

00:46:13.779 --> 00:46:18.219
explode it was looking like I was going

00:46:15.039 --> 00:46:19.329
to get caught in the effective area it's

00:46:18.219 --> 00:46:24.719
what we in the business call an

00:46:19.329 --> 00:46:27.160
explosion and ei it's in the game oh I

00:46:24.719 --> 00:46:31.059
think that was a compound fracture

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:34.140
explosive OH that split into a compound

00:46:31.059 --> 00:46:34.140
fracture explosive OH

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:44.490
come on

00:46:40.349 --> 00:46:45.800
comer like a Vaughn Bonnie son come on

00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:51.930
come on

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:56.609
nothing oh you're killing me smalls what

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:58.440
are we going to do here we got the win

00:46:56.609 --> 00:47:00.480
on our fingertips we got no luck we're

00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:03.990
getting no items you're starving me of

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:05.910
Zain you starved me of Zain and then you

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:07.890
give me the dunce cap you give me a

00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:11.760
little trickle of Zane you write a

00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:17.300
little scientific paper about it get

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:17.300
your doctorate thanks for the help

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:23.160
million cents no freaking luck upgrades

00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:25.530
can't buy a new item to save my life

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:27.720
just ask you for anything maybe they get

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:29.550
Polyphemus and expose Evo and give each

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:31.980
other those lump of coal but we do I

00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:35.040
want more it's not enough there we go

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:37.680
there we go Capricorn to damage upgrade

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:40.440
so you know what the other stats make it

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:41.010
pop I'm happy thank you so much for your

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:45.589
support

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:45.589
let's go get dusted blue baby

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:53.890
so confident in the dusting pot the

00:47:50.410 --> 00:48:00.130
power card oh you are a cruel mistress

00:47:53.890 --> 00:48:05.370
but I have to I can't say no I would say

00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:05.370
the odds of us dying are very high I

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:14.200
still sort of resent feeling pressured

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:16.360
into going to the delirium floor but I

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:20.710
also respected that pressure is largely

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:24.370
a result of myself not a result of the

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:26.500
game mechanics I just take variable

00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:30.940
payout something like which floor to go

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:33.250
to man so it makes you feel like a

00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:37.350
little baby if you don't go to the hard

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:37.350
floor because it's rare

00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:49.900
instead I'm like we might be screwed as

00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:51.310
a result of this but I'm going to give

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:52.960
it the old college try anyway because

00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:57.880
I'd rather die than be called a baby

00:48:52.960 --> 00:49:00.460
because my pride is very very weak it's

00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:05.200
important to me that any slight gets met

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:08.650
with reckless behavior even if it does

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:14.620
border on being self harm hey get out of

00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:17.890
here stop this I don't believe you can

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:19.510
blow up doors this is the worst I don't

00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:26.590
believe you can blow up doors in

00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:28.950
delirium doors in delirium bombs over

00:49:26.590 --> 00:49:36.010
Baghdad it's an all-time classic

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:37.570
outcasts rank thankful SIBO I love you

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:41.260
but I wish you would stop doing that

00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:44.080
okay so let's be an inspirational story

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:46.120
for us and ergo the world and just beat

00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:48.340
delirium there is a chance this is

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:52.120
delirium and honestly to that I say

00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:54.940
bring them on I've never been scared of

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:57.030
anything less in my life than a slow

00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:59.260
death to delirium I was blastocyst

00:49:57.030 --> 00:50:00.610
honestly lucky for delirium this is

00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:05.740
blastocyst because his days were

00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:09.130
numbered IV vague give me IV bag I want

00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:12.730
the damage bonus and I wanted for a long

00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:16.660
time that's not IV bag but damage

00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:19.180
upgrade severe tears downgrade not that

00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:24.430
bad maybe with chocolate milk but the

00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:26.050
damage upgrade is not really worth it if

00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:27.400
we're just stacking splode I guess it

00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:29.170
doesn't care that's my new version of

00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:30.760
you know if you're getting a bunch of

00:50:29.170 --> 00:50:33.330
accessible SIBO shots you're stackins

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:33.330
close bro

00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:43.450
something about it sounds dirty and I

00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:52.480
think I like it we are one closer to

00:50:43.450 --> 00:50:54.370
spun now but no closer to one as in one

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:59.380
run not the loneliest number that you

00:50:54.370 --> 00:51:02.680
ever knew I know two can be just as bad

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:06.120
as one okay don't get started on me with

00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:06.120
this Amy man horse hockey

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:15.310
the adversary also not scared of you

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:20.320
thanks for the spirit art BAE free trend

00:51:15.310 --> 00:51:23.740
like add enough HP to our run that we

00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:25.330
can live at a maximum damage bonus for

00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:28.890
as long as it's possible then we can

00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:28.890
just stacks closed and we're good to go

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:33.400
keyboard probably sounds like

00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:37.060
insufferable right now but you know that

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:39.730
makes two of us nothing there delirium

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:41.140
okay had to happen

00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:43.000
why are there two deliriums on the

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:45.310
screen did you notice the double

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.660
delirium action there so I think the

00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:48.990
right course of action is to stack's

00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:48.990
blows

00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:57.450
everyone's like please stop saying that

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:59.310
I'm sure charge up a shot when you can't

00:51:57.450 --> 00:52:02.810
see them but when you can see them get

00:51:59.310 --> 00:52:02.810
those ecstasy bow shots go on buddy

00:52:06.350 --> 00:52:14.460
honestly at this point the circle of

00:52:09.090 --> 00:52:16.590
protection is like way better as a as a

00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:22.080
damage blocker than as a damage dealer

00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:25.110
and that's completely okay if I recall

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:30.180
we do not have nun's habit so don't

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:33.050
think I have a case to you know take

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:36.720
damage then use Yama hard I think our

00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:39.720
best course of action is going to be not

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:43.530
taking damage and then being pleasantly

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:45.660
surprised maybe later keep a move on

00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:47.490
here you know mom's foot does a lot of

00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:48.900
damage I think we've actually handled

00:52:47.490 --> 00:52:54.360
the first phase of this fight pretty

00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:57.630
well we do have a huge range here and

00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:59.970
lump of coal so yeah we're you know not

00:52:57.630 --> 00:53:03.180
at a disadvantage by doing this I think

00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:04.590
and any shots that we can deflect when

00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:06.060
we get up there are very helpful as well

00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:08.700
but it's not going to be a short

00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:14.790
delirium flightless no leave it at that

00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:19.940
so why am I not using yum hard right now

00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:24.360
seems to me that the best option for us

00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:25.590
would be to use a Yamaha to get a second

00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:29.130
round of permanent polaroid

00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:31.040
invincibility so I'm gonna try to use it

00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:33.360
when we fall down to a half heart I

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:34.650
don't think we have any lifesteal I can

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:37.730
mess that up I hope we don't have any

00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:37.730
lifesteal they can mess that up

00:53:39.350 --> 00:53:43.220
this guy's the worst dude

00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:52.150
okay that's where we want to deal our

00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:56.610
damage right here all right let's Evo

00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:58.840
shots all got popped out of the queue

00:53:56.610 --> 00:54:02.650
but still I think it's going pretty well

00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:04.150
we're about halfway done here we haven't

00:54:02.650 --> 00:54:06.070
taken a lot of what I would consider to

00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:11.350
be stupid damage maybe they've eased up

00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:16.450
on the Delirium nonsense maybe not thing

00:54:11.350 --> 00:54:18.730
is just like takes so long to do any

00:54:16.450 --> 00:54:20.560
damage to delirium like you're hitting

00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:24.910
them non-stop doesn't feel like the

00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:28.780
health bar is changing at all obviously

00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:36.520
over time it does I walked into a spider

00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:38.350
that's 100% my bed as far as I'm

00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:40.690
concerned scolex delirium is not

00:54:38.350 --> 00:54:42.700
hittable anybody who says otherwise has

00:54:40.690 --> 00:54:44.880
a burden of proof burden of proof on

00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:44.880
them

00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:51.980
I'm basically just walking around trying

00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:54.010
to dodge shots while tapping the up

00:54:51.980 --> 00:55:06.140
arrow key as fast as I can

00:54:54.010 --> 00:55:08.240
that's my new strategy here and it

00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:10.340
actually seems to be working okay

00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:12.980
although most phases of delirium don't

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:14.750
seem to last long enough to get dinged

00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:23.870
by the expose Evo shops too many times

00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:25.460
so this guy's not hittable that seems

00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:29.900
like a great way for us to deal damage

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:33.080
the Ragman heads other things worth

00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:35.050
noting I don't think permanent polaroid

00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:38.510
invincibility buys us much usefulness

00:55:35.050 --> 00:55:39.620
except for the invincibility

00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:40.760
I don't think were going to be able to I

00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:41.810
mean I know we have guillotine but

00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:47.690
that's not going to do too much to

00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:50.990
delirium I think oh my god I walked on

00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:54.920
pretty you might say NL your hand

00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:56.300
getting tired you might not say that but

00:55:54.920 --> 00:56:01.100
you should because yes you are correct

00:55:56.300 --> 00:56:03.530
my hand is starting a quite sore with

00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:06.260
fanny pack if we could get another half

00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:09.140
red heart I would be extremely pleased

00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:11.030
wouldn't turn up my nose at getting the

00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:13.010
full red heart although it would be

00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:15.910
worse from a permanent polaroid

00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:21.800
invincibility standpoint what is this

00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:23.620
earthquake behind you you probably have

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:26.960
fallen a little bit more behind on our

00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:30.950
our damage given versus damage taken

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:31.790
recently but we basically just have to

00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:34.010
use it right away

00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:35.420
I think we've remained competitive on

00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:38.290
this Delirium fight and that's all we

00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:38.290
really could have asked for

00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:45.950
I've walked right into that in my

00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:48.740
defense it's kind of a lot of stuff

00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:55.880
going on on this fight but we have taken

00:56:48.740 --> 00:57:00.140
some preventable damage to be sure no

00:56:55.880 --> 00:57:05.720
Isaacs please the beams are not

00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:07.850
plausible but alle da ah this is the

00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:09.170
wrong run to fight delirium probably but

00:57:07.850 --> 00:57:11.270
for now thanks for watching that was

00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:13.280
like 56 minutes uh I wouldn't say

00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:14.360
torture but a little behind the eight

00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:15.350
ball for now thanks for watching hope
