00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.300
everybody welcome exeter in the lamp is

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.589
Abunimah have to go through the plus

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.639
this is the kind of daily you got to

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.530
worry about it is Lazarus to Mom's foot

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.730
and the scores on the front page you go

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.130
from 36 thousand to 58,000 so there is a

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.720
seam Lord knows that I have no idea

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.070
where it is and it seems like there's

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.070
multiple of them but that's okay as well

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.320
yesterday forty-nine thousand 186 points

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.050
with a rank of 189 two point one seven

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.830
percentile a good score and we've been

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.960
really consistent like over the past

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:37.559
days of 29 over the past six days 1.5

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.899
1.5 1.5 12.5 too likely these are good

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.600
ranks and I'm feeling like I've got my

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.360
mojo back but still we're waiting on

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.739
that daily that really I just punched my

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.300
hand that just says it all right there

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.360
I'm way now that daily it takes us to

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.000
the next level I mean obviously we're

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.640
Lazarus you can see our stats here minus

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.020
one luck it's good to die early as

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.890
Lazarus Lazarus is one of those

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.510
characters who actually sort of like I

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.369
think more than the average person but I

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.750
really have no idea why like Lazarus

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.880
consistently if you look at like Isaac

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.439
oh what a terrible bit of damage right

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.439
there if you look at like Isaac

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.630
subreddit posts that are like who's your

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.850
least favorite character Lazarus shows

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.290
up people are like you know I was going

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.490
to say Lazarus but the only reason I

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.610
didn't is because I forgot that he's

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.900
even in the game for some reason I guess

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.729
I like the the early game puzzle of you

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.920
know when is it appropriate to actually

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.540
productively die great start by the way

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.450
really good start here taking a little

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.159
bit too much damage but that's alright

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.630
it's kind of secondary the most

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.220
important thing on this run as you can

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.299
see or as you can tell from the scores

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.009
is that we really really need to find

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.320
the seam that allows us to proceed and I

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.820
mean 36,000 is usually like getting the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.420
Sheol 50,000 is like maybe you somehow

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.740
played I mean 56,000 is like a late

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.590
self-sacrifice room and so that's a

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:12.270
really really good score made that much

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.709
better by remembering that this was only

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.750
supposed to go to Mom's foot to begin

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.629
like that would be a good score on a

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.859
mega Satan run to be a great score on a

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:25.379
mega Satan run so to get 56,000 on a run

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:28.859
like this is kind of absurd that's

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:30.900
garbage but we'll take it and we should

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:33.269
try to maybe create an arcade by

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.799
shooting some poop our pill was retro

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.459
vision I wanted to use it because there

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:41.939
is like another pill of this type just

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.799
surrounded by some spikes but I don't

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:45.629
really want to risk walking on spikes to

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.939
pick up a retro vision pill because the

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:51.900
pill is a joke that doesn't do anything

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:54.930
so if you'll excuse me I think I'm just

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.030
going to completely ignore that we

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.859
should leave like you know maybe the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.030
spikes being there though isn't a bad

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.760
thing because we can use those to

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.120
productively in our own lives here and

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.389
then pick up the the Lazarus bonus which

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.919
is luck in like a 25% increase the

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.590
damage multiplier I think something

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:17.129
along those lines so many opportunities

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.900
by the way for uh for tinted rocks all

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.459
we need is a bomb it's like 10,000

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.609
spoons when all we need is a freaking

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.949
nice buddy why the Alanis Morisette kick

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.299
lately I don't know it just it's come up

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:29.970
a lot I haven't listened to Jagged

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.370
Little Pill in a long time but I you

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.439
know first cool god that piercing shot

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.470
almost put me in bad place there world

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:39.479
of hurt jagged little pill great album

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.150
though a forgotten because it's kind of

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:46.169
a time capsule but you ought to know is

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:50.430
like genuinely not a mean song it's like

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:53.569
an actual great rock song and if you

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.769
disagree you know I'm tempted to say

00:03:53.569 --> 00:04:02.189
you're rock and roll snob

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:07.560
I mean okay I mean where do we have any

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:09.959
red hearts sitting here we don't we

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.419
really really need to kick this into

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:17.310
gear as well timewise so I'm going to

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:18.739
try to just see what this is maybe we

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.590
shouldn't take

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.490
it's not necessarily a good decision but

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:29.449
it's what I'm gonna do kill me

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:32.150
give me the Flies give me old bandage

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.500
give me the pee beat boys isn't free my

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.850
soul I want to get lost in the rock and

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:40.160
roll and drift away okay not a good rock

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.940
song oh so you like Alanis Morissette

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.919
but you don't like Uncle Kracker

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.550
you say that with a straight face mr.

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:51.889
Strom man

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:58.490
bring me a dream mr. Strummer and bring

00:04:51.889 --> 00:05:01.910
me a scheme whoa be careful here okay

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.419
good work everyone I swear to God every

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.120
day

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:07.009
no is that quiet as a frickin Mouse on

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:11.599
skype until I start recording Isaac and

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:13.400
they go okay time to talk Maz has just

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:15.650
sent us a message it says all rainy

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.560
Boston weather how I missed you the dude

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.280
was in Atlanta for two days what are you

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:25.220
tired they've missed the rain in Boston

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.720
try living in the PN dub buddy rains all

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.560
the time with you like twenty-two days

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.940
of rain every month in the winter you

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.030
know we say when we get away from the

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.070
rain thank God you don't even know you

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.599
don't know what it's like man you ought

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.150
to know what it's okay now we'll pop

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:47.000
enough okay popping automotive ease

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:48.860
let's go let's go that's not no that's a

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.620
secret room I'm sorry to inform you this

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:55.190
is a secret room we're in an amazing

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:57.470
spot now but there is a lot of inherent

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.150
risk that that shows up as a result of

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.250
this so we got to be very very careful

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.289
and we do need to speed up as well but

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.539
we don't need to speed up quite yet so

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:08.060
that was our secret room

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:09.199
unfortunately because it would be nice

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.729
to be able to go to the curse room

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:14.990
without ruining our deals to deal with

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:17.780
the devil chance but now dr. Peters

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:22.900
doesn't really give us a bead I need to

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.900
pick that up on a on a scene

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:31.780
on an Adele two-seam but it should allow

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.640
us to get some extra bonuses like second

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.530
secret rooms secret rooms as long as

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:39.340
we're semi diligent about like looking

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.630
for those where they appear where they

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.690
could appear we should be in a decent

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:46.390
spot similarly like I kind of want to go

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.820
to our shop here and then I figured yeah

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:51.850
you can blow up this guy maybe he gives

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.590
you a nickel and then we can we're not

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.940
going to be able to get diplopia so I

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.080
think we buy a spirit heart and then see

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.850
what this card is and it's two of

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.010
diamonds which might seem like I'd be

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.900
bummed out but actually I'm unbelievably

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.900
happy about that that's extremely good

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:07.540
and then this isn't a secret room I

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.910
don't I don't believe it I know we got

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:13.230
to go faster but with dr. fetus we gotta

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:16.090
try to find a second secret room that

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:19.030
was a really perfectly placed bomb I

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:22.240
take no credit for it but I guess if I

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:25.810
have to there's our second secret room

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:29.470
it is locust of pestilence which should

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:31.090
do some extra damage and I miss the

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:34.540
tinted rock on this floor I don't think

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:35.860
so so first things first I'll eat your

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.470
brains then I'll start rocking gold

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.420
teeth and fangs so this is the eating of

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:46.120
the brains portion of the of the rap

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:48.370
game right here almost botched it a

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:51.310
little bit we'll definitely take PJ's to

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:58.360
start with some extra spirit arts here

00:07:51.310 --> 00:08:01.270
oh okay so that's how it's going to be

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:03.810
huh we definitely one go did it we

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:06.130
definitely want Avedon

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:07.390
this is a situation that doesn't happen

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:12.040
very often but you know it might

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:14.740
actually be fine believe that again the

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:18.340
angel statues give you like if not a

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:19.870
damage multiplier they give you like not

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.790
a damage multiplier sorry like a points

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.980
multiplier for doing them plus whatever

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:26.020
consumables we get for doing this but if

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.610
I had given myself the choice I probably

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.710
would have preferred to have not done

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:31.240
this right off the bat but that's life

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:33.670
we didn't slow ourselves down too much

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:36.099
grab this get the bombs grab this now

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:36.710
for our final trick we got to go back to

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:37.880
this cursor

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:41.030
I know you're saying it's taking forever

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:44.750
and it did but we got a lot of extreme

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:48.770
value on this floor so I'm not sweating

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:52.040
it too much good bomb teleported to the

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:53.720
deal with the devil and let's go so now

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.370
we got non-stop deals with the devil

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.410
we got an angel statue already killed

00:08:55.370 --> 00:09:00.140
for reasons that are still a little

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:03.500
strange to me and in two of diamonds

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:05.750
which we want to make work with like

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:07.820
blank card if we can get blank card to a

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:11.960
diamonds I'm loving life and we

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:14.450
shouldn't spend too much time exploring

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:18.440
really because we are again behind

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:21.380
schedule and no one knows what it's like

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:27.140
to freaking be the bad man or the sad

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:29.510
man behind schedule so we got to be a

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:31.220
little bit more diligent about getting

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:33.080
our job done here we will take pills

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.550
we have no HP so pills seem like a

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.340
sensible option I just want to see if

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:38.480
maybe secret room no secret room so we

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:38.690
might as well go to our curse room right

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:46.340
away

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:48.530
minimize backtracking and me and that's

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:52.550
fine even with unknown or curse of the

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:57.310
unknown I feel good about our HP and I

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:57.310
think I should not a secret room

00:09:57.889 --> 00:10:05.959
I don't know I I don't know what we've

00:10:01.429 --> 00:10:08.029
done they could really be a big coup for

00:10:05.959 --> 00:10:08.989
us early on in this run but it might be

00:10:08.029 --> 00:10:11.359
two of diamonds

00:10:08.989 --> 00:10:14.629
you know it's conceivable that two of

00:10:11.359 --> 00:10:17.629
diamonds is that is a fairly big

00:10:14.629 --> 00:10:22.429
improvement for us admittedly perthro is

00:10:17.629 --> 00:10:25.489
really good as well to use temporarily

00:10:22.429 --> 00:10:28.790
but if we're really really grinding to

00:10:25.489 --> 00:10:31.100
try to get that to get the boss rush

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:32.660
which we of course want to then I think

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:35.809
we're going to just not take it but

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:37.850
we'll rethink things if we get the the

00:10:35.809 --> 00:10:39.919
chance and we have the time to go back

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:42.769
like you might think I'm overly paranoid

00:10:39.919 --> 00:10:44.569
that's a secret room dude that's a

00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:48.709
secret room dude you might think I'm

00:10:44.569 --> 00:10:50.779
paranoid about a boss rush but it really

00:10:48.709 --> 00:10:52.639
is like all important on these as we've

00:10:50.779 --> 00:10:57.199
established no infinity times in the

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:58.850
past so I'm not going to feel the need

00:10:57.199 --> 00:10:59.959
the apologize for making it the boss

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:01.569
right if you're still watching the

00:10:59.959 --> 00:11:03.559
dailies at this point which is a big if

00:11:01.569 --> 00:11:04.759
but if you're still watching the daily

00:11:03.559 --> 00:11:06.919
to this point you know what the dailies

00:11:04.759 --> 00:11:09.199
are all about it's about a daily

00:11:06.919 --> 00:11:11.600
meditation it's the crossword puzzle

00:11:09.199 --> 00:11:12.949
you've got a series of steps you execute

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.809
in a particular order to achieve an

00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:16.309
objective Hulu sounds so exciting tell

00:11:14.809 --> 00:11:18.790
me more this is my favorite you know

00:11:16.309 --> 00:11:18.790
form of entertainment

00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:24.980
now what I I hope there's people out

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:26.569
there who enjoy these runs for the same

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.879
reason that I enjoy them because of the

00:11:26.569 --> 00:11:30.739
fact that I don't want to say that

00:11:28.879 --> 00:11:32.600
they're predictable because I like to be

00:11:30.739 --> 00:11:34.939
the sane man as well but it's an outlet

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.829
for for predictability and an otherwise

00:11:34.939 --> 00:11:40.189
chaotic universe here so that's our

00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:43.220
second secret room and it's given us a

00:11:40.189 --> 00:11:44.689
an addicted pill and a relax pill

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:49.220
neither of which are really meaningful

00:11:44.689 --> 00:11:51.619
and then we'll blow this rule blow this

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:53.149
guy up and we got our secret room and

00:11:51.619 --> 00:11:57.100
the secret room is probably going to

00:11:53.149 --> 00:11:57.100
give us money it did not

00:11:57.839 --> 00:12:01.630
so we're behind schedule again which

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:05.880
means I'm not going to go back for

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:07.750
perthro health up is actually good

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:10.930
remember we're going to get a deal with

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:14.080
the devil so starter deck by the way is

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:15.850
a tempting pickup but it does sort of it

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:21.220
spits in our face right now when we're

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:24.399
trying to go more quickly here we missed

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:28.480
it's a narrow room we miss every single

00:12:24.399 --> 00:12:31.209
enemy with one bomb not bitter not not

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.830
bitter Book of Shadows is good and Book

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:34.089
of Shadows also means we don't go back

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:38.920
for per throw which means I think we're

00:12:34.089 --> 00:12:43.080
content to rock to a diamonds here we

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.080
can't go this slow forever

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.779
it's compost for our secret room so

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:49.240
let's get a move on here pop this and

00:12:46.779 --> 00:12:51.550
then basically the stain is done because

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.770
he's always going to pop up pop up like

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:55.959
right next to us so as long as we got

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:57.700
Book of Shadows active which lasted like

00:12:55.959 --> 00:13:03.810
about a third as long as I thought it

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:03.810
actually did we're completely fine here

00:13:04.529 --> 00:13:10.620
he's popping he's just going around

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.620
popping there we go he's done

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.779
take the tears upgrade useful for raw

00:13:12.819 --> 00:13:16.000
damage output

00:13:13.779 --> 00:13:20.620
oh you're go for broke here so you take

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.029
this and then you take this we could

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.740
have done that in the opposite way and

00:13:22.029 --> 00:13:27.490
been fine but I want to keep one red

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:29.050
heart because the red heart allows us to

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:31.329
trade easily for deals with the devil in

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:34.449
the future however considering we traded

00:13:31.329 --> 00:13:38.529
three spirit hours for the red heart my

00:13:34.449 --> 00:13:40.420
normal like valuation kind of falls flat

00:13:38.529 --> 00:13:43.569
there but you might say hey can you

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:45.910
explain yourself there I mean I what the

00:13:43.569 --> 00:13:48.490
reason I prefer to have one red heart is

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:50.379
because it allows me to take a deal with

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:51.639
the devil for one red heart and set of

00:13:50.379 --> 00:13:53.110
three spear in arson I think that three

00:13:51.639 --> 00:13:54.850
spirit hearts are usually worth more

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:56.410
however the problem with this logic is

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:57.819
that I spent three spirit hearts to get

00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:00.959
one red heart back but it did come with

00:13:57.819 --> 00:14:03.009
nine lives as well so maybe it's not

00:14:00.959 --> 00:14:04.779
basically I preordered

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:07.660
how did I not take damage there does

00:14:04.779 --> 00:14:10.269
anemic make us immune to creep I would

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:12.360
have known that by now for all the

00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:16.199
damage I take against dumb sources I

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.199
would have known that by now

00:14:17.819 --> 00:14:22.810
don't waste your keys keys are still

00:14:21.009 --> 00:14:26.290
valuable even now you know that's one

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:27.880
shop one item room right there think

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:29.980
just I don't think I would have been hit

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:34.000
there but if you know you got a chance

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:37.800
to get hit when I use when I use your

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.800
book of shadows it's what is there for

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:53.860
Lazarus rag a little weird okay so I

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:58.150
mean it's you know there's something to

00:14:53.860 --> 00:15:00.100
that right like the fishtail doubles the

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:03.550
amount of flies we summon when we summon

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:05.140
flies so friends will the end would have

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:07.720
summoned a ton there but we have

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:11.080
infestation as well so I'm thinking that

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:12.730
there might be like a weird fly synergy

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:16.930
somewhere on this run that that works

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:20.700
really well but obviously that's not the

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:20.700
route we've chosen to go and that's fine

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.560
it could have been cool let's see what's

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:34.660
in here

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:36.640
I mean if you're going to buy one you

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:39.280
should buy diplopia because then you get

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:41.410
everything out of this for the same

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:46.080
price and then we'll take to Book of

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:46.080
Shadows and maybe not the best use of

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.400
not the best use of two of diamonds but

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:52.870
like a decent use of two a diamonds now

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.760
we have black candle along with us as

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:57.630
well again kind of a lame use of the

00:15:54.760 --> 00:16:00.760
fallopian but lame but sensible you know

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:01.930
like putting your money in bonds I don't

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:04.420
know I don't know anything about

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:06.400
investing I should stop I'm not giving

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:08.560
out advice I'm giving out like pseudo

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:11.080
it's comedy advice you should not take

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:12.880
it as a real financial advice but as

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.200
possible to people you know you never

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.700
know you've got to be even when you got

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.170
a platform as small as mine you got to

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:20.350
be responsible people might take you a

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:21.940
little too seriously I heard that you

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:23.890
should only buy bonds in this day and

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.490
age who told you that good an idiot on

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:27.490
the Internet

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:29.500
see we both be idiots in that situation

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:30.880
so we had to run we had to make it

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:34.960
through that floor quickly we still do

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:36.580
not have a scene that's a bad time for

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:40.570
us because we've only got two floors and

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:44.050
beyond Thanks beyond only having two

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:45.370
floors no yeah the apps deserve it very

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:47.050
much deserve it

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:48.340
beyond only having two floors we got two

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:50.940
floors in which we got to go real

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.940
freaking fast

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:01.710
as you got to check probably shouldn't

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:06.470
have taken that long but you got to

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:09.420
check so we want to be out of this floor

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:11.370
relatively soon we have piercing bombs I

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:12.689
picked it up mostly for the damage

00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:20.429
upgrade but it might actually be

00:17:12.689 --> 00:17:22.679
terrible hey something else hit this we

00:17:20.429 --> 00:17:28.800
should probably at this point blow up

00:17:22.679 --> 00:17:30.360
every single skull we ever see just so

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.490
that if there's an a washer and we can

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:34.530
make it happen

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:36.240
short of an eihwaz room you know what

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:38.010
our other seems the shovel the shovel is

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.740
a big one and the shovel should be like

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:43.200
if it exists we will find it because we

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.940
have the goat head I live fond and right

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:48.300
into myself use the frickin Book of

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:51.300
Shadows you dummy so I always mind flood

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:53.100
myself on these on these runs in which

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:55.830
you need a seam now the D one creates

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:58.620
extra versions of consumables which is

00:17:55.830 --> 00:18:00.990
actually essential I might not seem that

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:05.910
great right now but what this means is

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:07.559
that if we get a forgettin eihwaz room

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.850
we can double it floor to floor or at

00:18:07.559 --> 00:18:11.400
least like create an extra one every

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:13.470
floor I probably more likely create like

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:24.270
an extra two or three every floor keep

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:28.100
ourselves going strong there's a great

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:30.170
accident my favorite mistake Sheryl Crow

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:34.200
you're alive

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:36.179
Yes Mother too bad you will die that

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:41.250
quote I inverted that quote for Mortal

00:18:36.179 --> 00:18:45.660
Kombat annihilation dude

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:49.530
dude get dusted you're resisting the

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:51.750
dusting to an absurd degree I know I'm

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:54.410
leaving money on the table back here so

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:54.410
to speak but

00:18:55.660 --> 00:19:02.320
like I'm done losing my life here as me

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:05.200
in the corner

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:13.300
losing my frickin religion like Michael

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:16.120
Skype oh and yet in spite of all this in

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:24.090
Skype of all this I still believe in our

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:28.090
chances no rune justice bloodbag

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:31.120
magician not that useful pill bad gas

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:34.740
that's fine let's go let's go home power

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:37.030
power pill okay good great job teamwork

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:39.700
obviously like we want to go to the shop

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:42.040
but it's just not that conducive right

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:44.320
now to having success

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:49.300
the big problem by the way is actually

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:50.530
that I picked up death touch we never

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:53.670
should have picked it up don't give me

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:56.770
Krampus I don't want to fight Krampus

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:58.540
that's not grandmas I like I like it and

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:59.980
we'll go pretty deep on this one I want

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:01.720
rotten baby for the guaranteed damage

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:03.850
and contract from Bulow's non-compulsory

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:05.440
on dailies or sorry is compulsory on

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:06.490
dailies you've got to pick it up let's

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.580
go

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:11.230
didn't go to our shop oh let's go didn't

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:15.550
go to our shop but we didn't have a

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:19.890
chance to go to our shop all right we're

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:22.420
about where we'd expect to be on points

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:24.460
this guy he doesn't take damage he's

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:28.020
immune to damage sorry to inform you

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:28.020
that he is a god

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:35.360
the Sun the incredibly useful item crack

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:38.240
into this

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.769
where we going boys we got a book you

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:44.120
know what important for bookworm

00:20:39.769 --> 00:20:47.090
otherwise irrelevant I do not see a

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:54.080
self-sacrifice room so we know that we

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:56.419
want to go into the boss fight so we

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:58.159
have to go to the boss fight first there

00:20:56.419 --> 00:21:03.049
is a chance admittedly that it's like

00:20:58.159 --> 00:21:07.029
mr. mega or something in the in the shop

00:21:03.049 --> 00:21:10.519
but we have to we have to play like

00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:12.820
sensibly and the most sensible play here

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:17.629
is what we're doing right now getting to

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:19.460
the boss room that's the secret room I

00:21:17.629 --> 00:21:22.250
refuse to believe anything else now I

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:27.080
think like the mom fight is going to be

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:29.149
hell on earth dr. fetus without the

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:31.669
ability to really like place a shot is

00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:35.320
going to be super annoying we have to

00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:35.320
live through boss rush as well

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:49.570
see what I mean like we got good damage

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:54.350
rotten baby should do a number on them

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:57.680
every shot we managed to hit is actually

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:59.030
extremely valuable and it's never mind

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:01.370
what I said earlier this turned out to

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:03.380
be a very easy boss fight' and then we

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:07.850
definitely want to polaroid and then

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:09.920
it's not Krampus one spirit heart for

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:12.980
the pact is pretty good it also gave us

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:15.950
Leviathan I mean come in here what do we

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:20.990
do I mean you could see for yourself

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:22.520
into some amazing stuff maybe probably

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:29.660
you know what if we're possibly going to

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:32.900
die we should just go to the d4 man we

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:34.790
got conjoined to begin with and we've

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:38.960
already like I don't know maybe we hit

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:46.490
the jackpot early because this run seems

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:50.990
quite good but I think that we just

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:52.700
didn't find any theme and this if this

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:54.800
ends up being what this dailies about

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:57.740
like okay we got to re-roll this because

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:59.270
it's the damage choosing quite as good

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:07.010
as I thought it would be despite the

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:08.870
ridiculous output but you see my

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:10.400
conundrum here is so you can't hit me

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:13.360
with explosions that's right my

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.360
conundrum here is

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:19.340
we could have gone faster and maybe had

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:21.710
a greater chance now this seems like the

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:23.480
dream come true we could have gone

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:26.300
faster maybe have more time to look for

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:30.410
a scene but I hate when a daily forces

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:37.190
you to do that I mean this run is like

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:39.110
good it's not quite ridiculous like the

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:41.090
damage is great but the rate of fire is

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:43.540
bad enough that it doesn't super

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:45.800
compensate for it so I think we should

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:47.180
wait till we kill the enemies because

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:50.330
it's easy enough to kill them like this

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:56.980
and then as they're dying but before you

00:23:50.330 --> 00:24:05.740
get your next charge reroll like that

00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:07.670
this seems terrible but it's sort of not

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:10.130
but we're probably going to go for the

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:16.760
extra reroll again regardless yeah this

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:20.600
is not that bad that being said okay

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:22.880
there's fun now this we're starting to

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:26.990
speak my language and give me a bite of

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:31.430
a Vegemite sandwich here because we've

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:38.540
got like infinite range good damage I

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:39.650
think this is dead I I have a feeling

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:42.080
that this is going to be the end of

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:46.340
today's day leave which is you know as

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:48.920
always a mega bummer not being able to

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:50.510
find a seam but I actually think that

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:56.330
like a lot of people are going to be in

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:58.820
the same camp based on the fact that you

00:24:56.330 --> 00:25:00.110
know the top scorers have a 20,000 point

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:02.720
gulf between number one and number

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:04.820
thirty generally I think that I mean I

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.140
guess we keep free rolling but maybe

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:08.620
we'll get the shovel for finishing this

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.620
or something

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:18.610
you know generally the greater the

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:20.440
spread on the front page the the tougher

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:21.700
it is to find like that line that really

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:23.320
carries you let's go for the rear oh

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:27.820
this fungi I don't know what I'm looking

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:29.650
for on the rear oh by the way certainly

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:31.690
take you more damages and really helping

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:38.440
us here but if I'm really just trying to

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:40.000
protect like you know one like not so

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.670
amazing leaderboard position then who

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.290
cares

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:49.090
mom transformation lusty blood

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:53.850
he's homing or charm tears their charm

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:56.020
tears charm T is that I wish you saw I

00:25:53.850 --> 00:26:00.280
wish that I could find the seam on this

00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:01.660
round on this Ron this is the first run

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.460
with like no transformations we've had

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:06.670
in a long time so this is where you like

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:08.230
stop re rolling if you actually care

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:15.309
about your performance today

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:18.970
I guess although our damage is one point

00:26:15.309 --> 00:26:20.770
five six which is garbage but that means

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:22.420
we can do this which I have not been

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:24.400
doing I don't know we're going to be at

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:27.850
like 20,000 a day that's not a good

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:30.670
score we got broken mirror I don't know

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:35.770
where you were like rear Olin to try to

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:38.940
get a passive item that gives us a seam

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:41.380
which doesn't even make any sense I

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:42.670
guess that's it what a bomber dude

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:44.860
there's nothing we could have done the

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:49.000
best of my knowledge there or 500 and

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:50.290
forth but you know I have no idea where

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.370
you find the seam there probably

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:52.720
somewhere else on this floor that we

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:54.820
didn't think we had time to get to an n

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:56.440
yell mama mega and the boss are in the

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:58.480
shop or something like that kind of a

00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:01.559
whiff on this daily so I apologize but

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:03.610
at the same time you know I'm doing this

00:27:01.559 --> 00:27:05.650
masturbatory motion with my hand right

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:07.360
now like just give me one that doesn't

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:08.590
require this level of puzzle solving on

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:11.350
the sixth freaking floor we don't have

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:12.190
