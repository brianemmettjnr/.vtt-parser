##

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
never about a welcome action rule and

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.130
place binding once again plus

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.629
yesterday's daily was really fun

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.000
you were the lost you couldn't shoot

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.550
your tears you had familiars we didn't

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.500
do boss rush or hush because it was not

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.269
going to be plausible to succeed and

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.560
survive however we got thirty nine

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.690
thousand eight hundred eighty six points

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.500
came 91st a ranking of one point zero

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.000
nine percent dial not as amazing as I

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.359
thought but considerably didn't do the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.560
Hail Mary of naught or the Hail Mary of

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.960
doing boss rush and hush I can

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.500
understand it we also have another lost

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.460
day like today but that's okay this is a

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:46.739
lost daily what's or you couldn't see

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:48.420
that ah that goes to the show floor

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.800
which means in theory it should go to

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.379
the void floor which means you probably

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.610
want to leave before you fight delirium

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.620
but we'll see

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.899
I normally I like to at least try to go

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.300
for it but we'll see how the world

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.640
shakes out here yet definitely do not

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.110
welcome the spikes that's hurting for a

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.630
score than their what a gross way to

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.400
phrase that anyway I like the loss for

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.260
some reason I think I tend to perform

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.390
better as the lost and as the average

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.110
character you're wondering why I haven't

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.490
taken mom's wig yet I'm like 50/50 not

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.490
on mom's wig as an item I think it's a

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.680
good item possibly even a great item

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.380
because it scales with your rate of fire

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.509
kind of like the Mulligan so the more

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.000
frequently you fire a tear the more

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.369
likely you are those nothing more likely

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.560
you are but the more spiders you will

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.119
generate as a result of that so I think

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.100
if you can stack up tiers it's really

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.470
nice but also is the lost you kind of

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.490
want to ball out of control if you want

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.259
to do well first off if you want to be

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.939
with me baby there's a price to pay I'm

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.430
a genie in the boss rush you've got to

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.950
rub me the right way there's a better

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.590
parity there give me a second if you

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.630
want to pick up me it's not really

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.770
proper phrasing with that that starts if

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.070
you wanna pick up me baby there's a

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.829
price to pay

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.709
Polyphemus in the bass rush get to me by

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.950
minute Wednesday it sort of works you

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.510
know this is like

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.330
you're watching Kanye West make a beat

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.810
right now and just sort of see it in my

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.620
head it cleaned the community anyway um

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.200
I I think I'm just going to take it it

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.690
seems like a sensible approach to me to

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.920
take mom's wig plus it allows us to kill

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.070
a little bit of the time that we've got

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.530
with are you a wizard here making it to

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.480
the boss rush by itself is like a decent

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.020
challenge as the lost we really would be

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.430
hoping for like a good course spider-man

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.660
we've really be hoping for a good deal

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.860
with the devil on the next floor but

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.450
let's just hope that we live long enough

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.430
to experience a deal with the devil on

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.470
the next floor and for those of you

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.270
unaware I am deliberately skipping

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:58.600
tinted rocks if we get smaller ah that's

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.980
actually extremely useful however I

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.900
don't really want to speed down read yet

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:08.750
we could survive it but I don't really

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:10.550
want it and I want to save bombs because

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.110
they could be like I mean first off

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.000
secret rooms you know they have a

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.040
potentiality especially on second secret

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.280
rooms to give us runes that could give

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.510
us some value but beyond that you know

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.790
if we get in trouble against this boss

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.470
so you might just want to drop a bomb

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.170
down and save ourselves the trouble of

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.850
having to deal with it but now that we

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.500
get a speed plus range upgrade we can

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.730
definitely absorb a speed downgrade

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.170
without it being too much of a problem

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.070
as long as it's a productive speed

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:40.250
downgrade I can't be mad about it so

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.930
this is like the perfect sort of daily

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.030
setup for me what did I ask for in

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.620
dailies I hope this is Nicolas going

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.300
like be careful what you wish for we

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.959
watch your videos and be careful what

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:55.370
you wish for because like this is

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:57.470
actually what I asked for specifically

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.140
is you know less dailies where you have

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.640
a decent amount of HP but no damage and

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.200
more dailies where you know if you want

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.450
to make a challenging just make you play

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.590
as the loft maybe you know I'm not I'm

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.400
not taking credit for it it's probably

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.830
just coincidence however if you're mad

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.239
about it what can I say enjoy the Lost

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.640
he's the most dynamic player in

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.310
sports-entertainment right now another

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:24.389
speed upgrade linger beam is at least

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:27.699
like okay it's at least a passive

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.780
we could survive with the with an active

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.879
right now it doesn't even have to be

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.439
that good because we're looking to

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:34.120
replace the the d4 so we don't

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:36.689
accidentally press the spacebar when

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.669
we're like trying to skip the boss intro

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:41.680
might as well pick it up it I think it

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.000
doesn't give you points like we saw on

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.710
the last run that it doesn't give you

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.650
points but we might as well give it a

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:52.240
shot

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:54.789
one bomb kind of has me interested in

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.620
going to the boss fight immediately we

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.940
didn't fight a jerk on the last floor

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.669
like we didn't fight little horn

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.560
we didn't fight the haunt so we might

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:06.490
have like a genuine challenge but we

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:10.060
might as well now just you know give it

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.759
the old college try here okay that was

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.050
very lucky to not be hit to take these

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:15.669
guys out it's really just you know

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:21.669
maximizing our advantages more bombs

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:23.319
would be sweet it's kind of what I asked

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:27.370
for but not specifically and I hate you

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:28.629
so that's our secret room probably I'm

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.340
just going to shoot these quickly it

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:31.870
probably won't be the difference-maker

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.069
between getting the boss rush you're not

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.870
getting the boss rush it we might not be

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:36.190
able to handle boss rush anyway so a

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.840
regular version of little horn with no

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.400
fires this is fine and if it sounds like

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.860
I'm talking a lot about Isaac and not

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.229
talking a lot about you know random riff

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:47.979
Raff's

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:50.289
you you be right but it's because of the

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:52.930
fact that you know the run is a

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:58.449
challenge right now I also walked right

00:05:52.930 --> 00:06:00.460
into little horn so I'm trying to get

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:02.620
these spiders if possible there we go we

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.349
did it we did it we did it got HP which

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.210
doesn't matter no Krampus no Krampus we

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:08.620
get the pentagram let's go find the

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.099
regular secret room this is not that

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.620
good

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:19.539
like the pentagram doesn't save us from

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:20.770
a death probably worth it the pentagram

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:23.589
doesn't save us from death or anything

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.879
like that but it does improve our damage

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:27.099
and give us a better deal with the devil

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:28.539
champ so it's not bad we're going to

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:31.000
head down on the next floor not even

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:31.930
pick up the HP because we don't need HP

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.659
unless we come back to life with

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:37.449
somebody else so it might seem like the

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:39.400
dailies have been like too on topic

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:42.789
recently I've been talking too much

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:45.129
Isaac you saying an L I don't need to

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:47.979
know all this Isaac stuff I know all

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:49.779
about Isaac I've been watching this game

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:52.930
for five years I know all there is to

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:56.469
know and you're right but you know you

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:58.300
watch basketball for five years you

00:06:56.469 --> 00:07:00.699
watch football for five years you know

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.409
what are the commentators say you know

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:03.759
third and two they'll probably go over a

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:05.319
rushing play here John you know you

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:10.240
still got to talk about the game it's

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:13.499
analysis idle chitchat and especially

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:16.210
with a run as this character the lost

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:18.189
very important you got a yeah you have

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:20.469
two purposes like explain how the games

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:22.150
go and build a narrative occasionally

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:25.330
make up a song parody we already knocked

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:27.400
up the song parody right off the bat now

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:32.289
if we see Polyphemus and boss rush it's

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:34.089
like the prophecy is is foretold I've

00:07:32.289 --> 00:07:37.479
already forgotten it was if you want to

00:07:34.089 --> 00:07:39.219
pick up me I'm just going to pop the

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:43.740
Empress right away to make our life

00:07:39.219 --> 00:07:46.509
easier baby there's a price to pay

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:48.969
Polyphemus on the bass rush you've got

00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:54.669
to a rad minute twenty okay like it's

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:57.249
slightly syllabic lee improper slightly

00:07:54.669 --> 00:08:00.789
syllabic also my rap name I'm a

00:07:57.249 --> 00:08:06.209
linguistic rapper I've got extreme

00:08:00.789 --> 00:08:06.209
phonemes but I look like a fur trapper

00:08:06.779 --> 00:08:14.219
this is like a bad flight of the

00:08:09.129 --> 00:08:14.219
conchords analog in there somewhere but

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:24.289
they stay alert and stay safe like a

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:27.229
Canadian after-school special TSA I mean

00:08:24.289 --> 00:08:30.169
do you want remote then Nader here it

00:08:27.229 --> 00:08:32.599
gives us five bombs so we take it but do

00:08:30.169 --> 00:08:36.110
we hold it seems like kind of a bit of a

00:08:32.599 --> 00:08:39.770
whip right I'm not saying it's worse

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:41.659
than the d4 I'm just saying we probably

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:46.250
never use it to begin with and then

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:48.620
beyond that the d4 is unlikely to ever

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:51.649
be useful for us but if it is ever

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:54.440
useful for us then it's going to be more

00:08:51.649 --> 00:08:57.260
useful than the remote detonator remote

00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:00.610
detonator is like when you press the

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:05.570
button you get X X is a known quantity

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:08.209
you get a bomb that explodes d4 is like

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:13.339
when you press a button you roll a 200

00:09:08.209 --> 00:09:17.089
sided die you could get anything out of

00:09:13.339 --> 00:09:19.130
that sure you could get the worst role

00:09:17.089 --> 00:09:22.130
of all time you could roll a 1 out of

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:24.770
200 we've done that on probably more

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:26.120
occasions than one you could roll a 200

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:28.130
we've probably done that on more

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.720
occasions than one as well I don't think

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:33.620
we need this I mean like I don't think

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:34.970
this provides us with any value we have

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.860
enough bombs that I would look for a

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:43.520
second secret room just does try to get

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:47.360
a rune or something so just be cool here

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:49.130
this is this is a tough room now it's

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.350
not the spiders are very helpful

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:53.060
gerrae is not that good for us right now

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.440
but it's worth holding we're not going

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.300
down to the chest of the thing hoggle Oz

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:59.060
is irrelevant on soos is largely

00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:01.490
irrelevant blank rune was the God so it

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:03.770
does nothing for us and perthro

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:05.120
which also gave us another blank room so

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.290
he might as well try to / throw this

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.690
even though this might not be per throw

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:11.779
again it was / sir we get shot speeding

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:15.020
the car that's something the card is

00:10:11.779 --> 00:10:17.480
temperance which is irrelevant so it's

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:20.720
hollow Ciera or on soos and I mean you

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:22.760
go yera at least we can try to get a

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:26.540
point boost out of it but it's not

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:28.980
really very meaningful at all probably

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:32.010
could get lucky I suppose

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:36.899
here okay golden chest tempting better

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:38.670
closer warmer I kind of any words we're

00:10:36.899 --> 00:10:39.630
doing actually very well considering

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:42.510
that we're not ballin out of control

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:44.990
we're way ahead of schedule but we're

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:46.949
way ahead of schedule apparently is like

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:49.980
slightly more than a minute ahead of

00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:51.870
schedule we've been a little overly

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.490
optimistic and our stats aren't that

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:55.769
good but they're okay particularly our

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:58.920
speed which is important inherently in

00:10:55.769 --> 00:11:04.440
the dodging factors so it helps if you

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:08.370
can like shoot these enemies ever the

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:10.769
only reason I'm not going it's a lot of

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:12.360
key usage early man the only reason I'm

00:11:10.769 --> 00:11:14.250
not going to the cursor right now is

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:18.060
because I'm a little scared about you

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:19.019
know will we be able to get out of there

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:23.820
we don't have a get-out-of-jail-free

00:11:19.019 --> 00:11:30.149
cards so it can be a little scary but I

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:32.279
think we should do it I've got super

00:11:30.149 --> 00:11:33.660
mind flooded there I don't know do I

00:11:32.279 --> 00:11:35.240
want to fight bosses right now we

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:44.519
probably could take them but I believe

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:46.290
catacombs 2 is like mega fatty just

00:11:44.519 --> 00:11:49.040
wanted to take out one easy one first to

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:52.230
make my life a little simpler mega fatty

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:58.819
mega moth which can be like genuinely

00:11:52.230 --> 00:12:05.690
concerning so no tell appeals please

00:11:58.819 --> 00:12:08.250
perks so you definitely do pop that

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:12.079
because you've got the holy mantle

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:15.269
invincibility anybody who dies opening a

00:12:12.079 --> 00:12:17.100
mimic just trust me when I say that I

00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:18.660
feel your pain you might not think that

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:22.199
I feel your pain but I feel your pain

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:23.490
how could NL Isaac superstar and the

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:24.720
most electrifying man in

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.779
sports-entertainment

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:29.790
feel my pain trust me I've been there

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:31.740
I've been there recently I built on home

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:35.670
there I talked to the real estate agent

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:37.949
I said this is where I grew up and she

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:41.080
said whatever man just give me a 15%

00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:43.090
down payment and I said in this economy

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:46.030
you're lucky you're getting anything at

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:48.220
all speaking of anything at all we got

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:53.820
shielded tears which is with a 10 rate

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:53.820
of fire strikes me as being not amazing

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:59.200
we'll just have to be that much more

00:12:56.710 --> 00:13:02.740
clever in our interactions on this run

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.250
got plenty of money you didn't give me a

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.530
chance

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:07.540
like if the door just opened more slowly

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:09.610
I would have been happier but it was a

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:13.510
well-greased hinge there on that door I

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:15.520
expected it to be like earlier like a

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:17.770
creepy old haunted house but instead it

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:20.800
was like something straight out of a

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:22.060
cheap TV either way I was going to say

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.190
we had a lot of money so that makes us

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.600
prime for the great fight because now

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:27.150
that we can actually buy something of

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.200
course the shop is going to be

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:31.510
functionally not worth very much

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.650
although Steam sale if we end up wanting

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:34.570
to go to the hush fight which will

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:38.020
probably mean that I have picked up a

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:42.040
Kaos card at some point surely you can

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:43.390
do worse read hard probable secret room

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:46.030
you got enough bombs to check for

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:47.470
certain you know we want to rack up as

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:48.760
many points as possible as early as

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:52.660
possible because we might not live

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:54.940
through this fight so this whole run so

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:56.470
you know being able to get points

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:58.780
wherever they're available in the early

00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:00.160
game seems fairly important for me which

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.840
is why I'm even hesitating to use bombs

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.990
in a situation like this even though it

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.850
seems obvious that it's a right course

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.450
of action if not the right course of

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:11.860
action

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:13.660
so got 14 left still ahead of schedule

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.700
although slowing down a little bit there

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.500
we go go ahead dude if you don't find

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:19.300
the second secret room here you could

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.590
find yourself in trouble that might have

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:23.350
been a seam that we just found that

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:24.640
opens things up for us now we're lucky

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.560
we're fighting the hollow let's get two

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.570
birds stoned at once there one of them

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:31.230
exploding to give us two spirit arts the

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:34.570
spirit hearts give us two points each

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:37.780
what an investment and then we get a

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:39.640
range of gravy don't care about and two

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:42.220
little brims log flight to Little

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:44.200
Britain it's good question I guess

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.520
because I had a gyro rune I've got two

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.920
little brains made sense here but now we

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:50.260
get one little brim and we might as well

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:53.230
take the nail it allows us to crush

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.840
rocks and the d4 is not doing jack for

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:55.970
us

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:59.000
so we head down to the next floor we

00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:05.470
gotta be careful for many reasons but we

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:05.470
know we also have Krampus available

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:12.230
which is why it's like the principal

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:15.860
reason for my concern right now so you

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:19.310
only get a 0.9 1 damage increase from

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:21.380
pop in the nail it's still worth having

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:27.260
but it's like the world's worst book of

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:29.950
Belial and surely without any respawns

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:33.260
this doesn't give us a great ability to

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:35.500
do boss rush because like we don't get

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:38.390
the spirit heart out of it to begin with

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:40.760
so what's the what's the game plan here

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:43.670
like honestly a great pickup for us

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:45.290
lazar eggs is is take a bull but not

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:46.550
functionally usable because holding

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.290
mantle is so much better than coming

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:51.380
back with 1 hp under normal

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:54.470
circumstances but if we can get like a

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:58.190
Judas asado pickup and productively

00:15:54.470 --> 00:16:00.980
invoke it dude first off this is why

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:02.750
you're watching this channel right use

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:07.430
in terms of phrases like productively

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:10.550
invoke ooh for those of you who didn't

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:14.060
get enough ambiguous verbosity in school

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:18.430
or from watching old Don King promos

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:18.430
when he used to represent Mike Tyson

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:26.110
here you go

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:28.339
but a productive Judas of shadow use

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:31.129
could give us

00:16:28.339 --> 00:16:32.449
a leg up on the competition here mostly

00:16:31.129 --> 00:16:34.040
because of the nail so we have like

00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:43.999
really good damage you go into boss rush

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:45.399
as well that was no I hate this just one

00:16:43.999 --> 00:16:47.899
guy

00:16:45.399 --> 00:16:50.059
we've lived okay that was a mean I

00:16:47.899 --> 00:16:53.529
almost mind flooded myself out of

00:16:50.059 --> 00:16:55.519
existence there kidney stone I hate it

00:16:53.529 --> 00:16:57.620
mostly I hate the way I don't hate it

00:16:55.519 --> 00:16:59.300
not even a little not even at all mom's

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:01.129
box of trinkets has given us the ability

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.139
to unlock things and you know what I

00:17:01.129 --> 00:17:05.569
actually think that mom's box of

00:17:03.139 --> 00:17:10.669
trinkets beats the pants off the nail

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:12.260
right now the nail giving us a zero

00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:14.500
point nine eleven damage increase once

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:18.439
every six rooms means nothing actually

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:21.709
nothing being able to get a half-decent

00:17:18.439 --> 00:17:23.240
trinket which we don't have yet being

00:17:21.709 --> 00:17:26.299
able to get a half-decent trinket at

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:29.809
some point strikes me as being way way

00:17:26.299 --> 00:17:31.370
way more useful little brims do an

00:17:29.809 --> 00:17:33.860
amazing work by the way in case you're

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:36.890
unaware how I feel about this item 21

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:41.690
sad bombs means that for the next floor

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:47.120
we should be crushing it no none of

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:49.279
these guys I really thought that might

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:52.070
have been the end there Maggie's fate is

00:17:49.279 --> 00:17:55.669
irrelevant so we'll stick with what we

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:58.250
got here still on pace just got to be

00:17:55.669 --> 00:18:00.350
careful you know we we've probably

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:01.850
gotten past the ld50 on this room we

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:02.929
need that's that's a new stat you're up

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:07.870
I'm not going to tell you what to do

00:18:02.929 --> 00:18:10.700
you're a busy person I'm sure but for my

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:14.570
selfish reasons I would love to see like

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:16.549
the point at which 50% of the people had

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.929
died on a run or at least like the point

00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:19.429
level where you've crossed over the

00:18:17.929 --> 00:18:24.950
median while we were one room away from

00:18:19.429 --> 00:18:27.380
the boss fight this whole time we're so

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:28.640
close to the fruition of I'm a genie on

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:32.020
your boss rush which is actually

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.020
Polyphemus on your boss rush

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:41.940
we're taking a lot more sloppy damage

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:45.450
than usual this is easy wait for him to

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:46.740
jump that was not a that was a jump I

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:50.070
actually need to wait for him to leap

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:51.690
what I mean to say then you dumped a

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:53.460
little sad bombs action on we're gonna

00:18:51.690 --> 00:19:00.000
have to go a little faster than I'd like

00:18:53.460 --> 00:19:03.380
to be forced to we're in it to win it

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.680
here little - of course not Krampus

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.540
Necronomicon

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:08.070
I mean it's actually tempting but our

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:09.690
trinkets are not good enough yet so

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:11.400
we'll just say thank you for like the

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:14.450
bookworm potentiality and then we'll

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:17.250
move on with our lives here we shouldn't

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:17.610
you know cry about it I think we're fine

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:19.770
with that

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:22.470
we shouldn't cry about it if we don't

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:25.800
make it to boss rush like when everyday

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:29.240
we you guys do the same pattern you know

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:32.910
that's not first off bad look secondly

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:38.310
due to all the needless minor speed down

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:40.050
graves but secondly we're in our present

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:42.060
state we're not going to do boss rush

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:43.800
this is not a boss rush where they run

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:45.150
right now we should still try to make it

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:49.530
because you might pick up you know Judas

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:55.290
a shadow of boss rush it's a win-win but

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:56.820
certainly as of right now it's not it's

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:58.440
not compulsory to have a great run

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:01.250
although I did I will say I looked at

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:03.270
the leaderboards and my guess is that

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:04.980
there are at least a few people out

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:07.860
there who managed to do boss rush maybe

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:09.390
hush as well and shielded tears probably

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:11.220
helps out a lot with that but you know

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:13.350
are you hush is more important because

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:15.000
it gives us void floor access but you're

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:24.150
really going to do the Delirium fight on

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:27.840
this one spoon vendors good thinking

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:29.690
like the only seem that I mean what's

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:34.980
the point right the only scene that I

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:36.510
might have not seen is using the blank

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:39.360
room that turned out to be per throw to

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:40.710
get something even better than we got if

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.910
we could take both of these trinkets

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:43.500
they would be a dream come true but we

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:46.440
can't so anyway we don't care about

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.260
smelting Calais here which is a great

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.840
name

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:53.710
but I will pay seven cents to smelt a

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:55.720
lock upgrade and then keep rolling with

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:56.920
the moms trinket I recognize we're

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.970
skipping these tinted rocks that should

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.390
probably shouldn't go we're running out

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:01.390
of time

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:02.860
oh the governor nevermind first off get

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:04.000
get a charge on this but you do want

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.910
blank card Guerra from this point

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.170
onwards that's obvious I don't know what

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:10.390
you're going to do with it except pick

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:12.910
up unlimited a little consumables that

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:13.900
you barely have any use for but we might

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:16.150
as well take it and then our other

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:18.070
trinket is going to be bloody crown so

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:20.080
as skeptical as you might have been this

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:22.990
ended up being completely worth it which

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:24.820
is kind of hilarious that this

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.930
incredibly roundabout plan has come

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.520
through to fruition here

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:29.320
why is dark Prince's crown that good

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:33.910
it's item rooms on the womb man that

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:35.860
might give us a play for for being able

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:39.220
to beat hush because right now I mean

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:48.070
let's just be honest boss rush is is not

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:49.990
a likely situation we still have to beat

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:52.630
Mom and we have to beat mom quickly

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:56.340
enough which is looking decent you can

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:56.340
always take two hits on a mom fight

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:08.080
that did not hit me but should have I

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:08.080
walked right into it

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:17.620
can you sound perfect okay so we're

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:19.909
going to we have curse of the blind

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:21.110
we're gonna pick up the Polaroid we're

00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:24.710
going to blow up this and look for a

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:26.360
teleport card we don't we don't see one

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:29.000
so we're going to say goodbye boss rush

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:31.370
so we can fight probably hush instead or

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.230
is it not how are you guys so we can

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:35.179
fight the Krampus instead it ended up

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:37.220
not being Krampus this gives us like

00:22:35.179 --> 00:22:39.799
three spirit hearts it's just not worth

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:41.990
it might give us money right now

00:22:39.799 --> 00:22:43.850
actually if it gives us money we should

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:46.210
take it and we should actually blank

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:47.919
card yeah right

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:50.120
[Music]

00:22:47.919 --> 00:22:52.010
wait we didn't have curse of a blind on

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:54.320
this floor that was the last four but my

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:57.039
point still stands we're not going to do

00:22:54.320 --> 00:23:02.480
boss rush on this run and we never were

00:22:57.039 --> 00:23:04.309
hopefully it's a little bit of a whiff

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.299
but what kind of wouldn't be an NL Isaac

00:23:04.309 --> 00:23:09.860
winter there wasn't a little bit of a

00:23:05.299 --> 00:23:12.169
wisp and now our odds of getting to our

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:13.820
odds of getting to the hush fight are

00:23:12.169 --> 00:23:15.230
much greater we're still kind of looking

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:17.270
for a chaos card but I would give up

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:20.360
blank card Year effort for chaos and a

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:22.940
heart beat food and if you're if you're

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:24.740
mad about the boss rush play I do want

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:29.539
to inform you first off you're entitled

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:32.299
to be I didn't really want to throw up a

00:23:29.539 --> 00:23:34.669
you know 21 minute daily after getting

00:23:32.299 --> 00:23:38.120
it twice though all that's the

00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:40.190
moneymaker right there three damage

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:41.659
increases like our first sizable damage

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:48.020
increase over the course of the entire

00:23:41.659 --> 00:23:50.299
game secondly we would have died there's

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:52.909
like a 2% chance we would have live and

00:23:50.299 --> 00:23:54.289
I know you if you're on that side of

00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:56.120
things you're thinking as a 2% chance

00:23:54.289 --> 00:23:58.149
but if it hadn't worked it would have

00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:00.559
been sick you're not wrong

00:23:58.149 --> 00:24:02.899
burns me up a little bit too if it had

00:24:00.559 --> 00:24:05.210
worked it would have been sick but 49

00:24:02.899 --> 00:24:07.490
times out of 50 kind of pulled the

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:09.649
number out of my butt obviously but 49

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:12.380
times out of 50 we're getting nothing

00:24:09.649 --> 00:24:13.309
out of that we're using blank our gara

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:16.940
improperly

00:24:13.309 --> 00:24:26.720
of course and should stop go keep the

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:28.549
cursor room I'm ready now jizz yes why

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:32.659
is this valuable this is valuable

00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:34.730
because it's a Zayn enabler as rich as

00:24:32.659 --> 00:24:35.990
that may sound we lose blank card Yara

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:39.350
but if we're not getting consistent

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:41.659
items of from chests basically blank

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:44.120
cards Yara is like actually quite

00:24:41.659 --> 00:24:47.869
literally irrelevant I think this should

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:53.720
just be money never mind we'll just

00:24:47.869 --> 00:24:56.389
never get anything out of it if we're

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:58.690
able especially we can get like a third

00:24:56.389 --> 00:25:01.879
charge like this is two charges this is

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:06.830
algae's a blank card followed by algae's

00:25:01.879 --> 00:25:09.499
algae's we could probably beat the hush

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:12.860
with zero risk if we had three algae's

00:25:09.499 --> 00:25:17.110
rooms this only gives us two right now

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:20.659
so it's not enough to necessarily Popoff

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:23.990
but it's a start I didn't mention by the

00:25:20.659 --> 00:25:26.090
way but to get a score in like the the

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:29.019
top 30 aka you know a leaderboard

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:31.639
position today I think you only need

00:25:29.019 --> 00:25:36.110
44,000 or something we that's just going

00:25:31.639 --> 00:25:39.169
to make our life a living hell so we're

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:40.909
not going to I'm not going to say that

00:25:39.169 --> 00:25:43.039
we're necessarily guaranteed to be there

00:25:40.909 --> 00:25:44.929
I mean we played I've considered that we

00:25:43.039 --> 00:25:47.690
played amazing on yesterday's daily by

00:25:44.929 --> 00:25:50.659
our standards and we still finish like

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:52.490
just barely inside of the top 100 I'm

00:25:50.659 --> 00:25:56.840
not to disparage by that you know

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:58.700
there's really good local people on

00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:00.320
these dailies hey by the way you have

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:00.710
blank card algae's don't be afraid to

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:08.110
use it

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:08.110
yeah idiot that's very scary

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:18.720
sister biz most important thing just

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:23.730
dust before they can get like two

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:26.940
attacks off we're going to be fine okay

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:29.730
good work latchkey is luck and key used

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:37.110
to a lesser extent Krampus you knew it

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:41.010
had to happen big I accidentally hit the

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:43.020
Q key I meant to hit W and I hit Q what

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:43.350
a world I have chosen to make for myself

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.970
here

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:46.230
either way love of Cole's but of course

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.790
we're going to go back for blank card

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:49.290
Yara that's like it's worth an

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:56.040
unbelievable amount of value at this

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:58.140
point because I am a moron there were

00:26:56.040 --> 00:27:00.420
scores in like the 50,000 today as well

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:02.790
which I just find incredible not

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:04.740
suspicious just incredible

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:06.270
that's like obviously your damage

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:08.510
penalty is going to be 0 so it buys you

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:11.430
a little bit of space but dude really

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:13.590
you did hush fight and boss rush or like

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:19.500
blank card Yared yourself into oblivion

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:25.200
it's incredible we're relatively on pace

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:26.700
here which is a little sad considering

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.970
that we've skipped boss rush to make it

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:32.790
happen but I got high hopes and you know

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:35.130
what lump of coal croc cramps I said

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:38.070
lump of coal cricket said it's been a

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:39.990
good floor as we head down to the next

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:43.130
floor losing algae's sucks but hey I'll

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:49.310
just only matters if you get hit it's up

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:52.670
let's just try not to all right have fun

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:52.670
love you too

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:59.130
you know we can make thanks kidney stone

00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:03.660
we can make good use of this with blank

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:05.460
card dice yard well we're going to lose

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:09.920
hero forever either way so you Sierra

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:09.920
and then use blank cards dice yard

00:28:12.009 --> 00:28:16.489
that didn't work out that well obviously

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.159
what are we looking for out of this well

00:28:16.489 --> 00:28:20.509
I mean being able to reroll items is

00:28:18.159 --> 00:28:22.519
fairly important right now

00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:23.960
admittedly but at least we've got

00:28:22.519 --> 00:28:26.299
something worth 3 rolling back there

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:28.519
anyway let's make it to hush just in

00:28:26.299 --> 00:28:30.109
case we want to make it to hush I may

00:28:28.519 --> 00:28:36.320
have made completely the wrong decisions

00:28:30.109 --> 00:28:38.749
with our consumables here but I mostly

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:41.809
I'm salty that I left algae's behind by

00:28:38.749 --> 00:28:43.309
accidentally using it on Krampus it

00:28:41.809 --> 00:28:45.139
wasn't even like I meant to use blank

00:28:43.309 --> 00:28:49.059
card and instead I used algae's it was

00:28:45.139 --> 00:28:51.559
sincerely like just as a fat finger did

00:28:49.059 --> 00:28:55.419
it was a tight boat it was a video game

00:28:51.559 --> 00:28:55.419
typo you don't see those that often

00:28:56.559 --> 00:29:01.369
unless you're playing like a

00:28:58.779 --> 00:29:04.960
first-person shooter online and somebody

00:29:01.369 --> 00:29:07.129
calls you like a homophobic slur and

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:08.389
then you go hey just so you know I'm

00:29:07.129 --> 00:29:10.279
recording this for YouTube and they go

00:29:08.389 --> 00:29:12.229
oh sorry what my brother took over the

00:29:10.279 --> 00:29:15.859
keyboard I didn't what I didn't say

00:29:12.229 --> 00:29:17.659
anything did he so we should be using

00:29:15.859 --> 00:29:20.259
dice shark but I don't really want to

00:29:17.659 --> 00:29:25.429
walk back to use dice shard every time

00:29:20.259 --> 00:29:26.779
so kind of waiting for like a room that

00:29:25.429 --> 00:29:33.039
drops a bunch of stuff I mean I guess

00:29:26.779 --> 00:29:33.039
the item room is the perfect opportunity

00:29:35.139 --> 00:29:40.340
how come we always smelted the trinket

00:29:37.879 --> 00:29:41.869
so we can take another one it's like how

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:45.619
can it still be possible we have pills

00:29:41.869 --> 00:29:47.210
were not aware of at this point we're

00:29:45.619 --> 00:29:49.279
using the odds are that we become guppy

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:52.519
over the course of this single item room

00:29:49.279 --> 00:29:53.989
probably pretty low huh we got 0.3

00:29:52.519 --> 00:29:58.369
damage up out of the black feather

00:29:53.989 --> 00:30:01.009
because we have a pentagram we got one

00:29:58.369 --> 00:30:04.639
last deal with the devil oh let's go

00:30:01.009 --> 00:30:05.989
let's go I'm you oh you're an idiot why

00:30:04.639 --> 00:30:07.909
didn't you fight the boss first I got

00:30:05.989 --> 00:30:09.619
mine flooded and excited what's sad is

00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:12.169
that this is still like definitely the

00:30:09.619 --> 00:30:13.879
right play because we're going to get

00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:15.799
another item room out of it but you

00:30:13.879 --> 00:30:16.910
could have done you know better than

00:30:15.799 --> 00:30:20.330
this

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:27.560
and to make exactly the same mistakes

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:29.300
also we need to go faster but it was

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:31.840
still the right place that's what I want

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:34.720
to stress here this was the right play

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:37.460
you're not what you used to be bookworm

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:41.270
no we're one away so that's a reroll let

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:42.830
me get one we don't exactly know where

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:47.450
to go but we're strong enough that we

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:54.560
can make it what a strange run fun run

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:56.750
strange run nope yes well that deal with

00:30:54.560 --> 00:31:00.140
the devil being totally garbage just

00:30:56.750 --> 00:31:02.180
makes me feel like worse dude another

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:05.600
gulp though can't take it if it's bad

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:07.130
trip we just lose so yeah because our

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.930
last deal with the devil who knows that

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:13.970
might have might have carried us to

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:15.710
victory right so that one being trash

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:17.540
just hurts that much more but don't

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:19.880
throw your whole run away as a result

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:21.680
there's so much to live for here so much

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:25.070
to do so much to see we're going to go

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:27.320
reroll cursed I even though I don't

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:30.020
think it'll reroll into a nevermind it

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:31.790
rear old into a devil item which is

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:35.780
actually extremely nice for us right

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:38.150
eleven damage now do you fight cramped

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:40.790
or deep what are these days meant do you

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:42.920
fight hush I don't know here's the thing

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:47.480
we need to fight hush to get to the void

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:49.070
floor we could just do this one straight

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:53.060
to Sheol but it seems like it's almost a

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:54.560
little too easy at this point we can

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:57.860
deal with the speed upgrade nothing

00:31:54.560 --> 00:32:00.440
wrong with that you know what's the

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:01.820
highest priority for us here but you go

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:04.130
back and reroll Anarchist Cookbook

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:09.890
you know hopefully something good will

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:14.000
probably die against hush but I think

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:15.680
I'd rather try and die against hush

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.940
because it's an indication that I'm

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:20.540
going for something bigger than myself

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:23.560
and if I'm reading the writing on the

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:26.059
wall we're gonna die against delirium

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:29.309
regardless

00:32:26.059 --> 00:32:32.970
so in a way it should be freeing if we

00:32:29.309 --> 00:32:35.400
know that we're going to die the fingers

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:38.010
decent enough to save a full charge if

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:39.960
we know that we're going to die and it

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:44.040
really is like 99% chance we'll die

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:45.990
against delirium why not just make the

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:47.220
hush fight happen here try to make it

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:53.270
work you got shielded tears you got

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:53.270
decent damage there is a nonzero chance

00:32:53.809 --> 00:32:59.809
sweet I walked into the enemy that

00:32:57.299 --> 00:33:04.940
teleported right behind me

00:32:59.809 --> 00:33:04.940
we still live life is good

00:33:05.929 --> 00:33:11.850
this is bravery folks not all heroes

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:17.490
wear capes I'm being facetious of course

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:19.980
all heroes definitely wear capes but we

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:21.660
want to I want to prove there's

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:24.150
something more than myself on this this

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:26.010
is the dice shard room because like we

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:28.020
could at least take hot bombs here and

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:31.980
be okay with it I think you crack into

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:36.419
these you can dice shard dollars I mean

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:37.380
those are two not good items but I mean

00:33:36.419 --> 00:33:41.610
it's 10 bombs

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:44.340
oh oh oh it works it totally works so

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:45.870
you take restock and now we don't have

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:47.760
to worry about time at all so just slow

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:51.270
your roll shoot the fire just so you

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:54.240
don't accidentally screw yourself you

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:55.530
take champions oh you take Knight let

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:58.020
you take everything you can get like

00:33:55.530 --> 00:34:01.020
stopwatch should be good can we dice

00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:03.330
shard here and then buy a battle ax if

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:05.100
we have a battery charge I think we can

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:07.320
continuously buy battery charges right

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:15.300
so let's start by die starting all of

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:17.609
this we don't really love those items we

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:20.369
don't love those items at all so we dice

00:34:17.609 --> 00:34:23.790
shard again I don't really love those

00:34:20.369 --> 00:34:26.899
items we got so much money so worthy to

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:26.899
get the triple re-roll here

00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:34.269
you can take concussive tears you got a

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:40.829
you got to rethink the other to grab

00:34:34.269 --> 00:34:46.269
this real quick I don't really like

00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:48.099
little gertie that much yeah booger

00:34:46.269 --> 00:34:49.720
tears are well worth it but it's it's

00:34:48.099 --> 00:34:51.879
close so I'm not going to lie to you now

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:53.919
what about these like hot bombs are not

00:34:51.879 --> 00:34:55.809
that good this is good by the way

00:34:53.919 --> 00:34:57.279
because it's giving us a crack at Oh

00:34:55.809 --> 00:34:58.150
money equals power

00:34:57.279 --> 00:35:01.599
even though we're probably going to lose

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:06.250
a lot of it it's good because it gives

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:10.089
us a crack at items that are not in the

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:19.900
shot pool and three cents the two of

00:35:10.089 --> 00:35:23.410
diamonds please ace of diamonds I don't

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:27.940
know we need dice shots still but we

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:30.579
don't need the full card blow this guy

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:32.680
up give me a bunch of pennies of course

00:35:30.579 --> 00:35:37.480
I mean we knew that's not how that was

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:39.160
going to go but it's worth the three

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:41.019
cents to re-roll the item versus the

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.880
seven cents to buy a bad item to take it

00:35:41.019 --> 00:35:44.200
out as long as we have a battery charge

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.670
which we no longer do so we're going to

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:49.450
spend a lot of damage to make this

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:52.599
happen but it's all with the express

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:54.700
purpose that's what we wanted right

00:35:52.599 --> 00:36:01.750
there chaos of making this run actually

00:35:54.700 --> 00:36:06.910
pop and that's our last item we don't

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:09.190
really need Guppies paw so I think the

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:13.000
other thing worth noting is maybe you

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:14.170
just died shard right now no we only

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.519
want to die char right every one of the

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:17.410
money even if we get something we like

00:36:15.519 --> 00:36:19.569
so the other thing we're going to do is

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:21.910
place bombs like all around because

00:36:19.569 --> 00:36:25.349
there could be a black market and if

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:29.410
we're gunning for like the world's

00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:32.259
weirdest win that's probably pretty

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:34.269
unlikely right now why not shoot for the

00:36:32.259 --> 00:36:37.089
moon right even if we miss we'll land

00:36:34.269 --> 00:36:41.670
amongst stars there could be a black

00:36:37.089 --> 00:36:41.670
market there but the odds are fairly low

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:49.500
we kept the speed upgrade for survival

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:53.080
purposes and I think we're ready to go

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:55.870
this is really just about playing well

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:57.850
at this point I didn't take number one I

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:59.620
did think about it but I think on a

00:36:57.850 --> 00:37:04.420
fight like this I value being able to

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:05.800
stay as far away as possible and it

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:12.270
really is going to be like a laborious

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:15.040
hush fight it should be like by design

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:16.330
so I am actually a genius and I didn't

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:24.120
even know it

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:26.860
sad bombs booger tears protects us from

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:29.890
being hit on like one side of the hush

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:34.060
completely that's the stupidest great

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:36.100
news I've ever had in my life it's not

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:39.460
the greatest news I've ever had but it's

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:42.100
the greatest news for which I've been

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:42.430
excited that is the most minor thing

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:44.590
ever

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:49.240
so oh you almost swim right into that

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:53.670
one buddy that seemed to do damage

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:56.560
really enough think of the next step is

00:37:53.670 --> 00:38:00.210
you want to dump like as many shields

00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:00.210
and tears around as possible

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:06.770
we're just trying to surround him so

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:12.860
that effectively like he's completely

00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:18.500
neutered here probably goes without

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:21.560
saying but if I win on the hush fight

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:27.800
and lose on delirium I'm going to be an

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:34.760
extremely happy boy we probably have no

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:36.290
business winning on either I think he's

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:39.470
dead as soon as he pops up

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:41.270
so for all the money we spent here and

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:43.340
all the points we lost by spending that

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:45.050
money we're going to get like 4000

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:51.110
points just for finishing this so we had

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:57.590
to do it now the final step of our

00:38:51.110 --> 00:39:00.620
idiotic master plan fight every boss

00:38:57.590 --> 00:39:04.040
who's not Delirium and then I mean when

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:08.690
it comes to delirium I don't know what

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:14.390
you do but I think we can be proud of

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:17.030
today's daily regardless like I wish

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:18.500
that there was a way to like there was

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:21.350
not to cheese it but I wish there was a

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:24.140
way that was sensible to make it through

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:26.180
the Delirium fight we like it has to be

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:27.680
an I'm drowsy pill that's that's what we

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:29.240
need right now and I think we would have

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:35.900
seen one by now probably we've taken

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:37.100
like 70 pills but we can do everything

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:38.810
out that's probably not complete

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:41.870
delirium coming off a tiny room like

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:43.610
that but we can't check it we could do

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:45.440
the cheesy play and I think if we do the

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:46.790
cheesy play we have a better chance I'm

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.050
not going to say you know it's the

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:49.630
difference between front page and not

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:52.250
front page but we probably rank better

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:55.220
perch does nothing but there's no real

00:39:52.250 --> 00:40:00.010
reason not to hold it and if you'll

00:39:55.220 --> 00:40:00.010
forgive me I'm going to choose not to do

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:06.050
too many rerolls with the dice charred

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:08.750
simply because I want to save it for

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:10.910
item rooms wherever possible and by item

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:13.090
rooms I mean at this point bathrooms

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:13.090
because

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:19.150
you can't really dance everybody will

00:40:17.799 --> 00:40:21.130
save the battery charges cuz then we can

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:24.700
go back and use it on boss rooms that

00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:25.960
are right next to one another but I mean

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.999
what's our damage penalty gonna be if we

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:32.319
die like under a thousand for sure

00:40:27.999 --> 00:40:34.480
because it's zero right now so you take

00:40:32.319 --> 00:40:37.630
rune bag and if it gives you algis then

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:40.029
you know you're living life your love

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:42.009
and life everything related to your life

00:40:40.029 --> 00:40:45.519
you're okay with but I really mean this

00:40:42.009 --> 00:40:49.329
sincerely I am 1 million percent content

00:40:45.519 --> 00:40:51.759
on today's daily we should not have been

00:40:49.329 --> 00:40:54.039
able to beat hush and really booger

00:40:51.759 --> 00:40:57.249
tears save the day I do see that there's

00:40:54.039 --> 00:40:59.019
a there's an item back there or a room

00:40:57.249 --> 00:41:01.660
back there I should say what kind of

00:40:59.019 --> 00:41:04.150
room is it it's a blank room well you

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:07.809
take that over perks and then if we

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:11.700
accidentally make it into the delirium

00:41:07.809 --> 00:41:18.489
fight then you got a way out you know

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:20.259
easy you have to not because of the

00:41:18.489 --> 00:41:23.019
guppy chance but because of the respawn

00:41:20.259 --> 00:41:25.839
chance there's a chance because it'll

00:41:23.019 --> 00:41:27.609
respond us with holy mantle so this gets

00:41:25.839 --> 00:41:32.140
rear old and you know it's going to get

00:41:27.609 --> 00:41:34.930
rear old again probably this should not

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:36.599
be delirium I'm happy it isn't cuz it

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:39.119
could have been but it shouldn't be just

00:41:36.599 --> 00:41:44.710
out of the goodness of their heart right

00:41:39.119 --> 00:41:46.359
guys shard blank room ok so now every

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:50.319
other fight does have a chance to be

00:41:46.359 --> 00:41:52.599
delirium you should pick up every

00:41:50.319 --> 00:41:55.960
consumable on the way because if we

00:41:52.599 --> 00:42:00.430
don't well you probably don't need me to

00:41:55.960 --> 00:42:03.239
tell you what happens the next step is

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:06.700
getting like infinity charges and

00:42:03.239 --> 00:42:08.829
hopefully finding like if we could go

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:12.700
into the fight with a full blank card

00:42:08.829 --> 00:42:17.529
charge and double algae's that's the way

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:18.760
we do two algae's runes and a blank rune

00:42:17.529 --> 00:42:21.370
charge

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:23.170
blank card caught in charge you know

00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:24.660
what I mean at this point we're picking

00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:26.650
this stuff up because the extra damage

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:28.090
probably won't make all the difference

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:31.300
but could make a lot of difference and

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:31.660
it's worth points regardless so what's

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:35.430
this

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:38.700
that's just HP so we roll it 99 bombs

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:38.700
very good

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:48.520
instant point bonus we'll just continue

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:50.520
our exploratory efforts here and I think

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:52.870
you know we've probably done like a

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:54.970
hundred dailies at this point maybe more

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:57.940
maybe closing in on that number at least

00:42:54.970 --> 00:43:00.460
this is definitely in like the top 5% of

00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:01.810
dailies that I'm proudest of yesterday's

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:05.130
might be in there too so it's been a

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:07.570
pretty nice you know running form for us

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:10.270
black ruin is is weird

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:12.550
it's possibly my favorite rune in the

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:15.220
game even if it's largely due to novelty

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:16.240
you know the fact that Yara and perthro

00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:20.350
have been in the game for a hundred

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:26.650
years I really like black rune it's a

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:30.040
little muted by the fact that we don't

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:32.140
really have multi item rooms that are

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:34.930
showing up down here and we also don't

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:36.220
really need too much on the statistical

00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:39.970
side of things right now what do we want

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:44.460
like a speed upgrade tiers upgrade I

00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:44.460
guess is the is the non smartass answer

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:51.690
today

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:51.690
although wait a minute we have sad bombs

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:58.190
we also have kidney stone yeah so I

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:59.750
don't know this might have just ruined

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:02.270
our run or might have taken it to the

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:03.740
next level but if you get dr. fetus sad

00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:07.010
bombs I don't care if you're on a daily

00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:19.430
Meili a ukulele a shillelagh you take it

00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:21.140
that's what you do kind of stinks with

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:24.940
Jacob's Ladder but then the sad bomb

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:28.880
effect should work with Jacob's Ladder

00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:33.950
bang bang Jacobs silver ladder comes

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:35.510
down on his head - - - I think we're

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:37.370
still like completely fine although I do

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:40.430
think this is worse we're just waiting

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:41.840
on algae's and a gyro rune is good

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:45.700
because it means that if we get an

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:45.700
algae's we've actually got two algae's

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:51.800
it's hard to justify playing a judgement

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:54.290
right now because our money is also our

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:55.940
power and we don't want HP although we

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:59.450
could use another like a free item

00:44:55.940 --> 00:45:01.519
pedestal we got hit

00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:04.669
[Music]

00:45:01.519 --> 00:45:05.599
I don't know what we got hit by but I

00:45:04.669 --> 00:45:14.749
don't like it

00:45:05.599 --> 00:45:16.489
range down it's actually pretty bad we

00:45:14.749 --> 00:45:18.169
did lose the effect of booger tears as

00:45:16.489 --> 00:45:24.829
well which I didn't really consider but

00:45:18.169 --> 00:45:28.689
is horrible but do you have Ouija boards

00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:28.689
here that I'm unaware of or something

00:45:30.219 --> 00:45:37.999
yeah all we need is one algae's man

00:45:35.709 --> 00:45:39.739
which is why we're still exploring that

00:45:37.999 --> 00:45:44.749
and I'm you know deathly afraid of

00:45:39.739 --> 00:45:53.959
fighting definitely afraid of fighting

00:45:44.749 --> 00:45:56.959
delirium at this point what do you think

00:45:53.959 --> 00:46:03.429
there's like AI think it's least likely

00:45:56.959 --> 00:46:05.449
to be that room up there like the the

00:46:03.429 --> 00:46:07.999
little one so I'm going to go for that

00:46:05.449 --> 00:46:09.769
one first so we're still trying to crank

00:46:07.999 --> 00:46:14.439
out like random runes as well like you

00:46:09.769 --> 00:46:19.089
got something for me no you do not

00:46:14.439 --> 00:46:22.399
I'll call it uh it was the wrong pickup

00:46:19.089 --> 00:46:25.659
to take dr. fetus and you probably saw

00:46:22.399 --> 00:46:25.659
that coming a mile away but

00:46:28.059 --> 00:46:33.739
there's a couple of things we can do

00:46:30.559 --> 00:46:39.160
because we have yeras we can you know

00:46:33.739 --> 00:46:41.539
blank card Yara a bunch of consumables

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:46.190
we should just leave and re-enter for

00:46:41.539 --> 00:46:49.940
safety's sake what is that why are my

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:51.769
shops going strangely we could blank

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:54.410
card Yara like a room full of money or

00:46:51.769 --> 00:46:58.489
something like that fairly frequently

00:46:54.410 --> 00:47:09.319
but we could also blank card the blank

00:46:58.489 --> 00:47:11.509
rune over and over I don't really want

00:47:09.319 --> 00:47:19.099
to do that I want to beat delirium and

00:47:11.509 --> 00:47:29.359
then take my win my deserve and win yeah

00:47:19.099 --> 00:47:35.089
okay think weary roll this don't think

00:47:29.359 --> 00:47:40.069
little horn does anything for us so

00:47:35.089 --> 00:47:42.829
here's my new game plan we've only got

00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:46.099
two bosses equal chance their delirium

00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:54.289
in my opinion I think we Yara our blank

00:47:46.099 --> 00:47:57.109
room then we take the blank rune times

00:47:54.289 --> 00:47:59.989
two plus a battery charge into our boss

00:47:57.109 --> 00:48:03.460
fights here and we're just looking for

00:47:59.989 --> 00:48:08.359
delirium and by delirium I mean that

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:10.039
we're looking for al juice so we start

00:48:08.359 --> 00:48:11.390
with mask even for me don't pop anything

00:48:10.039 --> 00:48:12.769
here if you need to reroll the item just

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:16.400
go back and take dice char because you

00:48:12.769 --> 00:48:18.289
know the next boss is delirium yeah like

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:20.660
that should be dice sharded because it's

00:48:18.289 --> 00:48:22.849
garbage so and you know do we want to

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:24.019
use black rune we could but I don't

00:48:22.849 --> 00:48:28.390
think it's the right play I think the

00:48:24.019 --> 00:48:28.390
right play is what we're doing right now

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:37.299
go back and grab Dai shark because we

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:42.790
need a better class of item we can't

00:48:37.299 --> 00:48:44.200
just rely on I mean it's not very good

00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:45.609
to be honest and it'll shoot a bomb

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:49.720
occasionally so I'm going to stay away

00:48:45.609 --> 00:48:51.309
but go back give Blanc Rouge we're going

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:53.740
to fight delirium if we beat delirium

00:48:51.309 --> 00:48:55.990
we will rank in the top page if we don't

00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:58.599
be delirium I mean it'll probably pretty

00:48:55.990 --> 00:49:02.049
negatively compromised this run in terms

00:48:58.599 --> 00:49:03.339
of its score but we got to try you don't

00:49:02.049 --> 00:49:07.660
come to this point and then just quit

00:49:03.339 --> 00:49:09.970
you got to try so let's do it big

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:12.160
problem right now got to get right next

00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:15.280
to the boss okay

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:18.059
I've also been hit already it's an

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.059
algae's

00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:29.420
so I'm trying not to pop rooms until

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:40.670
necessary because we could respawn and

00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:42.760
then we want the runes with algae's why

00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:46.730
are we staying so far away

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:51.460
poppy next room para throw pop your next

00:49:46.730 --> 00:50:00.290
room I don't know what that last one is

00:49:51.460 --> 00:50:02.690
beans are a problem if I hadn't taken

00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:04.880
the dumb damage it sucks that it took me

00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:07.190
out but look at that 40 second I am NOT

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:08.660
displeased by that and we came so close

00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:09.830
if I just hadn't taken that stupid

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:11.270
damage early and I've been a little bit

00:50:09.830 --> 00:50:12.770
more aggressive I think we probably

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:14.660
would have gotten the kill there but for

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:15.920
now thanks for watching I'm very proud

00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:17.360
