00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.100
everybody's another glorious sunny day

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.600
of northernlion playing the binding of

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.410
issac afterbirth plus where we have just

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.300
been gifted victories where mostly we've

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.679
had some runs that have been mildly

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.690
mediocre but this is probably not going

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.100
to be one of them based on the fact that

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.410
it's Azazel and we got 48 7 vs so if

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.910
you'd like to have 487 vs we can give

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.769
you that I don't want to tell you what

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.349
the V stands for we've also got 36 new

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.790
jerseys we're looking to offload those

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.260
at a relatively low price I don't know I

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.750
don't know anything about New Jersey I

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.140
just know that it was a well that's not

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.329
true

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.570
I have been I've driven through parts of

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.730
New Jersey so I would say that makes me

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.890
an expert all I know is I feel bad for

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.600
New Jersey people who live in New Jersey

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.280
what are they called the constant

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.730
gardeners because it's called the Garden

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.260
State but the thing is they were like a

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.530
late-night host

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.270
punching gag you know be like well you

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.910
hear Prime Minister Trudeau is going to

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.460
accept 25,000 Syrian refugees what's

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.840
next accepting 12 people from New Jersey

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.420
and you're in the black mmm but I've

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.090
never been to your glorious state as I

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.850
understand it Bruce Springsteen's from

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.159
there maybe every song that he ever

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.200
wrote was about getting out of New

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.439
Jersey but still it must suck to be kind

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.210
of like a punching bag especially second

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.880
hand like if you've been to a place and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.759
you've spent some time there you're

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.990
allowed to trash-talk it like it because

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.460
you're intimately familiar with the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.070
details like if I was ever to leave

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.840
Vancouver and I love the city don't get

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.460
me wrong but I would be able to

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.899
trash-talk it I'd be like yeah you know

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.090
you can't shake a stick without find

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.570
another coffee shop where a drip coffees

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.909
$12 and you know you get served by a

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.799
dude who has a hairnet for his beard

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.770
there's nothing wrong with that I say as

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.899
someone who's you know electric razor

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.670
got lost in his luggage which has yet to

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.409
arrive at my domicile despite the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.570
assurances of Air Canada staff that it

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:08.459
would be there within the next day or so

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.729
either way I've lived here so I know I

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.739
know how to hurt the city to its core

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.590
but whenever people who haven't been to

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.760
Vancouver are like wow you know you just

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.680
won the lottery a hundred million

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.930
dollars or as I call it a single-family

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.780
detached house in Vancouver I'm like get

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.080
out of my city you don't get to say that

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.860
we get to say that okay cuz we live in

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:35.299
it so that all I'm saying is I

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.890
sympathize with you New Jersey I have a

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.299
friend I don't have friends who live in

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.560
New Jersey I have a friend who lives in

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:46.879
New Jersey you know what he's a mighty

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:48.680
nice guy he's a dentist he's offered me

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.780
free dental work but he won't pay for

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.280
the flight for me to get to New Jersey

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.319
so how free is it it's probably better

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.180
for me to just drive to Burnaby and then

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.180
you know get it done there anyway the

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.230
point is is getting to localized but you

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.930
got to cut me some slack because we're

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.390
playing as Azal here which is really

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.280
like the closest thing to a free win

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.220
that you can get next to being Isaac see

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.010
that's a little Isaac based humor for

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:18.069
you right there

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:20.269
we the only path to a loss via Azazel is

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.859
essentially having no range and then

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.889
wilfully choosing to fight the hush and

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:28.040
perhaps also void or delirium so we're

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:32.030
going to do that perhaps if the run

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.519
shakes out properly my ideal path to

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.470
victory as Azazel is you get dark Judas

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.910
unlike your first deal with the devil

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.950
and then just respawn can we use this I

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.510
can't officially say no but I'm guessing

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.090
that sulphuric Tears just does not work

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.190
based on the fact that it didn't seem to

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.069
work right there

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.169
we'll start with PhD as well and I'm

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.450
drowsy as an okay pill relaxes an okay

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:58.489
pale little unfortunate we've really

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.060
done a number on our donation machine on

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.560
like donation machine very recently was

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.349
that nine hundred and ninety nine cents

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.400
we've taken it back oh my god down to

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:12.970
under 700 here but it's because we have

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.970
freedom now

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.310
10 cents we could get deep pockets but I

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.229
don't really want to mill our donation

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.359
machine too hard it's like I imagine if

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.979
you're saving for retirement you know

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.690
maybe you want to have like let's say

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.669
800,000 dollars in your bank account

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.440
before retirement I'm not saying that

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.410
that's a reasonable number especially if

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.880
you're like 16 years old right now you

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.520
might be thinking that's a lot of money

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.080
but you got to account for you know

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.630
inflation the fact that you might live

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.550
to be literally infinity years old you

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.500
know down years in the market even if

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.490
you're conservatively invested etc etc

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.440
but let's just say 800,000 I'm sure when

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.930
you're at seven hundred ninety thousand

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.669
you go hey we shouldn't spend that much

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.560
money we're almost to our retirement

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.820
goal and then when you get to eight

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.449
hundred thousand you're like all right

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:03.810
time to live off this right that's where

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:05.400
we're at with our donation machine or at

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.110
least that's where we were at recently

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.340
is like you know you're at nine hundred

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.310
and fifty cents don't blow up your

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.560
donation machine we could get it to 999

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.990
then we got it to 999 and we're like all

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.199
right let's enjoy the downward spiral

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:22.080
you know getting this thing back down to

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:25.860
nearly zero probably Wow did you see the

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:31.680
approach this gentleman took here I do

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:33.840
not support it either way there we go

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.550
finally a pill worthy of the PhD

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:41.070
purchase I sometimes worry that because

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.680
I really believe that violent video

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.289
games are probably the greatest scourge

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.020
facing our nation's youth I mean I grew

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:51.090
up playing extremely violent video games

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.360
like the brothers who are super in Mario

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:57.210
and Diablo and it had just a twisted

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.590
effect on my psyche as you can tell but

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.900
it sometimes worried that Isaac is

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.449
setting a bad example for the for the

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.780
kids out there just because you have a

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:09.120
PhD doesn't mean it makes all pills good

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:14.070
trust me there are still some bad pills

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:16.139
I say that as if I've ever taken a bad

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:20.370
pill of my life which is actually not

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:21.779
like I had I genuinely have not maybe

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.490
there has been a time where I've take it

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:25.740
because you know on the bottle when

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.620
you're young you feel invincible and you

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.990
go I got a headache

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:32.860
I'm going to take some Tylenol and then

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:35.440
the bottle says you know take one every

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.600
two hours and you go come on I can take

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.190
it I'm going to take two on my first one

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.630
here it's quite the headache but that's

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.710
young and reckless you know you should

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:46.810
follow that advice to the letter I think

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:49.300
but I'm not very pharmaceutically

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:52.090
inclined I've also never like you know

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:55.449
broken my leg horribly or something like

00:06:52.090 --> 00:07:00.039
that but my my nerdiest like goody

00:06:55.449 --> 00:07:04.449
two-shoes story is definitely you know I

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:08.169
had testicular surgery when I was 16 to

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:08.680
repair a hydrocele I'm just going to

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:11.770
blow you up

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.960
I want that deal with the devil which is

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.789
not even close to life-threatening I

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.350
feel like a lot of people would would

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:19.270
spin that out for like some kind of

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:22.449
sympathy but really it's like getting a

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:25.630
mole removed except the mole is inside

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:27.880
of your totem and requires cutting

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:31.120
through the scrotum in order to get to

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.919
it but anyway the point is they gave me

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:36.639
tylenol threes which if you're not

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:40.389
familiar are tylenol with codeine in it

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:42.370
which is a somewhat powerful painkiller

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:43.599
it's it's an under the counter

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.610
painkiller is that what they call it

00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:47.080
it's not oh you can't just buy it you

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.990
got to like get a prescription from a

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:54.729
pharmacist or a doctor I should say

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:59.050
anyway I prided myself on being a moron

00:07:54.729 --> 00:08:00.400
so you know I took none of the tylenol

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:02.050
threes or I might have taken one of the

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.199
townhall 3s and then I was like I don't

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:06.970
need these looks like that paid

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:09.789
dividends to blow up that judgment back

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:10.960
there and instead I I don't remember if

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:13.060
I threw the rest of them in the trash

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:16.120
but I definitely disposed of the rest of

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:20.590
them and then later I was like it was it

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:22.000
was so needlessly full of bravado in a

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:25.000
way that gets me no street cred

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.300
whatsoever who cares yeah okay you had

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.520
surgery on your balls and then you

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.660
didn't take a painkiller that the doctor

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.719
said hey you should probably take this

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:36.490
painkiller I'm in the business of

00:08:34.719 --> 00:08:39.159
following doctor's orders now and then

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:40.479
the flipside of that and it's the proof

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:42.039
that you know you always get

00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:43.539
deserve in this life which is obviously

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:46.300
false but at the same time let's pretend

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:48.250
it's true for this bit when I had my

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:50.500
wisdom teeth taken out it was like I'm

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.670
not trying to scare you here this is 6

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.550
range ups pills

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:57.600
this is actually like ideal azazel you

00:08:54.550 --> 00:09:02.610
know money-making opportunities here

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:04.870
when it get to like 32 range basically

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.670
when I had my wisdom teeth taken out it

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:08.620
was like the most pain I've ever felt in

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:10.449
my adult life I imagine there were

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:12.519
probably things you know maybe being

00:09:10.449 --> 00:09:16.899
born hurt more but I don't remember much

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:20.800
of that so not on a physical level

00:09:16.899 --> 00:09:22.120
that's mostly you know your mom is in

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.410
pain there so I that's what they always

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.940
say but I don't know they might just be

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:27.250
milking it for attention please don't

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:29.139
hurt me um but it really is more the

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:31.300
philosophical pain of like I'm leaving

00:09:29.139 --> 00:09:33.220
the warm embrace of the womb for a cold

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:36.760
universe that doesn't care about me even

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:43.570
but you get over it eventually but yeah

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:46.720
like that the it was unpleasant fine it

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:48.550
was unpleasant to have my wisdom teeth

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.519
taken out borderline pay painful

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:54.459
probably sure to ask for more freezing

00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:56.620
but you know in my Canadian nature when

00:09:54.459 --> 00:09:59.019
the dentist goes like do you feel any

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:01.029
pain after he's already frozen you I

00:09:59.019 --> 00:10:02.380
just go no because I don't want him to

00:10:01.029 --> 00:10:06.459
feel that he's bad at his job

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:10.269
I would rather experience excruciating

00:10:06.459 --> 00:10:11.709
pain but then have the benefit of you

00:10:10.269 --> 00:10:15.790
know maintaining the decorum of

00:10:11.709 --> 00:10:18.310
politeness but afterwards extremely

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:19.569
painful recovery you're probably going

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:20.920
to be fine if you're on the underside

00:10:19.569 --> 00:10:24.819
you have an edge wisdom teeth taken out

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:27.310
I know when I was when I was in high

00:10:24.819 --> 00:10:29.199
school my kaleil Fox had his wisdom

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:30.910
teeth taken out what he was like 16 he

00:10:29.199 --> 00:10:33.130
was back at school like two days later

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:34.569
and though I think that the day he took

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:36.160
off he didn't even have to take off but

00:10:34.569 --> 00:10:38.500
you might as well because you know you

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.670
get that's one of the few times no one's

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.260
going to judge you for taking the day

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:44.079
off in North America as you're like I

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:46.600
just had a licensed professional use a

00:10:44.079 --> 00:10:47.199
drill to remove a piece of bone from my

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.829
job

00:10:47.199 --> 00:10:51.850
but yeah the dentist was like you

00:10:50.829 --> 00:10:52.720
shouldn't have done this when you're so

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:55.389
old you should have done

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:58.720
you were younger okay thanks a lot and

00:10:55.389 --> 00:11:00.910
then I wanted some higher grade

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.980
painkillers because I'd literally was in

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:05.829
pain there was no recreation involved

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:09.000
here and the dentist gave me literally

00:11:05.829 --> 00:11:13.029
the dental assistant pulled out a

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.519
Kirkland brand huge bottle of ibuprofen

00:11:13.029 --> 00:11:17.290
and they gave me some and I was like I

00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:20.500
could have just gone down to the Costco

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:22.480
and gotten this you guys are giving me

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:26.529
four dollars worth of over-the-counter

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:28.199
painkillers I was I was in agony for a

00:11:26.529 --> 00:11:31.569
couple of days at least

00:11:28.199 --> 00:11:34.509
anyway that's the end of this story

00:11:31.569 --> 00:11:37.569
I don't I'm not afraid of the dentist

00:11:34.509 --> 00:11:39.040
and have never really been and I'm still

00:11:37.569 --> 00:11:40.269
not to this day because after the wisdom

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.850
teeth stuff I don't know give me a root

00:11:40.269 --> 00:11:45.399
canal I don't I don't care for the most

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:47.860
part but yeah

00:11:45.399 --> 00:11:50.110
let this be if I if I could give you

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:52.720
what the most adult piece of advice

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:55.420
young adult piece of advice many of you

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.759
people William you'll please people many

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.410
of you people are going to be like in

00:11:56.759 --> 00:12:03.040
college right now and you're going to be

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:05.290
on either a dental plan for your school

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.759
you're going to be on a dental plan via

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.300
your parents for their work or something

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:09.670
like that

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:12.100
if you are your wisdom teeth taken out

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:15.629
there's no negatives except that it's

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:18.279
slightly inconvenient but trust me

00:12:15.629 --> 00:12:22.029
better to you know either get it done

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:24.189
for free or have to get don't only have

00:12:22.029 --> 00:12:25.720
to pay like twenty percent of it then to

00:12:24.189 --> 00:12:28.750
have to pay for a hundred percent of it

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:30.610
and also be older when I don't know I'm

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.350
taking this you know second hand for my

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:35.319
dentist but my dentist was like if you

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:37.839
have this done when you're like 16 to 22

00:12:35.319 --> 00:12:39.670
it's no problem you had it done at 26

00:12:37.839 --> 00:12:41.559
and it was like those teeth did not want

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:46.850
to leave they were in a rent-controlled

00:12:41.559 --> 00:12:48.440
job but I was

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:51.500
by the way boring topic for conversation

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:53.150
but that's kind of my brands my idea is

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:57.230
that we can mill it for some kind of

00:12:53.150 --> 00:13:01.040
absurd humor later it was the root of my

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:04.520
paranoia is how my dental experience

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:07.160
went wisdom teeth wise because I was on

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:10.400
my parents plan or my colleges dental

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:13.910
plan for like literally my entire life

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:15.500
until maybe the age of 24 but always go

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:16.940
like I didn't go to dentists once every

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.600
once every six months in college because

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.910
come on

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:22.460
there's keggers to go to but I did go

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:25.550
like once a year

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:27.260
when I was you know back at my parents

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:28.880
house they'd be like let's go to the

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:32.810
dentist any some vegetables that seems

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.950
like a good idea and every time I was

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:35.570
like should I get my wisdom teeth taken

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:37.460
out seems like a good time and then I uh

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:38.570
you know we don't take them out anymore

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.550
unless it seems like there's going to be

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:42.620
a problem you know we did the x-rays it

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:45.470
looks good as soon as I come off of the

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:47.570
insurance all these wisdom teeth are

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:49.460
looking oh they're impacted and probably

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:51.440
how did you let it get this bad I don't

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:54.650
understand isn't that painful and you're

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:56.720
like good good one I don't know if we

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:59.330
had like bad insurance from our school

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:03.320
or something like that but yeah so

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:05.690
that's look I love the Zayn azazel soy

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:08.180
milk is not Zayn it's just horrendously

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:09.650
annoying if I can reroll it I will but

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:12.950
I'm happy to let that one go you

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:16.520
literally just stop doing damage is what

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:18.920
that means you can fire a lot faster

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.450
I'll give you that so I'm not saying you

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.800
should insist I mean I think you should

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:23.440
follow your dentists orders if you

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:28.130
haven't had your wisdom teeth taken out

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:30.820
but I was a little mad that the I felt

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:33.200
like this dentist was like a mechanic

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:35.090
yeah you guys are out of warranty now

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:39.530
we're going to need to replace the

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:41.420
entire car with solid gold parts that

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:42.950
being said in the end I think our

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:45.590
dentist gave us a break it wasn't very

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:48.050
expensive common misconception you don't

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:53.300
get free dental care in Canada medical

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:58.600
care yes dental care no and that's the

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:58.600
end of that it's the end of that tangent

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:04.790
let's take stock of where this runs ed I

00:15:05.869 --> 00:15:13.110
think without a reroll room we basically

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:15.649
cannot lose so we should be in the

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:18.899
business of looking for fun synergies I

00:15:15.649 --> 00:15:20.059
still maintain that soy milk is not one

00:15:18.899 --> 00:15:22.559
of them

00:15:20.059 --> 00:15:25.379
with a 100% deal with the devil chance

00:15:22.559 --> 00:15:30.360
here obviously like real brimstone and

00:15:25.379 --> 00:15:32.759
then combine that with like homing tears

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:35.189
and like you know monstros long or

00:15:32.759 --> 00:15:38.790
something like that I want to shoot like

00:15:35.189 --> 00:15:43.559
electricity tentacles out of my body

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:45.209
here if we can accomplish that I'll

00:15:43.559 --> 00:15:47.999
consider this run a success even though

00:15:45.209 --> 00:15:49.589
we've talked about that same dental

00:15:47.999 --> 00:15:52.439
story that I've talked about many times

00:15:49.589 --> 00:15:56.309
in the past but you know I want you to I

00:15:52.439 --> 00:15:59.639
don't love your only experience if

00:15:56.309 --> 00:16:03.329
you're on the younger side to be

00:15:59.639 --> 00:16:06.509
listening to the other people on the NSS

00:16:03.329 --> 00:16:10.249
talk about going to the dentist because

00:16:06.509 --> 00:16:14.509
I think we exist on a spectrum I am a

00:16:10.249 --> 00:16:16.949
steps to right yeah I am a cartoonish

00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:18.420
depiction of an adult I'm like going you

00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:21.420
should always pay your taxes and

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:25.410
everyone goes put a shield and then Nick

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:27.839
is like a begrudging adult he's like you

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:29.910
know you ever see that picture on

00:16:27.839 --> 00:16:31.290
Twitter that's like why the heck

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:33.269
everything got it costs money

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:35.220
Nick's in that stage of adulthood and I

00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:38.490
completely resonate and understand with

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:41.730
that as well rob is still in the state

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:44.490
of rebelling against adulthood you know

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:47.189
he's like I think dentistry is a scam

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:49.259
and I understand that I've been there at

00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:50.549
points in my life but I'm past it I

00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:51.860
don't want you to just take what I'm

00:16:50.549 --> 00:16:54.839
saying

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:56.459
please let me into the shop I don't want

00:16:54.839 --> 00:16:59.129
you to just take what I'm saying at face

00:16:56.459 --> 00:17:02.579
value and go NL's right I just want you

00:16:59.129 --> 00:17:04.439
to have a broad spectrum of opinions on

00:17:02.579 --> 00:17:07.289
adulthood I think that's something the

00:17:04.439 --> 00:17:10.529
analysis is very good at is that we're

00:17:07.289 --> 00:17:12.990
all not just at different places in our

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:15.750
lives but we all want different things

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:18.689
we're all we're all at different places

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:21.569
and we're all you know getting there via

00:17:18.689 --> 00:17:25.079
a different mode of transportation like

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:26.819
bear taffy is adults but he also

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:28.740
maintains and I think he does this

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:30.450
willfully a little bit of that childlike

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:33.779
wonder you know he's like an adult but

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:35.880
he's like I will eat a popsicle every

00:17:33.779 --> 00:17:39.000
day nothing wrong with that you know

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:41.130
it's a healthy little bit of a childhood

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.679
enjoyment it's I'm not saying I eat

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:45.090
quinoa for a snack I'm just saying you

00:17:43.679 --> 00:17:46.970
know when I eat a popsicle I go I

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:48.600
shouldn't be in this popsicle he goes

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:50.370
psychologically there is a good reason

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.590
to eat this popsicle and I think he said

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:59.309
I think you've got a lot going right in

00:17:52.590 --> 00:18:04.020
that situation Austin is like it's like

00:17:59.309 --> 00:18:07.590
Rob but I'm trying to think of where I

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:11.610
want to draw this distinction I think

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:13.289
Rob is aware that the decisions that he

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:15.510
makes as a young adult are not

00:18:13.289 --> 00:18:17.399
necessarily ideal but he feels like he's

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:19.620
in a deterministic universe to have to

00:18:17.399 --> 00:18:22.039
do them anyway he's like this thing is

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:26.250
not good but I'm going to do it anyway

00:18:22.039 --> 00:18:30.779
Austin on the other hand is like this

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:32.039
thing that I'm opting out of is the

00:18:30.779 --> 00:18:33.720
right way to do it like we had a

00:18:32.039 --> 00:18:35.100
conversation about dress clothes the

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.389
other day and he's like I don't see why

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:40.049
I should have to wear nice clothes to a

00:18:36.389 --> 00:18:42.360
funeral I feel like and I love Austin

00:18:40.049 --> 00:18:43.919
don't get me wrong I love this topic of

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.870
conversation as well because it's

00:18:43.919 --> 00:18:48.630
ridiculous and that's exactly what I

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:50.399
look for in my life obviously like this

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:54.210
we want everything here we got some Zane

00:18:50.399 --> 00:18:56.490
I respect this and we can smelt up

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:58.080
trinkets smelter orders suck up drinking

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.220
some out there and get a permanent speed

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.270
upgrade as well and then what have we

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.950
got here what do we got here we should

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:04.320
have saved food for this that's an

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:11.760
amateur mistake I'll tell you what drive

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:13.230
a bay Austin is like he believes that

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.270
he's fighting on the right side of

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:17.610
history for this stuff Rob would be like

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:18.960
I'm gonna wear you know a t-shirt to the

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:20.879
funeral because that's all that's clean

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.570
but I recognize that that's kind of a

00:19:20.879 --> 00:19:24.299
bad thing

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:24.780
Austin would be like society's ideals

00:19:24.299 --> 00:19:26.700
have

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:28.920
no bearing on the way I choose to live

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:32.790
my life and I respect that in its own

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:34.740
way as well I think I at the biased suit

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:37.020
I think I'm too old to not own a suit

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:41.160
you know what would actually trigger

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:42.660
this for me was when I went to my I mean

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.950
I mean this is not bragging it's just

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:45.330
setting up the situation because it's a

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:47.460
weird thing to brag about okay I just

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:49.950
want to make that clear when I was at my

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:52.740
old high school's graduation I wore like

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:55.860
a polo shirt and okay jeans and then I

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:57.240
got there and everyone was basically not

00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:00.750
wearing a suit necessarily but like

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:02.670
dress clothes almost except for me and I

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:05.310
mean I grew up in the kind of town where

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:06.900
people would like they'd wear dress

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:09.750
clothes but then it also have like a hat

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.770
with their favorite snowmobile brand on

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.660
it they'd be like you know I'm

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:14.250
interested but the Polaris hat doesn't

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.080
come off or anything so I was like if

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:19.520
I'm underdressed here it's time

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:21.660
as someone who's nearly 30 and that

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:23.340
honestly I'm such an adult that that

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:26.460
statement actually excites me I'm like

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:29.670
30 bags are going to start to trust me

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:31.350
soon I can rent a car at like the

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:33.750
average rate soon not that I've ever

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:38.210
rented a car but you know I could now is

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:40.650
the thing like I just got to get a suit

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:42.830
I'm not even like fighting the good

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:46.190
fight I'm not anti suit I'm just like a

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:48.480
the problem is I've never had a

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:50.790
situation where I've had to wear a suit

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.500
twice in one month so I always like I

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:54.600
should probably wear a suit for this

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:56.760
thing but I'm not going to just wear a

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:58.290
suit or like I'm not going to go buy a

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.670
suit and then wear it once and then put

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:01.560
it in the closet and the next time I

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:03.630
need a suit is going to be like I don't

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:05.880
know it could be like four years from

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:10.650
now so it hasn't been cost-effective but

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:12.750
I think you know Lord willing my body is

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:14.280
roughly in the same state the same

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.780
configuration that it's going to be in

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.790
for like the next 20 years at least

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:19.650
let's be realistic probably going to

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:23.310
pack on a few pounds it's the way it

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:24.600
seems to go but that's alright we can

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:26.370
always just get it taken out in the

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:30.000
stomach if something tailor's can do I'm

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:32.310
sure it bothers me because I see like

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.620
you know nineteen year old student

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:36.630
athletes wearing suits and I go I don't

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:38.279
own a suit this person was born in like

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:40.019
the year 2000

00:21:38.279 --> 00:21:45.359
they own a suit I got to get on that

00:21:40.019 --> 00:21:49.349
like I'm falling behind maybe maybe not

00:21:45.359 --> 00:21:51.869
I don't know because I'm not buying the

00:21:49.349 --> 00:21:53.940
suit because I'd look nice in it buying

00:21:51.869 --> 00:21:56.549
a suit because basically I'm going to

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:58.469
pay like probably a few hundred - you

00:21:56.549 --> 00:22:01.379
know just over a thousand dollars to

00:21:58.469 --> 00:22:03.059
stop feeling like I'm underdressed when

00:22:01.379 --> 00:22:08.309
I go to important events like weddings

00:22:03.059 --> 00:22:09.989
and funerals I'm definitely not a guy

00:22:08.309 --> 00:22:14.009
that's like I'm going to get a tailored

00:22:09.989 --> 00:22:15.839
suit probably I don't know that strikes

00:22:14.009 --> 00:22:18.119
me as a mouse thing do we have any

00:22:15.839 --> 00:22:21.450
interest in piercing shots they would

00:22:18.119 --> 00:22:23.879
Doubleday you know what I say we give it

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:25.379
a freakin try here and honestly I'm

00:22:23.879 --> 00:22:28.739
going to go for the hush fight and the

00:22:25.379 --> 00:22:30.779
reason is I would rather die on the hush

00:22:28.739 --> 00:22:32.309
fight then just win the run in 21

00:22:30.779 --> 00:22:35.249
minutes and have people think that I'm a

00:22:32.309 --> 00:22:38.399
little baby right so let's buy this and

00:22:35.249 --> 00:22:41.070
I mean we'll just buy everything Saul

00:22:38.399 --> 00:22:44.909
gave me father why should we bother buy

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:46.710
everything but Billy Billy Talent

00:22:44.909 --> 00:22:48.869
are they still popular when I was in

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:52.769
tenth grade this is a Canadian band by

00:22:48.869 --> 00:22:54.539
the way so it might be a little bit of

00:22:52.769 --> 00:22:55.649
an exclusive to Canada reference I don't

00:22:54.539 --> 00:22:58.039
know Billy Talent ever made the

00:22:55.649 --> 00:23:04.469
crossover wouldn't surprise me

00:22:58.039 --> 00:23:09.330
necessarily but hmm okay I have an idea

00:23:04.469 --> 00:23:11.249
I think that we do we want to this is a

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:15.179
weird one first off we don't care about

00:23:11.249 --> 00:23:16.589
these but we also do not want teleport

00:23:15.179 --> 00:23:18.509
so it's kind of a confusing situation

00:23:16.589 --> 00:23:20.489
there is a battery charge for sale okay

00:23:18.509 --> 00:23:21.960
so I think we do not want to ruin

00:23:20.489 --> 00:23:25.320
permanent polaroid invincibility so we

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:27.330
should suck up this room that gave us

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:29.519
almost no benefit and then we got a

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:30.989
couple of options here I think the

00:23:29.519 --> 00:23:33.119
correct course of action is you take

00:23:30.989 --> 00:23:35.190
Virgo and the invincibility from virgos

00:23:33.119 --> 00:23:37.979
like pretty good we should have looked

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:41.969
to see if we could have gotten a black

00:23:37.979 --> 00:23:44.399
market first though because luck

00:23:41.969 --> 00:23:47.580
upgrades please it's plausible we could

00:23:44.399 --> 00:23:49.019
have traded bloodbag on the black market

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:52.140
for something a little bit more valuable

00:23:49.019 --> 00:23:54.120
I think here we don't want blood rights

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:55.529
in what is kind of a it's almost like

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.720
this is a trick question on the Isaac

00:23:55.529 --> 00:24:07.830
exam I'm pretty sure that what we want

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:09.840
to do is take the straw and then drop it

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:13.200
back down and then suck it up so we have

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:16.140
it for later and the straw once every

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:21.620
six rooms is not really worth very much

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:24.330
at all but so King baby plus dry baby

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:31.500
actually is a pretty good combination to

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:33.720
block shots especially we can just stay

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.919
in a line here but I mean this is going

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.570
to be an annoying

00:24:34.919 --> 00:24:40.620
hush fight I don't think there's much

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:42.090
question about that rate of fire is like

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:46.830
completely fine let's get these yeah

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:49.260
that's the idea right there try to get

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:51.210
these guys in a position so that they

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:52.440
can actually block shots a lot of these

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:53.880
shots are going to come in on an angle

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.940
and as a result it's going to be a

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:58.830
little tougher for us to block them but

00:24:55.940 --> 00:25:02.760
it's actually like the most useful I've

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:05.760
ever seen king baby be king baby bees

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:07.590
you know oh my god and they'll know

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:10.049
smash broz I thought he was a hundred

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:13.080
years I was there when Smash Bros one

00:25:10.049 --> 00:25:15.029
came out okay a few people watching this

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:17.460
will probably not even alive you were

00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:19.500
just a twinkle in your dad's nutsack

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:22.980
before you know super smash brothers

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:25.559
melee came out I was there when 64 came

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:28.080
out all right friends telling me it's

00:25:25.559 --> 00:25:30.929
not okay to pick up the laser gun as Fox

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:32.730
because Fox already has a laser gun how

00:25:30.929 --> 00:25:36.149
is it fair that you get two guns and we

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:39.419
get zero it's not a laser gun it's a

00:25:36.149 --> 00:25:42.470
blaster it is true that that's my

00:25:39.419 --> 00:25:45.330
impression of myself as a ten-year-old

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:47.399
I'm glad we at least took it upon

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:51.059
ourselves to give this a try down here

00:25:47.399 --> 00:25:54.330
oh I remembered I was going to say now

00:25:51.059 --> 00:25:55.740
is talking about that Hulk come on it's

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:58.470
talking about that Billy talent

00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:00.630
situation that was like the biggest

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:02.820
concert that ever came to my hometown

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:04.310
when I was in college they're not

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:06.080
college sorry

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:09.710
that would be when Broken Social Scene

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:15.710
played at stages but now Billy Talent

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:17.090
played at AJ's hangar when I was in when

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:20.090
I was in high school and it was an

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:22.670
all-ages show and it was like if you're

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:28.550
anybody who's anybody he's going to that

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:30.770
Billy talent show so I stayed home we

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:32.810
didn't get you know bands that you could

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:34.910
find out much music all that often so it

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:38.780
was a big it was a big milestone for us

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:44.180
I should I know how to dodge this shot

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:47.960
this is what bothers me I'm just I've

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:49.640
chosen to be more aggressive on this

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:51.920
hush fight and that could lead to my

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:59.510
demise here although at this point we're

00:26:51.920 --> 00:27:06.170
probably relatively set what's going on

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:10.250
there those shots were not those were

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:16.030
not continuum shots at first we're not

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:18.800
hitting anything it's okay there we go

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:20.800
honestly this is like the best attack

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:23.090
for us which doesn't happen too often

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:24.980
that that's what you're actually looking

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:28.940
for but that's like the best attack for

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:31.630
us because it's very y'all I tried to

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:35.420
just keep it as safe as possible very

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:40.280
easy to dodge with with high speed at

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:42.290
least all I need is for like I could get

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.880
hit one more time and be fine if I get

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:44.960
into two more times I don't like very

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.280
comedy we're going to beat this fight

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.960
but if I get it two more times anything

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:50.900
could happen on the Cathedral like it

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:53.000
one more time I'm pretty confident we

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:56.300
did it was it worth it I mean under no

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.510
circumstances but do keep in mind I did

00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:01.370
pay three spirit hearts for a piercing

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:03.770
shot upgrade that does nothing for us so

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:05.750
at the same time I'm also like it's not

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:06.710
like I just played badly and put us in a

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:11.210
bad situation

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:13.790
like I jokes on you guys that was just

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:15.170
pretending to be bad I would love some

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:17.330
HP

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:21.260
you gotta added a little spice on an

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:23.020
Azazel run right like otherwise what's

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:25.880
the point

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:29.390
we do have PhD feels like I'm walking on

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:31.220
sunshine is actually kind of I've come

00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:34.610
to believe that this is actually like

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:37.820
not a good pill for the most part it's

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:38.720
not bad but it's also like just not all

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.660
that's huge

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:43.250
it's also just not that meaningful at

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:45.050
all because it does so little damage

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:46.250
it's nice for a blood bank or a demon

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:48.580
judgement or something like that but

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:48.580
anyway

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:59.440
I think my defining characteristic on a

00:28:56.170 --> 00:29:01.090
personal level at least the the side of

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:07.930
the personality that I showed it videos

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:11.790
is I have lucked into a job where I can

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:15.280
be free of all adult responsibilities

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:18.100
Moute well some adult responsibilities

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:20.890
and then you can really draw a line

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:23.260
between the members of the people who

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:26.050
are on the NL SS based on how they've

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:30.640
reacted to that I'm grateful but at the

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:34.570
same time I feel guilty you know I think

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:36.790
Rob is sort of on that same line austin

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:39.190
is on some Tim Ferriss stuff where he's

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:41.230
like this is the right way to live your

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:42.880
life I don't know opposite it's kind of

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:44.140
an insult to call Austin Tim Ferriss

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.670
because he's not working a 4-hour

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:50.500
workweek usually working like an eighty

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:54.280
four hour workweek and you should know

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:56.500
from my a pink okay let's pop it we did

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:58.420
get that's from Serpent's kiss I think

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.800
though you should know from my you know

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:02.470
how many times have I said that I hate

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:04.240
the expression work smart not hard work

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:06.190
smart and hard you should know from my

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:08.860
opinion on working smart and hard that

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:12.790
you know I respect Austin's work ethic

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:14.200
to an enormous deal just interesting to

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:15.610
tease out these differences and

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:18.250
personalities the kind of stuff I think

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:21.010
about is worth you know making a bit on

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:24.340
the NL SS I'm like how am I going to try

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:30.310
to tease out the things that make us

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:32.290
different in a comedic fashion I think

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:35.110
the people you know that watch it and

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:37.900
then chat kind of see a little of

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:40.390
themselves in some of the NL SS members

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:42.430
as well and that's important

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:45.760
nobody sees themselves in me though

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:48.250
which I accept I'm willing to be the

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:49.810
vanguard of criticism for the for the

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:53.320
show I'm just surprised that's all

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:58.050
because I think I live a relatively

00:30:53.320 --> 00:31:02.640
normal life yeah

00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:04.430
might as well take Mambo I always hold

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:07.550
myself as having relatively reasonable

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:10.080
opinions but perhaps you know that's

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:13.800
because I hold them I would think that

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:17.730
they are reasonable why we did a bid on

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:19.880
the NL SS where I was often doesn't like

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:22.230
cucumber and I said that strikes me as

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:23.760
slightly unusual not for you because I

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:26.100
know you don't like many vegetables to

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:28.020
begin with but because cucumbers to me

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:29.760
seems like a very likeable vegetable he

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:31.830
described it as weird water which in

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:33.300
hindsight I can't disagree with if you

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:34.860
gave me a glass full of cucumbers when I

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:39.810
asked for water I'd be like this is

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:42.420
weird is the old glass full of X and a

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:45.960
restaurant a philosophical experiment

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:48.660
but anyway he's not wrong about that but

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:51.660
I was like if you asked one hundred

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:53.040
school-aged children I'm not going to

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:56.070
get in the minutiae of what is and isn't

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:57.750
a school-aged child but anyway II didn't

00:31:56.070 --> 00:32:03.750
affect our range that of Rebbe of

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:06.150
brimstone that's right Linda beam if you

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:08.280
have to 100 school-aged children I think

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:10.020
you would find that cucumber is one of

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:12.000
the most liked vegetables of course you

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:12.480
know in North America that was really

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.250
bad

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:16.740
in North America you got potatoes you

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:20.490
got corn yeah carrots these are all

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:22.020
going to be beloved then somebody in

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:23.460
Chad first off they were like nah

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:25.860
cucumbers weird and I was like I don't

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:28.800
understand your opinion on this then

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:31.410
they went well we had an anecdotal

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:33.660
someone who works as a salad bar that I

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:34.560
guess children frequent they might be

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:36.000
watching this right now I'm not

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:38.760
disparaging you I'm just calling into

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.760
question the veracity of your data

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:43.560
collection said that the most popular

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:45.450
vegetable where they work is banana

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:49.290
peppers and this sort of set me off

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:51.090
because I'm like but I don't buy it dude

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:56.370
I don't buy the banana peppers or the

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:58.980
most that gave us no stats I don't buy

00:32:56.370 --> 00:33:02.820
that banana peppers are the most popular

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:05.040
vegetable it doesn't make sense to me in

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:06.630
terms of consumption like 3 banana

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:08.670
peppers is all you need for a sandwich

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:10.110
or a salad you need like you know 30

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:11.010
leaves a lettuce or something like

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:12.480
anyway I don't even know

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:16.160
is going with this bit we don't need

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:19.440
either of these i this will suck them up

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:21.780
we're looking for I mean if necessary we

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:23.400
should leave some red hearts red hard

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:25.020
containers on the ground if possible but

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.559
we don't need to take the money that's

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:28.500
my bed

00:33:25.559 --> 00:33:30.330
if not necessary then we don't want to

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:35.850
ruin permanent polaroid invincibility if

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:38.220
we can get around it so we should still

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:41.640
win though and I do I feel a little bit

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:43.860
like I put this run in a dangerous place

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:46.350
with some pickups that were highly

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:48.750
unnecessary so I don't feel like we've

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:55.620
made we played badly I think we played

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:56.130
ok all the sneeze this sneeze no don't

00:33:55.620 --> 00:34:00.240
leave me

00:33:56.130 --> 00:34:06.900
the sneeze I really wanted that sneeze I

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:08.399
was pursuing that sneeze great a fire

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:10.440
got bad for a second there because a

00:34:08.399 --> 00:34:13.800
triple shopper was still sitting pretty

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:19.530
it's alright to be sitting pretty this

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:20.790
is song from hey oh no just I mean at

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:23.100
that point we probably could have

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:25.050
afforded to not suck them up but a

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:27.570
little bit of extra damage means

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:31.950
something a little bit of damage but a

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:35.570
lot of luck is what we're looking for

00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:37.500
more items do more items hold yeah oh

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:39.389
that's what you're looking for right

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:43.190
there and you know what we got permanent

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:43.190
already visibility give me e coli

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:59.150
nicely done should be like a hundred

00:34:53.330 --> 00:35:00.890
percent set now I told you if we didn't

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:04.280
get hit twice on that

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:05.510
hush fight we weren't going to die you

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.920
got here once we'd be in a more

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:09.290
dangerous situation but if we got it

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:11.390
twice anything could have happened but

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:13.720
at two and a half HP we got no problem

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:21.620
student and as you can tell right here

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:23.390
will I do the void floor I don't know I

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:25.160
got to think about it it's the honest

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:29.570
answer to that question we've paused

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:32.300
time for about a half second not that

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:34.010
valuable and we're done okay honestly a

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.880
fairly fun as asel run for now thanks

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:36.350
