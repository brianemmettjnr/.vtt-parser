##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.609
hey everybody welcome back to a

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.940
refreshed northernlion goes back through

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:13.110
the challenges here I rule is new that's

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.969
not one we failed there's only five of

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.529
them four after birth plus ultra hard is

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:23.730
garbage backasswards I think is so when

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:27.330
were you start on mega Satan and then

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.010
you lose an item every floor the fact

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.189
that we're starting with mom's knife is

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.300
like incredible we can see some of our

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:40.290
other items in there the soul The MITRE

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.210
our damage is bad it's not a horrible I

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.920
mean it's as good as our damage was on

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.890
the last run plus with the added benefit

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.960
of mom's knife so you'll forgive me if I

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.140
find myself like a little bit pleased

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.309
with the way this run looks oh no

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.010
question marks because it really does

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.280
look better than the last one

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.660
sadly that makes you small we have also

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.030
have acid baby so we got the poison

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.380
effect there so I expect the mega Satan

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.119
fight to be kind of annoying

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.330
mom's knife is kind of like our saving

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.159
grace here and then we'll lose an item

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.979
or more every single floor on the way

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.159
down but if we get to keep mom's knife

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.650
we're probably gonna make this work this

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.090
is another one like I'd cheese did you

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.110
can't really deliberately choose this

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.150
one I think but um I sort of got lucky

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.170
the first time I did this challenge I

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.390
was like I don't see why everyone's

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.369
complaining the run was so good I didn't

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.210
even notice that I was missing items the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.130
longer it went on so far this is

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.770
starting from a position where basically

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.670
as long as we're not losing mom's knife

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.090
we're probably gonna win because the run

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.680
just gets easier in terms of like the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.770
enemies it gets more difficult in terms

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.020
of you know the relative difficulty of

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.350
killing the enemies potentially it's not

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.350
great

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:08.090
we're not stacked right now but if you

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.039
look at like the the optics for how this

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.610
run goes in the future we could be

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.900
stacked pretty quickly in the future

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.910
relative to the enemies as long as I

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.110
think I deflected that shot into myself

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.360
all we need to do is live through this

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.620
and actually that's appearing to be more

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.620
of a challenge than originally expected

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:37.670
you definitely do not want to squander

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:39.140
this one because this is like as close

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.660
to a 10 out of 10 start as you could

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.640
expect because our stats actually are

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.900
rendered nearly irrelevant by the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.340
existence of mom's knife

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.370
I noticed by the way we also have like

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.230
dead shot in there we have a empty

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.910
vessel which is not doing anything for

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.739
us right now but you know dead shot

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.700
growth hormones there's some items in

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.530
there of some value can only get hit

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:09.430
four more times actually like a little

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:09.430
scary please just die right there okay

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.280
do you only start with ten items by the

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:18.920
way yes so there actually is a

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:23.540
relatively good chance every floor that

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:26.180
we lose something important particularly

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.850
mom's knife but also I would prefer not

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.889
to lose growth hormones Deadshot is a

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.569
close second if we lose moms knife we'd

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:35.660
rather lose growth hormones than

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:39.319
Deadshot but if those don't get

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.940
deflected excuse me if we don't lose

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.049
moms knife we'd rather keep this

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.049
straight damage upgrade

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:51.410
we're good we're good get dusted okay

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:55.120
thank you good Lord above for the moms

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:58.880
knife start here and the spirit heart

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:05.180
and do we want to go straight up

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:06.940
I can't imagine me wooden oh ignore what

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.250
sounds like a gas leak in the background

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.730
that's just uh the shower on the

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:17.510
adjacent wall now we go fight Satan I

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:24.500
mean it starts pretty pretty

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:28.000
outrageously here I can't help but feel

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.000
I might have made a catastrophic mistake

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:38.790
don't do just be mega satan what like

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.790
it's hard

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.470
bait him into that it's okay we're good

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:52.550
we're good we're good very important

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:54.919
just keep moving here don't forget to

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.660
drink your Ovaltine there we go we did

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:58.180
it shouldn't have been that tough

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.250
I'll admit I'll be the first to admit

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.660
and maybe we should do more rooms now we

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.669
have to do we have to get to the spawn

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.850
room that's the only thing that makes

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:09.590
sense because the spawn room contains

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.840
the portal to go up all right now I'm

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:16.490
feel like we're set here what did we

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.030
lose I don't know actually bad trip is

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.979
fine

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.270
Tomoe would like to leave that trip is

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.960
actually great because if we get hit

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:26.680
once all of a sudden we got like a

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.680
ridiculous amount of value

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:36.930
addicted is not really a good pill

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:40.409
obviously in pretty much any

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.879
circumstance although if we don't get

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:43.650
hit if you wanted to be like super

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:45.659
pedantic and be the kid who corrects the

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:50.250
teacher when they make a mistake on the

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:52.439
chalkboard technically if you don't get

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.120
hit addicted is good because of acid

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:57.860
baby you get a mass poison when you

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:01.319
start the room if you use it technically

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:06.930
uncle it's are cloven-hoofed but not all

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:09.150
cloven hood animals or ungulates I had

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.949
that happen in in a college lecture once

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.620
not to the same extent this was more

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:19.080
like less like a actually and more like

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:20.909
a cool guy there was it was like classic

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.590
first-year University lectures there

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:26.009
were like 200 people in the class and

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:28.680
this dude was talking real loud the

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:30.779
whole oh we lost mom's knife but this is

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.229
actually okay for our damage as long as

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:37.259
we can keep dead I he was talking and

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:39.690
the professor was like do you want to

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:42.000
teach the class and then he walked up to

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:44.400
him like with the microphone he was like

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.789
oh sure and then the professor is just

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.860
like get out that's that's the end of

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:53.089
that story that if you told it with more

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:55.050
Flair might actually be entertaining

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:56.699
basically the guy thought he was cool

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.770
he's like I'm gonna the professor would

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:00.419
never expect me to say yes and then he

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:05.789
said yes he was just like get out of my

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:07.379
class get out of my class get expelled

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:08.879
from my school I don't know if he got

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:11.370
expelled that seems a little harsh for

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:14.279
just like one outburst of being kind of

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:17.539
a jerk but more like an idiot than a

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:17.539
jerk you for being honest

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:28.010
so the moms knife loss is pretty bad the

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.790
existence of Deadshot helps it not be

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:33.500
horrible

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:37.040
I thought we died what happens if you go

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:39.110
through to the I don't want to know uh

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.700
this is actually answering my question I

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.320
was just gonna say can we get more items

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.970
like if we explore can we go to the item

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.970
rooms once we get up to the depths if so

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:49.780
I like our odds I actually quite like

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:52.070
our odds as well now that we've well

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:58.040
alright we don't want to go up I like

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:59.240
our odds anyway because of a theme you

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.430
know the more items we pick up the less

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.960
likely we are to lose these items that

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.190
mean something to us if the items that

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.170
we pick up don't mean anything to us

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:09.290
which I would say athame does mean

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:14.540
something to us we could orchestrate or

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:21.590
run around it didn't really work there

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:23.420
but range up fairly irrelevant but yeah

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:27.500
I don't know does does this get harder

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:28.880
or easier as it goes along I'm assuming

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:32.360
that pretty much depends on what you

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:35.780
roll like this run should be harder now

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:39.170
as a result of the loss of moms knife

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:40.370
but if we had lost like acid baby or

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:44.450
something we might be laughing all the

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:45.950
way to the bank here mind you it's also

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:49.520
you got to think about this it's like

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:52.190
there's some calculus involved when we

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.620
lose a good item is the hardest that it

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:56.150
will ever be for us having just lost

00:08:54.620 --> 00:09:00.350
that item like if mom's knife is the

00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:02.450
defining item in our run having lost

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:04.610
that the run probably stands to never

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:06.320
get more difficult than it was when we

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:08.330
were on the first room that we lost it

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:11.180
on does that make any sense at all you

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:13.250
see what I mean like I'm trying to give

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:16.750
a well-reasoned example here but I'm not

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.750
sure it's coming across completely

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.450
basically we've already suffered the

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.280
punishment

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:27.330
we've already it's like doing the time

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:29.850
before doing the crime you know we've

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:31.020
already spent 25 to life in jail now

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:33.560
we've gotten released and it's like an

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:35.910
Ashley Judd double jeopardy situation

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:38.040
well she was on double jeopardy I didn't

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:40.260
even know she was smart that's not funny

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:46.140
okay there's not as funny as you think

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:50.190
it is self-conquest we did not lose

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:56.400
Deadshot nor did we lose a theme I think

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:57.720
we lost a multi-dimensional baby it's

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.100
gonna be hard to keep track of what we

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.570
lost but remember the first step I did

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.460
this challenge which at this point was

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:04.200
actually only like seven months ago so I

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.760
have a little bit more of a memory than

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:11.280
those rebirth challenges we did in like

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:12.720
you know the winter of 2014 I didn't

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.640
even notice that it was taking items

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.950
away from me that time so this is like a

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.770
new it's a new era to at least

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:22.500
understand that that's happening so now

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:25.950
we got white pony white pony is a pretty

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:27.840
great active item on acid in a run like

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:29.670
this I think and to be honest with you

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:33.240
although Krampus is head is not

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:36.170
meritless in and of itself I'm gonna be

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:38.910
happier just having the ability to fly

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:48.630
then once every six rooms killing all

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:52.380
enemies range down range up instead of a

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:58.100
range down this is the world's worst

00:10:52.380 --> 00:11:02.370
reference to pavements range life-track

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:09.210
nine on 1994 album crooked rain crooked

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:16.860
rain crooked rain cookie dream crooked

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:17.760
ring I only want to see you listening to

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:24.360
the

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:27.540
good rain that's Prince but really he

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:30.090
was a king of the of the music industry

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:35.130
for a while anyway okay you've got 18

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:40.010
cents shop caliber the floors get

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:40.010
shorter as time goes on as well so

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.470
don't have too much to worry about

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:06.790
I was starting to feel the fatigue with

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:12.240
shooting these enemies though since when

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:16.740
are they so strong like this champion

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:19.660
siege bunker here from Starcraft one is

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:22.480
not plausible to kill that was a deep

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:26.470
cut reference for me by the way it has

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:29.020
probably been like close to two decades

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:32.470
which is scarily mathematically

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:33.370
plausible since I've seen a bunker I

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:34.270
don't even know if they're called siege

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:43.600
bunkers because they're definitely

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:46.420
called siege tanks so worth sort of we

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:48.279
got too bad trip pills I really I have

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:50.410
like a philosophy on these challenges

00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:55.240
and and a lot of the philosophy is if

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:57.240
you have one full health slash you know

00:12:55.240 --> 00:13:00.220
survive a bill that was really dumb

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:02.380
survivability pillar card you almost

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:03.700
can't lose unless you do something

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:06.250
stupid and screw yourself out of a

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.899
victory you're probably gonna come out

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:10.800
of this one smelling like a rose is my

00:13:07.899 --> 00:13:10.800
perspective

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:21.670
14 hour energy it's not bad now what

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:25.600
would be the ultimate item to lose it

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:26.019
would still I mean it would be bad thank

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.120
you

00:13:26.019 --> 00:13:29.769
oh we should just look for the cosmetics

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:33.100
table which will make it easier to tell

00:13:29.769 --> 00:13:36.750
when we don't Lenny I see it would be

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:39.100
bad to lose Deadeye which we didn't

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:40.779
didn't lose ass I think we lost growth

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.910
hormones yeah that would that would be

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:45.100
like in the top three worst items to

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:46.810
lose no doubt the soul would also be bad

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.829
but you know we already got the value

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.630
out of the spirit hearts and those

00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:52.810
essentially kept us alive on the saving

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:59.139
flights so and the manga Satan fight for

00:13:52.810 --> 00:14:00.760
that matter so starting now I mean we

00:13:59.139 --> 00:14:02.829
have a 100% deal with the devil chance

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:06.329
thanks to goat head which maybe is kind

00:14:02.829 --> 00:14:06.329
of like an unsung hero in and of itself

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:15.370
all we need to do to win this run is to

00:14:13.449 --> 00:14:17.649
roughly and it doesn't even have to be

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:21.220
exact like I think we're pretty okay if

00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:22.660
it's in exact but roughly match the

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.339
quality of items we lose with the

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.600
quality of items we gain considering

00:14:24.339 --> 00:14:27.250
we're gaining more than one item per

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.589
floor I would expect that the hard part

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:32.050
of this run is already over unless we've

00:14:29.589 --> 00:14:34.420
rolled really really badly you know what

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:35.949
I mean like on the on the first few

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:39.040
floors those are the hardest floors in

00:14:35.949 --> 00:14:40.720
the game and you're losing an item

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.310
without having the chance to gain more

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.790
than one item on these floors

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:48.010
conceivably we can be gaining two or

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:50.890
three items well I don't know if this

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:52.660
item rooms but especially with Goathead

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.949
we're at least getting the chance to get

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:56.560
a deal with the devil every floor and

00:14:53.949 --> 00:14:58.890
we've already fought Krampus so the more

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.890
the merrier

00:15:01.509 --> 00:15:06.999
but having seven damage at the peak of

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:06.999
Deadeye

00:15:07.959 --> 00:15:16.309
leaves a little bit to be desired trying

00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:21.189
to keep that Deadeye bonus going as long

00:15:16.309 --> 00:15:21.189
as possible and it's worked out

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:37.550
I'm begging I'm bagging we're good

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:39.410
we get the negative and actually a great

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:41.750
series of deal with the devil items good

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:43.100
lord so we don't have 4.7 or sorry

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:46.190
eleven point seven one damage we

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:52.910
probably actually have like I guess five

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:54.740
point eight five but still this should

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:57.050
be enough at this point we just added

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:59.569
two very very good items we're probably

00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:00.829
never gonna get well I don't know I was

00:15:59.569 --> 00:16:03.529
gonna say we're probably never gonna get

00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:06.800
a high enough level of damage to just

00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:08.899
destroy enemies before they stand any

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.220
threat to us but I guess it's actually

00:16:08.899 --> 00:16:13.819
completely plausible to that would

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:15.170
happen cuz the run is giving us easier

00:16:13.819 --> 00:16:17.829
and easier enemies as time goes on

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.829
excuse me

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:30.570
we don't need anything it pains me

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:32.340
because I'd like to get more items in

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:33.390
fact actually now that I think about it

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:35.130
it's not like we can donate to our

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:38.790
donation machine we might as well just

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:41.490
snag at least a passive item to give us

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:43.280
more of a chance of losing that item as

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:56.340
opposed to some other item that actually

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:58.830
is meaningful to us yeah I think that

00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:00.840
makes sense so we're like halfway

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:03.510
through this run but we might be

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:05.280
anywhere from like a quarter to you know

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:07.590
three quarters of the way through the

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.690
run depending on the items that it takes

00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:11.160
and also the items that were able to get

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:12.750
for the rest of it I don't understand

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:18.330
why you guys are immune to taking damage

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:19.560
I also don't understand what paid out

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:21.990
with that eternal heart but it gives me

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:24.240
a great excuse to not go to this blood

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:27.780
bank here okay that's pretty stupid of

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:31.470
me like oh yeah I guess it's piggy bank

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:35.310
but you know what unless we think about

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:41.820
it the better do that thing you were you

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:44.940
think there was a ton move fool you were

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:49.610
bored if someone asked this chizz way

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:53.250
around okay great dude great song

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:56.970
talking heads this must be the place

00:17:53.250 --> 00:18:01.650
open parenthesis naive melody close

00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:07.700
parenthesis from the soundtrack of Wall

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:10.869
Street starring Michael Douglas who

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:15.320
claims he got

00:18:10.869 --> 00:18:17.450
esophageal cancer from performing favors

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.889
for his wife bold move we've been down

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:21.940
that road before that's that's one of my

00:18:18.889 --> 00:18:25.450
favorite NLS a recurring NL SS bids is

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:28.249
good Lord Michael Douglas

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:31.399
the brass cojones to say that in public

00:18:28.249 --> 00:18:33.619
a little bit out of control okay

00:18:31.399 --> 00:18:35.450
I forgot once we lose that we lose the

00:18:33.619 --> 00:18:38.269
ability to fly but that's okay because

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:42.489
we actually want Guppies head preferably

00:18:38.269 --> 00:18:42.489
not walking over the spikes 20 times but

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:49.820
what did we lose at this point

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:51.739
I do not know wait no we didn't lose

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:53.299
dead shot it just got purged from the

00:18:51.739 --> 00:18:58.580
the sideboard because we have too many

00:18:53.299 --> 00:19:00.889
items Emperor not a good card at all in

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:03.980
this context and actually wait a minute

00:19:00.889 --> 00:19:08.929
I'm looking at my I'm looking at my HP

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:11.259
I'm not that pleased we maybe want to

00:19:08.929 --> 00:19:11.259
get that

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:23.570
try something like this on for size

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:26.780
money diplopia could be good we really

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:30.260
want a fool card is the big get I

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:33.650
suppose while we actually destroyed

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:35.750
every single one of those shots this

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:38.090
will not make us Guffey but it will give

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:40.700
us a free Steam sale along with the

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:44.059
extra consumables was it worth it I

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:45.440
don't know maybe maybe not I could have

00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:49.130
used that for a deal with the devil for

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:51.740
example instead but it's another bad

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:53.240
trip what are we on anyway Deaf's one

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:55.309
okay just slow your roll because we do

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.630
have a little bit of time left like you

00:19:55.309 --> 00:19:58.520
don't want to just throw this run away

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.960
by being overly aggressive for being

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:03.080
honest we have all the tools we should

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:08.059
need to succeed so we're really just

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:10.220
kind of throwing maybe a little bit of

00:20:08.059 --> 00:20:12.110
our survivability away in the pursuit of

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:13.700
becoming stronger which is not necessary

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:16.520
right now of course you know the more

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:18.440
items to get the merrier but more

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:22.220
concerned about making sure that we have

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:25.490
the HP necessary to live here I should

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:28.059
look as if you have red chests I would

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:28.059
value them

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:43.030
I've gotten that oh I was gonna say I

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:44.200
have an idea but I'm not sure that idea

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:46.270
is actually good I was gonna say

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:49.900
normally we want to teleport into the

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:50.590
boss fight what if we teleported out of

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.179
the boss fight

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:57.460
we still have Deadshot damage still

00:20:52.179 --> 00:20:59.500
looks good sadly I don't think I can

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:02.140
take it you know I would love to get

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:03.610
mom's knife again but I was like we

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.870
could teleport out of the boss fight but

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:08.380
then we miss out on the chance to get

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:10.420
all these lovely items you know so drop

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:12.580
addicted and take ace of clubs you say

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:15.130
some clubs to get a bomb wow what an

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:16.990
incredible hall then we use this and we

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:20.679
go here and we blow this guy up and

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:24.760
hopefully by the spirit are beautiful

00:21:20.679 --> 00:21:27.640
and we can sort of see where the boss is

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:29.320
or sorry where the exit is likely to be

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.570
remember these floors are liable to be

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:33.640
shorter so I feel like we're I'm not

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:34.840
gonna gloss over it we're pretty you

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.270
know lucky on this run

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.650
to start with mom's knife and at least

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:41.710
carry it for a few floors is pretty

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:44.049
amazing for us and I think I complained

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:47.110
about getting a bad draw it a lot of the

00:21:44.049 --> 00:21:49.000
more difficult challenges this one it

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.440
can be a difficult challenge I know this

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.870
one could be a little cheesy depending

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:55.360
on you know how the run goes but in our

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:56.860
case we got super lucky you know we we

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.030
got a great run and we're able to carry

00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:00.970
it here and I'm pretty sure we're gonna

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:04.030
get the win as a result we lost HP I

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:06.660
think so we must have no we lost

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:06.660
Deadshot

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:17.850
yeah absolutely not

00:22:15.289 --> 00:22:19.710
yeah we lost Deadshot so our damage is

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:22.409
starting to tank well it serves us right

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:25.169
for getting a little cocky right we

00:22:22.409 --> 00:22:27.240
shouldn't be talking as if this run is a

00:22:25.169 --> 00:22:28.799
guarantee we are on the caves one which

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.000
means after this Thank You infamy

00:22:28.799 --> 00:22:37.470
which means after this we really only

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:40.710
have the basement left and even seven

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:45.480
damage or The Fool is so good even seven

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:47.580
damage on the basement is like more than

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:51.270
you need we're still at seven

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:52.230
we still have acid baby I don't know

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:54.630
what we've lost here we still have

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:57.169
infamy we still have a shame there's not

00:22:54.630 --> 00:23:00.150
that much more they can take from us a

00:22:57.169 --> 00:23:01.919
lot of the stuff did at this point makes

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:08.610
us good makes us good in composite as

00:23:01.919 --> 00:23:11.640
opposed to all at once why not and in

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:14.450
fact let's let's get absolutely idiotic

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.450
with this

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:32.450
this could end in despair but I like

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:36.770
that idea okay good then fool cards the

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:39.220
fool card takes us to the spawn room got

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:45.470
a look right we go up to the next floor

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:47.420
hello our damage is 14 we're fighting

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:48.950
the same boss for whatever reason I'm

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.630
not gonna ask questions they're gonna

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:52.010
say no deal with the devil for you and

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:58.610
I'm gonna say you know what deal with

00:23:52.010 --> 00:24:06.290
the devil for me we could become guppy

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:09.170
why not dude so pretty much at this

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:10.430
point we are gonna win I focused a

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:12.290
little bit more than maybe I would have

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:13.790
liked on this episode we had a couple of

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:16.280
song parodies though so I had to forgive

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:20.870
myself the big deal is just get

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:22.460
ourselves out of here and put one of it

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:24.170
probably one of the two more difficult

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:26.000
challenges from after birth plus in the

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:28.910
books here the other one being ultra

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.700
hard which is just like annoying this

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:34.160
one we knocked out Laz bleeds more

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.970
probably borderline worthless but for

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.320
now thanks for watching hope you guys
