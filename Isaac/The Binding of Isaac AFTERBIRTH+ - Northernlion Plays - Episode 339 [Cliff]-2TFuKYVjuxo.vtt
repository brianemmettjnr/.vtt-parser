00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.299
hey everybody welcome back to Northland

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.770
lions unstoppable brimstone menagerie

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.660
the binding of issac afterbirth plus we

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:18.810
can't stop getting brimstone is so

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:20.520
problem 6 B K P h2 to J I thought we had

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.720
lost the hut on the right side of the

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.170
screen but we actually just have my

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.689
shadow which completely blends in

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.390
damages great rate of fire is actually

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:32.489
excellent the only real problem is our

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.460
HP but this is a really really good

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.540
start we continue to basically get what

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.500
I would describe as squander Abul stars

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.480
there's two different kinds of on

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.210
squander Abel starts starts that are so

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.340
good that you can't conceive pardon me

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.320
shots or starts that are so good that

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.500
was gross that you can't conceivable

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.360
loss and then starts that are so bad

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.559
that you can't conceive of calling it

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.899
squandered because there's nothing to

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.690
squander in the first place but this is

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.080
a squander will start to lose this would

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.240
be to lose something important so it's

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.710
up to us to hold it together here but it

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.420
seems relatively easy especially the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.040
sixth sense I will use a Kiki gives the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.390
shop access shop access gives us a

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.560
spirit heart probably if we don't get

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.880
one through other means you know I don't

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.580
know why she swallowed the fly I guess

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.500
she'll die it's all a chain of events

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.479
got a bomb which we have to go back for

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.369
we also start with in my opinion one of

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.780
the more interesting space bar items

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.600
added to the game recently and that's a

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.420
dull razor dull razors got a myriad of

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.619
uses you know anything that IV bag can

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.659
do except give you the money in the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.170
first place and I guess trigger bloody

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.880
lust this can do as well which I mean to

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.710
say is basically an opportunity for us

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.360
to pay half price to go into the cursed

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:55.829
room just by using dull razor on the way

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:57.390
in let's go bomb the boss one of the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.579
rare blank the blanks that isn't

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.840
associated with the troublesome college

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.479
initiation process

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.829
I suppose salt the snail maybe is fine

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.540
as well It's Always Sunny in

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.039
Philadelphia you know I'm not really

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.920
familiar with that side of things I was

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.180
always raised I don't know where I was

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.530
going to go with that I was always

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.360
raised sort of comment you

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.640
see why that doesn't make sense but you

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.330
know I was raised on media that was like

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.530
first year at college fraternity you're

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.520
going to take off your pants people are

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.140
going to hit you on the bum with a

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.180
paddle then I get to my school and

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.790
fraternities are outlawed probably for

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.150
that exact reason it was nice to be

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.830
honest with you like to not have to deal

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.500
with fraternities I suppose didn't

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.860
inhibit social life of the school you

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.769
know my my alma mater probably the most

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.540
famous event added within the last ten

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.220
years did well last fifteen years I

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.959
guess at this point is that a the

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.459
homecoming party a bunch of people

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.150
flipped over a car and then lit it on

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.459
fire

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.420
I know amateurs in some parts of the

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:04.910
world but for Canada that's Coneheads

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:08.550
all right that's a little serious so

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.590
nothing well you're just going to bounce

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.280
although the secret room is probably up

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.110
here yeah you know I have prepared for

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.670
fraternity life and by prepared I mean I

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:24.390
did absolutely nothing whatsoever to

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:25.739
prepare for it then it didn't exist not

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.380
that I feel ripped off so we can't go

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.850
into our shop without using a key but I

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.880
don't want to use a key because we could

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.380
use the money that we have right now if

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.820
we don't spend it on the shop and we

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.739
don't need it cuz we got HP anyway but

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.510
we can take the money that we have right

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.459
now don't spend it on the shop instead

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.579
spend it on a chance to go to the arcade

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.290
or hold it for a chance to mature into a

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:51.120
chance to make the arcade work for us

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:53.220
you get the idea at this point basically

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.709
I want to knock aid and without dull

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.000
razor doing anything else for us at all

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:02.670
it makes sense to use this as a way to

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.890
as a way to get a little bit more free

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.380
money out of the donation out of the

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.950
blood bank if it exists what cheers is

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.239
also like really good it's a tough call

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.280
we're spoiled for choice honestly that's

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.620
why it's a squander we'll run you might

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.350
say you know NL where you at that party

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.959
where the car flipped over no not

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.700
necessarily just because I'm a good boy

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.060
but at the same time

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.520
I was also in twelfth grade I wasn't

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.640
about to be like hey mom can I go to the

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.560
University party promise we won't flip

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.100
over a car and light it on fire because

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.960
that would have been a lie I suppose I

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:44.760
would have been guilty by association no

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:47.040
matter what so I was not at that one but

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.520
I was at the next probably like the next

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.680
three I guess at which point nobody

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.780
flipped over cars but instead you go hey

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.220
you guys excited to go down an Aberdeen

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.770
Street and then we went down to Aberdeen

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.870
Street and went it's really crowded here

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.500
and there's broken glass everywhere I

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.060
don't see the appeal I didn't see the

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.160
appeal at the time either but I still

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.900
went it was it was to be seen it's a

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.900
provocative it gets the people going

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.460
alright get cranked down little horn

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:20.280
this strange expression but that's fine

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:25.590
I invented it I think oh we don't want

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:27.360
that I'm sure I don't I don't like that

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.920
item it's just not good enough to be

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.420
excited about at least but I will go

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.770
back for it and of course take it now

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.750
because I didn't think they'd keep the

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.460
door open for me feel like those doors

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.980
have been staying open a lot more often

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:42.960
recently which is honestly good news for

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:44.220
me often times we kind of botch our deal

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.470
with the devil plain so for that to work

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.200
is good but I don't know if having a

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:52.140
random familiar that tends to be decent

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.850
is worth the it's like a months of

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.890
passive monster man well basically I

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.340
don't know if that's worth the worth the

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.340
squeeze

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:07.500
so wow you don't get much luckier than

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.440
that so I'm just going to take that as

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.860
the universe being like good job son you

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.780
know what thank you I appreciate it

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:19.290
two extra keys because we should just

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.970
crank on those go in here might be able

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.800
to get enough money to buy something but

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.110
we don't want any of this junk get out

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.870
of here get the trash out of here we're

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.090
set dude this is like a really really

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:32.820
good run and you know what dull razor

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.530
justified its existence the shears is

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.500
also lovely I don't know why I said that

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:40.320
with such a saliva

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.690
tone which is not a word probably but

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.980
you know it lets to decide what a word

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:49.140
is William Shakespeare I'm trying to

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.880
keep politics out of it I apologize but

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.400
William Shakespeare shouldn't get to

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.790
decide on a word if I say saliva and you

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:59.010
just heard me go Shakespeare you know

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:02.520
what that word means that word is made

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:08.370
we all agree upon the meaning of the

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:09.840
word additive dictionary not just the

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.640
urban dictionary but the rural

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:16.980
dictionary as well both kinds of

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:19.530
dictionaries dull razor it might seem

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:23.520
like I mean and right now to be fair we

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:24.810
are in that situation but it might seem

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.380
like this is an item it's hard to get

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:31.169
the to really synergize there's actually

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:35.130
so many items in this game that give you

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:39.870
a benefit upon being hit all we need to

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:41.430
do is find some of them even just by

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.710
itself if you think you're going to take

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:45.000
damage just pop dull razor and all of a

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.200
sudden you can't take damage because

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.020
you're in your period of invincibility

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.370
but I mean we have the shade so I guess

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.620
we really should be popping this like

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:54.330
once every two rooms just to make

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:58.260
another shade but no Anna I don't think

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:59.460
if we I don't think we get a shade with

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.790
dull razor which is actually

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:08.970
disappointing throw in a little bit of

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:11.970
HP away for no reason here though no we

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:13.350
totally do disregard or maybe we get a

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:16.020
chance to I don't know it doesn't matter

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:17.190
it's worth once every two of two rooms

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.650
trying to spawn one because right now

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:20.690
we're not doing anything else with it

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:23.700
you can be use it as kind of like a

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:27.120
ghetto how to jump but how to jump as no

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:30.000
charge which is why it's a little bit of

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.190
a well a lot of a better option if

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.659
you're just going for as much

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:42.060
invincibility as possible okay bomb bag

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:44.219
is basically not good for our exact

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:46.830
purposes right now but I also cannot

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:48.959
complain we're about two HP upgrades

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.250
away from just kicking the crap out of

00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:53.899
the

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:56.120
so I don't perceive bad things happening

00:08:53.899 --> 00:08:58.939
in our future here this could be good it

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:06.379
could also be very basically like

00:08:58.939 --> 00:09:11.810
completely neutral I suppose this is the

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:15.529
weakest dull razor synergy but at least

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:17.600
it's something because the shade is even

00:09:15.529 --> 00:09:19.550
worse when it's just by its lonesome and

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.949
I recognize that this is not the most

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:23.629
you know incredible proof of concept for

00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:27.110
dull razor but you've seen dull razor

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:29.600
pop off before dull razor turns varicose

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:38.230
veins from like an also-ran into just a

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:42.860
wonderful choice slices and dices makes

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:44.689
julienne fries I always thought as a kid

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.040
yeah this expression I don't think it's

00:09:44.689 --> 00:09:47.569
used as much anymore it must have been

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.490
like a cultural reference to something

00:09:47.569 --> 00:09:52.399
that was that happen when I was younger

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:54.319
but it always when they're making fun of

00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:56.569
infomercials they say it slices it dices

00:09:54.319 --> 00:09:58.610
it even makes julienne fries I always

00:09:56.569 --> 00:10:01.009
thought they said julienne fries and I

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:04.309
was like who is this julian fries is it

00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:06.740
the inventor of the french fry because i

00:10:04.309 --> 00:10:08.449
would love to meet this man and shake

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:14.059
his hand for creating one of my favorite

00:10:08.449 --> 00:10:17.420
foods could be worse it could be a slice

00:10:14.059 --> 00:10:19.339
of the dices it makes julienne fry yeah

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:23.329
oh jeez I don't know about that third

00:10:19.339 --> 00:10:24.740
one slicing and dicing chilling in swill

00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:26.269
and relaxing all cool shootin some

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.009
b-ball outside of the school I don't

00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:31.819
think they were swilling I think his

00:10:28.009 --> 00:10:33.350
name is will okay we're going to buy a

00:10:31.819 --> 00:10:38.059
spirit art everything else is kind of

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:41.180
junk in here so surprisingly dangerous

00:10:38.059 --> 00:10:43.819
situation at least from our HP

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:47.980
standpoint but I do have to recognize my

00:10:43.819 --> 00:10:50.540
own role in that taking a lot of damage

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:52.790
throwing away some spirit hearts we had

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:56.629
no reason to lose I will also say though

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:58.220
we I'm going to act like there's no

00:10:56.629 --> 00:11:01.870
benefit to this for us but we didn't

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:03.100
have to take both deals with the devil

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:08.740
neither deal with the devil gave us

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:11.440
damage upgrade so it's not like they

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:13.750
were must takes I really took them and

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:17.320
they could be mistakes instead of must

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:18.880
takes clothes ok three bombs plenty of

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.200
consumables have them into our item room

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.860
yet on this floor lots of room for

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:25.480
improvement

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:37.120
throw some bombs down it's like a great

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:39.250
one-two punch right there so fast come

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:42.490
on give me an undeserved deal with the

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:43.740
devil I'll even take Krampus didn't beat

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:47.620
the odds that's fine

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:49.029
again like we're very lucky the thing

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.370
with having a good start is that a good

00:11:49.029 --> 00:11:53.440
start doesn't necessarily guarantee a

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:55.240
good run what it does mean is that no

00:11:53.440 --> 00:12:01.600
matter what even if you have a couple of

00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:03.370
bad floors you're good cool it's a

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.800
little close there it's like eating a

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:07.870
good breakfast even the good breakfast

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.490
doesn't guarantee your day is going to

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:11.200
go well but what it does mean is that

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.610
you know if you got important things

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.350
that work that keep you from even lunch

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:18.279
we have into our item removes Bambang

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:19.810
and if you've got a you know important

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:21.790
work stuff that came up out of nowhere

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:23.350
you got to skip lunch you're not going

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:27.279
to be as hungry you know that's why I

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:30.520
wanna NL's travel rules and I'm it

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:35.740
sounds so stupid but so many people in

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:37.660
this career make like I'm not firing

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.589
shots they make bad choices with respect

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.089
to their health and I'm not talking

00:12:38.589 --> 00:12:41.890
about like you know ate too many

00:12:40.089 --> 00:12:43.510
hamburgers I eat too many hamburgers

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:47.920
I respect the hamburger poisoning is a

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:50.589
noble way to go what I mean instead

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.839
rather is like you know you got to drink

00:12:50.589 --> 00:12:54.790
some water you got to eat some food

00:12:52.839 --> 00:12:56.920
that's more of what I'm concerned about

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:58.779
so many people when they travel don't

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:02.260
follow NL's travel rules which are very

00:12:58.779 --> 00:13:04.779
very simple anytime is the three rules

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.880
basically but basically two and one is a

00:13:04.779 --> 00:13:07.959
sub rule anytime you get the chance to

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.240
go to the bathroom you go to the

00:13:07.959 --> 00:13:13.370
bathroom if you're out and one of your

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:15.350
friends has to go to the bathroom

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:19.040
don't let them just go in by themselves

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:20.510
you go take a pee as well it minimizes

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.710
the chance that any of you are going to

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:23.120
get stuck in a position where you

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:24.800
urgently have to go to the bathroom to

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.150
the point of affecting your plans if

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:29.120
you're already stopping and send one

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:31.010
person to the bathroom everybody that

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.600
has even an inkling that they could have

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:34.850
to go to the bathroom in the future

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:37.550
should go to the bathroom it's just a

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:39.500
sensible move you know know your own

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:40.760
body but at the same time recognize if

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.960
it's been like eight hours since you

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:44.210
urinated and you're like well I don't

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.440
have to go just go you're gonna have to

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:47.360
be what do you think your kidneys

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:51.110
stopped working just go to the bathroom

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:52.670
you weirdo and then the second thing is

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:55.070
whenever you get a chance to eat or

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:56.660
drink we've taken out you take them up

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:59.420
on that offer and the reasoning is

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:02.060
exactly the same with an added benefit

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:03.950
of people are almost always more

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:07.339
pleasant to be around when they're not

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:10.190
starving so it's good for everybody's

00:14:07.339 --> 00:14:12.770
mood I think a lot of situations would

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:14.240
resolve themselves if you you know two

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.320
people had like a fight and they said

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.870
okay we're going to continue this fight

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.339
after we eat a sandwich you go eat the

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:21.140
sandwich you come back are you as mad

00:14:19.339 --> 00:14:22.400
probably not unless you just say maybe

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:24.500
you're fighting over dinner and it's

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:27.070
over simplified oversimplification here

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:30.320
you know you'd be amazed how many people

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:32.240
don't do that I've been to more

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.800
conventions than I should have gone to

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.210
basically at this point I've gotten more

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.330
conventions of the average human being

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:40.070
goes to in like six lifetimes did that

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:42.400
trip not hurt us or did it take away a

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:45.830
spirit heart I didn't even know existed

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:48.020
you got it like drink water you're at

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:51.620
dinner drink like four lines of water

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:53.060
you're going to thank yourself later go

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.170
to the bathroom at the restaurant unless

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.540
you want to go to the bathroom or a

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:58.430
convention center but anyway I forgot

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.170
why I even got on this topic

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:02.180
oh it's yep because this one i NL z'

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:03.860
rules a traveler they've served me very

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.450
well I'm not going to say I never find

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:08.810
myself in positions where I'm out not

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:10.100
hungry or thirsty or you know got to go

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:11.600
to the bathroom when I travel but

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:16.580
they're minimized as a result of these

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:19.250
precautions I don't like the coupon

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:21.930
honestly I don't I think it gets it's

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:26.160
overrated in my opinion

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:28.620
so many streamers like they all you know

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:32.130
like Rob saying that he doesn't have

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:35.550
time to defecate blew me away that's a

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:37.950
non-negotiable thing he's he's got this

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:39.570
weird thing where like I'm a long pooper

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:41.400
and I understand it more than most but

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:44.190
he's like I could take like a half hour

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.960
to a 45 minute poop and I don't have a

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:46.980
half hour to 45 minutes to spare today

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:50.550
so I guess I won't poop

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:52.830
that's absurd make the time move

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:54.570
something around to defecate or change

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:57.240
your habits because like that can only

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:59.700
be harmful and like for a while Austin

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:04.770
and maybe even still you know we have

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:07.529
recording sessions sometimes at like 7

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:09.240
p.m. my time which is 8 B 8 p.m. his

00:16:07.529 --> 00:16:11.640
times they're having a lot less reason

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:17.029
to discredit you know be the change you

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:17.029
want to see in the world excuse me and

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.670
you know he started streaming it like

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.440
noon his time or something like that

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:24.360
finishes the stream and then comes on

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:26.430
the to do the recording sessions with us

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:28.140
and then he's like I am really hungry

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:30.120
you know I will achieve today nothing

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:33.209
not you've been up for nine hours you

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:34.110
haven't eaten any food you got a nip

00:16:33.209 --> 00:16:36.690
that in the bud

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:38.190
I know few of you out there watching

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:40.770
this because this is a very common

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:42.660
archetype like in high school and I did

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:44.640
it in university as well I'll admit but

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.990
you know they'd be like yeah I don't eat

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.910
breakfast so I basically wake up at like

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:50.430
6:30 a.m. and wait till lunch and then I

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:52.140
eat what's wrong with that look if you

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:53.700
if you're actually physically ill when

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:55.500
you eat in the morning I understand a

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.450
lot of people feel that same way I'm the

00:16:55.500 --> 00:17:00.810
exact opposite I wake up with a burning

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:02.220
hunger like every single morning I love

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:05.360
it because breakfast is right around

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:07.949
freaking corner man just go pick it up

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:10.050
best meal of the day but you're going

00:17:07.949 --> 00:17:11.400
you know I agree with Austin no the

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:13.640
thing is though just because you've

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:16.439
trained yourself to believe that that's

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:18.120
like you can survive doing that doesn't

00:17:16.439 --> 00:17:21.449
mean it's the ideal way to do it dude

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:24.150
wake up have a glass of water you know

00:17:21.449 --> 00:17:25.980
eat a banana or something at least and

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:27.540
then come back and tell me that you

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:30.030
don't feel better we perform this

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:32.850
experiment on the show before I had this

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:34.460
anecdote or this exact same tangential

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:36.470
piece of advice and

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:38.060
then I was like just go eat breakfast

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:39.830
for a week if you don't normally eat it

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:41.930
and see how you feel like noon every

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:43.910
single day I got a lot of tweets from

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:45.440
people that were like who would have

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:50.060
thought I feel better after eating

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:53.570
breakfast it's important and you might

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:55.880
say like who doesn't know this that's I

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:57.230
know that's the thing is that's why I'm

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.730
surprised I gotta bring it up in the

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:01.610
first place you know there's a lot of

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:03.230
pressure on on the Twitter side of

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:05.390
things especially like always be on

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:07.190
never take breaks and I understand that

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:12.680
but at the same time you've got to eat

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:14.990
man what good is what good is having a

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:16.430
career streaming if you can't have a

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:18.710
bean burrito

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:22.130
you know 15-minute bean burrito break at

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:24.380
times but anyway I'm not a I'm not a

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:27.170
paragon of Health admittedly what I am

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:31.070
is maybe a little older than the average

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:33.170
streamer just just I've matured into an

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:35.000
old man of streaming I guess by virtue

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:37.340
of still being around at this point but

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.920
this guy I'm is coming from a place of

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:43.760
love you gotta eat why be stubborn if

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:45.890
you pride worth discomfort sometimes

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.720
although 12 hours you know from waking

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:51.230
up until the first meal it's staying

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:52.910
stood never a time where I'm like yeah

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:55.910
I'm glad I'm fasting right now I

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:57.410
apologize this episode might be like mid

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.580
Ramadan or something like that and

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:01.120
you're like please stop talking about

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:03.980
fasting I've been doing it for her you

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:06.830
know two weeks at this point or a month

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:10.910
at this point so you know more power to

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:12.110
you I did I did a fundraiser you know

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:13.580
you might not know this but in some

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:15.140
Canadian provinces and I don't know

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:16.070
other parts of the world perhaps in

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:17.600
order to get your high school diploma

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:20.000
you have to do 40 hours of community

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.410
service which in hindsight doesn't seem

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.620
like that much but at the time was like

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:26.360
I could get in a car accident and get

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:29.720
zero community service potentially but

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:31.970
you know it's good it's good to foster

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:33.650
some community involvement slash

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:36.710
resentment because you're forced into it

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:39.050
but anyway the point is I got super

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:41.360
lucky and before they went wait a minute

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:43.010
this is not that much effort there was a

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:46.010
little fundraiser called the 30 hour

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:47.240
famine which was to you know raise funds

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:50.480
to help a

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:53.840
be a global hunger so what you did is

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.740
you stayed overnight at the school let

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.110
me just see what this deal with the

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:59.059
devil contains good lord you stayed

00:19:57.110 --> 00:20:01.160
overnight in the school and you didn't

00:19:59.059 --> 00:20:04.360
eat for 30 hours so you know starting

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:06.890
from like lunchtime on the Friday and

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:09.580
going until like 6:00 p.m. on the

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:12.020
Saturday yeah of course we'll take that

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:16.309
dude dull razor gives us the ability to

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:18.230
actually use these sort of worth it you

00:20:16.309 --> 00:20:21.920
didn't need anything so we set up like

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:24.830
you know VCRs and we watched r-rated

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:27.230
movies and this was the mid-2000s which

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:29.120
at the time seemed like you know

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:30.860
everybody's so concerned about safety

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.570
and now people are probably like the mid

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:36.500
2000 you could do whatever you wanted

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:38.570
relative to now but anyway played halo

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.800
to land parties and stuff like that and

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:42.290
we got thirty hours of community service

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:45.440
for it and it wasn't that bad you know

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:46.610
just to go without food for 30 hours and

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.470
put yourself in the shoes of other

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:50.960
people you know for whom that's not an

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:54.590
option and instead you know that's just

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:56.679
the normal way of life it's very sad but

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:59.690
also at the same time it allows you to

00:20:56.679 --> 00:21:02.030
it makes it more real I suppose without

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:04.850
putting you on the same level of having

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:08.990
suffered of course but I recognize that

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:10.850
it's not a torture to go thirty hours

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:12.080
without food once enough so I understand

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:13.580
you know you're like I can go without

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:16.370
breakfast every single day is people

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:18.140
around the world do it but you know when

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:23.000
they brought out the pizzas at the end

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:26.480
of the 30-hour famine it was about to be

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:29.420
a freakin riot so don't tell me that the

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:30.950
food is no value man anyway the other

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:35.390
side of that story that I didn't quite

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:39.110
finish was I and everybody did this but

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:40.790
basically like I got thirty hours of

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:43.490
volunteering or community service for

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:46.280
doing the 30 hour famine so essentially

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:47.480
I got three-quarters of my community

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.550
service for participating in a

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:51.800
fundraiser in which I basically just did

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:54.020
not eat for thirty hours which was very

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:56.120
easy relative to doing any actual work

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:59.990
and then I got like 10 hours once

00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:00.800
because I went to my aunt's office which

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:03.230
was a non-pro

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:05.930
and organization and then she was like

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:06.890
hey can you like set up this router like

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:08.180
okay there you go

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:09.890
she was like hey can you set up this

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:12.170
printer and I was like okay there you go

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:13.700
she's like well you know you're supposed

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:15.410
to be here for like another eight hours

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:17.410
but there's not that much to do but

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:21.680
there is like a couch so if you want to

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:23.660
take a nap go ahead and that's exactly

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:26.060
how that went down and then I just

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:30.800
signed it for ten hours I was there for

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:33.350
ten hours not lying to you and you know

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:35.660
what honestly that's how some of my jobs

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:38.030
at offices had gone after that point as

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:39.710
well you'd be like only Ryan welcome to

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:42.080
the office um okay here's something

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:43.700
here's a little task for you let me know

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:46.000
when you get that done all right it's

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:48.470
done or is the test number two for you

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.820
okay oh that's done well you see the way

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:52.040
things actually work is you're supposed

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:54.260
to take as long as is possible without

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:56.240
raising suspicion when you do a task and

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:59.000
as a result you get less work assigned

00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.860
to you so you can stop bothering me and

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.300
instead just fart around at your desk

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:03.590
for like another two and a half hours

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.000
before you ask for another assignment

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:08.780
that be sweet because I got important

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.370
work to do okay get out of my office so

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:16.370
in that way it was very representative

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:18.790
of adult life oh dude that's a bummer

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:21.500
this run is it's come off the rails

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:22.850
first off we lost the value of Maggie's

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:26.210
fate there which makes me a very sad

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:30.400
individual but we got two HP and our

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:30.400
stats are basically where they were ad

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:38.530
at the start of this run that's why I

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:42.200
say like that's why I mean what you say

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:47.690
that we don't have a guaranteed win we

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:49.880
do have tolerance for having a couple of

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:51.410
floors of garbage and and really we have

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.570
had a couple of fours of garbage we only

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:56.930
had a 33% devil deal chance anyway so to

00:23:53.570 --> 00:24:00.410
go from a 33% well go from a 33% chance

00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:02.820
to a 9% chance is not that bad it's bad

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:05.490
it's worse

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:11.639
but it's it's not like we went from a

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:15.330
hundred to 230 I suppose relatively it's

00:24:11.639 --> 00:24:18.450
the same but I don't know if relative

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:23.220
matters that much in this situation okay

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:29.820
um as soon as you drop the Book of

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:32.130
Shadows you're going to lose the effect

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:37.080
of The Book of Shadows so I think you

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:42.990
dull razor Book of Shadows Book of

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:45.690
Shadows no you don't lose it okay so we

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:46.470
don't need to get all of them we just

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:49.860
wanted to get the bookworm

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:52.470
transformation and now we have a satanic

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:53.879
Bible and you know I would love to feel

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:55.470
like I didn't have to take Satanic Bible

00:24:53.879 --> 00:24:57.990
and continue with the dull razor which

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:59.639
was still not enabled but it was

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:01.679
eventually going to get there probably

00:24:59.639 --> 00:25:04.080
just because of the sheer number of

00:25:01.679 --> 00:25:08.399
items that can synergize with it

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:10.669
oh can synergize my favorites MMA

00:25:08.399 --> 00:25:10.669
fighter

00:25:14.739 --> 00:25:20.570
but we have to go Satanic Bible I think

00:25:18.369 --> 00:25:22.729
that's just an insult

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:25.339
give me the quarter when I have 99 cents

00:25:22.729 --> 00:25:26.509
I mean I didn't have to pick it up it

00:25:25.339 --> 00:25:28.969
could have gone to the shop and spend

00:25:26.509 --> 00:25:31.429
some money but it's very unlikely to

00:25:28.969 --> 00:25:37.849
matter like let's be honest with one

00:25:31.429 --> 00:25:40.159
another here that misplayed 25 cents

00:25:37.849 --> 00:25:42.489
with two shops remaining one of which

00:25:40.159 --> 00:25:46.669
will almost certainly have greed is not

00:25:42.489 --> 00:25:50.329
going to be the winner losing factor

00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:58.219
here I think certainly we want this we

00:25:50.329 --> 00:26:02.839
don't want little baggy we've already

00:25:58.219 --> 00:26:04.509
got the faith of Maggie nice to try 48

00:26:02.839 --> 00:26:07.009
hour energy dude okay so apparently

00:26:04.509 --> 00:26:08.719
we're actually just going to defensively

00:26:07.009 --> 00:26:10.069
ball out of control despite the fact

00:26:08.719 --> 00:26:11.869
that we started this run looking like an

00:26:10.069 --> 00:26:13.249
offensive powerhouse and also looking

00:26:11.869 --> 00:26:15.229
like a fool with a pants on the ground

00:26:13.249 --> 00:26:17.329
got your hat turned sideways something

00:26:15.229 --> 00:26:23.289
something and good luck go from with

00:26:17.329 --> 00:26:27.379
your plants on the ground well we have a

00:26:23.289 --> 00:26:37.899
one in eleven chance of making the devil

00:26:27.379 --> 00:26:37.899
deal pop it would be nice the rough one

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:48.630
we should have advertised sister vids on

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:53.190
this one honestly it's a much more

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:55.350
dominant factor of this fight you're

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:58.250
going to shoot coward you're only going

00:26:55.350 --> 00:27:02.309
to kill a man che guevara also

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:12.390
northernlion Homer Simpson smiling

00:27:02.309 --> 00:27:13.980
politely it's actually very easy no deal

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:16.230
with the devil a tears upgrade that

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:18.000
honestly is extremely welcome to this

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:19.770
point and then more spirit hearts that

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.740
we could possibly desire but this run is

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:24.450
slowed down absurdly like we started

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.950
with such a leg up on a chance to get

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:28.559
the boss rush and now we find ourselves

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:30.240
like it's not going to happen obviously

00:27:28.559 --> 00:27:31.830
unless we get mono mega but if we get

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.750
mama mega we can also choose our way out

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:36.540
of boss rush which is what we would want

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:39.990
to do because it would take us 230,000

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:42.380
years to actually get through it we're a

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:46.410
happier with Maggie's faith for now

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:53.600
there's a very silly move to try to make

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:53.600
that dodge work but it did work

00:27:53.890 --> 00:28:00.170
I'm not really like bitter about this

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:03.290
run I'm just surprised at how things

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:04.670
have turned out it's like the kids are

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:06.080
all right by the offspring sort of

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:10.190
situation although I'm pretty sure the

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:11.630
message of that song that things didn't

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:16.340
turn out all right he's like the kids

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:17.900
aren't all right is the thing I always

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:22.070
like to listen to that song and then

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:25.820
after that I listen to surrender by

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:28.670
cheap trick mummies I'll ride daddy's

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:31.240
I'll rack they just look a little weird

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:34.760
and it's like the kids aren't all right

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:37.070
but mommy and daddy are killing it and

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:41.600
you know what they deserve to it worked

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:51.380
for it man kind of tempted to take one

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:52.490
of the candles but this is working it

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:56.360
was really nice

00:28:52.490 --> 00:29:02.750
no no thank you on that one but Stars

00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:05.810
carded up the finger is more interesting

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:07.280
I'll meet you 50-50 on that one and we

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:08.960
slightly improved our damage but the

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:12.080
taro cloth is basically the big get

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:13.430
there and being able to choose items

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.830
from the bossfight end from our last

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:17.390
item room I mean seven cents basically

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:19.010
bought us a choice on that item room I

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:20.840
think that's a pretty okay deal

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:25.910
we're going to go back for the eihwaz

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:27.410
room I don't really know what I expect

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:31.190
to get out of that I don't want to skip

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:32.810
a floor it's a double chance of the

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:36.400
black market when we got HP to burn

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:36.400
thanks to Maggie's faith is pretty solid

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:45.800
so weird run man today on the northern

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:50.230
lions insights while playing The Binding

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:50.230
of Isaac eating food is good for you

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:55.180
followed by well what a weird run

00:29:55.410 --> 00:30:02.470
really have the ability to do the mob

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:04.420
trap room we might just go like try to

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:06.070
get a little bit of pace back underneath

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:07.600
this run what are we looking for an

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:12.280
arcade you don't want to play it because

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:14.380
of the eternal art situation I guess

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:18.640
like a curse room could be good but I

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:19.900
think this is still like probably our

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.190
preferred way to go here so we know

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.450
we're going to get the polaroid a deal

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:25.030
with the devil would be so nice to just

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:26.620
give us some DPS I recognize that we got

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:30.640
champion belt but you can't build a

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:33.400
winning run on champion belt alone you

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:35.410
know champion belt lump of coal and a

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:39.160
good start it carries you for a while

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:41.080
but you know then little Kimmi won't in

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:45.970
the middle of the night that don't

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:50.020
impress me much so you got DPS but do

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:53.260
you get the touch now we did get a deal

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:56.650
I mean ever closer to eventually making

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:58.720
guffy pops essentially we don't need the

00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:04.060
money because we actually cannot make

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:07.060
the hush fight think I've got all these

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:08.800
you know mapping tools I don't know what

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:11.230
a Waze did there with taro cloth but it

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:18.420
did give me a crawl space dude that's

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:20.110
pretty funny let's go oh we broken him I

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:22.360
thought he was just going to keep

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:24.960
ricocheting or Nicola Shang

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:29.560
that's right being the founder and

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:33.010
principal member of the fifth best boy

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:34.570
band from the 1990s Wow late 1990s ago

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:36.340
then we got to start talking about New

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:38.590
Kids on the Block and you know menudo

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:41.040
and that one that Ricky Gervais is was

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:41.040
part of

00:31:50.059 --> 00:31:57.090
swallowed penny is actually more useless

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:59.880
than useless

00:31:57.090 --> 00:32:02.280
it takes away in HP upgrade so there's

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:05.669
like several of HP upgrades potentially

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:07.169
so stay away from that basically that's

00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:12.809
a pretty easy decision to make we've

00:32:07.169 --> 00:32:15.299
chosen not the poison here dude I am

00:32:12.809 --> 00:32:17.130
worried that eventually in the future

00:32:15.299 --> 00:32:20.610
I'm going to make like the world's most

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:22.860
paranoid dad you know how many searches

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:25.230
I have on my phone for like is it okay

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:28.530
for a cat to eat blank because you'd be

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:30.090
surprised like I didn't used to be

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:31.919
paranoid about this kind of stuff but I

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:33.780
bring it up because for you and me where

00:32:31.919 --> 00:32:35.640
I live don't need poison hey should I

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:37.559
eat this plastic bag no you dummies

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:39.840
don't eat the plastic bag don't even

00:32:37.559 --> 00:32:42.630
give me the classic' internets devil's

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:45.240
advocate what if you hit pikas okay what

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:47.280
if you're in the point zero point zero

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:49.559
zero five percent of the population that

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:51.419
is freaking pica yeah okay don't eat the

00:32:49.559 --> 00:32:52.620
plastic bag still if you can help it but

00:32:51.419 --> 00:32:55.070
I understand that there's underlying

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:57.150
issues that make it seem more you know

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:58.710
desirable than it actually is in reality

00:32:57.150 --> 00:33:00.450
I'm just saying you still shouldn't eat

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:02.669
the plastic bag this is against the

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:05.130
point of the conversation cats have no

00:33:02.669 --> 00:33:07.140
idea and you have to appreciate that I

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:08.610
guess from a cat standpoint although

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:11.520
they're incapable of having this thought

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:14.179
consciously they live in an alien

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:17.970
civilization like we are a benevolent

00:33:14.179 --> 00:33:19.950
superior sorry but it's true you ever

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:21.990
seen a cat go to the friggin moon just

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:25.650
throwing that out there that's a very

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:27.419
homo sapien centric look of progress NL

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:29.970
okay look I'm proud of my species

00:33:27.419 --> 00:33:31.830
alright we've done some good stuff and

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:35.700
some just god-awful stuff but you know

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:41.480
some good stuff as well it's not all the

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:43.770
head this will take little even and

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:45.780
we've built all these structures that

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:46.919
are like hey nice planet remember when

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:49.049
you used to jump around in that tree

00:33:46.919 --> 00:33:51.270
well that tree is now a 100 story tie up

00:33:49.049 --> 00:33:52.950
our 100 story high apartment building

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:54.149
but you can live in it and we'll give

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:54.740
you food and water and your limes are

00:33:54.149 --> 00:33:57.500
going to become

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:59.870
Boleyn well don't worry within a few

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:01.820
dozen generation will just breed it so

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:03.320
you like captivity anyway and it'll be a

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:06.020
good relationship for all of us you know

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:09.530
cats sold out and they were smart to do

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:12.530
it because worth you know killing it and

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:15.020
anyway the point is they don't know

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:17.869
what's poison what's not poison my cat

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:21.139
routinely will love we have two cats but

00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:23.990
one in particular Ruka will fight tomo

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:27.080
bite fur off of Tomos body and then eat

00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:30.440
it in some kind of weird display of like

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:32.450
now part of you is inside of me and like

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:36.230
I'm eating your courage or something

00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:39.320
like that it's very primal and then an

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:41.419
hour later you'll just throw up in front

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:43.909
of our bedroom door and the throw up is

00:34:41.419 --> 00:34:47.389
just cat hair thanks a lot for that now

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:50.090
that's like ignoring all the plants that

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:53.740
dude conehead saved me there all the

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:56.030
plants that can see that cats can't eat

00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:58.310
literal garbage that just falls on the

00:34:56.030 --> 00:35:00.440
ground like here's a little short list

00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:03.700
for you garlic and anything in the

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:05.510
garlic family so shallots garlic

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:06.740
obviously I don't know about ginger I

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:07.700
don't think gingers the kind of garlic

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:09.530
you just lump them together cuz they're

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.430
used a lot but they might be better safe

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:15.230
than sorry right

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:16.730
grapes lilies poinsettias you know many

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:18.650
different flowers that you just go to

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:20.420
the you go to the florist and be like

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:22.280
hey give me some pretty flowers oh thank

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:23.810
you here's a lot of money to go home and

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:26.540
you're like oh you just introduced like

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:30.590
an actual weapon of mass destruction to

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:32.000
your to your cat you know coffee that's

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:34.570
the one I got me because I'm making this

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:38.119
cold brew requires you leaving the

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:40.550
coffee grinds out sitting in water and

00:35:38.119 --> 00:35:44.510
now I'm like I got to put this on like a

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:47.380
shelf hidden away because caffeine cats

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:49.940
don't apparently possess the necessary

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:51.619
metabolic pathways to process and so it

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:54.619
kind of builds up as a toxin in their

00:35:51.619 --> 00:35:57.350
blood so now I'm like these are cats I

00:35:54.619 --> 00:35:58.670
love them like they're my child every

00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:01.310
night before I go to bed I do a

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:03.080
once-over the whole apartment and I go

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:07.820
you know it's going to trust me doesn't

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:08.570
take too long we live in Vancouver but

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:10.310
we

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:12.770
like I do it once overnight okay any

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:15.290
like sharp things sticking out anything

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:17.600
they could potentially like choke on and

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:19.070
die because you're like I'm on one hand

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.700
you're like Mother Nature is pretty

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:23.120
smart

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:26.060
you know they've lived for hundreds of

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:27.620
thousands of years in a similar form to

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:29.960
what they're at now they'll probably

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:31.790
handle it and I accept that I do but at

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:33.380
the same time there's like a rash of

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:36.200
like cats falling out of high-rise

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:37.910
windows lately and that reminds you

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:40.130
you're like wait but we've kind of read

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:42.830
them to be a little dumb as well like

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:45.650
they're clever sometimes but they can

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:47.900
still be like you know I'm on a window I

00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:50.780
slipped and now I'm you know fallen

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:51.880
eight stories or something like that not

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:54.350
a good thing

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:56.690
sure they might they might live when

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:57.890
they land but you know injury and trauma

00:36:56.690 --> 00:37:01.100
and then they're lost

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:02.540
etc as you get the idea so they're cats

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.380
so I'll you know I love them like

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:05.120
they're children

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:08.540
well they're not children in the sense

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:11.660
that like it's not quite the same if

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:13.460
your cat eats a chocolate bar as it is

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:17.510
if your kid like swallows a bunch of

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:19.910
Drano so I'm I'm a little in the back of

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:23.270
my head not that it's on the to-do list

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:24.890
for like the next five years but I'm a

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:27.980
little worried that I'm going to be like

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:31.640
the world's most worried dad I like when

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:33.050
the kid becomes 10 15 you know whatever

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:35.270
that I'm gonna go out with my friends

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:36.560
dad okay don't accidentally take that no

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:38.630
please that's the big one

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.770
apart from that you're probably how kids

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:41.300
are the kids will be kids right to

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:46.040
figure it out but when they're like zero

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:48.560
years old I was like just nightmares of

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:51.110
just waking up and you're like oh the

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:54.710
baby got his head stuck in between the

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:56.990
bars of his crib but he's alive but this

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:59.180
image will haunt you forever you know

00:37:56.990 --> 00:38:05.030
that's what I'm that's the kind of stuff

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:07.040
I'm worried about see I think my mom was

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:08.450
actually the opposite to some extent

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:11.510
she's a lot better about it now because

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:14.150
I'm like an adult but when I was when I

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:18.230
was a kid like a young kid my mom was

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:19.790
like play outside go nuts then when I

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:20.850
got older when I got into the teenage

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:24.060
stuff

00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:26.160
she was like a little bit more nervous

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:29.190
which was completely uncalled for

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:31.200
because I was like actually the most

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:35.010
well-liked a cartoonishly well-behaved

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:36.300
teenager you know I'm like a little

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:42.780
hanging out with my friend Michael al

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:44.940
Fox don't do drugs we think we're to do

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:47.160
drugs we're going to play like you know

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:49.110
brute force on the original Xbox it's

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:52.530
flattering that you think I'm going to

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:54.570
his house to do drugs nobody else is in

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:55.370
schools draw on that conclusion and tell

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:57.480
you that much

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:59.130
yeah we're now I'm going to go over to

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:01.890
his house we're gonna work on a report

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:03.740
about impairs law one of Maxwell's

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:05.670
equations that describes the

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:07.740
electromagnet behavior of

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:10.230
electromagnetism but thanks for thinking

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:11.490
we're going to inject some crocodile it

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:16.260
makes us sound a lot cooler than we

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:21.510
actually are I guess society's eyes yeah

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:23.550
definitely like she was more nervous as

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:25.650
as I got older I think I'm going to be

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:27.810
the opposite but who knows man that's

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:30.120
the thing I'm sure you know everybody's

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:31.410
like this is how I'm going to be as a

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:34.200
parent and then you actually have a

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:35.520
child and you go would oh what are these

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:39.030
changes happening to me on a

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:41.490
neurological level right now that's why

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:43.680
I wouldn't deign to know I got roasted

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:47.820
so hard there was an onion article you

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:49.920
know the satire humor publication the

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:54.030
quarterly the periodical from The Onion

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:56.130
News Network it was like 27 year old man

00:39:54.030 --> 00:40:01.080
sage Lee gives advice to 24 year old man

00:39:56.130 --> 00:40:05.880
I was like that's these videos at least

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:07.320
I always go but I'm still a young man

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:10.320
and I don't know what I'm talking about

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:14.070
and it's brazen to give advice regards

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:18.180
what am I getting a hit by dude I don't

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:21.110
understand I'm actually I think the

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:25.200
broken I I don't know what's happening I

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:27.210
think the broken modem causes some shots

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:29.220
to get stuck in the air but they're

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:31.210
sprites glitch out and then I'm like

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:35.470
walking into the shots

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:39.790
I was actually losing it temporarily

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:42.099
there it was nice we got to talk about

00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:45.040
some stuff that was not isaac related

00:40:42.099 --> 00:40:47.230
for like five minutes there because the

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:48.849
run started to pop off now it's in a

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:54.010
dangerous position again but we'll still

00:40:48.849 --> 00:40:56.200
probably be fine i don't know how i lost

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:57.550
so much HP again i think it is an insult

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:59.080
when they give me voi access before the

00:40:57.550 --> 00:41:00.119
chest especially with the arrow rune i'm

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:03.930
not going to do it

00:41:00.119 --> 00:41:06.880
void is not that fun to justify skipping

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:08.970
you know sixteen free items it's not fun

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:12.400
enough to justify skipping four items

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:15.820
please more passives peepers a passive

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:18.099
at before ax is a good passive who use a

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:20.050
properly metal plate i never remember

00:41:18.099 --> 00:41:23.950
what it does euthanasia is good the

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:27.280
relic is great but bombs is fine and

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:30.880
tech x is game winning mom's bra is

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:34.770
useless mostly 2020s lovely x-ray vision

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:37.390
largely irrelevant zodiac ranges from

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:39.520
sort of good to sort of bad anemic it's

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:41.619
irrelevant blank card doesn't matter

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:44.080
obsessed fan mostly for Beelzebub and

00:41:41.619 --> 00:41:46.000
demon baby so in the end I mean turned

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:48.130
out pretty well I can't with good

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.540
conscience say that in the end it

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:52.930
doesn't even matter because in the end

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:54.849
it did matter here we got some very good

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:56.320
stuff as a result of the extra effort we

00:41:54.849 --> 00:41:59.890
put in there so I'm a happy camper we're

00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:01.330
going to just steamroll now I'm not

00:41:59.890 --> 00:42:02.560
salty about the way that the game went

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:05.589
but we're going to come through in the

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:07.550
clutch regardless hello Kate how's it

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:12.920
going

00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:17.660
that is easily doable not a not a

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:23.590
problem whatsoever and in this run right

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:26.320
here approximately 10 to 90 seconds

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:29.990
because this is fallen out of control

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:32.630
it's on a level that mankind is never so

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:35.150
she's left she left in the middle of

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:37.430
that description that's okay we are

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:38.750
going to be done soon what's up with

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:42.080
these restaurants man

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:45.380
8:30 p.m. on a Sunday

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:47.270
my ideal dinner time maybe two hours

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:49.370
from now but there are like only a

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:54.020
clothes spend time with our families

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:57.500
come on dude what about those of us who

00:42:54.020 --> 00:43:01.640
choose to wake up it 11:00 a.m. and then

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:04.870
eat an exceptionally late dinner you

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:08.030
know where's our where's our recognition

00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:09.710
this is inside baseball enough on an

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:12.610
actual level that is not even worth

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:15.650
talking about beyond just the byline but

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:17.510
Vancouver actually does sort of stink

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:21.440
from like an after 10:00 p.m. food

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:23.300
perspective there's a lot of like like

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:25.220
every place closes at 8:00 and I'm not

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:26.600
complaining cuz like you know I've lived

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:28.340
in a small town for a lot of my life I

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:29.480
understand you're like well it's 8 p.m.

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:31.130
should we go out for dinner well there's

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:35.090
only three places in the whole town that

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:37.610
are open Shea McDonald's the maison de

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:40.340
the king of burgers and you know we

00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:42.140
really hurried Pizza Hut might serve us

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:43.880
so I you know I've lived that life but

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:48.080
for a city of three million people is

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:50.420
prising lack of like 24-hour joints of

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:51.170
the food variety anyway hey for now

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:53.030
