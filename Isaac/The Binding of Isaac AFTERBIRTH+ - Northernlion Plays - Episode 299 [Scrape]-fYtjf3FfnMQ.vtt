##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.330
everybody welcome Exeter the lamp

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.000
lighting my together booth plus

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.560
yesterday's daily and you know it wasn't

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.480
a horrible we were four hundred and

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.519
seventy four five point seven four

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.519
percent I was the worst one in like the

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.369
last ten days but it's not a complete

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:20.270
you know botched failure of a run if

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.460
anything I'm I'm gonna take it as a

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.350
warning shot you know I played not my

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.539
style and I was punished for it but

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.010
today's daily is a Maggie run it goes

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.130
all the way to the end the scores on the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.020
front page range from 39,000 to 58,000

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.430
that indicates to me that today's daily

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.050
is probably pretty freakin terrible

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.370
thirty-nine thousand for the thirtieth

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.899
best score on a run oh oh

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.670
we have blank card and High Priestess as

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.180
well I don't know international you know

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.399
foot-fetish day or something like that

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.800
but thirty-nine thousand for a run that

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.710
goes all the way to the end is like a

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.289
terrible sign that's normally you'd be

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.519
looking at like 60s at the top and then

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.080
I don't know maybe like sixty to forty

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.840
nine or something like that I mean we're

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.840
getting a little too into the banal

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.760
minutiae of what's going on there but I

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.850
I'm almost just because of the fact that

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.979
I have also now gotten quake and I drop

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.140
the mom's toenail because I don't know

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.700
if I really want that you cannot drop

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.720
mom's toenail maybe the amps the problem

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.820
right there because I was looking at

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.960
this run and I was like am I losing my

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.670
mind because it feels like this daily

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.009
just by virtue of getting canna

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.049
ninetails right off the bat and starting

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.780
you know High Priestess blank card is a

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.250
decent combo at least especially early

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.689
game where it matters that you killed

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.220
bosses without getting hit because

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.700
you're unlikely to have that many spirit

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.840
hearts like it seemed like there must

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.040
have been some mistake like I was

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.829
looking at the wrong leaderboards or

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.299
something but um perhaps not maybe we

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.189
should have stuck blank card justice on

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.110
a daily but you know I'm going to take

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.240
this I like its ability to kill bosses

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.369
early I feel good about that this is

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.560
probably our secret room just watch out

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.630
you got to like constantly keep on the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.750
move to not get hit this secret room

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.039
seems like it shows up all the time now

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.100
we got to constantly be on the move to

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.300
try not to get hit by

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.530
the foot that's going to come down I

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.260
guess who could have blown up the tinted

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.330
rock as well or instead I should say but

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.610
anyway we're moving on I mean the daily

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.300
it has all the tools right now it is the

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.250
tools of a run that almost became a dog

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.640
there while I was talking as the tools

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.950
of a rougarou it has the tools of a run

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.330
that could pop off but you know

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.640
obviously there's better players than

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.320
myself or at least you know I'm trying

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.090
not to here's the thing whenever you

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.920
insult yourself even implicitly people

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.200
it comes across as fishing for

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.270
compliments right but it's not fishing

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.280
for compliments these there are people

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.000
on the leaderboards that have you know a

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.260
hundred times out of the last 110

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.760
beating me in terms of their score on

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.890
these daily the better players than

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.780
myself that's not an admission of low

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.690
self confidence just knowing where you

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.000
stand you know you know I'm not Pete

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.370
Sampras circa 2003 when it comes to

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.860
Isaac I'm like you know Michael Chang or

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.120
something like that I you know American

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.910
tennis ranking you know top top 70 maybe

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.650
somewhere in there I'm a seventy fifth

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.520
on the leaderboards right now so I can I

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.320
can live with that

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.060
let's just go back and explore a little

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.230
bit here we're not going to get an

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.750
arcade which means we're probably not

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.120
going to be able to go to the boss trap

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.820
room although it looks like this could

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.310
fairly easily be a secret room I can't I

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.170
can't even stress enough to you 2

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.660
minutes 38 seconds of this video when

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.700
all morning all afternoon those skype

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.650
messages 2 minutes 30 seconds into the

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:47.210
Isaac video it's time it's time for some

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:51.590
impromptu Skype conversations like our

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:55.550
days are exactly offset enough that that

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.350
can happen I really thought I could make

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.820
it out of there I guess to be honest

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.600
with you taking half a spirit art is

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.790
pretty decent

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.170
instead of taking a full spirit art

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.820
which I would have is the champion ran

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:10.940
into me let's grab this Skype by the way

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:13.850
is actually just Dan quoting Kanye

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.170
West's lyrics right now no item rooms ok

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.870
is going to say something doesn't seem

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.299
right about this run so no item rooms is

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.600
going to leave us behind the eight-ball

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:26.540
in a relatively big way I don't really

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.020
want to go buy a bomb to blow up a

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.120
spirit

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.110
hard or blow up attempted rock and I

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.120
don't even know what I'd be hoping to

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.160
get at that point but I love High

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.259
Priestess here helping us out keeping us

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.940
on pace spirit hearts helping out if we

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.699
get a good deal with the devil as far as

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.710
I'm concerned we're off to the races uh

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:44.240
I mean we got a deal with the devil that

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.150
will probably be good later and I'm not

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.500
going to take headless baby it's just

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.759
not good enough if we're going to be

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.449
getting deals with the devil like crazy

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:56.210
from this point onwards so hopefully you

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:58.340
understand my methodology there yeah I

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.919
don't know today must be I don't know

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.229
it's Christian Louboutins birthday or

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.990
something like that somewhat a nickel is

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.880
big into shoes I mean there's nothing

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.550
wrong with the today's June 2nd

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.930
maybe it's Anna Wintour's birthday NL I

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.699
didn't know you knew so much about old

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:18.530
Kuchar it's true I do having grown up

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:20.330
spending a lot of time on the internet

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.370
you know I'm not saying I'm a person who

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.409
resonates with luxury brands in high

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.180
fashion whatsoever but you know I am

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:28.930
aware that Anna Wintour of course played

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:32.419
by Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:36.770
editor of Vogue for many years Christian

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:41.419
Louboutin 50 cent released a remixed

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:43.580
version of Cee Lo Green's fu where he

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.560
said see the red on the bottom of her

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.840
Christian Louboutins match my Ferrari

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.880
and that's why she's gone and I said to

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.610
myself who is this Christian Louboutin

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.529
and I googled it and probably rap genius

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.889
told the old Christian Louboutin is a

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:59.270
high-end shoe designer based probably

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:04.669
let's be honest probably France or Italy

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:06.529
that sounds more French Nets you know

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:08.210
you start to build this nexus of pop

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:09.919
culture references that you know double

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:16.400
back in on each other and reinforce

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:19.430
themselves in your mind do you think if

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.020
Anna Wintour was a big fan of Game of

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.690
Thrones and she was in the throes of

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.930
sensual climax she would say winter is

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.930
coming

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.780
good one good one so we have the Emperor

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.570
car what do you think about an emperor

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:37.900
card in this situation I think that it's

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:39.010
it's tempting oh you got to go chaos so

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.310
we get the money we got to go chaos

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.930
that's like the first rule load there's

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.290
a book series right rule of something

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.880
it's the first rule of that you see I'm

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.900
kind of going halfsies on the reference

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.820
there but that's okay

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.080
onl you're getting to family friendly

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:57.190
yeah well what about the joke about the

00:06:53.080 --> 00:07:01.960
former editor of Vogue having a sexual

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:04.360
climax I don't think so buddy that's not

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:07.420
friendly to anybody least of all in a

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.710
wind tour no disrespect meant I really

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.670
know nothing about your career but

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.200
because of the fact that you have a

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.000
Wikipedia article I have to assume

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.220
you've achieved achieved some level of

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.400
notoriety Plus Meryl Streep ain't

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:20.140
playing me in no movies I'd have to

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.390
think about what would have to happen in

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:24.100
my life for Meryl Streep to ever play me

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:26.200
in a movie and I don't like it not

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.550
because of any like gender-bending or

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.870
anything like that but because of Meryl

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:32.940
Streep was playing me in a movie I

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:35.170
probably died before my time because I

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:38.440
nothing against Meryl Streep at all I

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:42.160
hope I out liver she's got like at least

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:43.900
40 years on me let's be honest so if I

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.200
could dude were poppin off on this run

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:49.300
if if I go down before her and she gets

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:52.300
to play me in a movie of my life then

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.070
something has gone wrong I mean I have

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.450
nothing against it's not a zero-sum game

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.730
I could die early and she could live

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:59.320
forever for all I care but if she's

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.850
playing me in a movie there's a there's

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.100
a bad situation that's happened there

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:05.770
somewhere but I guess I died in a

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:07.420
remarkable way or at least a wave

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:10.270
remarkable enough to have its own movie

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:12.370
hopefully hopefully it's not a comedy no

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:14.710
danger of that with your jokes NL good

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:16.810
good one maybe they'll make a movie a

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:18.730
movie about hey maybe one day I'll learn

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:21.640
how to talk hey maybe one day they'll

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:25.110
make a YouTube commenters movie it'll be

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:27.910
called please stop he's already dead um

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:30.070
let's keep moving on here we need to get

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:31.600
a well he's used to bombs to get in

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:34.030
there that's very true I want to get

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:36.099
chaos though I'm still trying to figure

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:38.200
out why the scores are so bad on today's

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:40.750
daily like does something happen because

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.340
as of right now it's probably you know

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:44.740
out average maybe slightly below average

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:47.170
we got blank card here a font which is

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:52.960
fine I recognized the most obvious

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:55.390
Avenue for this to go bad Li Li no for

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:57.700
this to go badly is badly was the

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:59.920
villain from rush hour for which was

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:04.120
scrapped it was Li but he went into the

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:06.280
Shadow Realm and is that we get stomped

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:09.100
on by moms toenail like frequently

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:11.290
frequently was the good guy for he was

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:14.530
like we can clone himself rush hour five

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:15.820
but it never really popped off is the

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:18.250
thing so we're not going to be able to

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:20.800
get chaos so we were sadly just going to

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:22.540
go here and maybe chaos would have done

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.590
it or maybe chaos is what's caused all

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.910
the problems to begin with you know

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:27.070
we'll never know we're two minutes ahead

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.600
of schedule are we've already checked

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:30.430
this and gotten everything out our

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.980
damage stat is good rate of fire is okay

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:35.170
speed is okay we need to amp those up as

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:37.180
possible but as of right now is this a

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.770
me being cocky I'm not saying like how

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:41.080
did these idiots get such bad scores

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:46.450
today rather I'm just saying when does

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:48.339
the other shoe drop here because I mean

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:51.310
at the present moment this daily looks

00:09:48.339 --> 00:09:53.970
just fine mind you like to get a daily

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:57.520
in the in the forty thousands is like

00:09:53.970 --> 00:10:00.550
far from bad might just be a high damage

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.020
penalty but the fact that the the some

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:03.220
not saying I'm going to be up there in

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:05.710
the forty thousands of just saying the

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:10.750
fact that there is a forty thousand

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:12.790
score in the top 30 right now indicates

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:14.680
to me that this run seems to be harder

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.580
than average to get a good score on and

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.440
I'm trying to figure out where that

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:19.450
comes from but that's okay hey do you

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.830
think when Anna windmill kick you get

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:26.470
the edge I'm not going to slandered poor

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:27.339
Anna Wintour I mean maybe I should

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:29.190
because I don't have anything else to

00:10:27.339 --> 00:10:32.230
say apparently but you get the idea

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:35.050
okay just that guy's got to go first

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:36.280
it's good to go you're going next right

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.510
that's right we got to keep moving a

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.370
little bit because the foots going to

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:42.300
come down on occasion I stand by my

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:45.900
decision to get rid of High Priestess

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:49.420
the Melisandre card in order to pick up

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:51.630
all careful in order to pick up the

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:53.670
Hierophant here upon blank card is like

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:55.620
number one at the fast food

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:57.450
restaurant of my life that's a number

00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:00.510
one combo if you got blank card if it's

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:04.110
blank card week you want the hero font

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:07.680
even if your HP is good because there's

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:09.300
really no reason not to use it

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.220
frequently you know you get more spirit

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.570
on sleep sometimes you will be able to

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.780
pick up sometimes you won't even if you

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:17.190
won't you have them there is like a as

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:20.790
stored value basically just chillin on

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:24.270
the ground we would consider like a yera

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:25.710
as well no doubt about it like here I

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:27.180
sort of why wouldn't we really

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:29.670
especially with another battery charge

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:33.810
available we're not going to need spirit

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:35.340
hearts for any deals with the devil in

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:38.010
the very near future that's for certain

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:42.630
now I would okay that was weird I

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:45.120
definitely would not replace blank card

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:47.760
hero font with IV bags so we're just

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.560
going to ignore that great timing on the

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:53.760
on the appearance of that item

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:55.950
almost want on the spikes there but it's

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.630
not necessarily like a horrible affront

00:11:55.950 --> 00:12:03.420
to our lives that it came into our

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:04.800
existence here we got some ah you know

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:07.460
what maybe it's good I was going back

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.830
there to go to the boss trap room but

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:12.090
maybe it's better this way

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:14.580
we'll keep our pace high so we're not

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:16.680
like super freaked out as we try to make

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.420
it the boss rush like every time I make

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:21.210
it the boss rush I'm an early person a

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:23.310
said it many times try not to you know

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:25.620
crib this complete bit from Mike

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:27.060
Birbiglia from it's excellent comedy

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:30.110
special from earlier this winter however

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:33.720
I don't like I don't like being late and

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:35.640
everyday leave is lateness you know

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.710
everyday leave you're like 15 seconds

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.360
away from being late now if you're a

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:40.920
late person that's called being on time

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.720
if you're an early person you know you

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.730
arrived like 15 minutes after you

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:47.400
expected to which is why it's cumbersome

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:50.850
for me I think we want cards more than

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:54.660
we want hearts you know what we really

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:57.450
want is a bombs dude like they just do

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:59.340
not exist so I'm thinking maybe this is

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:01.350
where we start to slide into mediocrity

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.180
on this run we're fighting the tanky

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:04.710
boss that's going to start to you know

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.850
affect my psychology and I'm like we're

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:06.430
not doing enough damage we're not doing

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.680
enough damage

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.970
so then I'm like we got to go faster I

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.710
don't know how I'm going to do that but

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:14.740
if this deal with the devil is like bad

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:16.240
or Krampus then I'm going to feel like

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.770
I'm behind the 8-ball despite being 2

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.660
minutes ahead of it and now that we've

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.980
identified that harmful thought pattern

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:23.200
we can try to get out in front of it

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:24.970
just remember if we keep going at the

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.310
same pace we've been going we're going

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:30.220
to be good you know we're doing really

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:31.660
really well I mean that was really poor

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:35.560
but apart from that we're doing okay

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:38.800
that was way worse but we're doing fine

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:40.630
okay so we've got a horrible rate of

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.310
fire increase and then a Krampus fight

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:45.760
so it's actually even worse than

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:52.450
predicted we desperately need a tears

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:56.890
upgrade we did get us nice we did get a

00:13:52.450 --> 00:14:00.010
speed upgrade and we could really use

00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:02.410
lump of coal a tears downgrade without a

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:04.930
damage increases the worst man we got an

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:06.430
HP downgrade as well but like as far as

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:06.940
I'm concerned that basically does not

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.649
matter

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.510
okay lump of coal is exactly what we

00:14:08.649 --> 00:14:12.040
needed here so let's just be content

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:14.200
with that we're about a minute ahead of

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:17.380
schedule still in spite of ourselves so

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:19.150
that's good but we basically have dour

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:21.870
DPS but we are going to make boss rush

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:26.140
and I feel confident saying that because

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:29.880
despite the fact that we're going to be

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:35.140
doing like very little damage we are

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:36.880
loving life because of the Excel floor

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:40.660
here should allow us to find the boss

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:43.300
fight more quickly be in a better

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:45.100
position that regard we just one shot

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:51.070
that guy thanks to having great range

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:53.709
and also love of coal so that actually

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:57.430
made me jump in my seat and not like

00:14:53.709 --> 00:15:01.440
let's go like actually like let's go I

00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:05.980
got hit I got scared you know my set a

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:08.230
pulmonary infarction got a bomb bomb

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:11.230
allows us to play the judgement again we

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:13.270
got so much time might as well go for it

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:15.579
I will say I wouldn't say it's a jump

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:18.510
daily there's some good stuff going on

00:15:15.579 --> 00:15:20.259
here but an experimental treatment that

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:23.829
actually takes away

00:15:20.259 --> 00:15:29.769
half of your dps is god-awful

00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:40.419
it's just horrible okay so like this guy

00:15:29.769 --> 00:15:44.609
needs to go and he's close once you get

00:15:40.419 --> 00:15:49.660
one the remainder shouldn't be that bad

00:15:44.609 --> 00:15:51.189
did to myself did it to myself is this

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.569
the room I'm going to go to the

00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:53.679
subreddit and everybody on the subreddit

00:15:52.569 --> 00:15:56.169
is going to be like this is the room

00:15:53.679 --> 00:16:02.139
where I knew this daily was going to be

00:15:56.169 --> 00:16:04.379
garbage once you get like two of them

00:16:02.139 --> 00:16:06.519
taken out it's no problem whatsoever but

00:16:04.379 --> 00:16:11.879
before you get two of them taken out

00:16:06.519 --> 00:16:11.879
that's a carnival of sadness right there

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:22.670
gotta eight tanky enemies with a poor

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:26.870
rate of fire so pretty became crystal

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:29.840
clear pretty quickly why this run is not

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:31.130
very good and honestly this is one of

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.350
the worst ways for that to have happened

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:36.650
because now I'm looking at this and I'm

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:39.080
like it must not really ever get any

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:42.370
better because like tears wise or it may

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:44.510
be even damage wise because if it did we

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:46.100
we wouldn't be seeing those scores on

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:48.170
the leaderboards this is now like easily

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:51.500
the most plausible explanation for bad

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:56.150
leaderboard scores so we could teleport

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:57.620
I think it's actually idiotic I'm now

00:16:56.150 --> 00:17:01.400
sceptical by the way that we're going to

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:02.980
be able to make boss rush if we find it

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:07.339
that's fine

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:10.610
but we need to we need to find a way to

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:12.439
kill mom I think this is me

00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:15.020
acknowledging that things are going to

00:17:12.439 --> 00:17:17.510
be a little rough here because how are

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:24.860
we going to kill mom in even like close

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:26.900
to a timely fashion I don't see the the

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:28.189
optics of the situation you know it

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.170
takes us 30 seconds to get through this

00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:39.170
room we're going to be doing almost no

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:40.700
damage almost never and there's no item

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:43.100
rooms for us to get before the mom

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:49.340
fights so I mean sure bombs are they

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:51.710
have some importance but unless we can

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:53.660
get like mom to hurt herself or I don't

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:55.760
know like an amazing shop or something

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:58.760
like that so it turns out like blank

00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:00.200
card Emperor might have been the better

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:03.170
choice although I don't know what our HP

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:04.850
would look like in that situation this

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:09.320
one is just becoming like kind of a

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:10.760
grind and that is unfortunate that one

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.830
experimental treatment could throw the

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:14.390
whole thing in the into question like

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:18.920
this but we still you know that's the

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:20.840
thing with dailies you never walk alone'

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:24.950
on a daily you know you always got other

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:27.980
people there working with you they want

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:29.570
you to succeed probably most of the time

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.890
or they want you to fail but they want

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:31.280
you to fail them is spectacular and

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:34.310
entertain

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:37.790
way which is honestly like still pretty

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:40.880
excellent so be okay with that as well

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:44.390
so really like as much as it would pain

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:46.580
me to give up blank card on a daily for

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:50.090
my sanity to pick up like a red or blue

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:59.840
candle might be exactly what the doctor

00:18:50.090 --> 00:19:02.540
ordered I really wanted that to murder

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:04.970
these guys so let me I'm going to own up

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:07.520
to another mistake on this run that

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:09.620
didn't become apparent until now with

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:11.390
our DPS or at least our rate of fire

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:15.650
being so horrible it would have been

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:18.020
actually pretty nice to have a headless

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:19.490
baby as much as I hate to admit that

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:27.460
headless baby might have changed our

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:27.460
fortunes a little here I believe it just

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:36.560
I don't know that I've ever seen a run

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:39.650
go from like promising to pretty much

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:41.750
garbage this quickly I still even if we

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.260
make it into the mom fight no greed no

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:43.970
greed

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:49.970
okay Oh blue candle okay we have to we

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:54.410
have to we have to we have to always

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:55.700
forgiving now like sincerely always

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:57.170
forgiving okay we bought the Empress

00:19:55.700 --> 00:20:00.380
instead of the hair pasta it doesn't

00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:03.800
matter doesn't matter it is now

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:06.140
conceivable that we could beat mom in

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:08.330
time and we have some extra damage so

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:14.120
okay I mean actually I have to close sky

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:17.000
losses this is absurd the messages are

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:21.050
coming fast and furious now we have a

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.490
chance though I think a lot of people

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:24.440
and they might be right in this

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:26.270
situation a lot of people are going to

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:28.190
be stubborn they're going to say you

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:29.710
know and I know stubborn is better than

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:32.930
most a lot of people are going to say

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:34.100
blank card it's a 10 out of 10 on date

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:37.400
lease you got to go with it and they're

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:40.580
not wrong you almost always gotta go

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:43.280
with blank card I think this is one of

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:44.850
the almost though I also just realized

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:48.630
there's like no chance we make

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:52.530
ah Suresh cuz we got to fight two bosses

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:57.570
and can't find one boss for the life of

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:58.860
us who can't find one boss Joker I don't

00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:00.720
know yeah sure okay Joker like

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:04.490
immediately and you're just hoping to

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:07.200
get like some damage ups real quick

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:09.000
we found the boss there is a chance just

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:11.340
yes that was the perfect way for you to

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.590
die there I appreciate it great deal

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:18.510
sister Vince is not the tanky his boss

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:22.250
in human existence it would help if we

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:22.250
didn't whiff so many of the shots but

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:40.530
he's sort of done it this is this is

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:47.340
laborious man okay we got got a chance

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:49.530
of big tears upgrade start throwing down

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:51.780
bombs lose your black cards do what you

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:53.550
got to do hit me

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:59.700
take my take my black cards we're going

00:21:53.550 --> 00:22:02.730
to this and we've done it we've actually

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:05.070
made it we don't need to go to the boss

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:12.330
fight and we could just use the hero

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:13.650
font card now I think this rude

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:16.650
awakening happens to me pretty

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:17.730
frequently when you make boss rush

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:22.140
you're like sick

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:24.660
I made boss rush then you're like

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:27.900
alright now I actually have to kill all

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:31.080
the bosses on boss rush and admittedly

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:36.540
Abaddonn you know some market

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:38.850
improvement for this run it's not like a

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:41.250
ten out of ten though our damage is

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:44.310
eight which is probably a little bit

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:45.660
above average without making enemies of

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.250
everybody who thinks that eight damage

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.780
is like the greatest you could possibly

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:53.670
have by the time you get the boss rush

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:55.050
but it's like certainly not ten out of

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:56.220
ten levels I don't even know if it's

00:22:55.050 --> 00:23:02.520
eight out of ten level is probably like

00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:06.300
a six and a half we do also have to like

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:08.460
grind like crazy if we want to make the

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:10.950
hush fight here so blue candle is very

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:13.920
helpful and you know in a pre rebirth

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:15.990
after birth afterward plus world it was

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.880
actually like oh I've got blue candle I

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:19.800
win the game this is from the same era

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:23.160
where it was like you know oh I got the

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:26.190
nail I win the game I mean to be fair

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:29.400
those are still easy items to win with

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:31.620
the difference is we're not trying to

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.510
win we're trying to kill every single

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:36.840
boss in the game sequentially and then

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:38.940
followed by that you know make it to the

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.830
hush fight in a timely fashion and then

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.240
kill the hush as well without dying and

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:43.280
then

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.690
then we got the you know the rest of the

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.460
run that begins there there's going to

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:49.790
be like one of the lowest scores we've

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:52.910
had in a long time maybe ever getting

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:57.650
out of boss rush here damage penalty

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:59.780
seems pretty absurd normally we have

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:04.160
like 13,000 points by now we also like

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:05.540
we got no items I look starting to I'm

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.980
starting to find myself getting tilted

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.970
and it's up to us to pull out of the

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:11.900
tilt tailspin

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:14.090
admittedly however I really I want to

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:16.340
know like internally how they value item

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:17.540
rooms with Nicolas okay well why would

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:18.860
we give you item rooms today you get

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.630
blank our high priestess that's as good

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:24.620
as you know six item rooms is not as

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:25.880
good as six item rooms mom toenail most

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:29.840
of the time you don't even pick it up

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:32.390
because it's too unwieldy must be an

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:38.240
enemy that's gonna pop up other yep we

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:40.340
didn't get hit until then so I'm just

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:44.420
certified this is a bad daily this is a

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:45.800
quote unquote you know bad daily mostly

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:48.080
because of experimental treatment so if

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.550
you did this one and it's the ultimate

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:53.150
irony of course is dailies we did this

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:54.410
one and what that was so fast if you did

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:55.850
this one and you played conservatively

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:59.780
maybe you don't take experimental

00:24:55.850 --> 00:25:02.990
treatment you find yourself actually

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:05.210
doing maybe decent damage your speeds

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:06.980
not going to get the speed up so you

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:11.750
know you no good deed goes unpunished

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:13.220
but but we should really not concern

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:15.560
ourselves so much with the the

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:17.180
overarching meta of like you know

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:20.210
today's daily what we should concern

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:22.360
ourselves with is our ability to win

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:24.500
today our ability to survive you know we

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:28.520
no real reason to be taking as much

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:32.470
damage as we have been taking except

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:32.470
frustration you know starts to creep in

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:37.220
there is a chance we could fight hah I'm

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:39.680
not going to worry about it too too much

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.970
and our score dude I don't even know

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.940
where a score is going to be sitting

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:45.380
here you should actually look for the

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:49.510
person with the eye score today because

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:49.510
they are an Isaac god

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:58.750
you know this is a daily where

00:25:56.250 --> 00:26:05.620
statistically the attributes are not

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:08.530
working out in your favor we might have

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:11.590
like the mildest of mild legs up on the

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:20.440
competition just because we made boss

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:21.820
rush but even that is like I don't know

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:24.880
how much that's worth I feel like we

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:26.710
might be behind the eight-ball and

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:29.320
that's what I get for being skeptical

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:31.090
like at the start of this run like you

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:32.650
know look at all these amazing upgrades

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:34.630
of Gunners like decent upgrades you've

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:39.190
gotten over the start of this turns out

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:41.590
it was all it was Fool's Gold man Texas

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:49.810
tea thank you angel statue those

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:52.320
downright conscientious of you you still

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:52.320
a lot yeah

00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:03.540
well uh I mean despite stats nothing to

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:06.360
write home about I think we could make

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:11.760
the hush fight it would be helpful to me

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:17.750
if we could you know get out of here

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:21.510
within maybe like the next ten seconds

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:24.750
go be a the most likely way of making

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:26.130
that dream come true barely got out of

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:28.140
the way of that one this could be our

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:30.090
final wave I mean I think we have not

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:35.070
been going through the waves as slowly

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:36.720
as we have on some other daily so at 26

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:41.280
minutes we're going to need to book it

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:42.900
dude the irony is it's actually a run

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:47.460
that's relatively well equipped to deal

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:51.120
with them now don't do that attack that

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:53.040
attacks the one that's the most I need

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:55.860
to kill you quickly is the problem so I

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:58.440
have to put myself at risk we have a

00:27:55.860 --> 00:28:00.420
relatively good run from a hush flight

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:04.380
standpoint you know we got some

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:06.120
survivability at least rate of fire

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:12.210
maybe doesn't punish you as much for

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:13.920
being terrible in that situation if we

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:16.230
get down to like 28 minutes though

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:18.180
there's no chance okay so we have the D

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:21.000
0 or D 10

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:24.000
obviously not worth anything at all so

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.810
20 26 minutes two minutes per floor is

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.850
theoretical chance we traded we traded

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:32.100
speed for comfort basically by getting

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:36.470
rid of sorry to quote wedding crashers

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:38.790
but by getting rid of blank card

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:41.270
actually we traded comfort for speed

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:44.400
from being honest a getting rid of a

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:47.460
blank card especially with the hero font

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:51.210
we've now put ourselves in a situation

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:53.610
where we can go fast but it might be a

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:56.250
little dicey to get where we need to go

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:57.120
we probably need to predict where we're

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:59.070
going

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:01.440
correctly on like the first or second

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:03.030
crack I'm so mad I'm actually so mad I

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.419
mean it's my fault I forced myself into

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:08.740
kind of a bad

00:29:04.419 --> 00:29:11.259
position they're still pretty cheesed

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:13.929
off about doc bump and I with a spider

00:29:11.259 --> 00:29:16.590
there though it's like a one-in-ten roll

00:29:13.929 --> 00:29:21.370
and I was in the worst position to get

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:24.730
dunked on um we're still still going

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:26.590
strong here relatively strong mental

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:28.210
fortitude starting to collapse but let's

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:31.509
you know you just got to reverse the

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:39.759
tilt let's right the ship you know a

00:29:31.509 --> 00:29:42.009
tilt is not a capsize a cap sizes of

00:29:39.759 --> 00:29:43.539
caps there's no way the boss rushes down

00:29:42.009 --> 00:29:44.740
there so we got it there's no way the

00:29:43.539 --> 00:29:46.419
boss fight is down there I mean so we

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.799
got to go this way and we know it's not

00:29:46.419 --> 00:29:50.980
going to be to the right either unless

00:29:47.799 --> 00:29:55.240
the rooms join up so if they do you know

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:56.620
Fair Play if they do some of those might

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:59.019
be incredibly useful we might as well

00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:01.899
see if it joins up it does not so it's

00:29:59.019 --> 00:30:03.549
like a 10-second room that I think was

00:30:01.899 --> 00:30:06.149
worth it for peace of mind we didn't get

00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:08.769
it there somehow so life is but a dream

00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:14.799
just going to de gAHS us into having one

00:30:08.769 --> 00:30:17.080
extra spirit hard right off the bat I'd

00:30:14.799 --> 00:30:19.960
say we borderline need an emperor card

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:21.700
at this point if we're going to make the

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.320
hush fight whether or not we want to do

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:25.539
the hush fight is another thing that I

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:29.559
haven't really called into question at

00:30:25.539 --> 00:30:33.250
this point but just like the quickest of

00:30:29.559 --> 00:30:35.409
quick glances to try to find a attempted

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:39.419
Rock because small rock would be nice

00:30:35.409 --> 00:30:39.419
spirit arts are you know the lifeblood

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:45.460
come on

00:30:41.649 --> 00:30:48.789
those tinted rocks at this point though

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:51.039
like can we even wait for a bomb to

00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:54.269
explode to grab a tinted rock if we want

00:30:51.039 --> 00:30:54.269
to go to the hush fight I don't know

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:59.620
okay here we go we're going to invert

00:30:56.919 --> 00:31:02.049
the tilt I'm going to say at this point

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:04.690
everybody watching as an impartial

00:31:02.049 --> 00:31:06.129
observer is going hey dummy you're not

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:08.620
going to make the hush fight just slow

00:31:06.129 --> 00:31:09.909
your roll stop taking damage reposition

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:12.580
yourself for a better chance of doing

00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:15.039
well on the on the chest so we should

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:16.980
really take my own surrogate advice

00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:19.840
there

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:21.730
it's highly implausible unless we get an

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:25.420
emperor card even if we get you know

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:27.850
brimstone bombs knife etc etc there's

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:34.240
just not enough time you know in the run

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:39.820
to pull it back we may want to consider

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:42.820
taking the white pony it is a speed

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:45.670
upgrade definitely do not want that blue

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:48.040
candle so useful though I think we have

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:50.460
to roll blue candle for now so obviously

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:54.510
I'm going to keep trying to get to the

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:57.460
hush fight because I'm like an idiot and

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:58.930
also it's a nice point bonus but I think

00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:02.260
we're going to be looking at like the 30

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:04.480
thousands here as our final score as a

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:05.920
little like I don't want to say

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.270
embarrassing because you know we played

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:10.150
to the conditions we were dealt today

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:13.120
but it's a bad score I can completely

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:16.720
understand why the scores on the front

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:20.080
page where we're pretty garbage today

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:22.030
the garbage daily and I don't use that

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:23.860
term to say like hey you know hey you

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:25.090
watch this garbage daily Wow way to

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:26.980
waste your time why don't you do

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:27.730
something productive like nothing you

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:30.550
know that's

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:32.560
I hope you got entertained at least not

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:34.420
the videos over but hope you had good

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:36.910
found some entertainment value in

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:39.970
today's daily if even only through

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:42.240
chatting through it you know to have to

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:44.770
have watched a grown man

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:47.620
self-flagellating this video hopefully

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:51.010
brought you a little enjoyment in some

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:55.660
way but admittedly this is is not really

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:57.850
my idea of a fun daily The Lost dailies

00:32:55.660 --> 00:33:00.250
give me a million of those before you

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:03.100
give me another one of these just a

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:04.480
Maggie pull the wool out from under you

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:06.880
that's not how that expression goes pull

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:09.970
the rug out from under you from under

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:14.860
your eyes okay rose-colored goggles Yves

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:16.720
saint-laurent glasses and we're not

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:18.930
going to explore everything because the

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:20.860
daily it hasn't met us halfway you know

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:22.600
there's always going to be people out

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:23.590
there they're like hey someone treated

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:25.750
you like garbage kill them with kindness

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:27.580
yeah I mean you should you know the best

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:28.760
revenge there's a saying that is hard to

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:30.980
stomach but it's true

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:33.290
the best revenge is living well because

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:34.940
living will take so long and putting

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:36.650
sugar in their gas tank would feel so

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:38.470
good temporarily but leave them may be

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:42.860
getting a felony or something like that

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:44.650
but either way it is it is true there's

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:46.520
always going to be people that are like

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:48.710
someone's mean to you you should be

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:52.070
super nice to them I'm not one of those

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:53.990
people necessarily at least not past a

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:55.880
point in today's daily maybe not super

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:59.870
mean to us but I don't really feel the

00:33:55.880 --> 00:34:01.190
need to to meet it here you know it

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:03.640
hasn't given us the tools that we need

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:06.410
to really thrive so it's like leaving

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:08.210
well I'm giving my two weeks notice of

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:10.130
this daily right now and how's the

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:14.480
office been they've always paid me on

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:18.679
time it's been it's been okay you know I

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:23.810
can't basically it was a job it wasn't a

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:25.310
career it wasn't fulfilling but it it

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:27.649
paid the bills and I can't necessarily

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:30.409
complain but on the way out am I going

00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:32.840
to you know give a personalized card to

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:34.610
everybody at the office no today's daily

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:38.050
if I'm being honest and you just hasn't

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:39.919
earned it you know if I was leaving

00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:41.929
company where the people were like my

00:34:39.919 --> 00:34:43.700
family that'd be something but that's

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:46.370
not what this daily is this daily is

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:48.639
just you know hey your summer contracts

00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:55.340
over and we're not going to renew you so

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:57.320
back things and that's fine you know run

00:34:55.340 --> 00:35:00.410
like that it helps you appreciate the

00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:02.090
good ones out that much more and for all

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:04.250
the the bellyache you know I was even

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:07.690
belly aching butt Theory crafting Theory

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:10.030
aching if you will over whether or not

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:12.590
moms toenail was going to be the

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:18.830
deciding factor in this daily it was

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:21.820
like not that case at all it barely

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:21.820
impacted things

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:30.100
High Priestess could have kept us going

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:31.270
faster I don't know what our HP would

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:34.360
look like but it could have kept us

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:35.740
going faster if I'd known that dark bum

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.880
would show up like three floors later I

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:38.050
might have stuck with High Priestess

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.460
maybe we could have made the hush fight

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:40.930
but I don't know now if we'd made the

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:42.520
hush fight it would have been more the

00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:43.990
same woulda just been me complaining on

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:46.750
the hush filing our damage isn't that

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:48.630
good blah blah blah so you know at least

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:51.160
I'm going to take it as a blessing that

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:52.510
maybe we missed the hush fight here so I

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:54.880
could free myself from this merciless

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:58.960
daily as quickly as possible there have

00:35:54.880 --> 00:36:00.370
been worse ones like and honestly it's

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:05.260
been a lot better since picking up torn

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:08.620
photo now this is pretty minor

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:11.200
I got hit there it's pretty minor but if

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:13.240
you're going to use a moon card on one

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:17.980
of the last two floors you might as well

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:19.510
use it on the chests or the dark room

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:21.310
for that matter because if you get a

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:23.410
chest it's going to guarantee you an

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:24.910
item if we use it now sure we could get

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:26.860
an item and in the end like it's

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:28.360
possible this one has high this one is

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:32.020
Black Lotus in it and the next one has

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:34.030
you know like two pennies but if all

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:37.300
other things are equal which for our

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:38.710
knowledge they are the the best option

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.970
is to maximize your chances of getting

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:42.580
an item especially if we don't care

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:44.260
about our item penalty this is also a

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:47.140
daily I should point out you know a lot

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:49.390
of inside baseball talk here but there's

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:51.730
no I don't think it's a guarantee that

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:55.120
just because we won where we're going to

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:56.530
win on a bad daily that we're going to

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:58.450
have a good rank because I think this is

00:36:56.530 --> 00:37:01.210
a daily that honestly seems very easy to

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:05.470
win on it just seems difficult to rank

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:10.030
well on so I don't know I would be I

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:16.930
would be expecting to probably be in the

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:19.360
top 500 maybe which is okay and you know

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:21.070
the further away I get from a perfect

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:23.170
run the worse the ranking predictions

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:27.070
get so take it with a grain of salt but

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:29.980
still also and take it like a man steady

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:31.589
and strong I don't know list of the

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:36.329
lyrics to this song but it

00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:37.650
and love again until I can the eyeless

00:37:36.329 --> 00:37:40.049
in the country music growing up you

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:41.339
can't I mean if you listen to country

00:37:40.049 --> 00:37:44.729
music now I'm not trying to insult you

00:37:41.339 --> 00:37:47.670
or anything but like mid-1990s the late

00:37:44.729 --> 00:37:49.079
1990s that was like the music Garth

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:49.529
Brooks was the biggest artist in the

00:37:49.079 --> 00:37:53.160
world

00:37:49.529 --> 00:37:55.049
he still is ok you I mean Taylor Swift

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:57.329
exists but you know whatever you want to

00:37:55.049 --> 00:37:58.859
go believe in that's okay there's

00:37:57.329 --> 00:38:01.259
nothing wrong with I'm not even a Taylor

00:37:58.859 --> 00:38:02.999
Swift fan you know I don't hold it

00:38:01.259 --> 00:38:07.979
against her that to pimp a butterfly

00:38:02.999 --> 00:38:09.329
lost to read at the Grammys or 1985 or

00:38:07.979 --> 00:38:13.259
whatever the frickin album was caught in

00:38:09.329 --> 00:38:14.969
a 19-point is it's just ridiculous but

00:38:13.259 --> 00:38:16.259
at the same time like I don't hold it

00:38:14.969 --> 00:38:20.339
against her it was calming she's like a

00:38:16.259 --> 00:38:24.509
biggest artist on planet earth I know

00:38:20.339 --> 00:38:26.940
like probably like eight Taylor Swift

00:38:24.509 --> 00:38:28.140
songs and I've never willingly listened

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:30.479
to one of them that's how big of an

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:31.650
artist she is and for what its runs I

00:38:30.479 --> 00:38:33.119
don't know if there's any Taylor Swift

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:35.099
backlash but if there is I'm not part of

00:38:33.119 --> 00:38:39.440
it I think she seems like an an affable

00:38:35.099 --> 00:38:43.469
young lady and she makes music that is

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:44.849
listenable I always wonder though it's

00:38:43.469 --> 00:38:47.400
like I'm on Twitter all the time because

00:38:44.849 --> 00:38:49.200
I'm a narcissist that's not really true

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:51.329
I'm like I'm like the opposite of a

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:54.829
narcissist which is exactly what a

00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:58.410
narcissist would say but either way

00:38:54.829 --> 00:39:00.180
there we go dude

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:01.859
either way you never know this like I

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:04.109
see people they like make a joke about

00:39:01.859 --> 00:39:06.989
one direction and then there's all these

00:39:04.109 --> 00:39:10.219
accounts like you know Harry Styles fan

00:39:06.989 --> 00:39:12.509
101 I love Harry and they like have

00:39:10.219 --> 00:39:15.029
80,000 followers in there like check out

00:39:12.509 --> 00:39:16.859
this basic boy making fun of Harry

00:39:15.029 --> 00:39:19.799
Styles and then there's just like a

00:39:16.859 --> 00:39:21.660
hundred thousand Harry Styles avatar

00:39:19.799 --> 00:39:23.609
accounts get up in their mentions and

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.930
I'm like I don't know where we are in

00:39:23.609 --> 00:39:27.390
the world that's not a that's not unique

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:29.880
to our generation you know my mom had

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:31.170
pictures of freaking Davy Jones up in a

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.460
room I'm sure when she was growing up

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:35.910
and that's as much as I want to think

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:38.489
about that but I'm just saying you know

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:41.500
I'm unfamiliar with the scope of popular

00:39:38.489 --> 00:39:42.880
media in this day and age

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:45.550
you're really going to construct your

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:48.130
whole identity around a celebrity from a

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:49.540
different country I'm not biting the

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:52.869
hand that feeds if you have like an

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:54.609
account that's like I'm my identity as

00:39:52.869 --> 00:39:57.430
being a fan of northern line I'm very

00:39:54.609 --> 00:39:59.290
flattered a little scared but also

00:39:57.430 --> 00:40:01.180
flattered as well but he's not so much

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:03.160
more often than that you know you take

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:04.750
some time find yourself figure out what

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:06.369
like what you're what you're in it for

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:12.730
and then you know construct your

00:40:06.369 --> 00:40:14.230
identity around that instead I don't

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:17.170
want to be in this room anymore by the

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:20.349
way so High Priestess not I priestess

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:22.690
blue baby's only friend I think for all

00:40:20.349 --> 00:40:24.640
the the flack that it gets for being

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:26.680
kind of like boring because you don't

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:30.460
shoot you just set your cursor and

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:33.520
forget your cursor um it gets like what

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:35.710
I'm going to use because I believe it's

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:38.200
more consistent damage puberty's fine

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:40.270
here and if we're going to do that then

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:41.440
we really should take either how to jump

00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:43.740
or giga fire because we're not going to

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:46.410
be using blue candle very much so

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:49.630
actually I am an idiot

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:50.500
great great damage there I'm an idiot

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:54.460
moron man

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:56.170
why wouldn't we use blue candle we can

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:57.700
use blue candle well this is hanging out

00:40:56.170 --> 00:41:01.420
overtop of enemies and run into no

00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:03.760
problems whatsoever now don't stop that

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:05.710
the worst thing is just when these guys

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:10.359
collide this is water it's like when

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:13.030
gods coli but Powerman 5000 references

00:41:10.359 --> 00:41:14.230
aside that's how we got hit I mean

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:17.190
getting hit three times in this room is

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:17.190
just an embarrassment but

00:41:18.999 --> 00:41:27.859
- we in both know your dusted so we got

00:41:23.119 --> 00:41:29.719
for luck it's enough to expect some

00:41:27.859 --> 00:41:30.859
chests down here loveless and if you

00:41:29.719 --> 00:41:36.979
can't stay in the heat you know where to

00:41:30.859 --> 00:41:38.029
get out of ya blue candle still oh Jesus

00:41:36.979 --> 00:41:40.099
Christ

00:41:38.029 --> 00:41:42.170
blue candle still the right choice here

00:41:40.099 --> 00:41:44.450
I'm not convinced we're going to live on

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:48.859
this run I know I said that I thought we

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:50.809
would I'm not convinced of it anymore of

00:41:48.859 --> 00:41:53.479
course we have dark bummed I'm not

00:41:50.809 --> 00:41:54.619
saying we got like a 50% chance to die

00:41:53.479 --> 00:42:04.460
I'm just saying I don't think we're at

00:41:54.619 --> 00:42:07.640
90 please stay on the same plane the

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:09.950
astral plane or I'll go insane and I was

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:14.719
that a reference to Jonathan Richmond

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:19.039
yes it was yes it was most famous to

00:42:14.719 --> 00:42:22.039
most people as the singer from this

00:42:19.039 --> 00:42:25.999
Something About Mary his friends would

00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:29.019
say stop line and they've had enough of

00:42:25.999 --> 00:42:33.049
that his friends would say stop pining

00:42:29.019 --> 00:42:35.960
there's other girls to look at they

00:42:33.049 --> 00:42:39.769
tried to set him up with Tiffany and

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:43.219
indigo but there's something about Mary

00:42:39.769 --> 00:42:45.319
that they don't know but he did stalk

00:42:43.219 --> 00:42:47.809
her is kind of weird but you know of

00:42:45.319 --> 00:42:52.509
funny movies look the nineties were a

00:42:47.809 --> 00:42:52.509
different time simpler times

00:42:59.170 --> 00:43:05.960
just like trying to stay out of trouble

00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:08.050
here I know the boardgame advertising

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:12.100
said it's fun getting into trouble but I

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:14.560
disagree to a large extent I think

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:18.760
getting it in trouble is the worst part

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:18.760
sometimes breaking the rules can be fun

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:25.310
getting into trouble though that's you

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:30.710
know you don't want to get caught most

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:35.570
of the time I think please let me finish

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:37.070
this run early and I go still 200

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:38.870
minutes before roundtable can probably

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:42.920
fit in today's Isaac episodes in that

00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:45.700
time Tyrone laughs add your desired

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.700
workflow

00:43:50.820 --> 00:44:00.220
it's just it's just slow man just slow

00:43:54.280 --> 00:44:03.190
now don't push it further away from him

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:07.510
that's just cruel and then he paid out

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:10.720
with the spider I'm running out of

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:14.200
commentary fuel game you gotta have

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:18.280
mercy on this one like come me some

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:20.380
flippin slack like I'm at the point I

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:22.480
don't care who I kill last year what why

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:23.650
would I guess we should kill gluttony

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:26.080
last because we've already lost

00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:31.330
permanent polaroid invincibility but who

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:34.210
cares at all this is you've made me a

00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:36.190
nihilist a Nicholas nihilist that's what

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:38.140
you've done you've converted me I'm your

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:41.950
disciple now thanks for the spirit heart

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:45.910
really appreciate it oh why not why

00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:49.240
wouldn't you so actually to be fair soy

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:51.780
milk and love of coal are a nice

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:51.780
combination

00:44:54.360 --> 00:45:02.360
and actually one rate of fire with 1.77

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:02.360
damage is not that bad

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:11.370
not quite you know right home to mom

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:14.120
levels but it's up there Plus by the

00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:17.370
time you see it you already have lost

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:18.900
the chance to soar you lost a percentage

00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:21.450
chance to see more special items in the

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:23.670
future which is why I'm like you you the

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:26.220
only thing you gain by skipping soy milk

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:28.020
is not having soy milk which is usually

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:29.130
enough to skip soy milk but in some

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:30.840
situations you know you might be

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:32.640
thinking all and getting a better chance

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:35.910
to get brimstone or something later and

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:37.980
not going to happen so mom's bottle of

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:40.410
pills we use we get pheromones who cares

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:42.450
we grab black rune black rune is giving

00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:44.250
us a luck bonus I was going to say now

00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:45.900
that we've gotten a luck bonus it's a

00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:47.550
personal guarantee that we will have no

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:48.710
more rooms before the boss fight to give

00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:51.740
us a chest

00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:54.360
it's the stats that only mattered until

00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:56.220
you know literally the time when we got

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:57.480
it improve but either way we're about to

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:59.010
end this run and I was wrong we are

00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:01.980
going to win and we're going to win

00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:04.530
relatively easily we're fighting against

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:06.060
an enemy who doesn't move for like the

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:09.510
first half of the fight here which makes

00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:15.390
it a pretty good time to use blue candle

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:17.160
as well as soymilk we're not having to

00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:19.320
concern ourselves with the knock back

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:21.180
effects that normally are annoying here

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:22.920
I'll go ahead and say like if you invent

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:25.050
a time machine you know do those

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:28.050
requisite stuff kill Hitler buy Apple

00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:30.420
stock etc etc you know bed to make a lot

00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:32.310
of money win the lottery or you know bet

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:33.960
on Super Bowl or something like that but

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:35.970
after you do that like 10th on your list

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:36.270
don't play this daily save yourself an

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:38.430
hour

00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:41.100
maybe this daily starts the descent of

00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:42.840
you into because it's that's what's bad

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:45.510
about this daily is that it's not so bad

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:47.580
that you know it justifies you being a

00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:49.740
curmudgeon it's just bad enough that

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:52.110
you're like starting to get tilted by

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:54.900
mundane minutiae and you find yourself

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:56.640
just just coming bagley unpleasant for

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:59.730
the rest of the day as a result

00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:01.320
you know paying thanks to the spirit

00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:01.970
heart that's what's so insidious about

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:04.950

00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:07.710
