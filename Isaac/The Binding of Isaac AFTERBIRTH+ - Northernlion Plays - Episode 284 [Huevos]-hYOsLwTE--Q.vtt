00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.200
everybody welcome Eckener in line please

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.150
binding my scabbard plus we're back baby

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.990
we're winning games the conspiracy

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.849
theory that pardon me

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.080
it's ramming speed not curve torn the

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.260
conspiracy theory that the game has

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:21.510
gotten harder I don't know brief manic

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:24.180
moment of delusion benign lnq HCS we got

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.010
an item that charges us up not an excel

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.779
orchid we've got an item that charges us

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.820
up our trinket sorry that charges us up

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.619
when we fight bosses we have good speed

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.719
which we have not had for like two runs

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.790
here it's nice but we're not starting

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:42.930
with mega we did have mega on our last

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:45.420
run say with me those were the days I'm

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.870
sorry I can't play you yet forget a lot

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:53.160
of HP i hohoho okay could consider it

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.680
but present situation is not the right

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.300
time for that what is this run looking

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.280
great for right now well the damage is

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.370
bad the rate of fire on the other hand

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.220
is quite good and being able to get for

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.369
sure a charge on our card when we go

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.659
into our boss fight is something you

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.189
know if we get a double card or a

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.740
strength card that helps us actually get

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.000
value out of those cards instead of what

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.020
happens a lot of the time which is we

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.310
get a strength card and then we never

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.900
use it because we're holding something

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.509
else and we go out you know the time is

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.040
not right

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.240
fest is nothing wrong with that it's

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.830
kind of an awkward time to take pills

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.049
because if it's like a bad trip we're

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.090
really under the gun maybe we should

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.610
consider that before we you know commit

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.259
to recklessly taking any kind of

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.090
pharmaceutical to the game spawns for us

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.970
at this point that is a key we do need

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.360
that and we do have credit card and mmm

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.560
need a bomb to make that work honestly

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.490
what we might want to do with credit

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.840
card sure we could use it to get a free

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.420
deal with the devil but I sort of feel

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.070
like the right call is to just get a

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.560
bunch of free items right now the moving

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:03.210
box lets you unpack stuff in like a

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:04.380
future room really I will take this of

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.600
course

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.280
and then we get buddy in a box what's

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.569
the bus think about this what's the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.270
purpose of the moving box you know what

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.770
when in doubt look it up maybe

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.150
somebody's already done the hard work

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:27.630
for us moving box Issac oh my god so

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.980
many sponsored ads here moving box not

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.470
on the website I mean I just got like

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.800
moving boxes Vancouver if the box is

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.690
empty picks up all items and pickups in

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.190
a room and stores them if the box is not

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.580
empty places all stored items and

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:46.019
pickups in the current room stealing is

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.700
not possible you can pack up the items

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.709
without starting the challenge both

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:55.260
items presented by there's options and

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:58.019
more options can be taken if you used on

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.120
boss rush one of the objects is packed

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.810
up but the rush is not started so okay

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:10.290
we should take this and what's the

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:12.450
what's the game plan use it to steal

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.720
well not steal but if you get like a

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.980
double item you can take both of them

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.720
instead of having to choose it's

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.940
particularly relevant for some deal with

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:26.370
add angel deal with an angel

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.780
deal with the devil archetypes no tinted

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.160
rock that I can see there so obviously

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.400
like we can pick up something like

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.600
there's options on love and life but

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.549
barring something like there's options

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.220
which is not low percentage but not

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.900
particularly high percentage we're more

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.269
likely to probably use this to

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.890
consolidate items in a single room for

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.600
like I don't know reroll in purpose

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.489
azure something but we might as well at

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.160
least give it a try you know not every

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.109
item has an obvious impact right off the

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.190
bat sometimes they have subtle impacts

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.720
that you have to play around with a

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.850
little while to figure them out like

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.970
scapular for example you know the first

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.280
time you get scapular you go you know

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.560
amazing scapular I'm so excited

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.000
you realize eventually that it's among

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.560
the most powerful items in the game okay

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.560
we can move our mouse pointer now and

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.949
can close the Isaac wiki we're why did

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.940
we hit we were so fast for about a

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.650
quarter of a second

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.030
so I don't think there's any value in

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.900
using this right off the bat I guess we

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.290
can store

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:31.350
consumables in it for whatever reason

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:33.270
but the big draw is we should use it at

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.220
some point if there's any value to it

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.260
because there's no point in saving it

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.960
because we do have the you know whatever

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.970
the trinket is called hairpin that gives

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.620
you charges instantly when you go to

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.910
your boss fight three dollar bill an

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.160
item I got to be honest I'm really

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.810
guilty of underrating and or at least in

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.580
particular been really guilty of

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.270
underrating in the past so this seems

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.590
like an obvious play here right okay we

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:03.990
need to get the charge back so we can

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:06.630
suck everything up here but we can not

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.640
have to use a bomb to grab consumables

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.250
that are over there I never would have

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.500
considered that as a possible benefit

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.720
but I have to admit that it is and I

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:20.660
guess the more items that we can kind of

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.660
haul around the better it is for us I

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:27.180
think we can pack up spider but because

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.740
if we ever get a d6 or D 100 or a you

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.960
know a crack dice room or something like

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.550
that we want as many items to be stored

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.840
up in the moving box as possible I think

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:39.240
I'm starting to learn a little bit about

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:41.910
this item so I'm actually going to break

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.150
my own rule here to make this work I'm

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:48.120
going to use a bomb here to grab a key

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:50.730
then I'm going to suck these up and then

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.800
I'm going to go into here hope there's a

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:55.350
battery charge which there is by the

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:59.880
battery charge I'm going to dump all the

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:02.669
stuff off here including the bomb see if

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.780
there's some pennies here and I did that

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:08.419
because I know we're going to get a

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:11.400
charge when we let me fight our boss so

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:13.200
hear me out here our next charge we're

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.910
going to come back grab all that stuff

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.050
and then the idea is hopefully we can

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.270
add more to it in the future

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.070
I know it's bordering on probably this

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.840
being a little ridiculous but bear out

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.310
or bear with me here as I try to bear

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.190
out the results of my little experiment

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:28.080
we'll see if anything good comes to

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:31.150
fruition here because I'm back baby

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:39.590
I'm waiting runs three in a row

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:42.530
who would have thought buddy in a box

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:45.320
like is that what has spectral tears

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:48.020
right now or is that a result of the

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:53.150
occasional three dollar bill or maybe a

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:54.350
little bit of both I'm not sure so we're

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.570
going to get a guaranteed deal with the

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:59.660
devil I could really use good DPS that's

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:02.600
a start dude that's a start that's

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:05.150
pretty good I don't think I care about

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.650
little delirium it's just not quite good

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.139
enough I'll be content with my new

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:13.130
damage upgrades and the speed is not

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:15.440
that bad either for being honest here so

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:19.100
we're going to come down and I want to

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:22.490
drop infinity items later in the run so

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:25.250
there we go suck all this up I don't

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:28.070
really have a goal I'm short on

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.479
long-term goals on this run I don't know

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:32.449
what we're going to do with the moving

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:34.400
box but if we ever find the opportunity

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:37.970
to be role even if we find a two room or

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:44.690
a three room this could be not huge but

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:46.099
big sort of I think the big draw is like

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:48.050
it seems like if you take it to boss

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:49.550
rush you basically get to steal a free

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.960
item and then leave but you don't get to

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.340
choose the item I think it just takes

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.080
one of them

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.449
we'll have to see though in action when

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.159
we actually get in there if we actually

00:07:56.449 --> 00:08:00.220
get in there but it looks fairly likely

00:07:58.159 --> 00:08:02.690
we can make it happen

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:07.419
we're early on enough to make it happen

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:11.990
at least and then apart from that I

00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:20.020
guess maybe it's a nice little addition

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:20.020
to void but not fully convinced

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:29.020
we'll see I mean we don't have void

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:30.790
there's options again I think I've

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:34.870
touched on this enough but there's

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:45.310
options is sweep so my game plan for now

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:48.130
is I mean if it's a good passive item we

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:50.650
should just pick it up but if it's a bad

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:53.770
passive item wave if we use moving box

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:56.200
on the shop do we steal items in the

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:57.940
shop if so we should have been stolen

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.460
the items in the shop that means we can

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:03.130
dump all of our stuff off in the shop

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:04.870
and then pick it back up right after we

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:08.380
do the boss and grab anything else from

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:12.370
the shop along with it and then we can

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:14.260
pick it up for rooms later for free or

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:15.610
take it with us till the end of time

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:18.130
which apparently is how we're handling

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.970
it right now so I mean I mean I'm kind

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.330
of spinning my wheels here

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:24.930
conversationally I don't really know

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:27.970
where I'm going with the moving box but

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:29.530
what I do know is I'm having a good time

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:31.240
trying to make it happen we might be

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:35.950
exclusively on red hearts right now so

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:39.400
slow your roll a little bit right can't

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:44.530
get in there that makes sense don't have

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:46.030
any keys excuse me can't get in there

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:47.160
right don't have any keys that makes

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:49.120
sense that makes perfect sense

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.600
everything you're saying to me right now

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.600
makes sense

00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:00.620
do have a battery charge you got that

00:09:57.509 --> 00:10:02.730
for free kind of operating under the

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.019
principle that maybe it's a good idea to

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.639
always have it okay we didn't take

00:10:04.019 --> 00:10:10.230
damage

00:10:04.639 --> 00:10:14.069
dude the black rune everything's coming

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:16.350
together the blank rune allows us to

00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:20.670
eventually take all of the items we had

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:28.199
no use for and suck them all up into the

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:29.249
world's greatest stat increase ever we

00:10:28.199 --> 00:10:32.689
got to play our cards right though

00:10:29.249 --> 00:10:34.860
because right now next charge is dumping

00:10:32.689 --> 00:10:37.110
then we got enough battery charges

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:40.439
sitting around on the ground charge

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:43.800
after that is sucking it feels weird to

00:10:40.439 --> 00:10:45.209
say there's probably more creative uses

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.999
for this by the way they could get into

00:10:45.209 --> 00:10:49.410
some interesting stuff as well but I'm

00:10:47.999 --> 00:10:53.249
going to choose to just stick with

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:55.110
things as they are for now you know

00:10:53.249 --> 00:10:56.430
we've got a plan we'll try to execute on

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:59.250
this plane if it works awesome if it

00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:00.389
doesn't less awesome but come on 1.87

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:03.059
luck you're not going to give me a key

00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:04.680
and you're going to make me use a buddy

00:11:03.059 --> 00:11:08.569
in a box to do all the damage because we

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:12.779
got like ptosis fire mind or something

00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:14.730
forbidden fruit no consumables dude yo

00:11:12.779 --> 00:11:17.040
but this is not fair though is the thing

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:19.019
you see the problem is you're not being

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:23.160
fair right now so we use a bomb that's

00:11:19.019 --> 00:11:25.410
good there is a key okay so step one

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:27.529
with the key is probably the shop I want

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:34.309
to see if this works

00:11:27.529 --> 00:11:38.149
and maybe on the shop we buy a key first

00:11:34.309 --> 00:11:38.149
to go to the item room

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.970
so we dumped them and then you want to

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:48.120
go back here cuz we're getting a free

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:53.220
charge anyway you grab this what happens

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:55.170
if you suck up the box I don't know no

00:11:53.220 --> 00:12:01.200
okay it only sucks up the stuff that was

00:11:55.170 --> 00:12:01.970
actually down there that's a bummer but

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.470
acceptable

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:06.750
Ludovico technique say what you will

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:08.910
about it I know you will but three

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:12.240
dollar bill is sweet as heck

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:18.089
so our next charge dumps stuff it

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:19.200
doesn't actually matter that much now we

00:12:18.089 --> 00:12:22.529
have all these cool three dollar bill

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:24.089
effects that we don't need to be

00:12:22.529 --> 00:12:27.450
standing right next to the enemy to take

00:12:24.089 --> 00:12:28.830
advantage of we have two HP what I'm

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:30.870
getting at mostly is that if we get fire

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:34.740
mind we can do so from a safe distance

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:36.180
prompt ptosis as well so I think this

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.610
run is starting to come together here

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:40.350
I'll take the HP I'm not going to dump

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:43.680
our items off we definitely want to

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:46.490
continue to have charges so here's my

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:49.830
strategy if we see an item we don't like

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:51.990
ever because the shop strat clearly does

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:56.310
not work if we see an item we don't like

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:56.910
ever we pick it up so we can dump it

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.220
down later

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:02.970
it's like Ernest scared stupid we got to

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:05.760
turn all the camp counselors into weird

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:08.450
little wooden dolls and then fulfill our

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.450
collection of them

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:23.700
and then later we use a single black

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:24.810
rune and get like help these champions

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.180
dude they don't make them like this

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:34.380
anymore

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:36.120
we made it what we got algae's I mean we

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:38.010
could dump everything here and suck up a

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:41.700
nalgas room but I'm really adhering to

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:43.710
this black ruin strategy I think there's

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:48.120
there's meat to it all unlimited bombs

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:51.990
it's pretty solid let's prove it let's

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:53.820
go we needed that and the guarantee it's

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:59.970
actually a synergy I wouldn't have

00:13:53.820 --> 00:14:03.630
expected but the guaranteed charge from

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:05.400
the boss fight seems actually pretty

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:08.970
appropriate for this combination of

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:11.190
items we've made it

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:13.770
it means we're destined to get at least

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:18.570
a few charges per floor and one of them

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:20.400
we can time it exactly right so I'm

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:22.800
bummed by our deal with the devil

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:26.130
progress here but I'm like stoked that

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.990
we're going to survive the only thing we

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:30.560
need to make sure is that I mean we keep

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:33.360
in mind for one we can also suck up

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:35.220
active items we don't get to use them

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.860
but and that's I mean I guess what we

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:40.650
would want but we suck up active items

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:49.810
and then we can use those for black rune

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:52.680
later pretty bad placement there but

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:58.720
[Music]

00:14:52.680 --> 00:15:01.060
so we if we want to we should buy items

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:06.190
on the shop but it only if the money

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:08.980
really makes sense can't replace our

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:17.350
trinket only if the money really makes

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:19.720
sense which it does right now thankfully

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:21.130
but because like if we buy an item we're

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.720
not going to get to use the item we're

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.910
buying the item to basically buy a

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:27.190
random stat increase would we normally

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:29.680
pay 15 cents for a random stat increase

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:32.500
depending on the situation yeah I mean

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:34.090
if we haven't gotten stacked doesn't

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:37.320
seem like a bad use of our money as long

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:39.550
as you got enough of it to go around

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:43.030
this is our moment anyway so let's see

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:47.800
what we got in here it's a bad active so

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:50.410
we dumped we don't need to keep dumping

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:52.410
the consumables like that's we probably

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:55.540
just want to pick those up we go in here

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:58.090
you fight greed I would love to have

00:15:55.540 --> 00:16:01.960
Steam sale so I'm not going to pick that

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:04.060
up I'm not predicting that this is going

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:06.880
to be like the greatest role of all time

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:10.540
by the way on the on the black rune dice

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:12.100
but it would be pretty cool so check

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:15.130
this out we got pretty lucky because we

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:16.750
actually have a stars card now I'm just

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:18.070
a little skeptical about bow stretch by

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:20.500
the way because I don't know why I said

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:23.770
it like Baus rush as well but a little

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:25.360
skeptical about it bow rush because we

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:27.100
got some work to do here

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:30.430
we're a little slow is that a hot glass

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:32.170
to them algae's room we need the Stars

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:33.670
card for now and then we need black rune

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:37.260
later so the algae's room does not have

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:37.260
a there's no shell that fits it

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:42.760
hopefully we beat the odds and get a

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:46.110
deal with the devil that we basically

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:46.110
have no business with

00:16:48.459 --> 00:16:53.199
what he's like fully solid at the back

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:56.329
there bro

00:16:53.199 --> 00:17:01.010
he's been cultivating mass for four

00:16:56.329 --> 00:17:03.350
years just to kick our butt we could

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:04.970
really use some damage like we did it

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:06.410
was really nice and we had ten damage

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:08.480
there temporarily I thought my dreams

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:11.299
had come true someone's been reading my

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.790
diary instead we just get HP it's okay

00:17:11.299 --> 00:17:15.709
take it go back here you suck up all

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:21.110
these items it's more fodder for the

00:17:15.709 --> 00:17:25.939
eventual black rune which we also need

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:31.700
to take with us and it would be really

00:17:25.939 --> 00:17:34.850
sweet to make boss rush happen we're

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:37.220
like two minutes behind schedule not

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:40.130
optimistic our damage is not such that I

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:42.380
feel like optimism is warranted here we

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:44.390
might have to forego boss rush save it

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:48.140
for a future run with you know a similar

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:49.640
kind of make up of items moving box has

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:53.410
only been in the game for like eight

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.410
days or something like that so

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:09.190
we're not really close so we're not

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:12.130
really close to death but we're also not

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:13.690
killing things particularly quickly that

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:15.130
was like a fail-safe move right there

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:16.930
we're not killing things particularly

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:19.330
quickly so we're kind of cutting that

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:20.710
weird little gulch between like the

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.270
damage we feel like we need to be doing

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:25.180
and then being able to get there as a

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:27.070
result to the fact that of course we are

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:32.530
taking damage to strength cards in a

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:35.440
black room well that is a pickle not

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:37.750
really we're going to keep our black

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:40.150
room for obvious uses later now this may

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:44.140
be I want a good passive here that's not

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:46.620
really a good passive sure it gives me

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:49.030
some extra bombs but I think it's worth

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:50.650
you know just sucking that item up and

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:54.760
turning it into a stat increase later I

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:59.380
guess if we had to we can also in a fit

00:18:54.760 --> 00:19:01.420
of desperation we could take all of our

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:04.810
items that we've stored up and injected

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:06.970
or not injected that's absurd but eject

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:10.450
it like we were a sea cucumber ejecting

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:12.520
our gonads into the seed to distract the

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:16.090
predator from you know the delicious sea

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:21.100
cucumber flesh look it up it actually

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:23.110
happens so the the panic move is we do

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.550
that black room get a huge statistical

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:26.740
increase it's like going super saiyan

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:31.600
but right now it's like going baby super

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:33.190
saiyan we need stack up like triple the

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.660
items and then I'll feel good about

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:40.060
cracking into that would become like

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:40.960
whoever the strongest super saiyan is I

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:44.860
don't know Gogeta

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:48.030
go go tanks or something like that get

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:51.270
sucked up okay

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:53.920
36 percent chance to deal with the devil

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:55.690
well you got to admit is better than it

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:59.500
was on the last floor this is probably a

00:19:55.690 --> 00:20:02.380
secret room dude

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:04.840
can this guy get ammo like can you

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:08.290
remove some of his ability to just fire

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:09.490
bones endlessly you never get a once

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:15.240
that guy gets you in his sights and

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:15.240
soldier 76 except with a bone soldier 69

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:21.840
no don't even try it

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:32.590
two spirit hearts is too good I almost

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:36.290
can't possibly okay fine I'll accept it

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:39.850
no not me and kg we're not the kind of

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:44.300
capacity to lead all right we'll do it

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:47.000
willingly as two kings wait a freaking

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:50.060
leanness to King okay so it's like I'm

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.520
no Jack Black felt like a referential

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:56.510
moment so I took it full card not

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:58.160
relevant it's gonna say referential for

00:20:56.510 --> 00:21:00.470
a second time there it's not fitting

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.780
though okay what do we want to hear we

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:08.510
got so much money I want not greed in

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:11.540
our shop good passive bad active good

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:13.670
passive improves our run bad active

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:16.250
really any active will probably buy to

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:17.600
become a stat increase but it would feel

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:19.250
like a bit of a waste if you like bought

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:22.070
red candle for that but we'd still do it

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:29.030
because it's the right course of action

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:32.590
I think we got enough bombs by the way

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:32.590
I've been like seriously mistaken

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:47.090
freaking leaders to key you got it and

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:52.430
then I mean you like gotta so what's the

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:58.340
actual game plan now right first we need

00:21:52.430 --> 00:22:00.429
a battery charge but well it's quite

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:03.830
simple

00:22:00.429 --> 00:22:08.080
now you spit out all the items wherever

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:11.240
you're able to and then you pick up

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:13.220
crooked penny and you try to double them

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:16.730
and then after you've tried to double

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:19.039
them you use black room whether or not I

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:21.169
actually go for the doubling will

00:22:19.039 --> 00:22:23.390
depends on how our run looks at that

00:22:21.169 --> 00:22:25.100
point might be as well I mean it's a

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:29.900
hundred percent is safer bet it might be

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:35.870
a better bet - just take the guaranteed

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:37.700
X number of stat increases and I'm

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:40.490
leaning towards that right now because I

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:42.380
mean have you seen the run as it stands

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:57.460
is kind of like a little underpowered

00:22:42.380 --> 00:23:00.679
twenty minutes - depths one come with me

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:02.120
okay definitely do not accidentally use

00:23:00.679 --> 00:23:03.710
the space bar item right now because you

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:05.630
will lose all your items forever but

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:07.730
anyway I've reserved the right to try

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:11.179
though that's the Seine and a half and

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:12.710
if it works old baby anyway what I was

00:23:11.179 --> 00:23:15.740
going to say is I've been mistakenly

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:20.090
under the impression that turbo bombs

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:22.179
make the bombs explode faster this is

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:25.220
not the case

00:23:22.179 --> 00:23:29.260
turbo bombs make it so you can place

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:32.690
bombs faster what a hilarious

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:37.460
misunderstanding thank God for this poop

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:39.440
man this guy's relentless no deal we

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:42.110
want this item so that's great news

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:46.370
we'll head down to our next floor to be

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:48.830
a great floor to get mama mega also a

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:49.970
great floor to not forget about the fact

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:52.890
that you're probably going to deposit

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:56.470
some items somewhere

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:58.480
even though curse of the lost is going

00:23:56.470 --> 00:24:00.580
to make you seem like you're good to go

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.320
you might want to double-check your map

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:05.320
for your vacate the premises just be

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:07.870
good time for two of diamonds more shop

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:12.450
items aisa hearts pretty much the same

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:15.539
thing what am i complaining about arcade

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:18.520
little risky because our HP is not I

00:24:15.539 --> 00:24:20.799
mean it's quite high actually but our

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.970
ability to survive on that HP is not

00:24:20.799 --> 00:24:23.830
great but I'll tell you what we'll play

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:26.980
a little bit we could use the luck I

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:34.230
would like blood bag go one more oh we

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:41.830
got our v bag we should if possible

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:43.029
suck up IV bag just to add one more item

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:46.080
to the collection now it might be a

00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:46.080
little finicky in here

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:55.990
remember the guaranteed bossfight

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:57.490
battery charge doesn't mean as much

00:24:55.990 --> 00:25:00.250
because we need a teleport card to take

00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:01.419
advantage of it now that we got a

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:03.640
battery charge right off the bat I think

00:25:01.419 --> 00:25:04.990
we take it think we just play it safe it

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.360
should be a big enough floor to get

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:11.320
everything sucked up here it is a little

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:15.549
finicky you know why not add a little

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:17.289
more to the top here just in case it is

00:25:15.549 --> 00:25:18.970
going to be a little finicky but I got

00:25:17.289 --> 00:25:21.580
the utmost faith that we can make this

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:23.380
work for ourselves I believe all of the

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:26.100
consumables are going to turn into a

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:30.390
single penny let me use the black room

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:33.580
so we might want to pick those up the

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:39.399
actual ideal for us is that it actually

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:41.110
just does not matter right we have no

00:25:39.399 --> 00:25:42.640
boss rush I was I was actually I was

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.750
catching myself thinking like well how

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.220
we're going to handle boss rush because

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:46.870
we want to make sure that we're sucking

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:48.070
items up not putting items down when we

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:49.809
start boss rush I guess you could just

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.799
put them down and then pick up one item

00:25:49.809 --> 00:25:51.970
and then suck them all up and then

00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:53.260
what's the point of doing boss rush

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:55.510
you're only picking up one item and then

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:57.159
you're doing boss rush so that's just

00:25:55.510 --> 00:26:00.399
doing boss rush that's not anything

00:25:57.159 --> 00:26:03.200
special I think we just take blood bag

00:26:00.399 --> 00:26:06.890
and say thank you for the opportunity

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:14.090
speed up means more the less damage we

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:15.740
have and our DPS is pretty subpar five

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:18.410
point nine three damage it's not

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:20.720
terrible but you know we're not killing

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:23.930
most enemies as quickly as I'd like and

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:26.120
that battery charge is huge so now we at

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:28.340
least can get an item from our shop or

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.810
item room if we want to and it will

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:35.960
require the right kind of items to be in

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:38.270
there ie bad items so we could suck up

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:43.910
both the polaroid and the negative and

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:46.240
then pop them down later and suck up the

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:49.400
negative or the polaroid for that matter

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:51.500
with the black room I don't think we

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:54.770
should because it just it introduces

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:56.060
another element of uncertainty in the

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:58.010
sense that we need to be able to have

00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:00.740
two charges one to put all of our items

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:02.720
down and then another to suck them all

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:04.100
plus Polaroid backup and we need them

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:06.410
all to be on the same room because we

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:08.000
can't get back into alright we can't get

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:10.850
back out of the mob fight once we go in

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.800
without risking losing black room so

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:15.620
yeah it's kind of complicated here I

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:18.560
feel like I might be using the moving

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:22.040
box wrong or I might be moving it or

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:24.260
using it so right that society hasn't

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:26.600
like caught up to me as a total powder

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:29.420
situation happens to me all the time you

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:31.610
know you're just a little too advanced

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:33.620
for the for the sheeple out there and

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:35.540
you come up with these bold strategies

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:36.950
right off the dome piece that everyone

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.810
goes oh my god you must have worked in

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:41.480
the field of moving box technology for

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:43.790
years and I say no son this is my first

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:50.990
day on the job and then they create hand

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:52.850
me a crisp $100 percent bill good good

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:56.060
damage that's that sacrificial damage to

00:27:52.850 --> 00:28:00.890
the damage god there's no point in Steam

00:27:56.060 --> 00:28:05.660
sale here so I'm going to use one bomb

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:09.170
if we buy Steam sale it's gone this is

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:11.960
sick though so you buy this and then you

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:14.780
use it it didn't make the item I wanted

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.280
to be free free there's a teleport card

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:23.670
but

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:25.930
then you suck it all up like so and

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:28.840
we've added another item to our

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:30.580
collection good good damage that's so we

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:33.970
call in the business we call that good

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:35.860
damage because it was a smart idea to do

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:39.220
that and totally wasn't a mistake to get

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:42.760
hit twice on the same room then here

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:44.110
this is I mean actually amazing but we

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.990
couldn't have really done anything

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:50.350
differently if we'd wanted to so

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:54.190
pyromaniac does an unbelievably positive

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:58.060
thing for us here it's not impossible to

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:59.800
die but it's pretty hard to do so now so

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:03.130
we really should just save our HP for

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:09.360
that or save our bombs for HP at this

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:09.360
point I think there we go

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:16.150
well it's pretty much the best possible

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:19.840
we can't get hit by mom's foot anymore

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:23.080
so we should just leave the tier on top

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:24.640
of us whenever possible although now we

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:31.180
can't get hit by fire mine explosions

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:33.250
anymore either so life's good man you're

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:38.980
deflecting me but you are not deflecting

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:40.180
the tear we have a hundred percent deal

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:43.610
with the devil chance which is

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:46.680
incredible at least for now

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:46.680
[Music]

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:53.290
but we don't I mean we sort of we could

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:55.360
no we can't suck it up we're just paying

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:57.370
to have a spear at heart it's not the

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:59.740
right call third to have a demon heart I

00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:03.690
should say and we take this with us now

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:07.390
I think we start to get a little I

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:09.940
wouldn't say concerned but I will say it

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:17.559
might be the right time to start

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:19.360
thinking about use in the black room in

00:30:17.559 --> 00:30:21.280
fact that might have been the right time

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:23.500
to use the black room dump all of our

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:25.450
items by Satanic Bible and then use

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:27.040
black rune on all of the items including

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:30.010
the moving box which we no longer need

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:31.809
but I don't think we lose much by you

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:34.150
know extending our run a little bit

00:30:31.809 --> 00:30:35.830
longer in the absurd direction we're not

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:38.860
getting too many more items we're not

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:44.500
getting item rooms at all and we're not

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:48.240
going to shops at all getting one item

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:51.850
from each boss occasionally right like

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:53.740
it's just going to slow us down here re

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:55.090
are our growth is going to slow down a

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:57.610
little bit by virtue of where we are in

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:59.080
the run now we could go to the chest and

00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:01.840
try to suck up every item we get on the

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:03.250
chest the reason I sort of don't like

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:04.870
that is because we never get any time

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:06.730
then to play around with the items that

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:09.040
we got or the stat bonuses that we got

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:10.570
from the chest so I think that maybe

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:14.070
this is our time so I'm going to do this

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:16.150
floor with the the standard protocol and

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:20.230
then I'm going to go for the greatest

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:24.220
like octo black rune play in Earth's

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:26.260
short history from a cosmic sense at

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:28.720
least so it's going to happen pretty

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:29.830
fast here this also gives us the benefit

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:35.080
of being able to black room whatever

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:36.850
this item is if we hate it or if it's a

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:38.230
space bar item like the ability to fly

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:40.809
we could take that in black or in the

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:47.169
moving box which would be oh okay well

00:31:40.809 --> 00:31:50.460
you know as predicted in literally like

00:31:47.169 --> 00:31:50.460
the last sentence I honored

00:31:51.149 --> 00:31:56.940
could be interesting I think we'd rather

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:58.559
have the ability to fly then pick up the

00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:00.809
moving box again but you know what I'm

00:31:58.559 --> 00:32:03.509
content to say the moving box I still

00:32:00.809 --> 00:32:05.759
have no idea how it works but it was fun

00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:07.589
to use here we got to deal with the

00:32:05.759 --> 00:32:09.269
devil anyway which is surprising we

00:32:07.589 --> 00:32:10.889
could get a passive ability oh can you

00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:12.659
dump all the stuff here and then you

00:32:10.889 --> 00:32:19.799
take this instead but not did you go for

00:32:12.659 --> 00:32:21.539
the extra bombs let's do it I'll take it

00:32:19.799 --> 00:32:23.009
it's 2 HP for a passive ability to fly

00:32:21.539 --> 00:32:29.190
and then the active ability to fly will

00:32:23.009 --> 00:32:32.580
use for its active effect what kind of

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:35.009
person would I be if I didn't try to

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:37.469
double this especially now that I have

00:32:35.009 --> 00:32:40.190
the passive ability to fly moving box

00:32:37.469 --> 00:32:45.059
don't let me down he's done it

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:46.019
get some Sun alright that was I stood

00:32:45.059 --> 00:32:50.539
off out of my chair and that's

00:32:46.019 --> 00:32:53.460
ridiculous but look at that the stats

00:32:50.539 --> 00:32:55.379
were out of control and we go crooked

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:57.899
penny for us your long-term as well I

00:32:55.379 --> 00:33:00.509
have no idea like go back you can see

00:32:57.899 --> 00:33:04.559
but it was like a five damage or four

00:33:00.509 --> 00:33:06.719
damage increase maybe a for a better

00:33:04.559 --> 00:33:08.999
tear stat we're had to speed right now a

00:33:06.719 --> 00:33:15.239
shot speeds through the roof our luck

00:33:08.999 --> 00:33:19.409
went up by five was actually like we

00:33:15.239 --> 00:33:22.139
just you know won a game of Monopoly in

00:33:19.409 --> 00:33:26.309
a single swing right there I was like

00:33:22.139 --> 00:33:29.339
look alright give credit where credit is

00:33:26.309 --> 00:33:32.339
due we got lucky with that crooked penny

00:33:29.339 --> 00:33:36.619
play but we sacrificed a little bit to

00:33:32.339 --> 00:33:40.549
make the moving box work and it worked

00:33:36.619 --> 00:33:43.769
and then we walked into a red pooping

00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:47.279
invalidated my you know craves of myself

00:33:43.769 --> 00:33:51.479
oh dude that was pretty sweet that might

00:33:47.279 --> 00:33:55.710
be moving box 101 but come on we

00:33:51.479 --> 00:33:57.719
orchestrated a plan on we don't need any

00:33:55.710 --> 00:34:01.799
of these consumables we orchestrated a

00:33:57.719 --> 00:34:03.509
plan on like the caves one and we wrote

00:34:01.799 --> 00:34:04.050
it all the way down to the womb one and

00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:06.510
it

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:08.250
paid off it's not the craziest run we've

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:10.560
ever seen like the stats are still not

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:14.130
in fact the shot speed is almost a

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:17.100
little annoying it's so fast yeah I know

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:18.840
I'm so rich my wallet is it makes my

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:20.250
butt fall asleep when I sit on it I get

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:24.030
I'm complaining about having great stats

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:26.280
nobody wants to hear that but it's like

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:28.020
I'm telling you about Lovelace and I'm

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:31.320
saying he's got mad weapons - I ain't

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:35.220
trying to hear that 14 bombs we should

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:37.950
pick up every bomb I know this one back

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:42.030
here this is just like protect your

00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:44.130
investment you know we made a good play

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:45.630
on this run don't let it die for no

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:48.240
reason sure we could play those blood

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:49.740
banks I think that would be stupid I

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:57.840
think that would be an idiot decision

00:34:49.740 --> 00:35:00.210
than an idiot would make and they say

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:01.860
that a man who represents himself in

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:03.900
court has a fool for his client well

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:08.730
ladies and gentlemen of the jury I am

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:12.930
that fool name that movie Barry

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:14.700
Sonnenfeld 1992 RAL Julia in the title

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:16.260
role well a lot of people in the title

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:21.080
role technically because it's the Addams

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:21.080
Family get IMDb's son

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:29.119
so I'm you can feel what the devil will

00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:35.539
be nice don't get me wrong I don't

00:35:29.119 --> 00:35:38.869
deserve it took some bad damage didn't

00:35:35.539 --> 00:35:40.309
get a deal with the devil that's life we

00:35:38.869 --> 00:35:42.260
have one obligation right now and it's

00:35:40.309 --> 00:35:43.460
to ourselves we have two obligations one

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:46.760
to ourselves one of the audience we got

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:51.260
to win this run because we brought the

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:53.000
ruckus and it would hurt to bring the

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:55.520
ruckus and then have the ruckus be

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.470
removed as if a you don't need to bring

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.700
the ruckus somebody else signed up to

00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:01.940
bring the ruckus you were supposed to

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:05.270
bring cups like the that's such an

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:06.680
unrealistic joke because nobody who's

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:08.450
ever signed up to bring cups has

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.859
forgotten cups cups for the easiest job

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:10.849
at the potluck we've talked about this

00:36:09.859 --> 00:36:14.270
like 70 times

00:36:10.849 --> 00:36:15.170
everybody wants cups and then you know

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:17.359
you're sorry

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:19.940
Jeremy's already on cups alright well

00:36:17.359 --> 00:36:23.329
take place well actually cups is like

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:26.900
all paper flatware so Jeremy's got

00:36:23.329 --> 00:36:32.869
plates too and yes forks and knives

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:35.240
I guess I'll bring soda that's like the

00:36:32.869 --> 00:36:37.039
second always somebody wants to sign up

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:41.569
I'll bring my grandma's special potato

00:36:37.039 --> 00:36:46.130
salad recipe shut up Jennifer it's just

00:36:41.569 --> 00:36:48.890
a jar of mayonnaise and a can of little

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:51.309
white potatoes mashed together it's not

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:53.359
that good nobody wants to tell you

00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:54.890
grandma stole it out of a cookbook

00:36:53.359 --> 00:37:00.049
called making it work in the Great

00:36:54.890 --> 00:37:02.170
Depression not that there's anything

00:37:00.049 --> 00:37:04.549
wrong with that but it's like you know

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:06.500
bringing it dirt so I'm not insulting

00:37:04.549 --> 00:37:10.309
potato salad I just I'm picking a fight

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:12.049
with the wrong food we already have one

00:37:10.309 --> 00:37:15.289
no we don't have one steam cell today

00:37:12.049 --> 00:37:17.809
again steam sale I wish it did something

00:37:15.289 --> 00:37:19.279
else not because it's bad but because

00:37:17.809 --> 00:37:23.059
when you pick it up at this point of the

00:37:19.279 --> 00:37:26.569
game you just go oh okay like it

00:37:23.059 --> 00:37:28.549
actually there is no world in which the

00:37:26.569 --> 00:37:31.970
Steam sale provides you with any benefit

00:37:28.549 --> 00:37:33.440
unless if you did a victory lap but you

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:35.750
can't do a victory lap if you're on the

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:46.820
Cathedral so

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:50.060
you know get dunked on discourse we're

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:52.370
not quite as safe as I would like to be

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:55.100
but I would say we're not far away from

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:58.250
safety of course I'm going to try to use

00:37:55.100 --> 00:38:00.740
a swallowed penny which is actually

00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:02.480
crooked penny more frequently I'm just

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:04.250
stoked that we are hurtling towards this

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:06.470
is like wind three or four in a row I

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:10.760
think I might be back I'm hoping I'm

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:12.440
back this run was never amazing but it

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:15.410
did start with a little bit of momentum

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:16.670
and the stat increase just like kicked

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:17.930
it into high gear I mean we were like

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:22.100
twenty-eight minutes or something when

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:23.780
we got out of the oil cheese and I mean

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:27.290
that's fine we're at like twenty-eight

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:29.180
minutes when we got out of the the

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:30.410
depths to so within six minutes we made

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:32.320
it down to the Cathedral it's a pretty

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:34.610
good stock they also have nineteen

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:38.540
health and reserve if you count all of

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:42.770
our bombs here so it's not very likely

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:45.410
that we're going to die not all tear

00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:49.240
effects created equal but that's a

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:51.830
perfect one for that room there we go

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:53.720
I've just dawned on me I don't even

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:55.610
remember what Virgo does it's occasional

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:59.900
invincibility after we take damage I

00:38:55.610 --> 00:39:00.740
think it's an item that usually is so

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:04.100
irrelevant

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:06.110
I barely remember that it even exists

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:14.780
the invincibility could prove useful

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:20.630
sometimes bomb bag I mean it's more HP

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:22.490
and reserved try to double our next

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:27.290
chests maybe or you know these guys they

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:31.180
can drop HP and we know it's HP please

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:31.180
just stop exploding

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:35.520
well it's not what we're looking for I

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:37.530
mean like HP upgrades in case that

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:43.290
wasn't abundantly clear he's going to

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:45.510
say it next chest we'll try to double

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:48.390
though that wing you can already

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:50.340
passively fly might have petered out a

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:52.500
little bit in terms of its like momentum

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:55.470
towards the end here but you got to

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:57.270
admit that's like a top top ten I don't

00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:59.040
know because we've had some you know

00:39:57.270 --> 00:40:01.200
good moments in Isaac over the years but

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:03.990
that's like a top ten afterbirth +

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:05.610
moment without a doubt finally using the

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:07.560
moving box properly to get some good

00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:10.670
stuff done especially when you remember

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:13.260
the track record that led up to it

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:15.900
having that you know a few terrible

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:17.540
performances an ill founded conspiracy

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:21.030
theory about the game getting harder

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:23.160
then I only like 20% seriously believed

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:26.010
in but like if you believe in it too

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:27.780
then I like 95% believe in it actually

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:32.850
because like come on did you see the

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:34.530
results they speak for themselves might

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:37.230
have just been on Phil Full Tilt Poker

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:39.750
calm though but today we got a day

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:42.120
that's chock-full of wins in my

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:43.320
recording session at least got to take

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:45.240
that item and then you got to double

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:46.770
that one it's just science you take this

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:49.200
one you double that one look at that SMB

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:50.850

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:53.360

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:53.360
