##

00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.290
everybody welcome back to northernlion

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.730
plays The Binding of Isaac a droid plus

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.000
we're going through these like splash

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.500
screens like they ain't nothin at all

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.840
man I don't know what that's supposed to

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.599
mean either way let's do an Eden

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.590
greeting run here not green here yet cuz

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.230
again I think we have to go through all

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.100
that we kind of can't even again

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:25.199
sometimes life is good NT for envy vb0

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.689
the shears is also I mean our stats are

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.119
not great I'll just give you that HP is

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:35.630
pretty good which is valuable but the

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.630
shears are like a 10 out of 10 item here

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.920
we can get value out of a key if we have

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.820
to the shears are a 10 out of 10 item

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.789
here for everything up to but probably

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.379
not quite including the actual green

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.449
fight itself although I think we have it

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.699
for the super green fight at the end and

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.420
that's fine as well

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:59.160
but it might actually be like STR level

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.199
4 green mode in fact I don't want to be

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.140
I don't want to suck all the value out

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.299
of these episodes in advance by saying

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.220
we're going to win like guaranteed but

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.310
it might even be like what's above X

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.070
here like Zeta Prime's here this is like

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.930
a Zeta prime to your item because we're

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.590
going to be able to use shears multiple

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.360
times per room as long as we play our

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.250
cards right and the way that we play our

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.610
cards right I think is actually very

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.409
very simple like for example we just use

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.259
another shears right here and then we

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.240
never leave this room we fight the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.170
bosses we pipes a deal with the devil

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.240
wave all in one go that way we don't

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.220
lose the existing shear setup that we

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.530
got going on here now are we going to

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.600
get another charge it might take us like

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.770
slightly longer but look at the speed at

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.110
which we're able to get through the the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.840
first floor of greed mode is a little

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.189
bit on the ridiculous side plus we

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.409
should be spending very little money on

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.320
HP so I'm kind of loving this right now

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.439
and not even in the but up up up a sort

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.180
of way hopefully we get angel deals cuz

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.170
black powder with no speed is just not a

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.230
good choice so the first thing you do is

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:16.019
grab a key

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.060
like we probably go for range and tiers

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.000
with a little extra HP associated with

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.810
it and then we just head down to the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.340
next floor

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.250
after getting 99 bombs is really good

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.959
it's really really good so we're going

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.849
to blow these guys up now that things

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.069
have changed slightly now takes us to

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:38.010
nine cents then we're going to ruin this

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:41.700
donation machines existence we could go

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.440
for like a two of diamonds if we see one

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.500
but it is a risk we're looking for

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.000
half-price items right now including a

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.379
Half Price key even though it doesn't

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.030
seem like it'd be worth that much I

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.069
don't think it's worth buying extra shot

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.099
speed I mean we use six bombs there

00:02:53.069 --> 00:03:00.750
that's basically no cost as far as I'm

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:02.220
concerned it's a very very good start I

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.439
liked it is my first video the day

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.430
normally I like to talk about Isaac a

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:09.540
little bit to start ease into things

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.569
then we'll get off into the zanier

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.310
tangents like you know for example we

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.750
talked about on the LSS the other day or

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.660
no it was in a battlegrounds video

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.299
either way what constitutes fried

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.410
chicken

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.730
Austin seems to be of the opinion that

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.750
any chicken that's fried is fried

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.000
chicken and I know some of you

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.260
literalists out there probably agreeing

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.190
with them even though it's ridiculous

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.319
because for me

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.579
fried chicken tell me what you're

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.079
missing kissing on a man while I'm

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:38.010
working in the kitchen is exclusively

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:41.639
chicken fried in the you know American

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.780
South style it's not boneless you pick

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.280
it up you eat it with your hands it

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.590
comes in a bucket that's a principle

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.449
element here okay now we have 87 keys

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:56.870
and no bombs I think we should save this

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:59.129
like save the question mark card and and

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.139
use the devil card like right now

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:06.690
because we can't take two with us and

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:09.229
then in here it is good that we have 87

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.940
keys because we can you know do that I

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:14.729
don't think we care about buying HP play

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:18.630
what we'll try add that that didn't even

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:20.219
blow up this over here in an empress

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.529
card dude there's too many cards that

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:24.300
accomplish exactly the same thing our

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:27.720
bombs are worth almost nothing those

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.970
so uh looks just before we even worry

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.159
about this let's just step on this you

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.370
know get the party started on a Saturday

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:34.379
night

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.919
everybody's moving and I'm feeling

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:39.449
alright did you know and this surprised

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.889
me anyway we'll get back to the fried

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.210
chicken thing maybe you know it might be

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.889
like a week or so in a battleground

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.419
video but I'll talk to Austin about it

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.550
and say buddy what are you talking about

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:48.180
you think chicken nuggets are fried

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.110
chicken

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.280
it's literally chicken that's fried I

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:57.270
get what you're saying but it's not how

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.940
the English language works you know a

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.740
chicken strip is not literally a chicken

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.020
finger is not literally the finger of a

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.050
chicken we're going to approach pure

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.150
absurdity here so what are our tell you

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.419
because this is ridiculous where are ten

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.550
out of ten items here it looked like one

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:20.159
of them ate my money I don't respect

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:23.219
that the actual ten out of ten items

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:28.259
here are 9-volt triple-a battery

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:30.479
none tab and maybe it looks like we're

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:32.009
getting one room or anyway there we had

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:35.130
an equilibrium when it comes to waves

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:38.729
we'll see in a sec here I guess we can

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:42.479
fight angel statues now I don't think we

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:44.340
want to get a key piece that's not

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:47.599
really worth anything for us at the

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.979
present moment in my opinion at least so

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:51.120
we're done with this floor early as well

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:53.069
let's try the pills we might as well

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.680
honestly get risky on this episode

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:57.949
because we're not really missing out on

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:04.949
anything hello there it looks nice

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:08.000
you're welcome how so oh yeah this

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:10.750
because I've got two sets of ears here

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:16.070
all right

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:19.280
this is actually all great we can only

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:22.460
buy two I know I said nun's habit is a

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.620
ten out of ten this is like you know the

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:28.100
perfect screw marry kill episode right

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:30.680
here I think we want tarot claws because

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.170
it's just a gorgeous item oh do it and

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.470
then you want car batteries we got

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:38.600
pretty lucky there but car battery is

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.130
actually something I didn't conceive of

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.890
but it's way better than all the other

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.660
items here I just being straight up with

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.430
you it might be a little bit on the

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.040
boring side but I think the best option

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.620
that we have right now is just to stack

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.890
up make sure we have $0.99 with which to

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.300
finish this run because I don't think as

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.210
long as we're getting HP I don't think

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.520
we can lose we played this like

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:03.440
accidentally exactly correct so I would

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.980
say you know look for items that can

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:09.290
give you more money which none of these

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.520
apply of course but look for items that

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.140
can give you more money and apart from

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.080
that just stack it up this is like the

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:20.960
easiest greed mode run of actual

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:24.020
all-time and now with car battery we

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.490
actually only have to use I think at

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:30.860
least we only have the use shears once

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:33.310
yet to get to shears voice Paul's as I

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.310
call them

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:40.620
justice which means we can afford I

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:45.090
think to kind of reset our situation

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:46.650
right here by not using shears twice on

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:48.599
this floor we don't need four shears

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:51.629
boys we don't need for Paul's that would

00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:54.270
just be ridiculous I'll just save you

00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:55.319
the Wikipedia for those of you who are

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.240
unaware what I'm talking about Paul

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:59.759
Scheer is an American you know writer

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:03.000

get made podcast on the Earwolf network

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:22.949
get dust did not quite not quite not

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.270
quite a dusting if you had to rank the

00:08:22.949 --> 00:08:27.930
chores that you have to do around the

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:30.389
house where do they rank I'm going to

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:33.599
like s to your chores chores I do not

00:08:30.389 --> 00:08:36.029
mind doing it all yeah let's grab I

00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:38.419
don't mind doing the laundry I'm going

00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:42.959
to be honest with you the laundry is a

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:43.919
high tier chore here's why how long does

00:08:42.959 --> 00:08:46.050
it take to do the laundry

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:47.550
it takes a long-ass time I'm going to be

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:50.339
honest with you you can't leave the

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:52.290
house really I guess you can do let's do

00:08:50.339 --> 00:08:54.660
it do you could leave your stuff in the

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:56.480
in the washer or the dryer although I

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:59.459
wouldn't necessarily recommend it

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.660
especially the washer well it's tough

00:08:59.459 --> 00:09:02.190
you know because if you leave your

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.230
clothes in the washer they might get a

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.760
little stinky depending on how long you

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.950
leave them if you leave your clothes in

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:11.459
the dryer they might get a little

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:16.230
wrinkly but is that so bad versus the

00:09:11.459 --> 00:09:20.520
stinky I don't know hello NL hello you

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:23.459
Suqian LLL go play Issac ugly more pills

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.709
I thought about blank card nods that's

00:09:23.459 --> 00:09:27.209
fine but I think we're better off like

00:09:25.709 --> 00:09:31.350
this again we want to save enough money

00:09:27.209 --> 00:09:32.970
for our for our greed donation machine

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:35.310
if we could donate like fifty cents plus

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:37.470
here that'd be awesome but sometimes

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:39.149
people go you know I can't come out that

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:41.339
I got to do laundry you know what is

00:09:39.149 --> 00:09:43.290
doing the laundry entail you got a

00:09:41.339 --> 00:09:44.459
hamper it's got clothes in it all day if

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.630
it doesn't have clothes in it yet we'll

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:47.040
stop throwing your clothes on the ground

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:48.000
you weirdo start throwing them in the

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:54.150
hamper

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:56.580
pampers just sorted ground oh that's I

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:58.410
mean the most minimal value but value

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.420
nonetheless and we might as well keep

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:01.380
this as well you take your clothes out

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.600
of the hamper I'm going to be honest

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:05.280
you're going to be like do we need to go

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.840
don't you need to separate the white

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.030
clothes from the clothes that are not

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.470
white this is not correct I mean maybe

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:13.080
you do but that strikes me it's like

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:15.360
some 19:40 stuff my mom still does that

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:18.540
but I am it almost at the point where

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:23.400
I'm my mom why I've been doing my

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:25.620
laundry unseparated for okay just cool

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:28.560
it a little bit here I've been doing my

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:30.990
laundry unseparated for like over ten

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.430
years in college I said to myself I'm

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:35.340
going to separate that stuff I'm going

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:41.430
to make you just won't attack that guy

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:43.710
huh well that's scary I'm just going to

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:46.140
you know make the laundry prove to me

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:47.310
that it needs to be separated and

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.720
honestly they've played very well

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.610
together and I'm very proud of them as a

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.710
result so you throw it in the washer you

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:56.370
throw in some detergent you set that to

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:58.470
normal you let it run until it beeps you

00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:02.370
take it out you put it in the dryer I

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:03.870
think we need to hear you let it run in

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.180
the put a little dryer sheet in there

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:08.670
maybe let it run until it beeps you take

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:11.100
it out and you fold it 80% of the labor

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:13.920
and doing laundry if not more is the

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:17.190
folding algorithm that you choose to

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.880
approach so you get a lot of credit for

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:19.200
doing the laundry

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:22.550
but the laundry doesn't take a lot of

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:24.780
time all things considered and it's

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:27.330
extremely important it's it's the

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:29.520
perfect intersection of chores because

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:31.740
it has to be done it's not a quality of

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:34.710
life thing like you need clean underwear

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:36.750
if you think you don't please take it

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:40.200
from me you need clean underwear socks

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:41.910
you know among every other item of

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.100
clothing that exists I had to leave I

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.600
was getting a little nervous there you

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.370
can always buy this for two cents feel a

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:50.430
little better we already have to hit

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:51.630
some enemies which scares me I don't

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:53.760
want to use the question mark card until

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:56.420
we fight super greed because he's super

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.420
greedy dude

00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:01.779
so yeah laundry's like a top-tier one

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.580
for me we had a discussion on the show

00:12:01.779 --> 00:12:08.380
recently well it's probably like you

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:09.670
know a hundred years ago but I don't

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.720
think it's good enough it's close but

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:12.130
it's not quite good enough we don't need

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.399
pay to play at this point we certainly

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:17.170
don't want clicker

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:19.300
okay piercing shots are quite solid

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:21.580
we'll take that and might get enough

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.899
money to get science but we're kind of

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:25.870
in a scary spot here because we're on

00:12:22.899 --> 00:12:27.610
our own for killing these enemies we got

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:32.220
tons of time to kill them so just maybe

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:35.589
don't try to go too fast and the

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:38.890
question is like would you rather do

00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:40.480
dishes or clean the toilet and both Josh

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.830
I agree with Josh is the most reasonable

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.870
thing this man has ever said in his

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:45.490
entire life both Josh and I had the same

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:48.670
opinion I would much rather clean the

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:52.510
toilet and do the dishes the toilet is a

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:57.089
is a bit of a grosser chore but the

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:59.950
dishes are like they take so much longer

00:12:57.089 --> 00:13:01.300
if you've got like a really I mean how

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:03.520
often do you clean the toilet versus how

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:06.130
often do you do the dishes I know you're

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.390
saying do the dishes you know every time

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.339
after you eat and you won't have to do

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:11.079
them in one big swell is it's not really

00:13:09.339 --> 00:13:12.640
a concern we have a dishwasher show some

00:13:11.079 --> 00:13:13.779
of the dishes just pile up we've put

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:17.230
them in the dishwasher it doesn't take

00:13:13.779 --> 00:13:20.110
that long but cleaning the toilet is

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:22.180
grosser but also it takes like you know

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:24.459
one eighth of the time and I don't mind

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:28.839
you know it's my it's my waste so I'll

00:13:24.459 --> 00:13:30.910
clean that up no problem I'm okay with

00:13:28.839 --> 00:13:32.380
vacuuming but I don't think I'm good at

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:34.240
it because vacuuming requires that you

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:36.250
maintain like a mental map of the places

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.839
you vacuumed unless you have like if you

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.579
got a carpet floor you can sort of do

00:13:37.839 --> 00:13:40.990
like a lawnmower thing and make patterns

00:13:39.579 --> 00:13:43.120
in the carpet so you know where you bend

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:47.020
if you got wood you got to like keep a

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:49.420
mental map and then you know you got it

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:51.760
you got to get a separate tool and drag

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:54.790
it out and it's fine it's like a beefier

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:58.390
chore in my personal opinion trying to

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:59.709
get like what the worst ones are you're

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:01.360
really going to make me do another wave

00:13:59.709 --> 00:14:03.930
here aren't you how long are you going

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.930
to make me wave

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:15.040
okay I should not be doing this but I

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:18.910
also just really want one of you to be

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:21.579
dusted this is like the most classic

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:23.829
northernlion bit of commentary at this

00:14:21.579 --> 00:14:32.160
point but if ur as good as this run is

00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:34.060
we do still have 2.8 damage which

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.459
usually I follow that up with the

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:38.050
standard you know default parameter of

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:39.760
it's not the worst in the world but

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:42.760
really 2.8 damage this late in the game

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:44.410
is really really bad we're 100%

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:46.930
insulated from it when we get the

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:49.690
opportunity to use our shears and I

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:53.019
think that that will sustain until the

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:54.490
end of the game however we do need to

00:14:53.019 --> 00:14:56.769
make sure that we're using our shears

00:14:54.490 --> 00:15:00.399
perfectly appropriately and we got kind

00:14:56.769 --> 00:15:02.170
of thrown off base here when our shears

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:03.880
just decided to stop attacking enemies

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:07.600
which I was not necessarily a big fan of

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:09.519
hey I like this though I will say

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:12.250
vacuuming you know it beats sweeping

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:14.829
sweeping is vacuuming is analog

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:16.480
vacuuming let me rephrase that because I

00:15:14.829 --> 00:15:20.050
kind of like that quote sweeping is

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:23.500
analog vacuuming better for the smaller

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:25.029
the task the better sweeping is and of

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:30.149
course with glass you've got no choice

00:15:25.029 --> 00:15:30.149
oh why not

00:15:30.529 --> 00:15:44.749
I don't want to go to the we should have

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.649
had that doesn't matter because think we

00:15:44.749 --> 00:15:47.449
should have gotten the little horn

00:15:45.649 --> 00:15:48.829
because it's tax it's a fear effect

00:15:47.449 --> 00:15:50.749
right so it would be better for us to

00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:54.249
have a little horn with soymilk

00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:54.249
considering how fast we're shooting but

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:59.480
either way try to think of like the

00:15:58.009 --> 00:16:01.910
worst tier chores

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:03.410
I hate mowing the lawn and I know that

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:04.040
that's a I haven't had to do it in a

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:06.589
long time

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:08.930
mowing the lawn and shoveling snow I am

00:16:06.589 --> 00:16:10.670
oh I can't believe I said that that was

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:12.139
on ironic you're gonna have to take my

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:16.120
word for it but my brain was like yeah

00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:16.120
just say I am oh here that'll sound good

00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:22.699
rarely do you hear about chores killing

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:23.990
people every year in Canada and I'm sure

00:16:22.699 --> 00:16:25.189
you know parts of other parts of the

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:27.680
world for sure

00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:30.199
you know a couple of men before their

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:34.970
prime keel over because the snows

00:16:30.199 --> 00:16:36.889
freakin heavy the heaviest chore well I

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:40.790
don't know if that's true but it's up

00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:43.910
there this is going nowhere I take no

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:46.490
pleasure in washing a car that's why

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:47.899
mankind invented those auto car washes

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:51.290
that you just you know drive your car

00:16:47.899 --> 00:16:52.939
into it doesn't get your cars clean not

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:54.949
you don't understand it does by my

00:16:52.939 --> 00:16:56.930
standards I'm driving I'm not driving I

00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:59.809
murdered out you know Lamborghini

00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:02.660
Murcielago I'm driving a very you know

00:16:59.809 --> 00:17:06.199
sensible and contemporary domestic sedan

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:09.409
it basically just has to not have you

00:17:06.199 --> 00:17:12.550
know bloodstains and too much animal

00:17:09.409 --> 00:17:16.600
feces and then it's good to go

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:19.300
I don't know what to do on this run and

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:27.580
it makes me feel bad because the run is

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:31.000
great but at the same time maybe it

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:34.210
isn't what I mean is at the same time

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:38.470
it's also sort of like awful at least in

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:40.720
terms of our raw stats I feel like I

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:49.720
should know what that is after this much

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:52.380
time in the game but as long as I mean

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:54.400
winning well no no no let's rephrase

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.600
entertainment is the most important

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.250
thing here you know we've already done

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:59.320
everything here it's not like we get one

00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:00.580
shot at it and then it's done forever

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.570
many people have been saying you know

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.420
when are you going to do challenges

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:05.830
again yeah I mean we're going to do them

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:07.840
when specifically I don't know but yet

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:09.310
there are there on the list as is like

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:12.970
literally everything I know it sounds

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:14.860
like I'm being dismissive fear criticism

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:17.200
here and there not criticism but you

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:19.390
know genuine kind of questioning that's

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.860
a bad habit of minded answer a

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:23.230
questioning kind of a smart aleck II

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:24.790
voice that might diminish the you know

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:25.990
self-esteem of the person asking and I

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:28.150
don't know why I do it I guess it's

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:29.620
because I feel it's it's audacious to

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:33.610
even be asked a question it's a great

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:34.960
personal flaw of mine I suppose you know

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:36.700
it should practice being a little bit

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.210
more genuine in my reactions to people

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:41.950
I've now is the bad place to be

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:44.440
thank you for your interest in this

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:46.120
series challenges will proceed at a

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.930
later point in the future but certainly

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.510
there's something that I'm looking

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:50.260
forward to doing that's a much nicer way

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:55.240
of doing it

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:57.010
perhaps so entertainments the most

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.930
important thing which is why we've got

00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:00.640
off on this chores power ranking episode

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:01.780
here I meant to talk about this on the

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.400
show today

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:07.240
which starts in like 40 minutes because

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:09.310
I know everybody is going to have some

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.870
divisive opinions I just know you know

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:12.430
Austin's gonna show up and be like my

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:14.350
favorite chore is mopping I'll be like

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:17.680
why I just like the feeling of mopping

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:21.460
you're crazy it's all about laundry man

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:23.840
you just pop a movie on

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:25.070
start folding before you know it you've

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:38.200
got another week's worth of fresh

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:38.200
clothes their second most important is a

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:45.080
little frightened here second most

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:52.010
important is you know accomplishing our

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:58.610
post-it note objectives here great time

00:19:52.010 --> 00:20:00.770
for you to pop up thank you so much in

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:03.560
order to accomplish our post-it note

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:05.480
objectives we do have to live and we

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:10.990
have to beat greed dude look at this

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:10.990
damage look at it

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:17.540
take a look you know just we do have

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:21.620
0.56 damage I just want to point that

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:23.510
out there this could be Krampus that the

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.560
I don't know if you take a full heart of

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:26.450
damage down here that would have been

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:30.050
quite scary so I'm thankful for this

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:35.750
free spirit art I don't think we should

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:41.090
try to fight blue baby who is actually

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:42.800
greed with 0 HP so I'm going to I'm

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:45.460
going to make some compromises here that

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:47.960
I'm not necessarily very thrilled with

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:49.520
certainly do not want 9 lives it's like

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:52.250
the exact opposite of what we want right

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:58.280
here and I'm going to I'm going to hope

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:59.810
that I get 6 uh well first we got to

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:05.360
fight the greed statute I guess but I'm

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:07.460
going to hope that we get 6 meat boys or

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:10.220
sheers boys 6 policy or if you will all

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:13.670
I used it once by accident that was

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:16.010
muscle memory thank God we brought the

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:20.320
question mark card otherwise this will

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:20.320
be a nightmare hope we get 4 cheers boys

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:28.200
we only got two shears boys I dispute

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:30.150
this I dispute this verily taro claw I

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:33.090
guess no that's not fair because taro

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:38.970
claws it just purports to do twice the

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:40.560
effect of your of your spacebar item car

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:42.750
battery doesn't change your spacebar

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.610
item it just makes it work it basically

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:46.350
turns your space bar into taro claw

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:48.900
we're still going to win but dude I

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:50.370
really should have just fought the greed

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:52.430
statute the old-fashioned way it would

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:55.770
have been a much much much simpler

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:58.950
situation for me well I'm actually too

00:21:55.770 --> 00:22:04.740
slow to escape from him if he ever

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:06.930
Agro's me so what a strange run because

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:08.370
again I don't here's the way I'm going

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:11.640
to describe it and it's still not quite

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:13.620
completely safe yet but this is the run

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:16.050
where the decisions that I made I think

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:18.050
have had the most little consequence

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:21.240
ever

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:25.080
we basically I mean taro cloth shirt

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:26.730
helped us out here potentially on our

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:29.490
Wade yet taro cloth should give us four

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:32.730
times the item or four times the power

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:34.230
because we also have because the

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:37.590
question mark card already gives you two

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:39.510
times the power anyway I digress we

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:41.400
should have gotten by my Mads we should

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:43.830
have gotten 2 to the power of 5 poles

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:46.320
right here where's 32 poles the new

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:47.550
movie starring quitting Tarantino yeah

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.800
that's right he's not directing it's

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:54.060
directed by Tyler Perry he's branching

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:57.300
out which is the movie starring Tyler

00:22:54.060 --> 00:23:01.560
Perry written by Quentin Tarantino ok so

00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:03.330
you should be dead basically like two

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:05.690
items I picked up on this run had any

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:08.940
consequence in terms of our you know

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:10.680
progress whatsoever here so we should be

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:13.110
able to donate to get at least two I

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:18.300
mean we should be able to get to 67

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:19.890
cents but what a strange run never in my

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.300
green mode history I think is a run ever

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:25.230
been so guaranteed and yet

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:26.790
simultaneously like so kind of dicey as

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:29.150
it came to the end they're like we

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:31.890
spawned with exactly what we needed in

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:33.870
order to

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:35.700
get this done you're really not going to

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:38.460
allow me to get to 69 you're going to

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:41.429
force me to get to 68 which barely gives

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:45.690
Kane the paper clip which is Gardens

00:23:41.429 --> 00:23:48.210
fantastic a little bit of a shorter

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:50.750
episode here but hopefully it gives you

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:52.860
some meat that you wanted the whole

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:54.510
chore Powerex

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:55.529
