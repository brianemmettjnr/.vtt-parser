##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.310
hey everybody welcome Exeter land please

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.610
mining - again 4 + or gods etc etc we

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.309
can't lose etc etc we have lost recently

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:13.950
obviously but we're still crushing it

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.120
dude really cursed I zodiac at least our

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.560
other will actually I'm going to say our

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.270
other stats are good tears kind of suck

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.850
- a 6 w x9 KF o I just exited that's a

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.380
new one that's what I said about that

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.570
but there's our there's our run there's

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.869
our stats speeds bad damages ok

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.489
rate of fire is bad but there's a you

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.620
know room to grow I got rhymes in my

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.649
mind embedded like an embryo real

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.969
problem rate of fire plus I hey what's

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.780
that item alright that's right it's

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:46.050
cursed I it's cursed I'm Shibuya yeah

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.370
yeah Shibuya roll call my name is cursed

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:54.480
I I suck a lot you got two items that's

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:59.969
what you got I'm not sure that bit

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:03.030
turned out that's ok I guess in a way

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.920
you know there was a time where I liked

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.680
curse die or at least thought I liked

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.990
curse die there was also a time when I

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.540
really liked you know the Canadian

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.970
children's band Sharon Louis and Bram so

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.729
I don't think you can necessarily hold

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.890
that against me we did get a big luck

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.390
downgrade from experimental treatment

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.830
but apart from that it was hugely

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.290
valuable a speed upgrade with a actually

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.130
fairly substantial damage upgrade as

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.200
well so I think we're not in as bad of a

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.060
position as we were very recently and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.320
you know maybe our negative luck comes

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.650
back to haunt us at some point they also

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.850
got HP out of it I forgot to mention but

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.329
maybe it comes back to haunt us at some

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.860
point but for now I'm very okay with it

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.020
we also have the scissors I just noticed

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.450
as a trinket so I mean counterfeit penny

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.750
for the swallowed penny is probably

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.360
better because it does give us the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.610
ability to essentially if we wanted to

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.170
we can create an arcade on this floor

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.479
probably a for the next floor I should

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.240
say and then maybe if we get an arcade

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.209
we get a ton of value out of that

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.009
because of the added benefit but I want

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.350
to try the scissors because we rarely

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:18.470
take it

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:20.420
I think it would be a good try and

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.340
honestly like I was mind flooded there

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.260
while I was fighting rag man just

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.700
because he's an annoying boss but I'm

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.160
really glad to kill him so easily and do

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.100
look at that magic mush all stats up we

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.740
got eight damage rate of fire has not

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.370
improved speed has improved we still

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.960
have the the teleportation issue which

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.220
is going to I mean if anything maybe I

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.120
should just treat it as a convenient

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.980
excuse to not have to fight void I do

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.320
want you to loop it if this guy hasn't

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.150
so I'm going to go back there but yeah

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.980
we got potential problems dude no bombs

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.890
on this floor but zodiac came through

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.580
with Stompie that's actually called Leo

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.320
which we actually really want that's one

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.690
example of why right there we just got a

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.760
black market with four and a half HP so

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:10.370
we can totally take some of these deals

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:17.560
if they're deemed appropriate I'll admit

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.560
slight dicey but if we're going to take

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.450
these items you might as well make our

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.220
HP work for us first new there goes our

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.330
deal with the devil chance we'd probably

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.170
already lost our deal with the devil

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.000
chance right

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.350
no biggie all right go back there and

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.310
don't sweat it

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.530
cuz now that you've got some extra

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.030
spirit arts I actually think this is you

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.370
know potentially as good as the deal

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:45.170
with the devil to begin with and rarer

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:48.320
as well so bloody penny yeah okay I

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.550
think this is a good idea there in a

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.500
year of rune was the other thing a

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:58.430
magician just pop it get rid of it okay

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:59.270
here you got to go nuns have it compass

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.490
is probably next

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.380
I'll take deep pockets sure did we go a

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.610
little hard on this I believe that would

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.760
be the way that you would refer to it

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.760
yes but the three pretty useful items

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.950
that makes me feel bad in my soul we

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.450
took damage there but bloody penny was a

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.870
big pick up there even though it was

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.130
absent the the reason for going down

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.450
there in the first place that might end

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.870
up being the most important pick up we

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.790
got but moreover like even if it's not a

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.100
great deal you see a black market you go

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.590
for the black market dude you go as hard

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.120
as you can in that M effing paint and

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.790
the reason for that just because it's

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.860
rare and it's fun that's at this point

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.889
in the Isaac you know lifespan that's

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.540
important having a good time we're here

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.370
for a good time not a long time unless

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.080
we invent you know like a mortal life in

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:54.160
which case do whatever you want I guess

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:55.930
but you can also do what you went

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.300
through what you want with my body it's

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.900
not a library it's not a library at all

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.600
I lied to myself a luck upgrade is very

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:10.720
important you think it's a secret room

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:13.240
here if it is we can save a bomb that

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.840
hurts and it's a great deal either way

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.229
though

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.669
lads rag it's pretty decent at keeping

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.970
us alive at the very least if nothing

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.919
else apart from that I think we're

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.270
basically just ready to hopefully beat

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:28.270
the odds and get a deal with the devil

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.430
in the end this floor didn't turn out

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.610
perfectly but I can't be mad you know

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.780
the existence of a black market is

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.130
always going to make things more

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.120
interesting shrimp to hoop is a huge

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.650
item for us to pick up beat the odds got

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.479
to deal with the devil also got synth

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.900
aisle I'll take Guppies tail as well so

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:48.820
we're at 10 damage a little dicey on the

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.280
HP front admittedly but this is the way

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.610
I prefer to live my life like there's no

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:58.150
tomorrow no longer do we have stompy

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:01.599
unfortunately one way or the other you

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:03.940
have to face the fact that we have mr.

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:05.740
boom really we're gonna have to face the

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:09.190
fact that we have cursed I eventually

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.110
whether that's you know just preventing

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:15.270
ourselves from getting hit at some point

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:18.550
er figure into something else out I

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.199
couldn't tell you to be honest kirsta is

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.500
not always the kiss of death sometimes

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:25.240
it is irrelevant it runs the gamut from

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:30.550
irrelevant to kiss of death I suppose

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:34.620
but you know it has a little flavor of

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.620
interest for certain my favorite

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:43.770
vh1 show so I'll tell you what we're

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.110
gonna do this I'm not mad about that I

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:51.750
want to roll with this because I truly

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:53.190
believe we did it I know you're gonna be

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.130
mad because we got brimstone but you got

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.510
to hear me out here first off we just

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:03.180
got another guppy item as well but

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:04.890
secondly don't die he didn't die we we

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:08.430
got brimstone it cancels curse die I

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:10.610
will never apologize for getting rid of

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:15.720
curse die by using brimstone now

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:17.460
straight-up still not necessarily

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.100
crushing it because the rate of fire is

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.720
really bad however I feel really good

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.970
about the decision that we made here and

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.010
beyond that we're going to roll coupon

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.780
as well so we took a little Zayn away

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:31.680
but we also added some Zayn I've never

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.970
used coupon really at least and I've

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.220
gone on record as being like it's not

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:39.090
that good in my opinion I think it's a

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:41.400
little overrated at least however if

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:43.710
they can you know kick off on this run

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.450
and start giving us like incredible free

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:47.280
deals with the devil this could be a

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.360
really really fun one obviously we don't

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.550
need to deal with the devil on this

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.260
floor I'd actually rather you know we

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:54.180
just burn off the damage penalty if

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.310
possible or not damage penalty inside

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.980
the the devil penalty stay there please

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:03.030
he didn't stay there

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:04.760
he moved pretty uncool bro if I do say

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:07.230
so myself

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:10.950
actually very concerned about dying too

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:12.480
mega fatty HP please okay all is

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:15.540
forgiven there was a period there where

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.860
I was afraid I was petrified thinking

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.920
how am I going to live without you by my

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:21.930
side that's me singing to HP then Anson

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.710
has spent so much money you wondering

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:27.110
how you got me strong and I mmm

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:29.490
continue to grow strong apparently okay

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:32.400
these jokes are not poppy this is why I

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:34.350
shouldn't record late at night you

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.110
wouldn't give me a second black market

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:39.920
that would be like otherworldly so we

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.920
get piercing shots

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:44.250
doesn't actually do anything for us I

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:48.240
think with brimstone except give us a

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:49.790
very insensitive costume but we'll be

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.750
moving on here

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:57.060
goodbye curse die it's been nice

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:59.690
shouldn't record this late at night

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:04.260

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:07.710
trademark weed has run quite dry finish

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:12.590
the running eat some french fries and

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:16.830
lemons I need a little hungry as a thing

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:18.470
and there's anybody that's in the

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.820
comments that's against french fries

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:22.860
honestly you can just get out as far as

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.720
I'm concerned there's a few foods that

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.880
all right I mean I wouldn't say innocent

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.760
you know I understand if you're chasing

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.620
those six-pack abs right now you don't

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.580
want to hear about French fries but I'm

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.300
going to level with you they're

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:36.300
delicious

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:38.010
potatoes are a miracle food not because

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.690
of nutritional benefit necessarily I'm

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:42.780
not a nutritionist that wouldn't dare to

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:47.300
tell you that but because of the fact

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:50.250
that they a taste delicious and B are

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:53.100
usually easy to make NC tastes good in

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:56.010
almost every form raw potatoes sometimes

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:59.090
I talk I'm like a you know I knew a girl

00:09:56.010 --> 00:10:02.250
in university who ate raw potatoes

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:06.270
people say either that's weird or I've

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:08.610
done that it's not that weird the second

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:09.150
group of people is wrong that is that

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.950
weird

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:13.290
in fact it's precisely that weird but

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:15.330
anyway I just don't understand why he'd

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:18.330
go for a riot a tow over a cooked one

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:20.900
except for timing reasons but anyways I

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:23.700
digress at this point there was a

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:27.900
quote/unquote controversial photo going

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:30.060
around about like you know this is the

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:32.700
definitive like fried potatoes ranking

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:35.460
and honestly I kind of agreed with it up

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:39.240
at the top and had waffle fries waffle

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:41.280
fries I think I have them so rarely that

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.450
I appreciate them every time I don't

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.650
think I've ever had a bad batch of

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:46.050
waffle fries

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:47.670
number two were Belgian freaks I've

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:50.220
never had them to the best of my

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:51.850
knowledge although they're you know

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.680
obviously it didn't

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:54.940
Belgium invent french fries I understand

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.980
that at first glance that sentence

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:59.830
sounds very stupid but I thought that

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:04.150
was indeed the case I know they're

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:06.940
served in a cone with mayonnaise up

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:13.210
there you know I will say I thought they

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:15.940
underrated Curly's curly fries are weird

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:17.820
because they always have zest I don't

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:19.780
know when we agree that the curly fry

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.800
convention that all curly fries were

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:23.470
always going to have zest

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:25.180
I'm glad the zest I think is a very nice

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:30.880
thing to have a little flavored salt you

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:32.380
know but I do think that curly fries

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.210
have one problem and that's that if

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:36.910
they're not cut properly which a lot of

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:38.980
frozen ones admittedly aren't they stick

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:41.070
together and then they don't cook as

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:43.750
well in the oven so you end up with some

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:44.980
perfectly cooked crispy curly fries and

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:46.900
you're like these are delicious then you

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:49.540
end up with some where like the middle

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:51.130
of the curly is raw and that's the same

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.510
concern that I have with potato wedges

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:55.390
but I would put both of those higher

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:57.520
than they had them on the list they also

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:59.500
had garlic fries hi and I got to be

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.790
honest with you I don't understand I

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.110
don't understand a couple of things one

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:05.190
is that understand what a garlic fry is

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:09.940
the second one is sometimes if I go to a

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:11.560
gastropub you know a hipster pub they'll

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:14.380
be like well you can change your french

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.970
fries into garlic parmesan truffle fries

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.170
for three dollars and fifty cents and

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:19.510
sometimes I've done it and I've been

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:22.000
like I don't really notice the

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:23.290
difference I think and I you know it's

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.170
that's three dollars and fifty cents I

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:28.270
could have spent on something else you

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.920
know and that's that's one zone on the

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:33.640
SkyTrain right there I don't know if

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:34.900
it's worth it but maybe I'm just missing

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.310
out on that but apart from that I looked

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.600
at that list and I said you know what

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.160
this person is a good head on their

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.170
shoulders as far as I'm concerned I'm

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.940
not necessarily a hundred percent on

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:43.870
with their choices but I think you know

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.490
we're never going to agree a hundred

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:47.410
percent if they put sweet potato fries

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.240
at number one I would have been like I

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:54.190
disagree even though I also like a good

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:55.930
sweet potato fry but yeah I think lot

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:59.680
they hit the broad-strokes correctly as

00:12:55.930 --> 00:13:01.960
far as I'm concerned hey any chance you

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.500
could give me a key I know I spent keys

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:06.410
that maybe I shouldn't have spent

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:10.700
but at the same time you're kind of

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:13.310
killing me here okay miss bombs didn't

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:14.870
really ask for those we're probably

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:16.400
going to become guppy here regardless I

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.870
just got a feeling down in my gut that

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.120
the guppy dream is about to come to

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:22.070
fruition it's been long enough and guppy

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:25.000
brimstone course the perfect combination

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:35.630
for us for a hot summer day

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:39.830
but oh those guppy nice to me more tell

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:41.900
me more okay I mean well he didn't have

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:44.840
to go that far

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:46.220
hey dude thanks for two keys originally

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.410
I was going to say something in his

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:50.300
voice that made me insult you a little

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:51.710
bit but then I realized you did a lot to

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.210
help me out here so thank you very much

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:55.070
and now I can't get rid of this accent

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:59.630
for some reason highly offensive please

00:13:55.070 --> 00:14:02.210
stop brain is broken stop doing the

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:04.750
accent man like I can't this is my voice

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:10.060
now apparently all right we're gonna

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:13.310
we're gonna make this coupon work for us

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:17.810
the time is right the time is right the

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:19.370
time is right although you know we had

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:20.960
to take that to really enable it but at

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:23.750
the same time I'm please I don't I don't

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:25.339
want old bandage here a bandage is a guy

that can't get no love from me hangin

00:14:25.339 --> 00:14:30.530
out the passenger side of his best

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:34.730
friend's ride trying to holler at me I

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:36.140
didn't mean to buy that if you'll excuse

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:42.020
me I have an important Skype message to

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:44.750
attend to says james's that's a big hit

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:45.980
it's a it's darkest dungeon video I'm

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.510
not going to begrudge them for talking

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:49.280
about darkest dungeon I may not play the

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:52.339
game myself anymore but I respect their

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:54.020
right to do so well NL that's very

00:14:52.339 --> 00:14:56.750
generous of you look I'm just trying to

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:59.540
meet them on a human level okay dude

00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:00.710
thanks for the HP appreciated we are

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.900
going to open this to try to get to

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:06.440
arcade levels so we didn't we got an

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:08.570
ability to fly which we already have and

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:11.170
actually like cannot take in this

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.170
situation

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:19.810
good but not good enough

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:21.700
good well bad but not good enough fun in

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:23.260
fact I wish I hadn't done that because

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.970
well I mean the coupons interesting as

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:27.400
well but we could have used that with

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:29.650
brimstone for sweet combinations but hey

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:32.410
again whenever you leave an item room

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:33.490
and you got the best thing that you

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:34.630
could have possibly gotten like when

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:37.510
your last reroll gives you the best

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:40.840
thing you're happy camp I didn't meet it

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:43.600
freaking take hold bandage man I want to

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:45.370
keep or Babylon pump in here that was an

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.750
expression that came out wrong but by

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:49.150
the time it was already out and I

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:54.220
realized that it was not that good I had

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:56.920
it was already too late so hear me out

00:15:54.220 --> 00:16:02.680
here play this guy and get old bandy to

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:05.430
work for you come on old bandy just give

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:05.430
me a red heart dude

00:16:08.149 --> 00:16:17.809
it's interesting isn't it we take this

00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:21.069
will respond as like Lazarus I think why

00:16:17.809 --> 00:16:26.990
wouldn't we just take an extra reroll

00:16:21.069 --> 00:16:28.670
that's our Lasry role we might just want

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:33.319
to eat it and come back as dark Judas

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:34.670
but we should wait I suppose until until

00:16:33.319 --> 00:16:35.089
we get like one more spirit heart or

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:37.519
something

00:16:35.089 --> 00:16:40.339
but if that happens and we're able to

00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:42.199
keep our spirit hearts like there's an

00:16:40.339 --> 00:16:44.029
enemy if we're able to keep our spirit

00:16:42.199 --> 00:16:45.740
how it's going I think we're in a very

00:16:44.029 --> 00:16:48.939
good spot even though our HP is actually

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.939
straight-up horrible right now

00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:54.249
tella pills actually pretty useful

00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:01.970
we do want the keys for certain and we

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:04.279
did things right you know I guess we

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:05.630
could have taken fate on the last floor

00:17:04.279 --> 00:17:07.819
if we'd known that we were going to

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:10.339
respawn but we had the ball in our Court

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:11.959
there we didn't want to do that because

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:14.779
it would have ruined Whore of Babylon

00:17:11.959 --> 00:17:17.240
so HP is the most important stat on a

00:17:14.779 --> 00:17:18.919
like fundamental level you need some HP

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:24.589
to live no matter how good your run

00:17:18.919 --> 00:17:27.069
seems to be that stinks dude we can't

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:30.200
win for losing on teleporting lately

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:35.480
even the last run we we teleported like

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:40.820
accidentally well tell you what

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:44.390
obviously we want this if we die I'll

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:50.659
always say do it this I do it let me in

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:51.770
okay place a bomb then let me in a lot

00:17:50.659 --> 00:17:54.350
of decent stuff here

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:55.340
I didn't know what that was going to do

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:59.450
I just wanted to try it

00:17:55.340 --> 00:18:02.380
uh please murder me thank you bring me

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:04.190
back on the outside thank you

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:07.580
damage is through the roof right now

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:10.730
teleport card please fingers crossed

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:11.870
nope the troll god laughs said you're

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:14.720
crossing the fingers

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:16.720
well you know what laugh at this buddy

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:21.140
and then I just picture me taking like a

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:22.399
ak-47 to a picture of The Binding of

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:26.820
Isaac's cover that that that that that

00:18:22.399 --> 00:18:29.759
that that that freaking goddamn dude

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:33.209
so vicious tongue lashing we're on the

00:18:29.759 --> 00:18:33.690
verge of I mean to OpenNet hey it was

00:18:33.209 --> 00:18:37.229
worth it

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:38.779
we're on the verge I don't think we want

00:18:37.229 --> 00:18:41.039
it there we're on the verge you know

00:18:38.779 --> 00:18:44.219
bitter sweet symphony' that's the verb

00:18:41.039 --> 00:18:45.269
now that I think about it we're on the

00:18:44.219 --> 00:18:47.039
verge of a couple of great

00:18:45.269 --> 00:18:51.269
transformations obviously we want to get

00:18:47.039 --> 00:18:55.079
Guffey okay you've earned yourself

00:18:51.269 --> 00:18:56.219
another opening here yeah I'm in we're

00:18:55.079 --> 00:19:00.359
on the verge of God people are also on

00:18:56.219 --> 00:19:02.819
the verge of spun I would love to make

00:19:00.359 --> 00:19:06.449
both of those happen because they're

00:19:02.819 --> 00:19:07.909
both very good as as simple as it gets

00:19:06.449 --> 00:19:11.729
right there I'm going to blow you up

00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:13.289
because I want the maximum possible deal

00:19:11.729 --> 00:19:17.849
with the devil chance here even if it

00:19:13.289 --> 00:19:19.679
says forces us to mess with that guy

00:19:17.849 --> 00:19:21.209
who's largely like a pretty cool dude

00:19:19.679 --> 00:19:24.089
most of the time I'm sorry to see him go

00:19:21.209 --> 00:19:27.119
like that all right so we're ready to

00:19:24.089 --> 00:19:28.379
move on here again I it's going to be a

00:19:27.119 --> 00:19:30.749
conspiracy theory I'm trying to like

00:19:28.379 --> 00:19:35.789
rush through these runs but I keep just

00:19:30.749 --> 00:19:38.279
accidentally teleporting I mean a kid

00:19:35.789 --> 00:19:40.829
stopped myself in teleporting life now I

00:19:38.279 --> 00:19:42.749
keep accidentally teleporting and also

00:19:40.829 --> 00:19:46.919
getting like really strong and making

00:19:42.749 --> 00:19:48.359
things look like I'm trying to uh like

00:19:46.919 --> 00:19:51.839
I'm trying to go as quickly as possible

00:19:48.359 --> 00:19:53.759
and there sincerely is not the case but

00:19:51.839 --> 00:19:55.379
both of these last ones have popped in a

00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:57.539
big way so I can understand if you'd

00:19:55.379 --> 00:19:59.309
feel that way and you know what if you

00:19:57.539 --> 00:20:00.659
want to build that narrative I disagree

00:19:59.309 --> 00:20:06.479
with you but I defended the death your

00:20:00.659 --> 00:20:08.369
right to do it we got stompy again so we

00:20:06.479 --> 00:20:11.399
got three crawl spaces it would probably

00:20:08.369 --> 00:20:13.069
be like a new NL record for the most

00:20:11.399 --> 00:20:15.479
crawl spaces I've ever gotten in one run

00:20:13.069 --> 00:20:18.719
it not just crawl spaces but like the

00:20:15.479 --> 00:20:20.459
black-market counts and if you say why

00:20:18.719 --> 00:20:23.699
does it count I say because I freaking

00:20:20.459 --> 00:20:25.859
say it does okay you got a problem take

00:20:23.699 --> 00:20:28.049
it up with you know lefty and righty

00:20:25.859 --> 00:20:32.629
here those are my fists those are

00:20:28.049 --> 00:20:32.629
actually that's my manager and my PR

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:44.190
I specifically hired them for their

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:48.120
novel names my fists are called Tristan

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:50.250
and his old dude you can't win for

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.170
losing with this guppy nonsense where's

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:55.350
my gun yet I've been trying to make it

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:57.480
to happen for 230 years here I mean I'm

00:20:55.350 --> 00:21:00.600
not disappointed to have MA the void

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:05.820
it's a lovely item and sake bus is also

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:10.980
fantastic but I'm kind of just surprised

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:12.150
with all that being said this is like

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.760
one of the easiest runs I think I've

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:20.070
ever had

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:22.290
reg not a reg genuinely it's almost

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:23.460
become like a joke if we rushed it we

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:26.100
could probably finish this whole run

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:27.570
within like 21 minutes be careful

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:29.910
because they're going to explode but I

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:32.220
do still want demon hearts if possible

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:37.680
so it's like I'm torn like a Natalie

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:39.000
Imbruglia song what's not that song was

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.620
from the perspective of a piece of paper

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.450
later I found out is from the

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:47.280
perspective of a person now that's

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:50.970
talented songwriting how does she do it

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:52.770
what's she up to these days please don't

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:53.730
be dead by the time this video goes out

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:56.700
it's going to make me look really

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:58.620
insensitive I mean also you would be

00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:00.450
dead which would be terrible for you

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:02.070
unless it in and you're suffering I

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.750
suppose but I don't know it's a little

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:06.990
bit too nuanced of an issue for me to

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:08.970
get in in the 4430 second time that I

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:11.610
play The Binding of Isaac on video get

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:13.560
the idea obviously we're going to go for

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:15.480
it here we otherwise is going to be like

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.190
a 21 minute video I deal with all the

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:19.260
old must be a speedrun comments and when

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:21.750
it actually is you know get a little

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:28.380
indignant I don't know I'd like to look

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:32.010
for a per throw if possible on soos the

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:34.580
anus room I don't think we're at

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:34.580
bookworm

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:42.160
great name for a librarian though at

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:44.020
bookworm or Twitter handles suppose okay

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:47.740
well we definitely want taro cloth which

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:49.870
we totally should have used the coupon

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:51.610
oh no that's not true necessarily

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:54.310
because we're happy to have the coupon

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:55.870
still cuz we get the get the damage

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:58.540
bonus dude you had to give me I'm

00:22:55.870 --> 00:23:01.860
excited there we may actually die as a

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:04.450
result how does that make you feel

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:06.490
excited yeah figures I want to see if

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:08.170
that actually widens our brimstone shot

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:09.460
it seems like it doesn't but it's not

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:14.440
like the other item would have been much

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:16.180
used anyway so guess double chariot is

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:25.080
pretty good and then we've got like an

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:27.880
added incentive to survive because we

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:29.380
have double Yara for the chest so we can

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:33.700
just make it to the chest which seems

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:37.800
you know completely plausible we will

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:37.800
need 16 keys to open everything but

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.730
certainly seems like it'll be worth it

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:44.590
okay things are things are going a

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:47.050
little faster than they usually to at

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:48.700
this stage of the fight I'm not going to

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:52.420
chase succubus like it can do whatever

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:54.490
it wants the more damage the merrier

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:55.660
though and the chariot card is something

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:57.460
I'm going to save for a little later

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:59.970
double chariot card

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:02.920
you know it's a blessing in the curse a

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:05.650
blessing because it's very good at

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:06.640
keeping us alive a curse because we're

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:09.250
not going to be able to do any extra

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:11.590
damage except for the damage via our

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:13.420
orbital which is not that strong so I'd

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:15.930
rather like you know make hay while the

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.930
Sun's up

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:28.250
got to be honestly I'm not necessarily

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:32.900
convinced this was a right call for us

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:32.900
do you appreciate the extra spiders

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:41.320
just a little just a lot no extra

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:45.460
spiders this time I wanted to get ma the

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:47.110
void to pop and give us like a black

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:49.150
card collective there and I think that's

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:52.030
actually how things went also remain my

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:54.760
indie band from high school we're a

00:24:52.030 --> 00:25:01.120
sunny day real estate cover band that

00:24:54.760 --> 00:25:04.300
only played emo polka the genre we

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:06.550
created ourselves then in folk chronica

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:13.720
where our main influences and functor

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:15.280
Annika and folk adele ik just really all

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:18.870
kinds of Daleks

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:21.880
including a Dalek psych

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:23.679
that's a our cover band that only plays

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:26.140
Adele songs in fact we only know one we

00:25:23.679 --> 00:25:27.700
only know chasing pavements and only the

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:30.610
chorus it's not very good okay so this

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:32.050
joke is going nowhere I'm just gonna you

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:33.850
know hang out here with the chariot

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:38.790
we're gonna be a little light on HP when

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:38.790
we leave to be straight up with you I

00:25:40.559 --> 00:25:46.590
think that hit at least I'm excited

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:46.590
screwed us

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:54.170
and I'll have you know game I'm more

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:56.710
than capable of screwing myself and our

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.710
needs your help

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:09.870
the music is too fast don't do it don't

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:13.000
do the laser attack I cancelled my own

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:14.350
flippin brimstone dude I don't know if

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.780
we're gonna be able to dodge that I'm

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:21.310
excited version of the brimstone laser

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:22.530
or sorry have the beams of light it's

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:26.500
gonna be tricky

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:31.560
nice good good move good move whoo the

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:31.560
shots are too flippin fast

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:41.260
that's a beam of light I had it's not a

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:42.790
beam of light merciful chance at a black

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:47.620
card no black card but a bunch of

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:49.630
spiders feel pretty useful okay we

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:52.180
survived and you know I wouldn't say we

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:54.910
did perfectly but certainly could have

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:57.340
been a lot worse and now we should

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:59.350
basically just start getting guaranteed

00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:00.610
damage done every single room and

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:02.290
running away with it here so we do have

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:04.800
a library now which is worth going to

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:09.240
for many reasons the big one is probably

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:12.780
bookworm but certainly I'm not against

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:15.370
picking up you know one or two extra

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:17.770
utility hearts here from Satanic Bible

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:22.060
Book of Revelations potentially should

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:28.510
be using mob the void as well we should

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:31.290
save T's we're lucky that was I mean it

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:36.880
doesn't hurt that much but it's annoying

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:38.320
we could potentially of course respond

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:40.240
if we die but that's something we'd

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:45.220
rather not you know force the game that

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:46.570
to hook us up with if possible similarly

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:48.610
I don't think we actually want HP

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:51.910
permanent polar invincibility is fairly

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:54.700
valuable no copy stream dude we can't

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:55.840
buy a guppy transformation lately it's

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:59.700
not like I should be complaining about

00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:03.630
this run and I'm not like genuinely I'm

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:03.630
I'm stoked I'm just uh

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:10.870
little flabbergasted how difficult it's

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:13.780
been to become Guffey recently has ever

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:18.010
sing that song in an elementary school

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:22.210
mr. Sun Sun mr. Golden Sun clean shine

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:25.390
down on me Oh mr. Sun Sun mr. Golden Sun

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:27.100
hiding behind the tree bum bum bum

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:28.180
something something's I mean I don't

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:32.760
remember the lyrics I was in

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:35.470
kindergarten you know 2025 years ago I

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:38.320
hate even bringing that up first off I

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:40.750
was not like in accelerated kindergarten

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:42.490
or something basically my birthday was

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:44.440
close to the cutoff time for my school

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:45.880
district so my mom was like can we just

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:49.480
like sneak him in and they were like

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:54.040
yeah it's the 1990s you can do whatever

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:55.300
you want in the 1990s that's that's how

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:58.360
I ended up being in kindergarten when I

00:28:55.300 --> 00:29:01.210
was 3 years old and then whenever I tell

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:02.980
people that they go no you were in

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:05.080
kindergarten when you were 5 years old

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:07.180
and I go I mean I was in kindergarten

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:10.180
when I was 3 for like you know a couple

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:12.670
months I turned for like two months

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:14.350
after the the year started at least this

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:17.200
is from what had you know that could

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:18.490
divine given my history and in school I

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.780
can work backwards and figure out the

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:21.490
year that I started junior kindergarten

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:24.250
but everybody always tries to tell me

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:27.880
like that I'm incorrect by the time that

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:30.670
I started kindergarten trust me I know

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:34.680
nothing else in this world I know the

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:36.940
year that I started kindergarten 2001

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:40.410
you got to think about that for a second

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:40.410
it's obviously incorrect

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:45.770
this feels good it's like there's a I

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:47.120
mean we don't want that but it was

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:50.750
really fun to move in between them there

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:53.360
I do love the magician but Wheel of

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:58.160
Fortune is obviously a better choice for

00:29:53.360 --> 00:30:02.050
us who these two free items actually we

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:02.050
yera it we can get four items out of it

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.810
yeah yeah I'm trying to run the math

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:10.700
because we have the yarra wheel of

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:12.080
fortune then II look every wheel of

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:14.440
fortune not every love fortune every

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:16.850
wheel of fortune will be worth two so

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:18.250
for free items if we air a wheel of

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:21.880
fortune

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:26.870
should I give up or should I just keep

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:30.020
wheel of fortune why but it worked okay

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:34.280
let's get the heck out of here you're a

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:35.960
silly man is what you are public enemy

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:40.400
number one understand

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:47.090
that's not a good ac/dc impression it's

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:48.590
me ac/dc see it's me ac/dc see I didn't

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:50.630
mean to be on this room just chances

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:54.080
we'll finish it in like a quarter of a

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:55.640
second anyway oh you didn't hear they

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:57.020
made the they made some changes so now a

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.410
quarter of a second is actually like two

00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:00.650
minutes

00:30:57.410 --> 00:31:04.970
Oh copy me I was going to say daddy but

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:08.660
okay and it's not make it weird let's go

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:16.030
okay so we Yara well you know what pop

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:19.400
it Yara and then crack them No No maybe

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:23.580
fun kind of a whip on the first few

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:27.130
there yes yes

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:28.630
no dude this is it again not complaining

00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:32.200
the run has been beautiful for us

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:33.520
however kind of a whiff for 16 items for

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:37.480
now Lux looks good

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:40.210
eventually Virgo might come in handy

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:42.130
dark bomb could save the run we probably

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:45.130
don't need it to be saved but you take

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:46.049
the shears here start cracking pills Oh

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:49.270
No

00:31:46.049 --> 00:31:52.150
what's wrong something's wrong pretty

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:53.890
fly pretty fly just keep repeating the

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:58.270
same thing over hell for gold trinkets

00:31:53.890 --> 00:32:00.820
melting okay I'm you should just move on

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:03.390
well be in there no we should take these

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:08.200
wheels of fortune it's actually eight

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:11.669
wheels of fortune it's going to require

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:14.140
a few bombs but that worked out okay

00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:16.090
that worked out so much better

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:20.679
we got Beelzebub I think once we get

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:23.020
said this right here and that's not so

00:32:20.679 --> 00:32:26.919
good but everything else here was like

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:28.539
pretty solid well we got like super

00:32:26.919 --> 00:32:30.870
Beelzebub alright get the heck out of

00:32:28.539 --> 00:32:30.870
here

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:39.190
in the end funrun you know taro cloth

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.960
came through in the clutch as the often

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:42.940
flash always does because it's one of

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:45.460
the best items they invented in this

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:47.200
game without a doubt we have a

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:49.080
guaranteed respawn right now which means

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.980
that you know in my opinion

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:52.809
professionally speaking repeating of

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:56.409
course there's basically no chance that

00:32:52.809 --> 00:32:58.690
we die in fact I think that just goes

00:32:56.409 --> 00:33:00.159
for real life you know oh you didn't

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:01.590
hear the Ray Kurzweil's it's like we've

00:33:00.159 --> 00:33:05.259
invented immortal juice

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:06.429
everybody's immortal now why are you

00:33:05.259 --> 00:33:11.710
always thinking about you know

00:33:06.429 --> 00:33:13.720
immortality so much NL means not I'm not

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:15.279
really like obsessed with the

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:17.379
singularity or anything I just think

00:33:15.279 --> 00:33:19.120
it's a it's a funny punchline to bring

00:33:17.379 --> 00:33:21.629
up on occasion if it eventually comes

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:25.029
true don't tell Ray Kurzweil I said that

00:33:21.629 --> 00:33:26.649
technology is neat I don't know if I

00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:29.500
probably mentioned this before I'm

00:33:26.649 --> 00:33:32.110
taking a cioppino why not we don't need

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:35.169
all of it but we'll take some in my

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:37.029
senior year of university I did my

00:33:35.169 --> 00:33:39.759
graduation seminar like we had to take a

00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:41.620
seminar class or a thesis class these

00:33:39.759 --> 00:33:44.980
two seem like a lot of work so I did the

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:49.059
seminar and I did it on you know Moore's

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:52.299
law which is the the law that you know

00:33:49.059 --> 00:33:55.330
the number of capacitors that can fit on

00:33:52.299 --> 00:33:57.909
a computer chip of X size doubles every

00:33:55.330 --> 00:34:01.059
two years and how Moore's law relates to

00:33:57.909 --> 00:34:02.679
you know biological principles including

00:34:01.059 --> 00:34:04.539
eventually the singularity because the

00:34:02.679 --> 00:34:07.000
singularity is kind of based on the idea

00:34:04.539 --> 00:34:09.730
of Moore's law as a central you know

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.960
founding premise by the way if you

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:13.389
listen to that and you said wow and I

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:14.770
thought NL was dumb actually turns out

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:17.619
he's smart no you just think that I'm

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:18.909
smart because I'm talking about

00:34:17.619 --> 00:34:21.490
something that interests you it's a

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:22.929
common human foible I promise you I'm

00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:24.520
actually still an idiot it just seems

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:26.290
like we're kindred spirits now because

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:30.310
we both are interested in the similar

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:31.750
thing here what was the gist of the

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:33.940
seminar well the answer to that question

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:35.740
is very simple or what were the

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:38.139
conclusions of the seminar well the

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:40.149
conclusion was I don't know I'm 21

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:40.540
here's what the scientists say about it

00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:43.419
though

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:45.520
