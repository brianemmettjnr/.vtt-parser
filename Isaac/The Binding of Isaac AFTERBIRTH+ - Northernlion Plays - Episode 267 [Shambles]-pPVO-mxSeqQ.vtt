00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.550
hey everybody welcome back to know the

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.440
line please dividing lines get to earth

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.839
plus we are doing a daily today it looks

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.760
like the top scores are between 40 and

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.120
55 thousand which is really encouraging

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.710
today is Wednesday May 17 in case you're

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.420
looking to look up the scores from

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.539
today's daily for whatever reason yes

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.910
Ernie became 195th to point to 4%

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.730
overall not bad but we have been sliding

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.080
a little bit so let's get this show on

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.269
the road

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.730
it's an isaac run that goes to mom's

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.230
foot but with scores in the oh we start

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.530
with sackboy as well today must be like

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.079
an international something day today

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.719
International Day I know like I thought

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.550
it was like international Norway day or

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.480
something like that

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:53.719
check adhikam national cherry cobbler

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:53.719
day national turn beauty inside out day

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:03.000
because we're wearing a paper bag on our

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:05.250
heads good one all right um but then we

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.500
have the D sixes or as I the deed 20 as

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.140
well and we were not Isaac or we were

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.180
Isaac's we have Isaac stamps but we

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.490
didn't start with the d6 strange I don't

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.680
really know but you know you don't need

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.000
to know it's not they're gonna ask you a

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.700
trivia question at the end that's like

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.600
you know four five bonus marks what day

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.090
is today

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.799
you know the st. C world it's as real as

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.130
it gets I wonder if we'll have item

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.799
rooms because we do have Sackboy in the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.780
d20 sometimes we do have bedrooms

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.700
sometimes they give you like you know we

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.320
gave you all three beans so you don't

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.810
need item rooms anymore and that's like

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.409
a little over the top

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:48.119
in terms of draconian punishment there

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:50.610
but Empress okay pretty good to get that

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.060
dime there I think I will just accept

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.189
toxic shock it's a great item and then

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:02.180
over here this should be our secret room

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:04.979
might give a shop access to blow this up

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.149
probably going to give us Wow maybe it's

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.069
going to give us enough money to go to

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.379
the shop and indeed it does with a luck

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.290
upgrade as well we need to use the v-22

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:16.739
reroll things but I feel like the more

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.599
that I look at this I think I'm going to

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.550
buy this the more I look at this more I

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.400
realize oh no this is where the points

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.590
come from is it is using the v-22 you

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.830
know instead of having to get crack dice

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.420
and then re rolling the crap out of it

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.670
by constantly hurting yourself as I be

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.340
bank that's the rub on today's run isn't

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.140
it you use the d20 to just give you the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.870
consumables you want outright instead of

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.739
having to get more finicky about it so

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.690
if if that's the case I'm at a mild

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.549
disadvantage not to overstate it but I'm

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:53.250
at a mild disadvantage because I don't

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:59.160
typically do that give it a shot

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.569
that was extremely great figured we

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.150
might as well reroll another battery

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:06.180
charge now another dime though so what

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.350
was the 20 cents what was the 15 cent

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.510
item in here I think was glowing our

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:14.970
glass right yeah maybe but I'm going to

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.069
stay away from it for now alright let's

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.540
move along so we're taking a run that

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.489
goes to mom's heart what's the obvious

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.930
thing that we need to worry about how to

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.310
find a scene we need to we need to

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:30.329
figure out a way to get out of there oh

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:33.450
this is usually fantastic especially

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.769
considering we have so much HP but it's

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.269
safe it's just in case we get down to

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.239
one heart and we still have the ability

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.650
to use this okay moving a little dicey

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.959
I'm going to play this guy try to snag

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.810
some HP out of it just so we know that

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.489
we can have HP to use if things go a

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.290
little dire and then we probably want to

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.200
play our blood bank and get into the

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.150
self-sacrifice room but not self

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.599
sacrifice boss trap but you get the idea

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.599
small rock lovely choice it's probably a

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.459
rear Ola bowls in here with the d20 but

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:07.470
we don't have a battery charge as of

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.459
right now now we do let's go back in

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.470
here we don't want to spend too much

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.170
time but you know we got 20 minutes it's

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.400
enough time to not be too worried about

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.230
things

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.820
love you to have a good time um power

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.070
pill okay power pill is pretty sweet

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.460
when you still use this to get a little

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:30.330
bit of bonus love here think we want to

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.729
blow this guy up and then crack into

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.620
this and I'd rather not reroll the

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.169
battery charge but that's okay so we're

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.370
going to do this and we get this so I

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:42.240
mean when I say this it's just

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.620
inconsequential basically I'm looking

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.300
for I mean to be honest with you I would

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.720
like to get a spirit heart that's the

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:52.080
big thing for us so that I can feel free

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.669
to go to that other that other room over

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.960
there the boss Trap room because we're

00:04:53.669 --> 00:05:02.400
low on HP right now Joker card lockup is

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.660
great we're unlikely to bad trip and I

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.860
can't remember if it will count as full

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.090
health if we have a half spirit out

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.350
backing us up so we want to hold the

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.229
Joker card probably don't care about

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:14.449
anything else you rolled these plenty of

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:18.560
keys okay now we could spend probably

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:21.030
infinite time here so I'm going to

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:24.419
abstain from doing that for the time

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.620
being now that we're out of battery

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.570
chargers are going to pick up everything

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.000
and then get a move on just because I'm

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.320
a little I'm a little self-conscious

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.860
about how much time this could

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.360
potentially take so grab all these hold

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.740
the Joker card for now and get a move on

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.080
we can go to the boss trap room we

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.370
probably should and just knock it out as

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.710
soon as possible and look at that the

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.510
ultimate irony there was a spirit heart

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:49.440
in the place that we thought we needed a

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.970
spear at heart turns out the real spirit

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.639
heart was right here the whole time

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:56.220
so I am met again I imagine that's

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.860
probably the way that we get a lot of

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.169
points and maybe even you know we can

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.270
instantiate an a wound out of nowhere or

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:07.130
at least a teleport card out of nowhere

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:09.870
by going ham on that blood bank there

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:13.610
but I can't necessarily feel like a

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.610
hundred percent confident in it yet

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.990
just a little bit just a little bit

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.550
temperance lockup great we have five

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.470
luck on the first floor so that's pretty

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.090
amazing and actually our damage is

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.350
really good as well so we have two of

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.550
clubs in the Emperor I'm just gonna pop

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:30.500
to a clubs right now because we're going

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.500
to stick with the Joker card presumably

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.860
batwing oh dude crickets head bat wing I

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.110
think I take gives us flying on

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.000
occasional rooms I mean a trinket and we

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.070
don't have any trinkets so it's a fairly

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.380
easy choice here and we will take

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:48.650
there's options and I think we'll just

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.060
go save the rest of our money

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.240
we are shoehorned into going a little

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.440
faster than we otherwise might like to

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.260
just because I spend so much time on the

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.210
arcade but honestly I think that the

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:03.510
right call might be to go spend more

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.889
time on the arcade but it also scares me

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:06.180
a great deal so let's see what we got an

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:09.270
hour deal with the devil first and then

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.380
we'll evaluate the situation accordingly

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.090
because right now we are going to be on

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.610
pace even if we fight Krampus will be

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:17.130
pretty close to being on pace and I

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.210
think you want blood clot there it's a

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.280
decision I probably would have made

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:22.880
differently couple of months ago and I

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:27.630
guess we're going for Angel rules and

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.919
I'm going to go going to go because I

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:33.830
want to make sure that we make it the

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:38.220
boss rush I'm also going to blow this up

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:40.440
so that people you know called call off

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:44.039
the freakin dogs on me can use a joker

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:48.090
card right away the odds of us being

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:49.320
able to use a joker card on this floor

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:50.760
are quite high or being you know

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.050
incentivized to users on this floor are

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.970
quite high so I figured you know let's

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:55.199
go first let's go for broke early and

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.729
we'll get potentially something that

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:59.430
could help us out didn't really work out

00:07:56.729 --> 00:08:02.930
that way world card devil cause you pop

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:07.430
the world card reroll everything else

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.430
kind of going for broke on consumables

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:16.080
now we are pretty easily hitting like a

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:17.340
hundred percent I don't want to call it

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.169
reroll ability I don't know what you

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:22.560
call it basically we have a sustainable

00:08:19.169 --> 00:08:23.789
situation with our with our d20 I'm not

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.800
sure if it's just due to our luck or

00:08:23.789 --> 00:08:27.629
what but we can basically reroll

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.039
endlessly with the d20 and just continue

00:08:27.629 --> 00:08:31.860
getting more chests at least that's how

00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:35.250
it seems so far so the world card is

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:36.659
very good for us we can strength cards

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:41.219
pretty much meaningless but with the

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:43.050
world card we can figure out where we

00:08:41.219 --> 00:08:44.790
need to go and go there in an expedited

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:47.250
fashion States reward is not

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:49.529
particularly strong and petrified poop

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:52.160
could be with the d20 but I'm sort of

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:54.540
skeptical champion belt is lovely and

00:08:52.160 --> 00:09:02.730
sack of sacks I don't know if it does

00:08:54.540 --> 00:09:04.410
exactly the same thing as as sack boy or

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.750
if it's synergizes with it so we're

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:08.100
going to go where we are right now in

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:11.760
the assumption that it'll synergize with

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:13.740
it either way certainly not bad you know

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.240
we're up to 12 damage on the third floor

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.339
that's really really good

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:20.550
could use a speed upgrade even our tears

00:09:17.339 --> 00:09:22.560
are okay so and we can use a speed

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:24.029
upgrade did I say that already I say we

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.829
could use a speed upgrade followed by we

00:09:24.029 --> 00:09:26.600
could use a speed upgrade well I meant

00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:33.089
it

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:37.110
gosh darn it I meant it we still have

00:09:33.089 --> 00:09:39.990
the and it is an N via balem right now

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:42.540
you know we're like how are we gonna

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:46.279
make a down payment on the mention you

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:51.570
know like we're in a good spot but I

00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:55.800
need to need to find my seam I am a

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:59.250
seamer it's probably going to SEMA get

00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:00.959
algae's it's a great rune devil now

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:03.470
we're going to stick with judgment for

00:10:00.959 --> 00:10:03.470
now I guess

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:16.110
to a diamonds now that's a pill we're

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:17.720
leaving behind a judgment card I think

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:23.180
I'm okay with it

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:25.800
goodbye judgment this is a weird run

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:30.480
again the battery charges are just so

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:32.400
good as long as we can continue to get

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:36.330
that don't pick up the coins well maybe

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:38.220
pick up the coins but you can reroll

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.840
empty chests which is why this run is

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.910
like popping off maybe you do pick up

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.890
the coins and like reroll everything

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.480
else except also keys you need because

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:47.610
like this is getting a little on the

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:52.890
ridiculous side we got a little tiny

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:54.390
sack it out of battery charge in it so

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:56.910
yeah you can see where I'm getting that

00:10:54.390 --> 00:11:00.030
here that like we basically have

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:01.470
unlimited consumables it seems so we

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:07.380
have two two of diamonds that takes us

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:10.470
to 96 cents and I think we're just going

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:13.920
to go now because we do have a lot of

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:18.480
floor left to cover yeah I think this is

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:20.910
the run you know word I'm looking into

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.800
like one of those whirly spinning things

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:23.910
that hypnotizes you like I just keep

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.500
reroll in every rolling you got a

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:27.750
battery charge and I'm reroll and you

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.520
know before I know it I spent like 45

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:30.900
hours doing this and we're not any

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:36.180
closer to actually getting a good score

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:38.610
today so I want to I want to not ruin

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:43.200
this run by being a little too ambitious

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:44.760
with the with the d20 I love that we're

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.250
killing it on consumables and we're not

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.960
not killing it on time but we got to

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:50.880
stay vigilant to make sure we stay ahead

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.680
of the curve here so we're kind of

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.330
hoping to not get a deal with the devil

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.700
the strange as that might sound because

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:58.350
we already got one so many moons ago

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:03.660
when we came down to this floor

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:05.490
originally get dusted young we did get a

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:09.210
deal with the devil so it's you know the

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:12.600
mildest bummer take pentagram get a move

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:14.190
on thirteen damage and we will almost

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.810
certainly at least have a chance of

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:16.880
getting an arcade on this floor so now

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.380
is really

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:23.660
okay we should probably blow that up now

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:26.000
is really where we need to start we need

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:28.220
to start speeding up I was going to say

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.950
slowing our roll but I actually mean the

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:33.830
opposite in this case you know it's

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:36.200
highly urgent that we make it the boss

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:37.730
rush we are looking for a Waze roons I

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:41.720
hope we're not looking for love in all

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:43.580
the wrong places now we'll take that I

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.960
mean pretty flag doesn't count as a

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.640
beelzebub enabler so I'm not sure this

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:52.100
is going to help we need a way to get

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:53.360
past boss rush so straight up I'm hoping

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.380
the shop it's like a rune bag or

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.850
something like that it seems like a

00:12:54.380 --> 00:13:00.620
plausible way for us to make this happen

00:12:55.850 --> 00:13:03.530
there's more sure there's more ways to

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:10.280
get through a boss or so I get through a

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:11.690
barricade via a once again via a deal

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:14.360
with the devil versus a deal with the

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:19.130
angel okay we'll take this and all I

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:20.930
mean by that is this shovel exists on

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:23.960
devil rooms but not on angel rooms I

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:27.910
think at least so I don't think we've

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.910
screwed ourselves in that department

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:32.960
what's the card what's the card it's the

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.730
Sun again I mean rather have the Sun

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.620
than on Zeus I guess just in case and

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:38.240
then with the left hand oh you know what

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.280
I'm thinking now is that we've given

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:45.680
ourselves the keys to become guppy but

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:48.290
again I'm looking down the freaking the

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:50.450
barrel of the hypnotists whirly bird I

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:52.730
know it's actually called the thing it

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:53.990
must have a name it's not a kaleidoscope

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:57.080
I know you're gonna say it's infrequent

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:59.270
kaleidoscope is not a kaleidoscope well

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:02.270
are we missing we're missing some stuff

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:03.970
over the rest of this floor but I'm not

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:07.160
sure if we actually care that much

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:09.800
really what I'm trying to do here is get

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:12.860
as many red chests as possible and then

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:15.530
that this is exactly the idea yes use

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:18.250
the red chest to hopefully turn you into

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:18.250
the GUP stir

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:24.830
it stays flat so we're going to crack

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.080
into these hold the son card for now

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:28.580
keep doubling or re rolling dude these

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.920
are triggers I've never seen before

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:33.110
angelic spoils is probably like better

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:39.260
angel rooms that's no good grab the left

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:41.720
hand again we need the left hand Ace of

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:43.840
Hearts just 13 minutes 13 minutes

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:49.940
there's advice a lot of time admittedly

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:51.980
hey what's the gas it shouldn't pick

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:53.420
that up it's okay you know we're going

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.620
to make mistakes here as these rooms get

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.360
busier and busier we're going to make

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:59.540
mistakes these could be two of so we

00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:03.400
should well we should look but kind of

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.400
running out of running out of time here

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:10.640
it's like a mega bomber there's got to

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:13.210
be locust a famine is fine suit it's got

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.660
to be battery charges in here somewhere

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:16.220
there we go

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.510
just go for the straight up reroll and I

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.250
think it's the last one going to do for

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:22.340
now just because I know that you know

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:24.620
times getting a little tight little

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:28.250
delirium he's delirious in case you

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:30.140
didn't know that it's going to hurt

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:31.400
oh we smelted the right trinket so now

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:33.440
we gonna hold whatever trinket we want

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:38.240
that comes after this would would room

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:39.680
her throat yes / throw me please chaos

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:49.520
alright I don't even know we're in

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:51.260
another world now ancient recall it's

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:56.360
like the last I'll just gives us three

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:58.520
cards I don't know do it I'm in and I'm

00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:01.040
in a weird world here store credit do

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:03.530
not care it justice sure whatever

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:11.360
okay just like them looking for a waz

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:13.760
man I don't see runes this is our last

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.980
one your breath of life shirt get dusted

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:18.400
we actually have to go I told you I'm

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:21.010
staring down the hypnotists whirlybird

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:24.920
hermit card at least it's a teleporter

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:28.100
quickly get these then get out we got

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:30.050
gulp again is there a trinket in here

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:32.210
there is I'm not sure if I want it

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:35.020
there's also another charge hilariously

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:35.020
enough but we have to go

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:40.640
they've got me in the hypnotists web

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:43.400
it's a compass it's all worth it

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:46.780
it's probably not all worth it but we

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.780
did get a compass you can't deny that

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:53.540
okay let's actually go because time is

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:57.860
of the essence right now yeah so was

00:16:53.540 --> 00:17:01.970
that smart I don't know we did get a

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:04.160
guppy item so there is that and we

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:07.910
shouldn't be slow over the rest of this

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:09.800
but like I basically gave myself no time

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:17.630
here so we're really looking for good

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:19.790
cards I don't at all care would you give

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:21.949
me although with chaos I'm hoping for

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:26.690
some Guffey shenanigans we still need a

00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:31.250
seam don't forget about that HP or a

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:33.710
book for Cano once's take on Zeus take

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:35.180
the HP get the heck out of here okay on

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:36.920
Zeus is of the utmost importance because

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:41.960
we have 30 seconds to be on pace for

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:44.000
this floor I'm sorry on suss we are

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.260
going to try to I think we're strong

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.320
enough to kind of push the limits here

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:52.580
so I'm going to go to the shop try to at

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:55.330
least you know cards could be an extreme

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.330
value as well

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:02.470
I know we're going to be late leaving

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:06.790
this floor that's just something I have

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:08.860
to accept toxic shock doing some

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:10.570
excellent work though so in here we

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:13.870
don't care at all I think we might want

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:16.800
the card but I'm thinking like right now

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:19.960
I basically am just checking runes I

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:21.250
don't really care about they don't

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.570
really care about a curse room I don't

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:24.250
really care about anything it's not an a

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:28.180
walls ruin or like getting the shovel at

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:29.860
this point so that's actually

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.330
potentially good we definitely want this

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:32.500
I don't think we care about the quarter

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.090
we definitely want that because we're

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.320
getting closer to Beelzebub and honestly

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:37.240
for all the items we have I'm kind of

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:43.180
surprised as of yet we don't have the

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:44.500
ability to fly so surprisingly cerebral

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.420
run here I'm not Tooting my own horn

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:48.220
because I think that it's conceivable

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:55.090
that I've actually messed this run up

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:56.410
this is a tough call here we wanted for

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:57.940
bookworm but we're running out of time

00:18:56.410 --> 00:19:00.130
mini monster is okay but we're looking

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:03.970
for greatness it's not quite good enough

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:05.500
I mean that is but we got to aim for

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:07.300
something better

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:15.490
and that I don't know it's luck at least

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:18.420
I'll take it okano again and Emperor

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:22.810
that's what we need okay so it's a start

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:24.520
and all I mean by it's a start is that

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:27.370
we now have a get-out-of-jail-free card

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:29.770
forgetting to boss rush now I again I'm

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:37.240
looking to be in the 40s here like a

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:38.590
Judd Apatow film we're not likely to do

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.450
that right now I think if there's a

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:42.160
self-sacrifice room on this floor I have

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:43.390
to go for weed on the next floor should

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.500
say we have to go for it so I've got to

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:45.820
take this right we've already been there

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.560
all right all right all right all right

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.910
we can relax ever-so-slightly we're only

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:52.690
emitted in a little bit behind schedule

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:53.980
and there is a self-sacrifice room on

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:57.480
this floor so we have a very obvious

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:59.290
goal now get a make your way to boss

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:02.070
that's what I call them now we're on a

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:04.210
first-name basis but get a teleport card

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:07.300
teleport cards should be pretty easy to

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:08.560
come by Emperor does not count in fact

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.750
they're easy enough to come by that I

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.399
would expect to get one on boss rush

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:13.589
like

00:20:11.399 --> 00:20:22.349
just by virtue of fighting everything

00:20:13.589 --> 00:20:23.820
that there is to fight there but we got

00:20:22.349 --> 00:20:28.460
to make it so you know we got to make it

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:32.249
happen and like these enemies are not

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:35.389
helping me out too much right now don't

00:20:32.249 --> 00:20:37.979
be afraid to use the rear old tower

00:20:35.389 --> 00:20:40.759
judgement blow them off sorry judge we

00:20:37.979 --> 00:20:40.759
got no time buddy

00:20:42.019 --> 00:20:51.779
chariot still kind of got to go for

00:20:46.739 --> 00:20:58.259
broke here we're looking for like the

00:20:51.779 --> 00:21:00.269
maximum amount of sacks we're going to

00:20:58.259 --> 00:21:01.739
face a pretty tough decision if we don't

00:21:00.269 --> 00:21:08.879
get one sooner the decision basically

00:21:01.739 --> 00:21:10.889
comes down to what's better giving it a

00:21:08.879 --> 00:21:13.859
chance to happen on boss rush or like

00:21:10.889 --> 00:21:17.489
really possibly coming very close to

00:21:13.859 --> 00:21:19.589
sort of skirting the the limits of

00:21:17.489 --> 00:21:22.080
sanity here because like we got to do

00:21:19.589 --> 00:21:26.039
this boss fight soon where the heck did

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:27.379
we get Robo baby oh it's the Delirium

00:21:26.039 --> 00:21:28.979
item okay that's fine

00:21:27.379 --> 00:21:30.269
grandpa's fight at least you're getting

00:21:28.979 --> 00:21:31.799
our deal with the devil out of the way

00:21:30.269 --> 00:21:37.139
now so we won't feel like we missed

00:21:31.799 --> 00:21:38.429
something you really got to go I think

00:21:37.139 --> 00:21:42.059
we're coming close to the point where I

00:21:38.429 --> 00:21:46.190
basically just have to go for it lump of

00:21:42.059 --> 00:21:46.190
coals lovely come on come on teleport me

00:21:46.669 --> 00:21:53.989
we're going to get so many charges that

00:21:50.989 --> 00:21:53.989
yeah

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:02.530
just um I don't want the bombs anymore

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:05.530
what do the world card okay like there's

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:09.760
something but like okay I mean we have

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:13.559
to go this is getting ridiculous

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:15.520
let's go so we're gonna fight the boss

00:22:13.559 --> 00:22:25.780
hopefully it won't be too tough to get

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:29.679
the kill in time here this is this is

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:31.840
the end of my life I'm so mad we're

00:22:29.679 --> 00:22:33.970
gonna be like 10 seconds too short here

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:40.050
and then we're going to be trapped in

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:40.050
this freaking room no no no no it's uh

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:58.840
let me run you back what happened there

00:22:49.120 --> 00:23:01.929
I basically fudged around for two

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:04.360
minutes like two seconds too long so I

00:23:01.929 --> 00:23:07.840
had to rush to kill mom and I was

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:10.330
standing where the trophy spawned so I

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.860
picked it up we were still three seconds

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:14.080
too short to make it the boss rush

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:15.610
anyway and being 2 seconds too short was

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:19.630
going to leave us trapped on that room I

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:22.210
am unbelievably disappointed with my

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:26.140
performance here I got caught in the

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:28.900
hypnotist whirlybird that's embarrassing

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:31.179
and also very frustrating but hopefully

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.350
entertaining thanks for watching hope
