00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.100
hey everybody welcome back it's time for

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.200
the suicide King challenge this is one

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.650
mmm pardon me that I think we messed up

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.580
last time as well by taking like Loki's

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.299
horns or something

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.300
there's our seed the seed is irrelevant

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:20.699
more or less what does this come down to

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.519
my friends well it's that hey everything

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.240
is gonna be fine fine fine as you

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.310
probably have noticed sound a lot better

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.410
today I'm over my illness wouldn't you

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.239
say uh joke's on you that recorded this

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.860
just after the last one haha that's what

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.829
we in the industry call to acting either

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:42.510
way weirdly enough oh come on it worked

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.670
and it worked out way better than I ever

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.320
could have expected weirdly enough

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.250
though I do think I feel better I took

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.980
some more buckley's and I will I will

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.980
always go to bat for Buckley's I don't

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.449
believe in a lot of like pseudo medicine

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.739
and I'm not talking about pseudo fed

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.170
here I'm talking about you know

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.250
medicines that are of dubious scientific

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.290
origin however there's something about

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.750
Buckley's a cough syrup that's been

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.720
around for like literally 300 years and

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.380
is made out of like you know rotten tree

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.759
gum that it just it gets if it's so

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.710
placebo effect and so be it but more

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.390
power to you like I gotta be honest that

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.119
whatever they got in the Buckley's

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.829
formula it clears you right out come

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.479
wouldn't you say Tomo I actually I'm

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.950
gonna go check here give me I've never

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.740
looked at the Wikipedia article on

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.930
Buckley's if you're not from Canada this

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.579
is probably something that you're not

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.180
familiar with but I'll you know explain

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.220
it to you here wk Buckley is a Canadian

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.020
corporation founded in 1919 and

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.049
manufactures medicine for health

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.960
problems such as the common cold they're

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.060
located in Mississauga Ontario Novartis

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.590
the Swiss based conglomerate with 2005

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.360
sales of thirty two billion purchased

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.790
ownership of the Buckley's brand and

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.330
formulas oh you dang Swiss wasn't enough

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.250
that you had Roger Federer you had to

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.200
take Buckley's as well noted for its

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.360
strongly unpleasant taste its

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.600
ingredients include ammonium carbonate

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.570
potassium bicarbonate camphor menthol

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.120
Canadian balsam pine needle oil and a

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.710
tincture of capsicum it doesn't just

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.310
sound like something that's sold off of

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:39.550
the back of a wagon in like the Wild

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:44.380
West era a tincture of capsicum I don't

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.750
even know what it thinks sure is it's it

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.900
is that not like you use an eyedropper

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:54.490
and submerge it in a solution of water

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.980
or so that again oh dude problem solved

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.920
I'm choosing every child it's my second

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.600
attempt I will choose every challenge oh

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.400
we're in the money now our damage is way

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.110
worse but our rate of fire increased

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.240
proportionally as a result as well so

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.510
actually feel like we're in an OK spot

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.030
here we have seven damage our shots are

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.100
weird because they kind of wobble but

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.959
they don't fall down is the idea so I

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:21.430
think we probably just picked up another

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:25.930
fairly easy w here and I'm excited you

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:28.209
can't trust medicine that came from like

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.950
the the early 20th century or earlier

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.890
well you can trust some of it I guess

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:37.360
like you know penicillin that makes

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.890
sense but was worried about like cough

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.750
syrups that were invented when you could

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.790
still buy like heroin over the counter

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.410
in a pharmacy they were like just don't

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.200
get addicted to it it's not that hard

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:52.840
you know for some reason those

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.070
Mississauga's in 1919 i don't want to

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.180
know what their kitchen smelled like

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.940
when they were cooking it up because

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.350
this is i am look i mean some foul

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.790
tasting things in my life

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.950
Buckley's is possibly it's up there is

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.840
what i'll say no one is ever like i like

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.970
the taste of it some people will even

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.080
you know they they'll eat a lemon and be

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.790
like i like it

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.010
but really they're just trying to be you

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.830
know

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.609
the cool weird person without realizing

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.079
they're just the weird weird person

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:24.020
anything that gives us HP here is like

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:28.400
10 out of 10 wait where is our extra

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.680
life is from Lazarus okay but no one's

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.410
even Buckley's for recreation you know

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.250
that's like the juice ain't worth the

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:41.539
squeeze

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:42.949
I think hangman doesn't do enough for us

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:46.910
I'm gonna blow these up just because I

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:50.330
want to get uh if possible more red

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:57.860
hearts nothing huh okay so let's blow

00:04:50.330 --> 00:05:03.860
one up that was so stupid I'm still sort

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:07.729
of okay with this because we do have we

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.830
do have Lazarus rags after this but it's

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.639
it's not necessarily ideal I'll level

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.110
with you on that one

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.729
we probably shouldn't have used a was

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.729
doesn't matter maybe it doesn't matter

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.510
so I was thinking like a was will it

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.800
can't give us a black mark because we

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.940
already got a crawlspace there so we

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.560
might have been better off just ignoring

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.820
that but either way I probably just

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.650
shouldn't overthink it sooo hard because

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.190
we're actually in a very very very good

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.800
spot and I'm gonna make a play that is

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.539
probably ill-advised especially now that

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.400
we actually got hit twice in the process

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:39.260
there but that's to go in there grab

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.720
that black card in the process of doing

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.610
so will slightly ruin our deal with the

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.050
devil chance but this floor is not

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.220
expected to have a good chance anyway

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.960
and then by another spirit heart so yeah

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.760
I think I made some plays that were

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.830
suboptimal there but we also got a

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.699
pretty suboptimal deal with the devil to

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.190
begin with so I'll take some

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:59.449
responsibility but I'm not gonna burn

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.159
myself up too much there it's not like

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:03.349
we had brimstone mom's knife and we you

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:06.680
know took neither and somehow lost HP

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:08.180
didn't any respect we still were trying

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.150
to make something work there but with

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:14.810
three demon judgments and no way to

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:16.940
regenerate our HP is little dicey kind

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.830
of like like three demon judgments is is

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.620
a really good deal with the devil

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.450
if you already have precedent and you

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.610
have a lot of HP which is if you're

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.229
running the math and you're

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.210
a situation that doesn't come up all

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:32.169
that often cuz if you have precedent you

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:34.030
probably spent for it which means you're

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:36.400
less likely to have HP to begin with but

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.930
I digress we could beat the odds we got

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.220
about a one in nine chance of getting a

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.160
deal with the devil you know give me

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.410
those odds in the Powerball lottery any

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.020
day of the week at all I'll be a happy

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:49.680
camper but one in nine and Isaac is not

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.580
necessarily a great vote of confidence

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.080
either way I think we're in a pretty

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.490
good spot plus I just got to point out

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.139
we got an A was writ on this challenge

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.320
which we unlocked for completing head

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:01.990
trauma we did get a deal we also got a

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:06.330
tears upgrade and some HP both of which

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.330
are valuable okay we got a lot of HP

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:13.510
like a lot a lot of HP and we will as a

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:16.030
apologies for my incredible James Joyce

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:18.539
E and verbosity a lot a lot of HP but

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:22.539
you know look I'm not writing Ulysses

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:26.830
I'm writing a symphony of Bopha right

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:30.220
now both of what both of these popping

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:33.389
out of mo buddy's not popping out of

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.389
mobile T's obviously

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.900
kill this angel statue take your key

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:40.129
piece try to make the run slightly

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.539
weirder because we did choose our way

00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:43.400
and I don't feel guilty about it coz we

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:45.169
did you know do things the old-fashioned

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.180
way last time and sort of screwed it up

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:48.259
but try to get deals with the angel to

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.960
make the run a little bit more

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:52.340
interesting perhaps this one is a little

00:07:50.960 --> 00:08:00.620
bit on the longer side it goes all the

00:07:52.340 --> 00:08:02.870
way to all the way to the Cathedral no

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.860
guppy items technology guppy I that's

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:08.270
one of the ones where I'm like is that

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:10.039
amazing or horrible most of the time

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.840
when I say that I have an idea of which

00:08:10.039 --> 00:08:17.090
direction I'm leaning on this one I tone

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:19.940
actually I think it might be awesome but

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:21.979
I could also easily be mistaken but for

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.349
now you know it's basically just a good

00:08:21.979 --> 00:08:27.440
Isaac run it would be better if our

00:08:24.349 --> 00:08:30.440
shots didn't Bend all the time but can

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.390
can you help me I'm bent I'm so scared

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:36.320
that I'll never be put back together

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:37.969
keep breaking me in I can't remember if

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.380
someone's gotta talk to Rob Thomas and

00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:42.860
see if he understands the dictionary

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:44.810
definition of bent if you're bent you're

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.970
not broken necessarily although they

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:48.110
probably have a high coincidence but

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:50.089
you're so scared that you'll never be

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:52.160
put back together just heat that bad boy

00:08:50.089 --> 00:08:55.910
up and then bend it you can bend a spoon

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:58.190
back yourself I don't know if you could

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:59.540
Bend like you know your car's chassis or

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:01.850
something like that maybe if you were

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:04.279
wicked strong I'm not saying you're not

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:07.850
Rob Thomas you know you seem like an

00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:10.839
able-bodied relatively young adult is

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:14.420
not a young adult a relatively young man

00:09:10.839 --> 00:09:15.350
40 is relatively young cuz honestly I

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:18.620
don't about you guys I'm planning to

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:22.670
lift like 200 so 40 is like a fifth of

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:24.980
the way through your life 200 and then

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:26.269
I'm like well yeah exercise the option

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.709
at that point see if maybe I want to

00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:29.390
sign on for like another three or four

00:09:27.709 --> 00:09:30.829
years get like kind of a bow or a desk

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.449
bridge deal if possible

00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:34.940
yeah first let's talk about Buckley's

00:09:32.449 --> 00:09:38.779
then let's talk about beau Horvath

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:41.920
canucks recently signed first and/or

00:09:38.779 --> 00:09:41.920
second line center

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:52.560
relatively unknown outside of his target

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:53.790
market sort of maybe I don't know these

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.230
we're pinning all our hopes and dreams

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:57.360
on him though we got the mom

00:09:55.230 --> 00:10:00.510
transformation mom transformation is

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:03.960
worth very very little I will spend a

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:05.790
key to come in here in the hopes of

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.410
getting a spirit heart which did not pan

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.910
out you know it would be like a 10 out

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:13.230
of 10 pick up see if you can guess from

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:15.060
the classic northernlion sweet of you

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.230
know items that are obviously good and

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.760
then for some reason I have this

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:20.430
revelation that's like oh good item

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.020
would be great here is it Polyphemus

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:24.770
sure that would fit but it's not the one

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:27.030
I was thinking of specifically is it

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:28.950
brimstone her mom's knife in this case

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.910
actually no although you know I'm not

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.230
gonna kick it out of bed for eating

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:35.640
crackers uh

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:37.560
it is homing tears because we are

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:41.280
missing a lot of our shots due to our

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:44.610
shots bending strangely thanks to what I

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:51.480
assume is my reflection here so when

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:56.010
will my reflections go screw itself

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:59.730
outside yeah yeah look I'm no aguilera

00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:01.770
okay I'm I consider myself more of a

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:03.240
Bernie Taupin you know in a songwriter

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:05.430
singer relationship

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.630
I'm not Elton John playing to you know a

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.490
hundred and fifty thousand screaming

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:10.260
fans standing room only at Dodger

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:12.210
Stadium I'm the guy in the background

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:18.650
trying to figure out a rhyme for Rocket

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:18.650
Man it's gonna be a long long time

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:25.720
keep moving we're doing extremely well

00:11:23.529 --> 00:11:27.580
like this is caves - Otto steps one oh

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:30.700
my god we're like way way way ahead of

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:33.220
schedule and we just got more options

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:35.440
which I realized makes me a fool because

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:37.180
we spent fifteen cents on an item that

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.800
actually can't benefit else but rather

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.029
than think of myself as an idiot for

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.490
this I'm gonna think of myself as a

00:11:40.029 --> 00:11:44.440
genius because it's a good habit to

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:46.510
purchase more options most of the time

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.910
it's just that we don't have item rooms

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:50.170
in this specific situation so you know

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:52.600
what at least this shows that I'm not

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:54.190
letting spending a lot of time doing

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.110
these challenges get in my head and

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:58.149
start to make me play worse from a

00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:04.269
fundamental standpoint that's the idea

00:11:58.149 --> 00:12:05.500
anyway that's the hope and dream whether

00:12:04.269 --> 00:12:07.240
or not it works out I mean we'll see

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.760
when we complete these challenges but as

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:12.700
for right now it does seem like we're

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.399
gonna get through this challenge without

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:17.440
much trouble

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:19.000
Trinity Shield is okay I'm Way more

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.700
happy about the tears upgrade but

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.140
Trinity shield the big negative not

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.329
maternity shield but with that room in

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.920
general is that um we didn't have the

00:12:25.329 --> 00:12:29.529
opportunity to actually fight the deal

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.630
with the devil or deal with the angel I

00:12:29.529 --> 00:12:34.350
should say and get another key piece but

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:37.170
so be it

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:39.820
it is a weird situation where we're like

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:43.420
offensively stacked defensively stacked

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:47.410
and we have a lot of HP hello Tomo

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:50.770
welcome back what's the I don't get it

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:58.180
buddy you got a Meowth for me

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:59.920
Tomoe Tomoe I knew it I knew I could get

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:02.790
it you're so much more social than you

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.790
used to be buddy

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:08.500
sometimes that's a good thing sometimes

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:11.650
it's a bad thing but it's cute

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:14.020
nonetheless as long as you don't step on

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:16.510
my recording hotkey I'm a happy camper

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:19.030
here I don't think we care about sack

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:21.880
lunch we definitely don't care about

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:23.650
amnesia that's just like a garbage pail

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.160
in the best of times and the worst of

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.260
times

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.720
hey buddy I'd really like you to stop

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:31.780
scratching the wall we're still renters

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.910
in this place if you could avoid I mean

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:36.220
look we've lived here for a while

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:37.660
there's gonna be wear and tear but it's

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.600
gonna be hard to explain to the landlord

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:43.210
why there's scratches on the wall

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:44.320
best case scenario feline mishap worst

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:48.850
case scenario

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:52.930
police are gonna be involved dumb oh no

00:13:48.850 --> 00:14:01.750
meows all right everybody at home you

00:13:52.930 --> 00:14:04.930
gotta say it to Tomoe Tomoe Tomoe great

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:06.310
episode so far within the first five

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:08.560
minutes I was looking at Wikipedia now

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:12.130
I'm uh yelling at my cat as he tries to

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:14.820
get behind the computer well what's your

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:18.750
problem then

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:22.810
once a day the cat just goes crazy man

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:24.520
Ruka just sleeps I don't understand why

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:30.100
you got a you got to rock the boat so

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:34.690
much in theory the tower card could be

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:37.570
better if we somehow gained the ability

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:39.940
to use it or to not get hurt by bombs

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:42.190
ourselves we can be lucky but in all

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:44.050
likelihood not gonna be too big of a

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:47.620
value for us in the positive or the

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:48.940
negative direction dad oh you know what

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.740
we can actually use it to pop that open

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.870
and I feel a little bit better about the

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:55.240
situation I'm probably not gonna do boss

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:57.370
rush here by the way case that's not

00:14:55.240 --> 00:15:00.089
abundantly clear unless we can get a

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.089
teleport car

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:11.410
the Sun is not a teleport card just as

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:12.610
the past is a grotesque animal dude did

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:14.800
you guys see there's a new LCD

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:17.320
soundsystem album out I'm not trying to

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.420
make this about musical tastes

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.100
necessarily but he did the guided by

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.510
voices thing where he retired and was

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.860
like this is the last show ever and then

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:25.360
like a couple years later came back

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.650
maybe I should start to think about

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.120
doing that myself you know this is the

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:32.400
last Isaac video ever

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:35.110
three years later senorita I'm kidding

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:36.670
I'm stoked though I did like that could

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.150
be the album that I listened to this

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:39.970
year

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:41.980
I mean mom's bottle of pills is

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:46.480
basically trashed so let's try to make

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:48.790
the coupon work here we've got a retro

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:50.320
vision pill for free sick we should have

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:51.580
saved this actually because we could

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.960
have gotten a free deal with the devil

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:56.200
item not that that matters too much

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:57.400
right now but it's mostly appropriate

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.980
for me because I had that dream like

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:01.930
three months ago where James Murphy

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:03.490
threatened to sue me I want to point out

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:05.590
this is a dream it did not happen in

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:07.870
real life but I had a very strange dream

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.950
where the lead singer of LCD soundsystem

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:11.530
was being quite rude to me and

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:13.750
threatening to sue me and take my house

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:14.950
away and I was like you don't have any

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:16.210
grounds to sue me and he's like I know

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:17.500
but I'm still gonna sue you and take

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:20.530
your house and I was like James Murphy

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:22.420
that's very rude I know you're you know

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:23.410
from an older generation but I kind of

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.490
thought you were on the side of the

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:27.040
Millennials with the you know

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:30.190
introspective dance music heroes it was

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:31.840
a good fit but I have no reason to

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:35.220
believe James Murphy is a jerk dreams

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:38.460
James dream James Murphy was kind of a

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:42.730
being a little bit unfriendly to me but

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:43.960
you know I can't make him apologize for

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:46.510
something he did in a dream that's

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:48.210
unreasonable these items are okay but

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:53.140
none of them are good enough to be like

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:54.400
20 out of 10 excited so instead we're

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:58.200
just gonna move on we've only got three

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.200
more floors left technically

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:05.970
and really I should just be happy I mean

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:07.860
I shouldn't I shouldn't cuz like on the

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:10.679
one hand I'm like technology's giving us

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:12.510
an easy run here but it has made it

00:17:10.679 --> 00:17:14.100
harder to kill enemies as much as that

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:18.300
might seem ridiculous because we're like

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:22.199
almost incapable of aiming with epic AK

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:24.120
to begin with it has made it harder to

00:17:22.199 --> 00:17:25.230
kill enemies just in that one hit

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:28.160
doesn't crush them anymore

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:30.270
now our rate of fire is really good and

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.780
the damage that we're doing is really

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.429
good

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:34.500
the fact that epic AK gives us like

00:17:32.429 --> 00:17:42.350
inherited poison shots here is really

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:45.179
nice as well however I'm a little bit

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:47.160
missing the extra damage but I should

00:17:45.179 --> 00:17:50.100
point out it's more like I recognize

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.990
that it's nostalgia for a long gone time

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.280
here and at that time wasn't that good

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:55.350
to begin with when you consider the fact

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.760
that we were having a just a nightmare

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.440
of a time killing enemies I don't even

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.540
what it might seem like this is a

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:02.280
guaranteed run right now I'm staying

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.290
away from that possibility because I

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.700
think it only holds pain for me to go

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:08.160
down that road of thinking that I'm

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:09.900
guaranteed to win so I'm not even gonna

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.980
open that golden chest and fight the

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:14.610
enemies it's the same reason I'm not

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:16.320
using the Sun card yet if we get up to

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.970
the Cathedral I'll consider using the

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:22.290
Sun card even without needing it for

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:25.170
full HP but for now I'm not sure that

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:27.150
the that's the most prudent use of our

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:29.610
time and because this is our second

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:31.650
run-through that's why I find myself a

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:33.980
little bit more concerned you know what

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:37.950
this is where you just go through the

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:39.600
the door here you know if it was first

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:44.640
to run through sure let's get weird with

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:47.640
it okay mama let's get weird not this

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:51.860
time though this time it's it's about

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:51.860
getting stuff done I'm out for blood

00:18:54.629 --> 00:18:58.659
shouldn't have taken that damage that's

00:18:56.769 --> 00:19:01.539
okay we got an HP upgrade which is not

00:18:58.659 --> 00:19:07.330
very good we are going to fight the

00:19:01.539 --> 00:19:09.219
angel statue and this will give us a

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:10.960
chance to fight mega Satan although

00:19:09.219 --> 00:19:13.629
there's no way for us to get to the mega

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:15.849
Satan doors so I wouldn't sweat that too

00:19:13.629 --> 00:19:19.539
much but what's this the wafer great

00:19:15.849 --> 00:19:22.149
item extremely good item all right let

00:19:19.539 --> 00:19:27.849
me coffee up as we head down one more

00:19:22.149 --> 00:19:29.049
floor here can it be mixed with the with

00:19:27.849 --> 00:19:31.659
Buckley's that's something I should

00:19:29.049 --> 00:19:33.159
check actually many cough medicines

00:19:31.659 --> 00:19:34.749
including Buckley's have become popular

00:19:33.159 --> 00:19:39.489
as recreational drugs in recent years

00:19:34.749 --> 00:19:43.749
kids don't do this that's not necessary

00:19:39.489 --> 00:19:45.009
just wait until April 2018 due to the

00:19:43.749 --> 00:19:51.580
dissociative properties of

00:19:45.009 --> 00:19:52.839
dextromethorphan dextromethorphan that

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:54.580
can't conceivably be the way you

00:19:52.839 --> 00:19:55.989
pronounce that high doses of cough

00:19:54.580 --> 00:20:00.219
medication can be used to produce an

00:19:55.989 --> 00:20:01.889
intoxication that is stupid don't do

00:20:00.219 --> 00:20:04.539
that

00:20:01.889 --> 00:20:05.830
there dude this is how you know you've

00:20:04.539 --> 00:20:08.469
made a good medicine I'm still reading

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:10.629
the Wikipedia article only some of

00:20:08.469 --> 00:20:13.419
Buckley's formulations contain

00:20:10.629 --> 00:20:14.769
dextromethorphan the original without

00:20:13.419 --> 00:20:16.269
the XM may be purchased however

00:20:14.769 --> 00:20:18.909
recreational use of Buckley's is

00:20:16.269 --> 00:20:23.259
uncommon due to the deterrent effects of

00:20:18.909 --> 00:20:27.429
its taste they've actually made a cough

00:20:23.259 --> 00:20:30.419
medicine so horrible that it is unlikely

00:20:27.429 --> 00:20:33.249
to be abused as a result of the taste

00:20:30.419 --> 00:20:34.690
maybe that's how the war on drugs should

00:20:33.249 --> 00:20:38.289
actually go you know I know this is a

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:40.149
controversial subject and probably

00:20:38.289 --> 00:20:43.269
ignorant because I have no knowledge of

00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:45.279
like you know opiates or well really

00:20:43.269 --> 00:20:48.879
anything on planet earth if I'm being

00:20:45.279 --> 00:20:51.399
honest but what if you just made all

00:20:48.879 --> 00:20:54.879
drugs legal but they all tasted like

00:20:51.399 --> 00:20:57.609
Buckley's if you smoke it the smoke

00:20:54.879 --> 00:21:00.909
tastes like aerosolized Buckley's if you

00:20:57.609 --> 00:21:02.830
eat it tastes like Buckley's drink it

00:21:00.909 --> 00:21:04.370
tastes like Buckley's that one's easy

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:06.470
we already got it

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:10.210
all you got to do is put some Canadian

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:16.150
balsam in there dad dad dad an antenna

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:20.510
Canadian balsam tastes hideously

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:25.760
Canadian balsam an active ingredient in

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:28.100
Buckley's I'm sorry Telmo and I'm sorry

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.680
viewers cuz like my voice is not good at

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:33.230
the best of time

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:37.130
but this is not the best of times it's

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:40.220
bad today but no coughing fits over the

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:42.200
course of this episode and you know what

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:48.160
they say if the coughing fits you must

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:50.450
acquits don't hurt me no more uh we

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:52.760
probably will not get a deal with the

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:56.510
devil chance here but in the end it

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:58.100
probably isn't a big deal here every

00:21:56.510 --> 00:22:01.750
time we get hit it takes a half sphere

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:05.240
and hard we got the wafer to compensate

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:09.950
and every spirit heart counts for two

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:11.210
hits as a result it's kind of a

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:15.920
roundabout way to phrase that but you

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:17.929
get the idea all we need to do is

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.280
essentially get to the Isaac fight we

00:22:17.929 --> 00:22:23.410
get to the Isaac fight with like a

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:26.870
decent amount of HP we're totally set

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:29.150
the like superior outcome for us here

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:30.740
would be to get I also felt my Canadian

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:33.470
accent coming through there but the

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:34.910
superior outcome you know be if got out

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:37.610
of Tim Hortons again a freaking

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:39.200
double-double settle it on the rink you

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:43.340
know a beer league doesn't have NHL

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:44.690
rules catch a little bit of blood on a

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:47.240
high stick Who am I supposed to be

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:53.420
Patrick Kane I'm on a force of nature

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:54.770
out there but anyway the point is let's

00:22:53.420 --> 00:23:00.950
get a deal with the devil here so we can

00:22:54.770 --> 00:23:02.780
actually use our coupon or maybe we

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:04.580
could just not be on the largest floor

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:08.059
on planet Earth's history you know

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:10.790
that's really up to the game we can make

00:23:08.059 --> 00:23:13.070
it we can make it we made it okay so it

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:17.300
leaves is going down we've really slowed

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:19.070
down turns out our our damage is

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.960
starting to not be high enough I think

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:24.560
to compensate for the fact that our

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:26.300
shots Bend like outrageously enemies

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:29.450
with huge hitboxes get bodied pretty

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:31.970
hard but enemies that are of a standard

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:40.030
size are not really feeling the pain

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:42.470
like a dinosaur jr. song no deal

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:46.790
definitely not gonna fight hush let's

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:49.210
head down to the next floor so what am I

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:51.530
gonna do here I'm gonna go to this room

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:52.880
and I'm gonna pop the Sun no I'm not

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.230
gonna pop the sun card on this room it's

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.110
like a single target enemy it's not

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:59.710
worth it the best way to deal damage is

00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:02.060
to like move as little as possible I

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:07.010
wish it weren't so like eagle-eyed

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:10.700
sherry and save tonight but it's got to

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:12.890
be done now I'll use it kill all the

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:17.060
enemies see where we're going it should

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:18.920
be a relatively easy finish here we got

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:20.630
a lot of HP we got a couple of bombs

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:22.220
we got the wafers so we actually have

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:23.810
like double the HP it looks like we have

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:26.420
and on top of that we actually have the

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:30.190
mom transformation so the worst case

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:32.419
scenario we should be able to walk into

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:34.970
Isaac and do quite a lot of damage but

00:24:32.419 --> 00:24:37.820
I'm not overly impressed with the

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:39.290
quality of this run right now I'm very

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:41.179
happy actually I forgot we had lazar

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:43.120
eggs too but I'm very happy that it's

00:24:41.179 --> 00:24:48.830
gonna be over soon and we'll be able to

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:51.220
move on with our lives I hope that we're

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:53.480
not up for the speed challenge next

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:56.950
there are there's one challenge we

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:59.809
didn't get a chance to do the first time

00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:03.500
so that one might be up next I can't

00:24:59.809 --> 00:25:07.220
recall actually could be a worthwhile

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:09.380
situation to use the the blood bank here

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:11.150
and try to get a blood bag but it's

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:20.059
probably a little too finicky not

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:23.720
necessary just one more room of actual

00:25:20.059 --> 00:25:25.100
enemies so I think I oh like I got to

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:28.190
pour out a little of this Buckley's

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:29.630
right here all to the honor of getting

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:31.460
technology in that crawl space

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:33.440
which really now that I think back is

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:35.570
pretty unlikely to have a tough

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:37.820
challenge basically negated by the fact

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:39.830
that we picked up technology in a crawl

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:42.110
space that's a like low percentage play

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:44.230
if I've ever seen one but hey it's gonna

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:46.130
get the job done it's made our lives a

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:47.750
little bit easier than they otherwise

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:51.620
would be but I'm eager to kind of move

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:53.810
on from this point and hopefully get a

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:55.550
little bit more traditionally strong in

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:58.010
the future but hey we're two for two on

00:25:55.550 --> 00:26:00.280
our challenge reduce here so I'm happy

00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:00.280
with that

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:05.840
fell for the same trap both times this

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.060
is a Floyd Mayweather he comes at you

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.410
like this yet take your hands off your

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.970
body and all of a sudden you're taking

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:20.090
kidney shots from the angel fetus is

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:24.620
there tom ow get close see what happens

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:26.480
the knife is pointing out dude I'm just

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:29.530
gonna spin my arms like this and if you

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.530
hit me it's your fault

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:37.480
there's the coughing fit not quite fit

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:37.480
yet but we're getting there

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:44.000
so two for two and to my surprise 100

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:47.390
stories high

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.880
people get Lucille and the booty is

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:51.590
ready to blow suicide King has appeared

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:53.000
in the basement that's pretty bad but

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:55.730
there have been like three opportunities

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.920
in my entire Isaak career where I've

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:58.940
made this happen in a positive way but

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.870
either way thanks for watching her

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:01.130

did click the like button that was out a

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:03.740

now thanks for watching and I'll see you

next time
