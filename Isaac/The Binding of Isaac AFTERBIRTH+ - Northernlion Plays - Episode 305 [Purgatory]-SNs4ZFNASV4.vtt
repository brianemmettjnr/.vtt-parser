##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.500
everybody welcoming online please my

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.819
name as a after birth plus we don't talk

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.940
about yesterday's daily it was going

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.550
fine we probably were on our way to a

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.139
adequate finish and then the basically

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.670
input device broke I couldn't use my

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.500
keyboard to do anything I recorded more

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.779
Isaac after I use the keyboard to

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.670
navigate to the menu to quit the run but

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:26.279
I was unable to move so we had to quit

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.199
the daily bummer um at least we were

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.210
like you know 85% of the way through it

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.980
today's daily looks like garbage it's a

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.579
blue baby daily it goes to mom's foot

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.340
the top score is 51,000 so that's a seam

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.690
and in the 30th score so the bounds of

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.840
the front page is 30 1947 which

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.920
indicates to me that there is indeed a

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.129
seam and maybe a reusable seam at dad

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.100
what is this restock has given us this

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.809
may be a reusable seam at that but it's

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.739
probably all due telepathy is so good

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.449
there telekinesis I should say although

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.530
it doesn't help us against these jokers

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.110
right here either way like it basically

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.479
comes down to are we going to find the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.560
ability to get 30,000 points 30,000

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.840
points probably in this case indicates

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.220
winning on shoul winning on the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.640
cathedral is probably the most likely

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.110
outcome okay I mean I appreciate

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.600
telekinesis more than you could ever

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.390
know think it's like a at least the top

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.130
10 space bar item specifically but we're

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.229
going to need to fight some enemies that

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.820
actually shoot bullets otherwise it's

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.960
just like you know talk to the hand

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.810
because the face don't want to listen

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.439
anymore you might say

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.210
ANL I wasn't alive in the year 2000 do

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.579
people really say talk to the hand oh

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.939
dude we said it all that's all we said

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.470
basically you know we'd be like welcome

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.540
to Burger King talk to the hand it was

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.320
it was out of control honestly we were

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:05.820
becoming quite a smarmy and sassy

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.149
culture nowadays we just go through the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.349
interaction with the person and then

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.080
afterwards we tweet about it and go yo

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:16.110
that Burger King cashier was sketchy AF

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.420
and then you laughing till crying emoji

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.700
and it's it's it's better this way it's

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.700
better this way okay blow this get out

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.350
of here game plan very very simple on

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.970
this run stack up as many spirit arts as

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.130
possible only traded to deals with the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.900
devil that are worth our time and

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.900
blaming to be honestly worth our

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.540
hard-earned HP as well because of blue

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.610
baby it can be a little hard to come by

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.470
50 to 30 thousand points and I mean one

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.330
person is fifty thousand so that I'm not

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.290
even treating that as like a realistic

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.570
outcome for us

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.700
I hate sometimes you go like well you

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.650
know literally the person in the world

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.720
who performed in the 100 thousand

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.160
percentile did this so I'm not really

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.800
setting my sights on that and then

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.170
people go they should follow your dreams

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.470
I'm following my dreams right now I just

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.730
I understand very Hinson and the fact

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.160
that they probably put it in a lot more

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.050
practice than I have as well but the

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.440
odds of me having even the chance to

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.990
compete up there are fairly low you know

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.460
if you go to like a high school track

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.760
meet or something like that and you're

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:21.750
like well you know David typically runs

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.060
a under 11 second 100-meter dash in

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.500
ninth grade and I'm more of a 13 second

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.350
guy so I'm shooting for just a bronze

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.610
medal and then your mom goes honey you

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.150
know you could do anything you put your

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.459
mind to mom David's trained his tendons

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.830
to provide so much more explosive force

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.930
off the starting line you know how many

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:45.090
times David's run 100-meter dash is like

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:48.690
you know 150,000 I'm aiming for bronze

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.459
mom and that's okay because David's

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.620
gonna flunk out of his Division one

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.270
college sprinting program I'm going to

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.239
get a sensible career as a chartered

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.160
accountant a price waterhouse it's all

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:03.420
going to work out in the end okay I hate

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:07.350
that we have no bombs left here I also

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.340
hate that I yelled because oh there we

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.560
go we actually got to use telepathy

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.150
productively there because I don't have

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.640
the compressor set up in OBS data so if

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.250
you get more optimized settings there

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:21.330
please shoot at me so that I can use the

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:24.200
bullets against you that's a spider

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.200
that's not a bullet

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:34.380
come on come on I just get dusted okay

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.140
you you failed me for the last time to

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.790
be honest we get HP which is just a

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.410
spirit art so sadly we're on to the next

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.460
floor doing like basically nothing at

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.720
all I don't even want to talk about the

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.310
fact that we're four minutes into this

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.960
episode you just saw the framerate dip I

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.400
do not get sky messages every four

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.620
minutes I can Skype messages once every

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.520
eight hours they just always happen on

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.810
the first side together so I swear like

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.660
it's one of those conspiracy theories I

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:03.600
don't believe but maybe there's truth to

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:07.140
it the little self inflating but you

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.440
know maybe they see old and ELLs playing

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:12.300
The Binding of Isaac after birth plus

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.250
the esteem message pops up maybe I

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.890
should check the Skype group that's got

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.750
an L in it and then no there's a message

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.760
there from 2:00 a.m. I should reply to

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.840
and here we are

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:27.840
anyway metronome you don't have to live

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.850
with the metronome don't have to live

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.500
with them I don't want to take the

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.060
metronome with the thing like telepathy

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.250
I should be using it more often to be

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.250
honest with you it's a great item I'm

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.450
not really I'm not like misusing I'm

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.890
just not using it as much as we should

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.330
it's not like we've taken damage as a

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.240
result of not using it properly

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.890
dude this run is like this floor is

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.260
filled with the bounty of riches if you

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:52.650
ignore metronome that I just cannot

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:55.620
willow cannot access because we're down

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.750
one bomb I'm begging you I don't really

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.970
want though I forgot we have we should

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.630
have not used a bomb to get that chest

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:06.210
on the last floor because that allowed

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.530
us or we have the callous I should say

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.360
which allows us to just walk over spikes

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.310
to get it and unfortunately that's

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.410
actually like kind of a big deal because

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.510
we ran out of bombs to blow up a stone

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:19.350
chest on the last floor and who knows

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:21.450
what kind of riches lived within that

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:24.000
stone chest I mean if it even just had

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.890
another bomb we'd be able to open some

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.700
of the stuff on this floor who would

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.930
have thought that would have such a

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:32.860
catastrophic impact well I mean we're

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:42.580
going to fight the boss

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:50.170
I really feel like against double

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:52.480
monstro we're pretty much what a shop

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.400
mated through the telepathy field either

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.480
way I mean it's just a little bit of

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.000
damage it's not going to compromise

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:04.030
things too much but we really want to

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.590
use their own tears against them the

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.380
sentence that makes you sound like just

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:11.590
a god-awful person they don't realize

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:14.650
you're playing a video game alright

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:16.890
we're about on schedule but it's a it's

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:19.690
a bit of a tight one here I'll admit

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:21.130
latchkey is basically just a better HP

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.290
upgrade we don't need the keys so much

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:26.080
right now but still and I mean you got

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:27.250
to go for a battle on and then I think

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.160
we'll see what everything else is

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:35.320
horrible I think is better right now

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:39.100
Gold goo ten ten ten ten ten ten tenten

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:42.100
doo doo doo Google so if we'd gone to

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:44.080
our shop and bought a sphere at art

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.190
first we had bombs to get spear at us

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.430
you probably would have taken Goathead

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:49.750
so I do think that in them not being

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.150
facetious here I think we might have

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:55.990
left ourselves in kind of an awkward

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:59.020
spot as a result of Maya as a result of

00:07:55.990 --> 00:08:01.480
some not so smart play on the last floor

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:03.790
uh but we got rune bagged out of a

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.860
golden chest and now I'm like did we

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:11.050
just do the thing that we did two runs

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:12.760
ago again where I played badly and maybe

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:15.720
misused my key but still found myself

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:18.160
being rewarded for it because rune bag

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.690
when you're not rich on bombs and it

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.330
comes out of a random golden chest you

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:23.980
needed to use a bomb to access probably

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.200
a little bit on the unlikely side right

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:28.090
and now we find ourselves having that

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.650
and knowing that the eihwaz rune is like

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:32.070
an essential part of our you know

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:36.700
balanced breakfast on a daily at least

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:38.350
I'm like pretty pretty happy about it to

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.410
be honest with you and then I know we

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:43.600
should not slow down here because time

00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:44.870
is of the essence but at the same time

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.980
you know in case you

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.990
those things are a little dicey right

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:51.620
now so just buy another bond because you

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:54.110
got restock and then many opportunities

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:55.490
to take advantage of that I don't think

00:08:54.110 --> 00:09:00.770
we need spirit outs that much because

00:08:55.490 --> 00:09:02.600
we're unlikely to get the we're unlikely

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:05.480
to get a deal with the devil in the near

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:07.730
future we got mom's flipping PO nail out

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:10.820
all that mom's toenail I use the bomb

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:12.770
and a key should have just gone for one

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.210
of the tinted rocks that's my mistake I

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.589
was thought maybe we'd get a bomb out of

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:17.540
the golden chest then we could use the

00:09:15.589 --> 00:09:18.950
like a bomb and consumables then we use

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.150
the bomb to open the stone chest and

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.710
stone chest gives us you know like a

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:24.230
damage multiplier or something like that

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:31.130
but that was I got caught in the dream

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:34.330
world basically right there I think so

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:37.279
even with Whore of Babylon it's not an

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:40.150
exceptional run at least not yet now I

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:42.470
think we do you know we might have

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:43.970
accidentally created a situation in

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:46.250
which we have found the keys of the

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:48.170
kingdom and that's really I mean I would

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:50.000
love to be like that's the bottom line

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:53.810
that's why you don't count out your boy

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.550
but really it's just you know kind of

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:56.990
dumb luck in this situation I'm going to

00:09:55.550 --> 00:10:02.839
sack the spirit heart and I'm going to

00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:05.690
do so because if there if there is a

00:10:02.839 --> 00:10:08.959
blank card we may want to use blank card

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:10.279
the gods instead of I have a can't get

00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:14.839
that we may want to use blank card the

00:10:10.279 --> 00:10:16.910
gods instead of just popping the gods to

00:10:14.839 --> 00:10:20.630
get one spirit heart and a curse out it

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:25.640
occurs purging out of it at least curse

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:27.140
purge androoni ii oh we were all doing

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.490
the boot scootin boogie back then too we

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:31.540
were saying talk to the hand want to go

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.540
to the boot scootin boogie with me

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:38.630
are you Brooks and Dunn and also a steak

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.810
chef because well does know okay this

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:43.700
doesn't really make any sense okay we're

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:44.990
approaching death but is it as long as

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.420
it's a tactical death that's fine

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:49.250
because we have the gods to bail us out

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:52.880
of a bad the row at least a horrible

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:54.950
situation so you can probably guess at

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.740
about this time how I'm feeling about

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.310
today's daily especially you know with

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.490
the odds of

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:03.520
making boss rush ever-dwindling this

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:07.100
early on not feeling great about it

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:10.070
where Babylon was a a worthwhile pickup

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:11.660
I stand by that and we don't we want go

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:13.700
to have but we don't want it as much on

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.960
a daily in which you know we're blue

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.160
baby because we're not gonna be able to

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.900
take half those deals of the devil

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.670
anyway I still would have wanted it

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:29.120
though I want that to be I want that to

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:30.529
be clear in on the record I don't even

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.450
think there's like any way we can use

00:11:30.529 --> 00:11:33.410
telepathy better to be honest with you

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:35.630
okay where am I

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:37.040
where am I that's not how you say that

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:39.920
expression that's okay okay I mean I

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:42.440
would like to do that but we're really

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.270
strapped for time here a wouldn't why

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.260
we've countless we've callous might not

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:49.730
look like we have Council we have

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:52.640
callous but almost certainly our secret

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:55.610
room we have no bombs as of yet which is

00:11:52.640 --> 00:12:00.529
fine I'm just going to keep ourselves as

00:11:55.610 --> 00:12:05.600
safe as possible hope for maybe it tears

00:12:00.529 --> 00:12:11.000
upgrade from our item room really number

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:14.020
two very dangerous I guess you just you

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.020
know what check this out

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.360
I actually think that this is the right

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:21.100
play right now we'll probably get more

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:25.839
yeras but you know over the course of

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:28.779
this run we'll probably get more to Gaza

00:12:25.839 --> 00:12:31.329
too but I'm more worried about survival

00:12:28.779 --> 00:12:33.279
than like anything else right now number

00:12:31.329 --> 00:12:34.629
two is actually a nice I mean sometimes

00:12:33.279 --> 00:12:37.389
it slows you down but if we got no other

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:38.860
options I think it could speed us up in

00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:43.720
this situation that was just terrible on

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:44.079
my part so take 100% responsibility for

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.519
that

00:12:44.079 --> 00:12:47.519
so luck upgrade which is nice

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:55.209
don't create a bomb here that's just

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:57.819
going to complicate things we could be

00:12:55.209 --> 00:12:59.439
out of here you know roughly a minute

00:12:57.819 --> 00:13:02.110
and a half behind schedule two minutes

00:12:59.439 --> 00:13:07.720
behind schedule it's not outside of the

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:09.959
realm of acceptability mega fatty super

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.959
annoying

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:23.280
pretty much just using number two is

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:26.790
like preventive medicine right now just

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:28.080
think is the way she goes boys I don't

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:31.620
even know if we can block shots that

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.990
come from overhead but I don't know we

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:37.080
want a deal with the devil that that

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:41.820
gives us some extra you know HP or

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:42.960
damage potential but the odds of us

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.000
being able to take it as you can

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:48.600
probably guess are very very low right

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.520
now good work

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.470
mega fatty went down it didn't take as

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:54.930
long as I might have expected wooden

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:56.340
spoon let's get the heck out of here we

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:57.750
got to go a lot faster if we're going to

00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.480
make boss rush work plus we've got to

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:02.820
make boss rush work looks like I'm not

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:06.990
so worried about our about our points

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:09.600
I'm worried about survival like how are

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:14.850
we going to kill 15 waves of bosses

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:16.890
right now guess one way would be sack

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:23.340
dagger okay we got to obviously go back

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:25.620
and check that so number two can be like

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:27.110
your angle or your devil dude there's no

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.670
doubt about it

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:31.800
I'm hoping it's going to be our angle

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:33.300
I've used this item enough that you know

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.580
I know how it works but I have botched

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:37.740
it on some occasions I think you got to

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:39.720
go a little harder on this one you got a

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:41.580
look for something better than halo

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.620
flies even though halo flies is fine

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.910
varicose veins is not good enough for us

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.580
but it's an interesting item in its own

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:49.280
right shard of glass I mostly am guilty

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:51.480
of just not really understanding this

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.690
scapular I don't even know if it works

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:56.100
is blue baby I'm going to assume not but

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:59.850
Maggie's bow is one spirit art that's

00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:01.620
not good enough little child leaves

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:03.320
almost tempting because it's a little

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:07.140
extra damage but it's not transformative

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:12.210
Libra ah man you definitely can't do

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:13.980
that although it's interesting it's a

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:15.630
tempting proposition admittedly no you

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:18.000
don't understand I know we're running

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:20.839
out of time here like I'm using so much

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.839
time on this rear old

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:25.520
I mean you could you could possibly

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:29.330
justify soymilk is

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:31.900
see this is a purse rail room it's a hog

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.900
allows room

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:40.370
good news hog allows room so obviously

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:41.960
in hindsight I just use telepathy there

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:44.230
dude obviously in hindsight we should

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:46.370
have gone with one of the earlier items

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:48.790
basically any of the earlier items would

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:52.850
have been would have been fine

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:55.970
instead we re rolled into soymilk which

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:59.270
is not going to be conducive for our

00:15:55.970 --> 00:16:01.970
chances of success probably will I take

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:03.740
it all I need to do to justify soymilk

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:05.660
is get a tear effect I think and then

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:09.830
you know we can start to talk we can

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:12.760
open up the conversation about possibly

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.760
taking soymilk

00:16:15.709 --> 00:16:21.619
though it's not going to be too high on

00:16:17.449 --> 00:16:23.449
my list of things to do today but you

00:16:21.619 --> 00:16:24.019
can see this daily is just like it's a

00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:26.360
grind

00:16:24.019 --> 00:16:29.269
now taking a little bit of damage I'm

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:35.869
not the happiest camper with but econo

00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:37.369
is also completely okay we have Calais

00:16:35.869 --> 00:16:38.420
we should just run not that that's going

00:16:37.369 --> 00:16:40.610
to be the difference between you know

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.990
making the boss fight and not or making

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:43.040
boss rush you're not making boss rush I

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:46.339
almost think at this point we should

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:52.790
just write off boss rush barring like an

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:54.110
amazing turn of events so I don't

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:55.639
believe that

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:58.939
I mean first not that anybody feels the

00:16:55.639 --> 00:17:04.909
way I do about you now but secondly I

00:16:58.939 --> 00:17:07.459
don't believe that we're going to be

00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:09.169
able to make it and it's weird because

00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:10.939
like sometimes this happens the run is

00:17:09.169 --> 00:17:12.110
actually on paper you're like you know

00:17:10.939 --> 00:17:16.189
what's the problem

00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:18.409
you've got Whore of Babylon not terrible

00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:21.649
damage like there's there's some okay

00:17:18.409 --> 00:17:24.439
things going on here and yet we just

00:17:21.649 --> 00:17:32.059
find ourselves incapable of of making

00:17:24.439 --> 00:17:34.100
quick progress like we're getting to the

00:17:32.059 --> 00:17:38.179
point where we're one full floor behind

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:40.460
schedule and I'm already like not taking

00:17:38.179 --> 00:17:41.630
advantage of every pops every popsicle

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.059
you know that's the thing I'm not taking

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:46.850
advantage of every popsicle some

00:17:44.059 --> 00:17:49.809
popsicles sure but as an adult I could

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:49.809
eat more pasta khals

00:17:53.690 --> 00:18:00.120
it's a great time for a pair of throw

00:17:55.919 --> 00:18:02.400
honestly bellybutton swallows a penny we

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:06.059
can hold two trinkets at least but yeah

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:10.200
I mean like sure like we gotta but also

00:18:06.059 --> 00:18:11.970
at the same time like rotten babies very

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.350
helpful here admittedly alright let's

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.730
head down we're a full four behind

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:16.770
schedule again but we're holding no room

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:18.440
so we can definitely take advantage of

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:21.270
an alien or something like that um

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:23.580
should we should we find the time right

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:25.049
we also I mean at this point it sort of

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:27.840
comes down to like how hungry are you

00:18:25.049 --> 00:18:32.429
for that boss rush if you wanted to you

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:34.860
could probably just start going nuts you

00:18:32.429 --> 00:18:37.140
know blow up every door that you come

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.049
across and try to use that to get there

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:41.250
but I think we're better off honestly

00:18:39.049 --> 00:18:43.320
just trying to get mom and Mega to work

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:46.289
so I'm going to I'm initiating like

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:49.289
official corporate policy as of this

00:18:46.289 --> 00:18:50.880
point boss rush via traditional means

00:18:49.289 --> 00:18:53.520
has been abandoned as a course of action

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:55.850
for this run please stop you're getting

00:18:53.520 --> 00:19:00.150
me all hot and bothered it's just not

00:18:55.850 --> 00:19:02.280
likely it's unlikely enough that we

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.900
should I think focus on improving our

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.549
score by other means and also like

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.960
improving our performance by other means

00:19:05.549 --> 00:19:10.280
because I sure if you've noticed but our

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:12.630
HP is in kind of a wonky spot right now

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:14.130
rotten baby didn't help at all but I

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:18.990
mean it helped us a lot in the damage

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:20.309
Department so I of the utmost thanks for

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:24.179
that which is an expression that makes

00:19:20.309 --> 00:19:25.620
no sense to get the idea so now we can

00:19:24.179 --> 00:19:27.360
actually do these rooms we can get the

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:30.600
you know consumables out of them it

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:33.600
would have been better for us to bail on

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.830
boss rush earlier but no one's gonna do

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.230
that no one's gonna be like I'm like a

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:39.780
minute late on the caves one who cares

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:42.600
about making boss rush you got a you got

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:46.950
to try to play the cards as they lay you

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:48.120
know it's on soos should make up a song

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:51.720
for that cuz sometimes you get blank

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:56.130
rune and you don't know what it is so if

00:19:51.720 --> 00:20:00.870
you pop a blank rune and you get an F it

00:19:56.130 --> 00:20:01.649
is on soos so you should not Fred let's

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:05.429
try that again

00:20:01.649 --> 00:20:05.910
if you pop up blank groan and monster

00:20:05.429 --> 00:20:10.170
dome

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:13.350
what you get if is on answers so you

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:16.200
should not fret see we'll remember that

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:23.550
now is it a good song now it's horomia's

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:26.300
heinous azalea ask however might get the

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:30.300
job done here hi guys

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:34.140
mostly not relevant but you know we'll

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:35.940
try to get something out of it little

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:37.050
Steven you know what I was about to say

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:41.970
is this is where they give you like a

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:44.700
great item so that you no longer feel

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:46.830
like the run stinks you just feel like

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:52.080
you're bad but now they did not give us

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:54.300
a great item now we're going to make up

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:56.310
like you know all the runes as verses in

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:59.670
that song probably not like right away

00:20:56.310 --> 00:21:01.800
because that's madness um so we'll take

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:04.590
the black room keep moving here I think

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:10.950
we made a good decision to cancel boss

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:13.010
rush for the time being you cannot hurt

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:13.010
me

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:24.160
I don't know what I guess I'm looking

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:27.480
for an a woz room was the other one

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:31.630
there I can't remember one second kirsta

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:36.420
black rune and her throw both good both

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:38.620
good man both kids this is a rough spot

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:42.220
should use the de gAHS room down here

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:42.750
it's true it all came true oh that's not

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:48.310
how you do it

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:52.500
um Danson how you do it that's not how

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:54.700
you do it Shannon and not none now

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:58.300
that's not how you do

00:21:54.700 --> 00:22:01.240
it's Monday afternoon you're losing the

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:02.890
daily soon I'm gonna take your rank and

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.510
feel like a fool

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:06.760
see there's like a little something

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:12.250
there does it need to drive it hit the

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:14.020
keys to my truck so we do have 15 cents

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:18.220
dude why not at this point

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:21.870
oh it's actually useless so we obviously

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:21.870
should have just bought the spirit heart

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:31.370
so we get in here we're still like the

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:36.140
most important thing is just that we get

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:38.720
an a washroom this is good because we I

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:40.820
mean we actually may want the ability to

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:42.290
fly more than telepathy it's one of

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:46.190
those situations where like telepathy is

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:49.360
great but it's possibly just a little

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:53.120
too finicky to work with right now so

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:57.170
instead we'll take a pony and then

00:22:53.120 --> 00:23:00.590
perthro this we grabbed lunch yeah okay

00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:03.770
I mean I need it but at the same time go

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:05.360
fudge yourself so we'll take our black

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:11.210
room back now there's like some other

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:12.470
stuff we can get here but not much I'm

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:16.880
going to do this one extra room here

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:19.970
cursed eyes like actually hell basically

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:23.090
so a little scared about that I think I

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:25.040
should be this run is like it's off the

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:30.110
rails off the planet isn't he going to

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:33.590
freeze himself and that coffee's gone

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:35.900
cold man so there is a game plan for

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:40.490
this floor it's two-pronged first let's

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:43.580
get a waz Esper throw Steven I can live

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:45.350
with it first is get a woz or you know

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:48.890
the shovel would also work and maybe

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:50.570
that happens with the maybe that happens

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.920
via the go ahead and I've already missed

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:53.930
my chance but I'm going to choose to

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:55.310
believe that that's not the course of

00:23:53.930 --> 00:24:01.640
action that would have led us to the

00:23:55.310 --> 00:24:03.920
promised land here the other thing is

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:07.970
get mama mega and get access to boss

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:09.560
rush now I'd be the first to tell you I

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:12.170
don't know what our chances of surviving

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:14.990
on boss rush are probably a little on

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:18.250
the light side and I ain't talking about

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:23.110
Luke Skywalker

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:24.340
ain't talking about Luke Skywalker every

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:26.440
once in a while just feels like a good

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:30.389
day to bust out the Tom Waits impression

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:37.120
oh my friends are married

00:24:30.389 --> 00:24:38.200
every Tom and Dick and Harry right we

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.539
don't have to laugh with you anymore so

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.190
be scary here wait be scared here be

00:24:40.539 --> 00:24:44.230
afraid slightly but there's nothing to

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:46.360
fear except fear itself and you know

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:57.279
deep vein thrombosis if you take a lot

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:58.750
of long-haul flights we're making cursed

00:24:57.279 --> 00:25:01.809
I work I can't believe I used to like

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:05.320
this item I can't believe I used to like

00:25:01.809 --> 00:25:12.879
you you make me teleport in all the

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:14.559
wrong ways dude can you get to the

00:25:12.879 --> 00:25:16.389
center of the room so I can use my space

00:25:14.559 --> 00:25:20.909
bar effect on you without dooming myself

00:25:16.389 --> 00:25:27.210
to taking some damage well because I

00:25:20.909 --> 00:25:27.210
okay algae's is actually like acceptable

00:25:29.159 --> 00:25:32.710
hear me out I'm actually just going to

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:35.139
use it right now first off points

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:37.090
secondly luck upgrades thirdly buying

00:25:35.139 --> 00:25:39.159
something from the shop fourthly maybe

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:41.559
getting a blood bag getting a HP upgrade

00:25:39.159 --> 00:25:42.610
and then we get to hold another room

00:25:41.559 --> 00:25:44.080
that's more valuable we can't take

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:46.029
algae's with us anyway we'd probably

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:50.559
rather take perthro but we need to take

00:25:46.029 --> 00:25:52.480
a waz if we get it so at this point this

00:25:50.559 --> 00:25:54.129
is this is four points and also for

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.659
potentially other upgrades as well if

00:25:54.129 --> 00:25:57.039
we're taking our time and just moving on

00:25:55.659 --> 00:25:58.539
and you'll forget about me after I've

00:25:57.039 --> 00:26:06.820
been gone we might as well just you know

00:25:58.539 --> 00:26:08.980
do our due diligence here hmm I mean a

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:10.860
little bit of damage there probably is

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:13.269
not going to affect us that much but

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:16.620
we're preferred if its head Telegraph's

00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:19.419
that we were about to run out there

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:25.470
okay so roon bag is not quite taken us

00:26:19.419 --> 00:26:25.470
to the promised land yet with restock

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:31.290
what with restock I'm saying there's a

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:42.660
chance

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:47.910
yes I am my lord I hate this room he's

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:49.410
done it we need to be extremely careful

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:57.150
right now one and a half spirit hearts

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:57.720
the eternal heart means nothing he's not

00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:01.050
dead

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:12.780
he took a freaking bomb right to the

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:16.170
chin I still think I mean step one of

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:23.240
this run is just beating ass good step

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:25.380
one of this run is just beating mom I

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:31.620
don't really want about a compass but I

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:35.400
definitely do not want to buy the

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:36.870
boomerang so 26 cents guy think about

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.980
this I bought some spirit arts to keep

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:39.570
me alive I'll do there's a

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:46.950
self-sacrifice room so that's actually

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:48.000
how you get past this right now you

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:49.650
perthro

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.950
yeah we can get enough money to make

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:54.960
this work it would be really really nice

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:58.740
to actually get a teleport because I

00:27:54.960 --> 00:28:00.990
want to get the Polaroid it's gonna

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:05.480
sound actually stupid and it might be

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:08.100
but I haven't run the numbers yet Mason

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:09.600
nah kidney stone you've entered in the

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:12.630
pile of trash items because of the speed

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:14.460
downgrade I don't understand why what

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:17.160
purpose that serves beyond you know a

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:19.290
joke that makes the item way less usable

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.940
it's already got a negative associated

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:21.480
with it but anyway if we can get the

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:24.330
Polaroid

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:26.220
we can play the blood bank and get a

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:28.350
bunch of money out of each permanent

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:32.730
Polaroid invincibility which then allows

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:34.260
us to buy more spirit arts than it cost

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:36.300
in the first place the risk is that we

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:36.760
might not get the spirit hearts back

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.350
like

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:40.840
sometimes the shop will restock

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:44.080
different things but so the guys is

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:47.500
lovely and we could get a blank card

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:59.640
still actually especially with Steam

00:28:47.500 --> 00:29:02.680
sale but I think you just pop it hmm and

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:05.560
then you're going to you're going to be

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:08.320
very confused by my actions I think and

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.980
and you may well be right and I may be

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.260
the idiot

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:12.160
where's-where's perthro where did I

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:16.510
leave that perthro

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:18.490
I can't doubt that they keep losing the

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:20.110
sight of this perthro okay here we go

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:21.100
hey what was the item in this shop it

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:22.870
was kidney stone so we should just

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:24.160
honestly black ruin that let's go back

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:30.040
up there and black ruin that right off

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:36.360
the bat black room stone eurozone and

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:40.410
the bow to be rolled on black holes

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:43.420
Thanks tears up great absolutely decent

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:46.810
so what is this moron planning to do now

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:49.120
dude you don't even know even you know

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:50.860
you don't know here's the thing so I'm

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.540
going to we got another black room back

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:56.110
there so that plays a part in my plan as

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:59.590
does this perthro room we're going to

00:29:56.110 --> 00:30:00.880
start I would rather buy this the

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:02.260
boomerang because I don't need the

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.240
compass the run might be almost over

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:06.340
instead I'd rather have another reroll

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.990
test okay so then we don't want any of

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:09.460
these items so we just pur throw them we

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:10.900
get the ladder we don't need it we will

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:12.640
take humbling bundle because there's a

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:15.880
chance that pays out dull razor doesn't

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:18.430
do anything for us then we're going to

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.750
go again the black room and we're going

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:22.450
to use the black room to suck up all the

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:24.040
active items we don't want the question

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:25.270
is should I spend money doing this and

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:32.860
the answer is are you kidding of course

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:35.470
not are we going to do it maybe we're

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:42.070
also looking for teleport cards because

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:46.510
I really do I find value here in our

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:49.380
oh that's horrible oh my okay that's

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:58.200
actually the worst

00:30:49.380 --> 00:31:01.710
don't go Jesus because we need to play

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:03.310
we need to be able to play the

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:04.990
everything we need to play the

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:06.970
everything it's the way it comes down to

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:07.990
here I know we've got swallowed penny

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:09.340
and you know it seems like there

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:12.940
actually was a decent reason for that

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:14.440
now but um okay okay here's what you do

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:22.690
three cent spirit I let's just start

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:24.130
buying them baby and then start throwing

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:26.980
them away and you'll get a little bit

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:27.850
more money back in the process we can't

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:33.460
hurt ourselves because we have the

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:36.450
callus your dis run why have you

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:40.090
forsaken me

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:41.890
sinners forsaken the Gulf trinket has

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:44.350
made it impossible for us to proceed

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:47.460
unless we get a was from the boss fight

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:52.810
and sometimes you just gotta accept

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:57.070
maybe it's not your day I think that's

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:59.980
where we find ourselves right now my

00:31:57.070 --> 00:32:01.120
plan was to play boss rush or not boss

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:03.400
rush rate but I plan was to play the

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:07.120
self sacrifice room and then use the

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:09.820
self sacrifice room to get to the lam

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:12.550
floor and I can't even hurt myself on

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:14.050
the self sacrifice room if you fly you

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:18.130
can still hurt yourself on the spikes

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:20.280
but if you have the callus oh don't be

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:23.650
ridiculous

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:29.950
they're just really really tall spikes

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:31.840
and there's our teleport cards mmm

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:33.850
okay so I don't know what do you do here

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:38.310
I mean you just it's pretty simple I

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:41.020
think you don't teleport against mom and

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:44.320
then you use the Stars card after and

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:46.030
like maybe there's a way out of this

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:48.630
situation that you have as of yet not

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:48.630
considered

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:55.230
of course you and I both know that's not

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:56.910
possible one way or the other I'm

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:59.510
actually pretty happy with today's daily

00:32:56.910 --> 00:33:04.170
because it's just so it's so off kilter

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:07.410
it's like a David Lynch products and I

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:09.920
can't be mad at it because the the seam

00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:13.530
was actually readily apparent and

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:20.880
hilariously compromised how could you be

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:23.100
mad like can you just give me the shovel

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:27.930
maybe you can still give me an a woz

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:31.160
rune in here you know just just take me

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:34.110
away Satan I'm ready

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:34.740
blow all this up sure yeah there it is

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:36.450
okay

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:39.420
who the hangman that's a good one all

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:40.950
right star Scott was this one rules car

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:51.300
the walls were hardened over time as you

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:51.630
test in it's okay okay here's what you

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:57.300
do

00:33:51.630 --> 00:34:02.220
your stars card out and you come back

00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:04.410
here and you just you're go oh that's

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:06.930
still fine but not good I mean our

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:09.870
dailies our score is gonna suck so we

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:12.590
might as well be okay with it sucking

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:12.590
and try to make it better

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:19.440
how do you do that well we basically

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:21.210
need I mean we need an a washroom I

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:23.130
don't know how we're gonna do that but

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:25.470
you can at least give it a shot here so

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:27.360
we're buying items preferably items that

00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:34.280
can give us a benefit and then you know

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:34.280
IV bag buying items

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:39.649
deep pockets doesn't give us anything on

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:42.500
with humbling bundle we're possibly

00:34:39.649 --> 00:34:44.270
getting like enough to buy more spirit

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:51.740
hearts here we definitely do not want

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:53.750
like like to plays gives us how much

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:55.760
money I mean can give us like 10 cents

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:57.980
on some occasions so and let's just

00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:01.099
stack up for now

00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:02.540
I don't know placebo could do something

00:35:01.099 --> 00:35:06.369
for us we're also like if possible I

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:09.940
guess creating runes would be nice but

00:35:06.369 --> 00:35:13.280
this is strange but not necessarily like

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:16.369
inherently terrible I think it's just

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:17.690
very weird ok chaos might have been what

00:35:16.369 --> 00:35:20.990
we needed and then we can create a

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:22.910
shovel out of the ether here or like a

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:24.349
d100 or something like that and then

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:25.880
reroll our runs so we no longer have

00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:31.940
chaos although I think chaos will still

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:33.500
stick around we just really do not want

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:35.960
to lose the spirits that are available

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:38.750
so again the run is so strange because

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:42.800
we've created a run that is actually

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:45.730
terrible except we're invincible and we

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:48.170
can buy every item that's ever existed

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:51.560
notice that we just cannot take a little

00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:53.270
baggie so that's we need wealthy we

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:58.089
could if we have to but we'd prefer not

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:58.089
to maybe a better way to phrase that

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:07.970
again I think you just you might as well

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:09.980
stack up on spirit hearts on occasion so

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:12.530
double razor now enters the equation um

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:14.660
I don't know maybe there's a way to just

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:18.950
use this as an opportunity to maximize

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:21.440
our available points but I'll tell you

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:23.540
one thing we probably do not need to

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:25.369
belabor every single item decision that

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:28.760
we're making this on me right now do we

00:36:25.369 --> 00:36:30.589
still have a black room no I wish we had

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:33.650
a black room because we could have used

00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:34.970
this like at least gotten rid of all the

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:38.240
space bar items we don't want so they're

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:40.970
not clogging up the screen I know we got

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:43.420
number two as well but

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:47.030
[Music]

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:49.910
so again in case you're just joining us

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:52.130
on today's daily I am buying infinite

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:54.200
items until we get the shovel

00:36:52.130 --> 00:37:02.570
you know what smelt some more trinkets

00:36:54.200 --> 00:37:04.760
dude why not you paid for it you know

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:06.170
what we should actually diplopia all the

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:07.820
money on the ground when we get a chance

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:11.260
the problem is it's actually going to

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:14.150
double all the item consumed or all the

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:15.650
all the items we come across as well so

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:17.360
it's going to become like pretty

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:21.500
unwieldy in this room after a certain

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:23.510
point we're making at least one cent per

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:25.310
spear at our purchase oftentimes they're

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:28.190
making like five cents or more the Steam

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:30.440
sale definitely helped enable this to

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:34.310
happen obviously I see magic mush in

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:38.960
there we could also do this to get $2.99

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:44.300
bombs I'm assuming nothing sounds more

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:50.210
like a waking nightmare to me but mom's

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:51.140
coin purse is take about so I like kind

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:53.870
of at the point where I'm like let's

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:56.690
stop pussyfooting around here let's grab

00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:59.800
a bunch of money all at once and then

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:59.800
just start spending

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:11.300
we really like do not care what we get

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:16.460
we're just getting it sure yeah okay a

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:17.900
bad trip pill what do I care now I don't

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:20.990
want to buy these pills these pills

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:25.010
they're not relevant to me not relevant

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:28.760
to my interests we're going to get

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:30.500
conjoined soon we've gotten some very

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:33.190
good items that would never disagree

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:33.190
with you on that one

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:39.200
we have gained a hundred points over our

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:41.120
over our endeavor here as well all right

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:47.030
so I mean obviously we're living in a

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:50.150
nightmare every time I choose the IV bag

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:53.210
is going to summon a bunch of bunch of

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:57.470
bombs we're immune to the bombs at least

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:58.580
on the first play I figured we might as

00:38:57.470 --> 00:39:01.180
well come out and use them on like a

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:01.180
bigger room

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:14.180
stop I can't believe that this is what

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:15.620
this daily has become I've become not

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:17.390
that which I hated but that which I

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:20.180
never thought I'd get you know black

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:22.820
sorry blank rune is actually taken

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:25.360
before us here but it's not take about

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:29.870
yet we got to wait a little longer

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:31.610
might be sponge you know eventually

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:34.040
we're going to start to pick up like

00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:36.620
every possible transformation in human

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:38.030
existence here I know what you're saying

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:43.520
and now you're going to murder yourself

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:44.810
I'm not going to murder myself and we've

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:47.060
I don't know if we've reached peak

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:50.780
silliness or peak boredom in daily form

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:52.190
but I'm sure many people in this in the

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:52.870
comments will see fit to give me an

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:56.300
answer

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:58.450
lockout do it thank you pom pom pom pom

00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:01.610
pom pom pom pom pom pom pom

00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:04.490
I'm also again wait not d100 waiting on

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:06.260
addy for one day this population is

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:07.520
going to rule our generation wait one

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:09.080
day our generation is going to rule this

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:11.330
population until then I just keep on

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:15.830
waiting waiting waiting on the world to

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:21.839
change I'm almost at the verge of like

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:26.910
taking a bad trip pill so that

00:40:21.839 --> 00:40:30.950
I just don't have to see it anymore okay

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:35.190
let's get down here look of shadows

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:37.769
Bobby Baba Godhead there we go boom I

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:47.460
say there we go is if like getting that

00:40:37.769 --> 00:40:50.099
actually matters hey nobody the bum

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:52.410
friend pick up was very annoying but he

00:40:50.099 --> 00:40:59.059
is creating infinite consumables for me

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:59.059
so the danger is that we need the money

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:06.269
but we thought we got it our margins are

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:09.029
large enough that we cannot make this

00:41:06.269 --> 00:41:10.829
happen so again we gain like 400 points

00:41:09.029 --> 00:41:12.539
as a result of doing this cost ourselves

00:41:10.829 --> 00:41:18.479
a lot of our precious life force on

00:41:12.539 --> 00:41:24.359
planet Earth but that's fun we're one

00:41:18.479 --> 00:41:28.950
away from guppy it's not really like

00:41:24.359 --> 00:41:32.940
what I signed up so our HP yeah okay so

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:37.950
that's dicey if you think about a second

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:43.130
secret room down here I just want some

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:43.130
HP which means I basically want some

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.940
money

00:41:44.839 --> 00:41:51.930
that's exactly how that went down

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:53.489
all you took it you jerk are we going to

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:55.700
spend the rest of our lives doing this I

00:41:53.489 --> 00:41:59.999
don't know do it I was thinking about it

00:41:55.700 --> 00:42:01.140
I'm kind of stubborn sometimes I'm just

00:41:59.999 --> 00:42:04.309
asking you a very simple question

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:04.309
where's my shovel

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:13.020
what do we run very far away from bum

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:18.940
friends then we go pick up our our

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:20.650
hard-earned profits here eventually we

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:27.040
got to hit like the swag bonus or

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:31.180
whatever is called alright let's get the

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:32.700
heck out of here it's my money and

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:35.050
wanted now

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:36.580
you know our damage and rate of fire

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:45.760
actually very good now he did get a

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:47.380
little relaxed in there that's mine the

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:49.810
irony is we just need to find some way

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:56.490
to like divest our earlier smelted

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:59.650
trinkets packs Guppies Edward guppy

00:42:56.490 --> 00:43:01.540
Wooden Nickel doesn't matter screw it's

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:03.370
quite good Gatti's collar for super

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:08.070
guppy mom's perfume better tier delay

00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:10.930
alright where's the IV bag there it is

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:13.300
it just keeps getting better at this

00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:19.570
point I've committed so much of my life

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:21.670
to this run I simply cannot leave if I

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:24.510
do it feels like a mark of great

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:24.510
personal shame

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:35.390
okay we're stacked on money I don't know

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:38.270
how long we're going to want to do this

00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:40.520
for though caffeine pills speed up

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:44.150
champion belt I like it taro cloth

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:46.790
sure explosive Oh scatter bombs we are

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:48.830
possibly in my Omega will open up boss

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:49.640
rush for us that's so stupid and yet

00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:55.250
hilarious

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:58.190
is there another teleport card because

00:43:55.250 --> 00:44:00.710
if there's another teleport card we can

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:05.120
actually go do boss rush 40 minutes into

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:06.740
this run I hate it and it's awesome okay

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:10.550
so pop that and then we'll just leave

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:13.370
that on we'll leave that on the possible

00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:16.070
pile for now so how you guys doing today

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:17.540
oh good me too thanks for asking yeah I

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:19.730
just thought you know pop in for a nice

00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:21.290
daily do a real quick one before the NL

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:22.490
SSO literally goes to mom's heart you

00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:23.690
know that kind of things but at the same

00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:25.640
time all the time then you know maybe

00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:30.140
order some lunch in between these runs

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:33.890
no worries get ready to nice early

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:36.500
docket plans today well I mean at some

00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:46.370
point you just got to say I'm an idiot

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:50.860
for that one okay you kind of just

00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:52.760
you're doing you're doing fine before

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:55.790
just keep moving

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:59.350
decently fast so bum Freddie bum friends

00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:59.350
can't get a bead on you

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:11.430
admittedly the scatter bombs did not

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:12.840
help I don't know actually if mama mega

00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:16.290
will pop because we've already been on

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:17.520
some of the rooms we've been on every

00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:19.550
single room that bum friend could

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:22.530
possibly work on

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:24.030
okay so we got sixty-seven cents that's

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:26.070
a decent amount of might we might as

00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:31.340
well buy this or take the are you a

00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:33.600
wizard kill so I see succubus down there

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:38.190
let's pick up another like seven items

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:40.980
sake bus forget-me-now missing page to

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:43.980
play and see the Bible is book learned

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:48.570
maybe no sad bombs lovely item a mystery

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:53.640
set I mean I think I think we just

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:55.860
forget me now I think we find I mean

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:59.760
this isn't really a way out but it's

00:45:55.860 --> 00:46:02.670
kind of a lateral move for us but we

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:04.020
should I mean before we forget me now if

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:06.630
we're already committed to this being

00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:10.530
the dumbest run in Earth's history we

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:15.090
might as well roll it like all the way

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:19.950
to the end right so I mean now it's

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:23.280
actually just like implausible to pick

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:26.550
up anything because the screen is just

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:29.360
covered like I think we actually have to

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:29.360
use forget-me-now

00:46:39.119 --> 00:46:48.880
like I actually I've rendered the daily

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:51.069
unplayable if we end up finding a seam

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:53.380
after this point by the way this just

00:46:51.069 --> 00:46:55.890
like instantly becomes the silliest run

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:55.890
we've ever done

00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:02.829
hello Tomo

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:04.900
I know it's madness isn't it okay just

00:47:02.829 --> 00:47:06.430
sure gulps um more trinkets dude who

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:10.990
cares it's never gotten you into trouble

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:14.319
before right bah-bah boy mr. boom fat

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:16.089
bombs ceremonial robes nice HP little

00:47:14.319 --> 00:47:18.309
baggy is horrible and now we lose the

00:47:16.089 --> 00:47:20.529
ability to have runes so in a cruel

00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:23.500
twist of fate essentially I have to keep

00:47:20.529 --> 00:47:26.200
doing this until and I wish this weren't

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:29.650
the case I have to keep doing this until

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:33.520
we get starter dick because there is no

00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:36.089
God or if there is he hates me or she

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:37.960
she could hate me too

00:47:36.089 --> 00:47:46.359
because now that we've got a little

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:48.099
baggie all of our all of our items are

00:47:46.359 --> 00:47:49.990
going to be all of our space bar items

00:47:48.099 --> 00:47:51.250
are going to be sigh all of our

00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:56.220
consumables are going to be pills

00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:59.470
instead of instead of not being pills

00:47:56.220 --> 00:48:04.720
something's wrong I don't know oh let me

00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:07.079
out I don't want to buy more spirit

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:10.680
hearts I'm ready I'm ready for this too

00:48:07.079 --> 00:48:10.680
too impressed it

00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:15.230
I mean if we if we take the

00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:19.840
forget-me-now no we won't be able to get

00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:22.370
by infinity items a snack for language

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:31.490
we should basically be at the point

00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:32.960
where we're I mean my brain is scrambled

00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:34.850
for this run to be honest you but we

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:38.930
should be at the point where we can't

00:48:34.850 --> 00:48:43.280
lose however I also like all of this is

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:49.990
in vain in my head if we don't have the

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:49.990
ability to do anything with it you know

00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:56.320
if we don't have the ability to get that

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.730
get that a water and really the a walls

00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:05.530
room is actually the only way we can get

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:05.530
out at this point barring the shovel so

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:19.130
okay wedge ourselves down here more HP

00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:21.200
HP gimpy the last item shade alright I

00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:23.960
think I'm going to leave but I'm also

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:26.120
going to try to do boss rush just

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:29.150
because it's ridiculous now for all of

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:33.830
the literally we spent about 20 minutes

00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:36.460
doing this for all of our troubles we

00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:41.960
didn't lose any points okay so we can't

00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:44.750
do that and that's fine we out boys

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:46.750
we need an a laws room it's as simple as

00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:49.460
that

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:51.950
certainly as compared to the last run

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:56.720
we're a lot stronger now that we're down

00:49:51.950 --> 00:50:02.420
here we're gonna chain Stu like use any

00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:06.080
of our upgrades so we haven't shot an

00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:08.450
enemy since this madness began

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:13.970
out of all that I also cannot believe

00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:16.460
that we don't have PhD but things our

00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:19.520
life is much better if we never allow

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:23.060
any of our bombs to spawn although I'll

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:26.680
be the first to tell you any enemy is

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:26.680
going to get pooped on by our bombs

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:33.170
of course any damsel is in distress be

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.170
out of that dress when she meets you in

00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:39.650
West of course so we all aware of that

00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:40.400
so I did I did doom us by taking us down

00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:48.620
to this floor

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:52.280
I have doomed us in the sense that we

00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:53.750
really have no way out of the situation

00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:55.130
we're in right now we do have restock

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:56.780
you know we get lucky and find a shovel

00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:58.220
we get a deal with the devil and as the

00:50:56.780 --> 00:51:02.690
shovel in it but apart from that like we

00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:05.180
have no we have no chance to get the

00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:08.950
eihwaz room which is I don't wanna you

00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:11.360
know say that it's not my fault but we

00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:13.340
got two items that were a little baggy

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:16.640
so I kind of felt like we were hemmed in

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:18.020
a little bit there um and we probably

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:22.940
are not going to get mama mega because

00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:25.880
we've already gotten it Pandora's box

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:27.560
does nothing for us here but maybe maybe

00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:30.890
just maybe we can make something happen

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:34.580
there me Satanic Bible is it exists but

00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:38.930
it's like irrelevant so like even these

00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:41.630
cannot give us yeah they only give us

00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:43.130
pills they can't give us rooms so the

00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:49.060
little bag you pick up might have done

00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:49.060
us in here let's see what happens

00:51:49.859 --> 00:51:55.660
no boss rush no way out

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:56.829
Pandora's box for unbelievable amounts

00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:59.470
of money and there's no way out of this

00:51:56.829 --> 00:52:00.700
room now unless that Stella pills which

00:51:59.470 --> 00:52:01.780
it isn't so I should have let him take

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:03.609
the money what do you got for me gulp

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:05.980
we'll take some more trinkets in and

00:52:03.609 --> 00:52:08.440
we're out well okay we freed ourselves

00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:12.270
from the poison of this daily we ranked

00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:13.839
