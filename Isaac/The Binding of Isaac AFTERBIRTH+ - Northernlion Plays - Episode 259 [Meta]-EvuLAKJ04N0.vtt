00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.940
hey everybody welcome back the lion

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.130
plays The Binding of Isaac after birth

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.599
plus you know what no I'm not I don't

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.160
care that we're Maggie I'm not reran to

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.200
me because we're Maggie I'm reran to me

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.269
because the streak is zero and I need

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.619
Redemption the quickest way to get

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.930
Redemption is to slay the Beast that

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.490
slayed you you ever played Dark Souls

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.910
we're getting our freaking blood stain

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.460
back v h 8 x 8 7 CX seems like a

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.010
familiar seed for whatever reason why

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.109
Judas Judas not the hardest character in

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.570
the game however I've recently posted a

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.530
Judas video in which I died three times

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.010
in the same episode it was embarrassing

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:43.410
also at a daily where I ranked 5000 and

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.390
I won't speak about the other daily

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.079
because it probably will not go up until

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.829
later tonight but let's just say

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.530
redemption wouldn't be the worst thing

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.219
in the world right now so here's what

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.539
we're gonna do we're gonna take a

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.800
strength car because that's a free deal

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.239
with the devil and we're going to win

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.670
and once you get this win we'll go back

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.649
to Randleman but yeah I feel like I've

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.539
been hit by a string of a combination of

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.580
poor play and bad luck and Isaac and

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.250
it's up to me to get out of it more poor

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.000
play than bad luck keep in mind we did

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:16.830
win two lost runs and a keeper run

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.909
recently like we did in the past week or

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.310
10 days or so but this is our chance to

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.049
get ourselves out of the out of the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.750
doldrums here and I hope that you'll

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.520
equius and and agree and give me the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.710
opportunity to redeem myself on this

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.600
Judas run today for now I think all we

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.680
got to do is play well and we'll be fine

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.570
usually I mean that goes without saying

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.899
some extent is supposedly unique it's

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.750
not always guaranteed that's why I older

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.720
I've gotten to be honest with you and

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.689
pull back the veil a little bit my

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.310
anxiety has gotten a lot worse and I

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.369
think it's because I pretend to

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.680
understand variants now not to say that

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.990
I understand it I was very careful of my

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.520
diction but now I'm like you know I

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.250
thought about it while I was studying

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.259
for this certification test and I was

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.670
like you know sure I could do the mock

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.410
exam and get like 85 that means I will

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.510
get like a hundred

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.670
if the actual exam is the same as the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.650
mock exam but you know what if I brain

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.540
fart up a couple of the questions in

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.640
this section and then you might think

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.180
that this is like overly worrisome but I

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.910
don't necessarily think so I mean if to

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.050
know let's put it this way to get a 90%

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.910
on like an exam what do you need to know

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.950
what percentage of the course material

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.230
do you need to know do you need to know

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.210
90% you need to know a hundred percent

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.830
do you need to know like you know

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.440
seventy-five percent and maybe get a

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.480
little lucky this is a boring topic of

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.950
conversation but hopefully you sort of

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.600
understand where I'm coming from same

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.330
thing I think about it like when I'm

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.270
driving sometimes I'm like even if I'm

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.890
paying a hundred percent attention there

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.240
are things that I will not be able to

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.340
avoid like if somebody else is paying

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.510
zero percent attention could cause

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.550
problems that's why I get really

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.810
aggravated what I'm driving and I know

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.000
there's some of you out of you're

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.720
watching this video use your freaking

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.760
signal lights

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.890
there's no others literally no cost

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.560
using your signal lights if someone

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.270
wants to cut you off in traffic because

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.230
they saw that you put your signal light

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.610
on and they're like I'm going to get

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.610
ahead of this guy and not let him in

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.620
rest assured that you know you might get

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.170
home 45 seconds later but at least

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.600
you're not a douchebag like that person

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.840
right a person's hood just a straight-up

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.800
piece of garbage so feel good about the

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.870
fact that you you know are not them

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.690
anyway you know so I think about

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.970
variance you know when you're young it's

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:49.080
not uncommon although not guaranteed to

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.510
have no unduly high confidence and not

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.480
even in a bad way you're like I'm

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.459
confident I'll do well I know the

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.110
material that's a safe attitude to have

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.980
and it's probably a healthy attitude to

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.620
have pyro in a crawl space it is not the

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.360
way what is it

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.930
we were the lyrics to it's not strange

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.780
that's it mmm pyro in the crawl space

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.690
it's not strange and he just wants to

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.010
give you bombs this way okay thank god

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.630
this actually paid dividends because we

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.780
could have been in a weird spot if it

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.880
didn't now I'm like oh if I want to get

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.510
a 60 on this I need to know 110 percent

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.460
of the material

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.990
and maybe that's a good attitude in its

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.500
own way as well say me when I'm driving

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:36.180
I'm like many times I'm driving I've got

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:38.820
my phone hooked up to the Bluetooth part

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.400
of my car's so that it plays music from

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.840
my phone and then the music that I've

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.370
set up in the playlist will just stop

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.260
and there's no way to get it started

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.750
again without looking at my phone I will

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.000
have a silent drive for the next however

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.710
long it takes it happened like the last

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.600
summer we were driving to Portland like

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.010
two hours into the five hour drive which

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.590
actually ended up being like seven hours

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.660
because the traffic music cut out Kate

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:06.090
was asleep I was like well I guess you

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:08.130
know hello silence my old friends they

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.860
never didn't have any choice you know

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.110
I'm a cautious person probably overly

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.780
you know risk-averse at this stage in my

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.340
life how does this factor into the

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.080
binding of issac I don't remember how

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.360
factors into the binding of issac I got

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.430
lost on this tangent and now I apologize

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.310
but the Zane is still there and that's

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.800
what's so weird is that they gave me

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.140
like a d6 room right now I'd say thank

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.050
you sir can I have another they gave me

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.060
a D 69 right now I'd say you know you

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.530
know let me check out my wife first I

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.960
mean we're a married couple in a

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.800
monogamous relationship here I want to

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.330
step on our toes here by engaging in

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.920
mutual oral stimulation with the video

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.870
game it's a I don't know what a d 69

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.880
room is all I know is that if you start

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.430
playing with a 70 sided dice you've

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.350
reached peak nerd them and I'm

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.060
simultaneously ashamed of you and also

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.360
jealous because that sounds like fun

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.710
either way there we go this is where we

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.280
can use our strength card for good not

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:10.880
for evil

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:10.880
that's a terrible item so this is great

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:21.069
yeah so we basically heard one HP and

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:25.809
one stripe card we just got two of the

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:28.800
best while two very good one of the best

00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:30.759
and one very good item

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.669
that's a sentence that made like no

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:35.529
sense what I'm trying to say is that we

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:36.669
got a pretty smoking deal there we never

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:38.559
should have been able to afford it but

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:40.930
we came in with a coupon and now we can

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:43.270
fly and on top of the flying we also

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:46.599
have incubus which is a huge help for us

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:49.300
in dealing more damage straight up yet

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:51.689
instead okay dude ten cents for three

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.559
spirit eyes this run is all about value

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:56.800
right now and it's working out very

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:59.349
nicely we are now outside of that kind

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.629
of like gestation period as yudice it

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:04.749
should be nearly impossible for us to

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:06.580
dye our damage is not incredible

00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:09.069
necessarily but the utility that we have

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:11.770
is out of control and I mean I'll just

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:17.229
leave it a few guys to notice that we

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:19.389
picked up like literally literally 94

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:20.830
cents or something 19 well I guess we

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:23.469
probably picked up more than 94 but not

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:27.490
all of it was counted on one room that's

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:30.189
pretty ridiculous some more money than

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:33.039
you get on most runs and we just got it

00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:35.219
all for the nookie so if you'd like you

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:39.789
can take that cookie what does he mean

00:07:35.219 --> 00:07:41.529
okay people got on my butt a little bit

00:07:39.789 --> 00:07:44.110
for misinterpreting the lyrics to no

00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:47.080
scrubs but I chose to selectively ignore

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:48.849
those comments you can take that cookie

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.259
and stick it up your yeah so that's a

00:07:48.849 --> 00:07:51.759
very Punk statement because most of us

00:07:50.259 --> 00:07:52.719
would take a cookie you know our mouths

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:54.580
and I don't think that's what he's

00:07:52.719 --> 00:07:59.259
suggesting Evie's suggesting that you

00:07:54.580 --> 00:08:01.180
put it up your your posterior and then

00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:04.559
maybe spin afterwards depending on how

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.559
much is channeling the Fonz

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:14.940
is this somebody's offering him a cookie

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:17.460
or is the the girl in the song who you

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:18.930
know put a tender heart into a blender

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.490
and still he surrenders maybe she owns

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:23.460
like a small cookie store or something

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:28.200
is that the she's like a baker

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:31.620
she runs a small business she is a baker

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:35.640
she runs a small business and she's

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:40.790
raising up three very lovely girls they

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.790
all have hair up on like their father

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:48.510
wes borland brow unfurls I don't know

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:50.670
The Brady Bunch theme song watch a lot

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:52.470
of Nick at night as a kid on my

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:54.450
grandparents gray market satellite

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:59.220
television don't tell the American

00:08:54.450 --> 00:09:02.730
government I was a child I was an

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:05.670
accessory to the crime at worst and it's

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.840
made me the lovely so-and-so you see in

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.280
front of you to this day by the way I

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.560
didn't I don't want to interrupt my own

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.390
tangent but blood bag is very valuable

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.580
here because we also got black powder an

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:18.090
item that I think is it runs the

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:20.820
spectrum from garbage to excellent with

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.740
the excellent side correlating 107 to

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:25.170
speed basically better your speed is

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:28.520
better your black powder skills are

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:31.460
going to be yeah did you know I

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:34.530
sincerely grew up watching like

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:36.720
Gilligan's Island I Dream of Jeannie and

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:38.940
I've developed

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.260
obviously the Brady Bunch of I didn't

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.850
develop the Brady Bunch that's like

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.730
probably a Merv Griffin joint or

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:46.530
something I've developed whatever the

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:48.420
opposite of nostalgia is I think I've

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:52.740
ascended to a new level of like cultural

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:54.300
hipster dumb people go oh hey man you

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.930
guys remember biker mice from mars that

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:59.370
was awesome and i'm like no it was shit

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.180
anything that I liked when I was five is

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.910
trash

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:04.850
you know I've developed anti nostalgia I

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:07.440
don't know if it's good

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:11.430
obviously anti nostalgia is also a Merv

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:14.220
Griffin joint by the way but yeah I

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:15.750
don't know like if that's a valid

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:18.410
approach to things I would imagine

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:20.060
probably the most valid approach is to

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.020
you know judge everything on its own

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.810
merits but that's extremely

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:25.550
time-consuming and sometimes it means

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:27.890
that people could have to like back up

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:28.970
you know they'd ask you to back up your

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:32.690
opinion and that's going to be

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:35.660
troublesome everybody wants to get an

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:38.450
arguments all the time let's grab this

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.920
let's donate as well like we might as

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:43.580
well that's our get out of jail free

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:47.360
card for boss rush okay that's a great

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:50.630
pill dude grab that too I'm not at all

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:52.400
complaining about my lot in life for

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:56.600
real I'm very happy with where I am in

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:58.880
life even like you know maybe like four

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:01.580
years ago a super bad Isaac run would

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.440
have it would have not gotten me down

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:05.690
too much but for at least like a little

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.220
while out of it all you know Kate's like

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.810
what's wrong I had a really bad eyes

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.400
grunt I'm gonna get roasted in the

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:12.170
comments when it goes up on YouTube

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.090
right I got a little bit more of a

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:15.770
nihilistic approach to it I like

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.780
sometimes the Isaac video is a good

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:19.820
place sometimes the bad play there's an

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:21.320
audience that likes listening to be

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.570
rambled they use these to fall asleep

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:27.700
even in Isaac episode in which I don't

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:29.780
play my best is uh it's fine because

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:31.280
first off I'm never going to be the best

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:33.320
player in the world so that's you know

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.630
dismissive but also at the same time

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.860
quite freeing and then beyond that

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:38.480
that's not the only value of these

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.830
episodes that's you know I've gotten a

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.580
lot more easygoing about stuff like that

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:46.130
or like missing a day of uh series

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:49.220
bothers me less you know I used to get

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:52.130
like stomachaches about stuff like that

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:54.350
sincerely you ever wonder why you know

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:56.540
youtube.com slash northern Lions got the

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:58.970
kind of consistency that it does yeah it

00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:01.490
consistently led me down by canceling

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:04.880
series without due process okay I mean

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:05.950
maybe you got me there but all that

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.290
hurts

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:12.230
you know it's largely motivated by fear

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:15.410
and and abdominal discomfort but anyway

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:18.680
a much more nihilistic about stuff like

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:20.300
that now which i think is good no it's

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.650
it's a smart approach I figured I was

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.310
talking about like mere seconds before

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:24.560
that

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:26.180
oh it's everybody arguing yeah okay so

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.040
like I'm not complaining about my lot in

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.420
life but sometimes you know you're doing

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.740
a Twitter stream and people ask you

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.390
questions they'll be like Al what

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:35.300
your favorite Marvel movie I'll be like

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:37.610
you know got to give it up to the Winter

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:40.220
Soldier for sure I think I'd probably

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:42.050
say for me it's Captain America Civil

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:44.209
War and then you know most people are

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:48.020
saying about it but some people are like

00:12:44.209 --> 00:12:50.870
you must defend your position explain to

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:52.700
me right now why it's Captain America

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.899
Civil War not guardians of the galaxy

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.760
and you'll be like well despite the fact

00:12:53.899 --> 00:12:57.410
that you know the Marvel movies is

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.880
Captain Americans Civil War you know

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:00.560
they kind of follow a formula to some

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.930
extent and you know they're bereft of

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:05.270
huge consequences for the characters of

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:07.940
the franchise and I you know would

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:11.330
really like if in the Avengers infinity

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:12.770
Wars part 1 they just killed off Iron

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.899
Man in like two seconds to prove that

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:16.190
nobody is safe you know kind of like do

00:13:14.899 --> 00:13:19.190
some Game of Thrones stuff to keep

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:21.800
people guessing I still respected it

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:25.580
it's kind of like a masterwork of that

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:27.290
particular genre of filmmaking and you

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:29.360
know guardians of the galaxy is also

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:32.930
great it succeeds on tone I agree but

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.940
for whatever reason I'm more of a more

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:37.040
of a Captain America Civil War man I

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:41.410
guess I like that you know it's like the

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:45.920
New England Patriots of superhero movies

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:48.220
it's not necessarily invented but it's

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:51.020
extraordinarily well crafted I guess

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:56.779
Logan though amazing as well definitely

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:59.149
a candidate don't you know what let's go

00:13:56.779 --> 00:14:00.709
for it why not let's go but we do need

00:13:59.149 --> 00:14:02.720
to buy some spirit hearts hopefully or

00:14:00.709 --> 00:14:04.760
something from the shop at least if

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:06.740
people always want to argue I'm telling

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:09.860
you I think I think that's a young

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:11.540
person's game arguing about media not

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.950
all I'm not saying you are young if you

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:15.670
do it by layer you're juvenile or

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:19.130
immature but I don't know man

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:23.329
the older I get the less interested I

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:24.170
find myself I still will roast Nikolas

00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:26.899
from time to time

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:28.790
I don't think Grandma's Boy is great but

00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:30.920
I respect his right to enjoy it

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:33.740
tower ice is the one that always gets me

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:36.470
cuz it's a movie that I when I watched I

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:38.690
could not offer up any sort of opinion

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:40.610
about it at all it's like you know the

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.930
bread and olive garden or something like

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:43.680
that you like you want some more bread

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:46.410
what do you think you know

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:48.900
take it or leave it right but he found

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:51.720
himself touched by Tower Heist in a way

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:54.029
I think I'm jealous of that sincerity

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:55.650
but it's also funny to harp on because

00:14:54.029 --> 00:14:56.130
it's a Brett Ratner fellow I mean come

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:59.940
on

00:14:56.130 --> 00:15:01.140
but people like they would they love to

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.820
argue about media

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:07.320
I've been following because I follow

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:10.410
like subcultures and that not as like a

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:14.730
hobby but you know I have not liked like

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:16.140
a DC superhero film in forever I have

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:19.380
nothing against them I just have watched

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:20.580
them and not liked it but sometimes they

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.560
go to like Marvel Cinematic Universe

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:24.900
subreddit or the DC Cinematic Universe

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:28.170
in subreddit it's amazing people are

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:32.040
like getting into internet fistfights

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:33.270
over these movies I'm not saying you

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:36.180
know if you feel like that's a good use

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:39.900
of your time by all means but I don't

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:43.440
know man I kind of feel like if plot if

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:44.910
possible you should let it go you'd be

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.820
good for your blood pressure and take it

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:49.080
from someone you know who's got

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.760
borderline to high blood pressure I

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.830
think I would know probably from yelling

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:55.800
about like that's not the right way to

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:59.850
eat cheese on the NL SS all the time

00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:01.620
just mellow out a little bit so K let me

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:03.060
use the thing no matter how hard you

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:06.390
fight on the internet and be like you

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:08.310
know how can you listen to that kendrick

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:10.170
lamar's dam is the only hip-hop album

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:14.160
that blahblah people are gonna listen to

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:18.540
and watch and eat and read trash all the

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:22.709
time this is never gonna stop and it's

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:25.620
okay because that's the future that the

00:16:22.709 --> 00:16:27.060
human race is doomed itself to we're not

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.650
ready to go I mean we might as well

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:30.150
actually now that I think about it you

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:34.170
just got the goat head as well so we got

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:36.480
free deals of the devil you are better

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:38.880
served using your time to find great

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.320
stuff for yourself not just to be

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.850
selfish but because everybody's got

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:47.029
their own preferences and also like

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:50.070
people like you more I think

00:16:47.029 --> 00:16:51.540
nobody likes one of the most offensive

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:53.370
things you can say to somebody is like

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.720
you have bad taste you know it's cause

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:56.649
like their whole being into question

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:59.199
it's extremely impolite you kind

00:16:56.649 --> 00:17:00.910
being a jerk unless you know you both

00:16:59.199 --> 00:17:03.579
agree on the terms of the discussion you

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:05.529
know like on the NLS says we try to make

00:17:03.579 --> 00:17:06.579
sure everybody at least that's in my

00:17:05.529 --> 00:17:08.620
head that's how I think it works

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:11.230
everybody's on the same page before we

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:15.179
go actually you are a moron and here's

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:19.089
why but I mean come on paper plates and

00:17:15.179 --> 00:17:21.549
fry like potatoes get high lag plates if

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:27.459
you catch me I think there's a joke

00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:29.890
there is this joke there somewhere and

00:17:27.459 --> 00:17:31.870
lack of song by Supertramp

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:36.070
we're linked do your friends with the

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:38.289
timestamp there's a joke somewhere there

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:39.070
is a joke some monkey we need this we

00:17:38.289 --> 00:17:46.950
need this

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:49.210
ah no the verb pill I do not want it I

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:50.529
know it's been a preachy episode I feel

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.970
like you know the episodes that I come

00:17:50.529 --> 00:17:54.549
back from being away are always

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:56.740
preachings I don't demean catalog is not

00:17:54.549 --> 00:18:03.039
stored up so I have to talk about real

00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:04.240
world garbage man it's not even it's not

00:18:03.039 --> 00:18:07.480
like it's overly personal or anything

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:10.720
like that but the good news is the

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:13.260
discussion of or the the topics of

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:15.610
discussion in this issac episode so far

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:17.440
definitely would seem to indicate that

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:19.270
we are going to win or at least be in a

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:21.309
pretty dominant position as you can tell

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:24.970
all this is awesome so you take the Sun

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:27.370
card never mind it's actually not that

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:33.100
awesome we can't use the Sun card for

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:34.419
mappings so what we do instead is we

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:38.140
still have a moon card right that's the

00:18:34.419 --> 00:18:39.730
other one we take these sun cards and we

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:44.100
at least use them to clear one room each

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:44.100
which probably justifies the time spent

00:18:49.429 --> 00:18:59.630
that being said if your favorite Marvel

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:02.760
movie is not Winter Soldier Civil War

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:05.160
the first Avengers movie the first Iron

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:07.860
Man movie Logan or guardians of the

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:11.580
galaxy I feel like the onus is on you to

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:13.169
explain I'm not saying you can't add Xu

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.850
you should always have the right you

00:19:13.169 --> 00:19:16.860
know if you're like my favorite Marvel

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:18.690
movie is Iron Man 2 I want to have a

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:23.160
conversation with you because that's not

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:26.100
a popular opinion I want to know what in

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:28.400
your you know your tastes making

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.720
preferences has led you to that opinion

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:33.809
it's the same for food if you're like my

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:35.340
ideal meal is a is a french fried

00:19:33.809 --> 00:19:37.410
sandwich please

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:39.299
meet me at a coffee shop I'm going to

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:41.160
talk to you for 45 minutes I want to

00:19:39.299 --> 00:19:43.080
figure out why not that I think that

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:45.480
you're wrong although personally the

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.650
concept of a french fries sandwich it

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:48.290
doesn't make me want to throw up but it

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:51.120
doesn't seem that appetizing to me I

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:53.520
know that ship buddies exist but it's

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:56.340
one of those foods that we just sort of

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:59.010
go you know hey Europe thanks for

00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:00.540
settling us and all that but like can

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:01.200
you fart off with that because that's

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:04.890
nonsense

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.179
facade sees and look you're going to say

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:07.890
that that's offensive in many ways

00:20:06.179 --> 00:20:09.900
you're going to be right I mean we'd

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:11.880
poutine in Canada it's not like common

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:16.500
meal but I assume that chip buddies are

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:18.750
not necessarily a common meal in the UK

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:20.940
as well but we're talking a french fries

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:22.710
sandwich there's also a toast sandwich

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.210
that's too far one piece of toast in

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:26.400
between two pieces of on toasted bread

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:27.660
that's that's not a sandwich I mean it

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.340
is a sandwich I'm not so worried about

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.630
the classification as I am the fact that

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:33.500
this is going to fuel a human beings

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:37.049
life for a little while that scares me

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:39.270
but then in in the Netherlands they have

00:20:37.049 --> 00:20:42.780
like rainbow bread unicorn bread

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:44.070
whatever it's called unicorn bread that

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:45.840
is ridiculous it's called rainbow

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:48.360
Britain okay they're both ridiculous

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:51.150
because what it is is white bread butter

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:53.170
and sprinkles you know every country's

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:56.800
got some food item that it's just

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:58.150
you know bad but like it seems like the

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.770
kind of thing that you know when you get

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:01.150
to the border you tell tourists like hey

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:03.730
now make sure you have a sprinkle

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:05.380
sandwich when you're in Amsterdam then

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:07.510
when they come back they go sprinkle

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:09.880
sandwich oh yeah this is unusual in

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:14.140
there like you actually did it you idiot

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:16.450
me Iceland has a you know fermented

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:18.010
shark's fin or whatever but I'm not

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:20.290
totally convinced that that one isn't

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:22.780
just a joke that's played by the tourism

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:24.760
department you could say like they ate

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:27.100
it back in the freaking you know 10th

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:29.040
century or something sure I ain't living

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:31.600
in a 10th century though you know I

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:35.890
don't think they were like hey give me

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:37.600
the shark's fin maybe they were though I

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:42.760
don't I'm not an Icelandic historian

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:47.380
although I have read Niall saga if I

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:49.600
remember basically zero of it okay we're

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.140
going first up we're taking too much

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.980
damage

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:55.000
secondly yeah we have been to the shop

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:58.650
and we've been to the item room I don't

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:03.480
think so we are going to make boss rush

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:06.760
but we should stop taking damage our

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:11.740
speeds almost too high okay that was

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:14.560
really bad don't get stomped buddy this

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:21.070
is like a dangerous situation okay we

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:23.230
got to go oh oh my brain what did I say

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:26.320
it's a run for redemption so we missed

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:28.530
it we missed out on our chance to get

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:31.840
the boss rush because of my own idiocy

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:33.250
what am i doing I actually mind flooded

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:38.650
myself I didn't know that such a thing

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:43.740
was even possible it's just because I'm

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:43.740
such a highly tuned athletes that

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:48.740
if I go away for like 36 hours I just

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:49.640
lose all of my Isaac's skill I don't

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:52.280
know how to explain it

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.700
um so yeah I mean obviously that was

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:56.750
idiotic

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:59.180
but rest assured I feel the shame of the

00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:03.860
cold chicken nugget of shame deep within

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:08.600
my own bosom here men men have bosoms

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:14.390
right of varying size I could describe

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:15.980
myself as having a bosom it doesn't just

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:21.200
mean breast ranking me a second year

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:25.370
bosom a woman's chest okay so definitely

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:27.950
not that there was a phrase bosom

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:29.990
buddies and I'll read the word has lost

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:31.640
all meaning by the way bosom but I

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:34.610
thought that that meant you know you

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:36.260
were your friends who like you know hug

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:39.200
each other really close apparently it

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:44.540
does not mean that only refers to a

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:46.700
woman's chest my mistake still from

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:47.900
wearing a shirt that's too tight call me

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:52.190
from the right profile

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:54.350
it could be forgiven all right truth be

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:59.840
told this is the situation in which I

00:23:54.350 --> 00:24:02.150
thrive to HP on the womb and I've made a

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:04.310
mistake so egregious that to lose the

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:09.110
run at this point would call my actual

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:10.880
like brain health into question so we

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:12.500
have to win right now - you know

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.290
preserved if nothing else at least my

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:18.380
own sense of identity so it's very

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:19.820
important for me dial in here and get

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.410
this taken care of Plus you know people

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:24.440
are always telling me that I an L don't

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:26.060
do boss rush so much boss you're letting

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:28.130
it control your whole place so I said

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:29.780
okay I'll make it to boss rush and then

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:31.430
just not do it for some reason you know

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:34.760
some arbitrary reason that seems to make

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:36.740
any sense at all why is everything

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:39.250
that's supposed to be bad make me feel

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:39.250
so goood

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:48.240
nice dodge is nice kills and spirit

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:50.220
hearts are coming back fast and furious

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.850
I mean again as I've said many times on

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:53.280
this run

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:57.810
we basically should have no reason to

00:24:53.280 --> 00:25:01.350
lose even getting down to one spirit

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:04.980
heart on the last floor the result of

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:07.590
like aggregated mistakes she'd never

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:09.360
been hit by mom she'd never been hit

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:11.220
there to be honest with you but with the

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.660
wood sack dagger and you know the amount

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:15.510
of speed we have never should have been

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:16.740
hit by mom look I'm just you know guilty

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:18.210
of not seeing the board that well

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:19.890
playing a little too impatiently

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:22.710
probably not using my spacebar item as

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:25.260
often as I should and letting it I'm

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:27.860
letting it get under my skin that's

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:32.010
basically the purpose of this run was to

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:35.460
get around that so continue we haven't

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:40.350
lost the plot completely yet High

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:42.270
Priestess is at least okay I still don't

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:43.860
really know what I'm drowsy pills do I

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:45.450
kind of just use them as if they're I'm

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:46.830
excited and they have an effect outside

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:50.070
of the room but I don't think that's the

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:52.260
case I think maybe they only affect the

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:53.850
room you're presently on like I don't

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:55.530
think I can recall a situation in which

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:57.900
I've been like oh thank God we had I'm

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:59.880
drowsy active unless we had used it on

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:01.140
the room that we were actually in by the

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:03.630
way I should have mentioned this is the

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:05.550
first like non daily I've done since the

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:07.560
second booster pack has come out so I

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:09.150
was kind of hoping to see some new

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.740
mechanics new items and stuff like that

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:13.260
but so far it's been a pretty vanilla

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:17.790
run but I know I was really excited to

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:20.310
see that the buzz on the booster pack

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:22.530
was very positive first off because I

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:26.580
think it's good the game could use a win

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:28.680
basically a lot of the press around

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:31.200
afterbirth Plus was not necessarily that

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:33.990
amazing for reasons that I mean largely

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:36.780
were warranted but in my opinion at

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:40.230
least it's kind of a case by case basis

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:41.670
but and secondarily of course because my

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:43.740
professional health is pretty much

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:45.630
directly tied to the success and you

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:48.290
know public perception of this game so

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:50.990
it's always nice when you see news about

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:53.060
Isaac unlike a

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:54.380
a source that's not Isaac specific and

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:58.220
people are stoked about it I'm like eh

00:26:54.380 --> 00:27:01.910
okay it's been a while people were not

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:04.400
necessarily immediately thrilled with

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:08.750
after birth plus or the mod support that

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:10.370
came with after birth plus so in fact I

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:14.000
was talking to some Victor last night

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:15.920
and he said the all you idiot now you

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.210
didn't say I'm an idiot but he probably

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:21.770
thinks it from time to time and that's

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:24.770
fair I said like the booster packs are

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:29.000
probably the best thing about afterbirth

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:30.590
Plus and honestly I might be inclined to

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.150
agree with them the fact that we know

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:35.330
there's going to be like injections of

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:37.790
content at a regular intervals that is

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:40.160
vetted by kind of a central source it's

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:42.950
good you know I know that a lot of the

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:44.810
content is maybe all those it comes no

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:47.300
just a lot of the content is like taken

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:51.500
from the mods to begin with with the

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:53.900
permission of the mod makers but still

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.830
we're still like so far from being out

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.960
of the woods yet I'm a little

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:57.950
embarrassed but it's one of these none

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:01.780
of these are balls of steel

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:01.780
unfortunately spirit arts please

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:11.210
beautiful thank you we're back a

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:17.510
dinosaur's story verb use our last pill

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:20.210
as I can see forever right thought maybe

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:24.980
we'd like look for a second secret room

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:27.080
quickly and then immediately I've

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:30.010
decided that idea stinks because we

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:30.010
didn't find it right away

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:43.110
where could it be now let's get out of

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:46.390
here I mean I don't really want a verb

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:47.260
and I can see forever pill but I think I

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:50.200
will

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:52.540
the odds of balls of steel for example

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:55.210
showing up again are not necessarily

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:57.970
high like did we even use I can see

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:59.980
forever last we didn't did we

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:01.930
so we got to wait for another pill to

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:04.390
show up that we recognize and then we

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:07.600
can copy it into verb I think the last

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:09.460
one we used was relax there you go so

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.540
you think think consciously about things

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:12.730
for like two seconds

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:15.210
don't let your subconscious brain make

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:19.690
the same mistakes you've been making

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:21.370
long-term you thank you sac dagger did

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:25.120
we really care about having five homing

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:27.940
bombs even with like 85 bombs sure 85

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:29.380
homing poison bombs is good but you know

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:32.280
me I'm unlikely to use them that

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:41.340
frequently it's just not in my

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:43.360
repertoire really gotten quite lucky

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:45.760
then it seems like we're going to make

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:48.700
it out of this situation relatively

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:50.740
unscathed like we came close to dying

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:52.780
many times and we also just brain farted

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:57.280
our way you know out of a boss crush

00:29:52.780 --> 00:30:00.130
anyone that actually does the the seeds

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:03.820
by the way which I believe I showed it

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:05.170
up earlier feel free to tell me what you

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:07.140
got out of boss rush you know I'm not

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:10.770
going to hide from the truth I obvious

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:17.230
pin that as if like I didn't just make a

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:19.210
ridiculous mistake so I would love to

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:24.250
know what this run could have looked

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:26.350
like maybe you guys got lucky and it was

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:28.480
like blue baby's only friend you got

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:29.620
spared from the minutia or maybe it

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.240
would have been like homing tiers

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:35.040
piercing shots and I would have been

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:35.040
super bummed to find out but

00:30:35.059 --> 00:30:40.010
interesting to know nonetheless either

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:40.850
way we're certainly not fighting on us

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:43.250
which sucks because we have the

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:44.659
resources for it but we except for HP

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:48.500
which is the big one

00:30:44.659 --> 00:30:52.240
I do see that there is a delirium portal

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:55.280
we have to do the chest like we actually

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:56.780
cannot it's got four different paths to

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.679
go after the mom's heart boss fight we

00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:01.130
got to go chest

00:30:57.679 --> 00:31:05.090
we need the items we also need to take I

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:06.740
wouldn't say the easiest path oh well I

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:08.990
guess the easiest path would be pit just

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:10.400
go down to Sheol because we have the

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:13.070
Polaroid's we wouldn't be able to fight

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:15.140
the lamb I was terrible just hold it

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:18.980
together here you know you got the lead

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:21.280
on the last lap of a mario kart race you

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:24.679
don't have to hit every shortcut

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:28.370
although that would help you just need

00:31:24.679 --> 00:31:29.870
to not fall off the track and then

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:36.530
eventually just pray that they don't

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:39.380
give them lightning and blue shells dude

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:42.919
there's like there's a scientific

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:44.450
research paper to be done about the

00:31:42.919 --> 00:31:47.990
effects of playing mario congress i've

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:50.360
been playing a lot of well not a ton

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:51.950
like not 15 hours i played probably like

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.720
eight or nine hours of mario karta

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:55.520
deluxe on the switch and i gotta say for

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:57.140
someone who was fairly skeptical in

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.990
advance of it i'm really having a good

00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:02.600
time at the switch

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:07.659
mostly because mario kart is awesome but

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:11.299
also tumble seed r.i.p but also the

00:32:07.659 --> 00:32:12.409
ability to grab a pro controller and

00:32:11.299 --> 00:32:14.150
then just put the screen up on my

00:32:12.409 --> 00:32:16.309
headboard and play it in bed is really

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:17.690
nice it's it's an extremely portable

00:32:16.309 --> 00:32:19.940
sister I'm not trying to sell you on a

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:20.570
switch lord knows Nintendo basically

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:22.220
hates me

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:24.470
I think I've told this anecdote before

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:27.980
but you know we got dusted when we tried

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:31.580
to get a media appointment for the

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:34.490
newest Zelda game last III and the

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:36.440
scuttlebutt was that not nothing I'm

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:38.510
like famous or infamous within the

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:41.720
industry but let's be honest one who

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:44.270
plays video games but I'm probably I've

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:47.510
been known in some press circles as a

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:48.419
guy who I guess Culver's games has some

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:50.580
influence particularly

00:32:48.419 --> 00:32:52.679
are very particularly for indie stuff

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:54.269
maybe and they were like yeah we're like

00:32:52.679 --> 00:32:56.159
we're aware of him but we don't think

00:32:54.269 --> 00:32:58.559
his content really fits Nintendo's

00:32:56.159 --> 00:33:02.279
family-friendly brand image I'll say

00:32:58.559 --> 00:33:03.840
okay yeah I mean there was that Pokemon

00:33:02.279 --> 00:33:05.220
world tournament where the winners threw

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:07.649
shit on each other's doors I wouldn't

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:09.059
want it I mean I get what they they have

00:33:07.649 --> 00:33:10.649
a right to control their brand until the

00:33:09.059 --> 00:33:13.230
game releases anyway but all I'm saying

00:33:10.649 --> 00:33:15.659
is that I'm if anything I have cause to

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:19.289
be more biased against Nintendo than be

00:33:15.659 --> 00:33:21.359
biased in their favor and I think the

00:33:19.289 --> 00:33:24.389
switch is a really cool platform right

00:33:21.359 --> 00:33:27.269
now but every time I'm in like seventh

00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:30.739
place in a Mario Kart oh we're going

00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:33.239
holy crap are we ever gonna

00:33:30.739 --> 00:33:35.070
any time I'm in like seventh place in a

00:33:33.239 --> 00:33:37.799
Mario Kart race and then I get a hit by

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:39.210
a red shell I'm like what is wrong with

00:33:37.799 --> 00:33:39.720
you and then of course when I'm a in

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:41.730
eighth place

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.960
you know I'm throwing that red shell at

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:44.429
seventh place because I want to finish

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:46.679
in eighth I want to finish in seventh

00:33:44.429 --> 00:33:48.450
but I'm like you're just letting the

00:33:46.679 --> 00:33:52.529
people ahead of us get further ahead you

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:54.659
scumbag we the form like a union back

00:33:52.529 --> 00:33:59.190
here and use all of our power-ups

00:33:54.659 --> 00:34:04.559
against the the elites up front they're

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:06.239
the ones truly crushing us here and like

00:34:04.559 --> 00:34:07.859
playing Mario Kart with you with your

00:34:06.239 --> 00:34:11.099
spouse adds like a whole new dynamic

00:34:07.859 --> 00:34:14.549
into it because I'm like I do believe in

00:34:11.099 --> 00:34:16.020
like a perfect world we should be able

00:34:14.549 --> 00:34:18.869
to be a hundred percent competitive

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:22.049
towards one another but like if I'm in

00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:24.960
first place and I send a green shell

00:34:22.049 --> 00:34:29.010
backwards to hit her well we're racing

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:30.869
with other people that's like I phrased

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:32.190
it actually in the wrong way because she

00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:34.049
actually doesn't get mad at me but

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:36.450
sometimes you know I'll be in like

00:34:34.049 --> 00:34:37.649
second and she'll be in first she'll hit

00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:40.169
me with something I'll fall back to

00:34:37.649 --> 00:34:41.909
fifth and I'm like you don't understand

00:34:40.169 --> 00:34:43.829
if I finish in second that means the

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:45.899
other person can't finish in second and

00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:49.379
that means me and you as a as team

00:34:45.899 --> 00:34:52.919
Ferrari move further ahead in the GP

00:34:49.379 --> 00:34:56.190
standings like I'm here to be your your

00:34:52.919 --> 00:34:58.080
cow from Talladega Nights

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:59.880
sometimes she's all about the thrill of

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:06.350
the kill she is also better than me

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:09.300
which is part of it I think I remember

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:12.380
Cal's full name from Talladega Nights is

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:15.930
his name Cal Naughton jr. my brain

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:19.860
chooses to remember the full name

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:22.170
including suffix of Jhansi Riley's

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:25.710
character from the 2006 film Talladega

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:27.240
Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby can't

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:29.340
remember the second stage of the krebs

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:30.510
cycle if you remember it good for you

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:32.100
but once you get out of your biology

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:36.000
class you're not take it from somebody

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:38.430
who is at least on paper employable in

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.200
the biological world why would I ever

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:45.120
take so much damage there that's just

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:46.590
like slanderous okay that was very

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:48.900
stupid of me so here's what we're going

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:51.270
to do instead we could use sack dagger

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:53.370
to finish the job that's lazy let's

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:54.990
complete our redemption at least half of

00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:57.150
our redemption the win here was not

00:35:54.990 --> 00:36:00.540
difficult it was actually I mean first

00:35:57.150 --> 00:36:04.530
off we don't have it yet but in on paper

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:06.840
not a difficult win in fact a very easy

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:08.970
win that we almost squandered but we

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:11.520
didn't squander it and honestly that's

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:13.680
that's a cut above the last three Judas

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:15.810
runs we had in that one video so I'm

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:18.270
going to bounce and say you know what

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:20.340
this is a good foundational stone for us

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:22.020
to build our confidence on for now

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:23.490
