00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.279
everybody welcome back to Norton land

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.109
place binding Vizag after work plus the

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.880
Eden runs just can't be stopped we're

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.960
going for the baker's dozen today what's

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.480
that I thought you had a problem with

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.190
the phrase baker's dozen as good as you

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:22.010
talk sir

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:22.010
XZ b q r z0 c really bad rate of fire um

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.500
sorry really great rate of fire really

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.990
bad overall damage PhD is lovely if we

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.820
can get some pills that actually I mean

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.070
at this point HP up is probably the

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.120
safest bed but I mean a seven rate of

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.489
fire and I think that's just a raw stat

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.350
so that's actually the worst of the two

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.510
outcomes the other option would be that

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.100
it would be because of an item like you

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.010
know mom's perfume that lowers our tear

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.170
cap the reasoning is that it will keep

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.219
our tear cap at five so if yours upgrade

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.010
they're less likely to be worth

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.329
something right off the bat but but to

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.820
run especially now with the pickup of

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.250
the relic is really good with the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.080
exception of our damage and the last run

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.710
started super strong so I'm not trying

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.450
to judge this run necessarily a hundred

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.659
percent based on the merits of our last

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.979
run which I don't think is fair seven

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.439
rate of fire makes up for our

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.939
inefficient damage right now that's all

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.159
I'm going to say about that is that you

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.840
know it's largely pretty positive so

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.049
we're going to use power pill and that

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:30.000
got the job done very easily well also

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:32.100
leaving us the chance of a we might as

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.930
well also leaving us the chance of a

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.570
good use of mom's bra in the future but

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.829
for now we do want to take explosive

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.140
diarrhea now that we have a little extra

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.369
HP we don't the sweated as much you take

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.040
explosive diarrhea and we're going to

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.759
try to get a second secret room and a

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.759
stone chest

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:58.080
worked out second secret room gave us

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.430
nothing and that at this point I feel

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.550
like we're safe to move onwards because

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.660
we have gotten the item room we might

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.830
eventually get enough money for the

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.720
shopper and arcade rate doesn't really

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.509
matter and honestly it turns out that we

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.830
were pretty lucky to get that HP upgrade

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.140
because we're rolling exclusively on

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.370
spirit house so I mean the gist of it

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.990
right now is that it really doesn't

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.959
matter we're in such a good spot and one

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.690
HP is about as good as like 4 HP right

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.480
now which I understand sounds like a

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.040
ridiculous claim and it may well be a

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.070
ridiculous claim but all I mean by that

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.500
is you know if we get nine lives or

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.400
Abaddonn or you know dark Judas or

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.630
something like that there's a few

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.070
different options on our deal with the

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.459
devil which is almost guaranteed on this

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.320
floor that are basically static it

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.050
doesn't matter what our HP is we're

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.380
going to be in the same position after

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.890
taking them so it's really really nice

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.330
to have more than zero HP that way we

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.709
can pay red hearts instead of spirit

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.600
hearts which are a little bit harder to

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.560
come by especially if we didn't have the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.330
relic which obviously we do and well

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.620
yeah this situation is fine the only

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.910
thing we need is a damage upgrade and

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.750
that can happen pretty easily on this

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.760
run last run we fought a hush and mega

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.680
Satan so I have like every available

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.950
excuse not to do that on this run but

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.110
we'll see how things go I feel like I'm

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.810
in a groove like I'm in a I'm in a Zayn

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.980
groove we've had runs that have been fun

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.780
they've also been largely pretty strong

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.239
and usually right off the bat like we

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.700
haven't had too many runs that have

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.650
we've had to like you know scrounge up

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:37.650
from the freaking gutter and you know we

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:39.840
got like this run with no relic plus our

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.549
rate of fire being like 13 is where

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.930
things start to get problematic but

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:48.110
instead we got to you know have a rather

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.990
doubled rate of fire which is like

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.390
excellent for us

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.990
[Music]

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.430
anyway PhD is also great if you can find

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.500
a way to make it pop but you know that

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:07.310
you don't need me to tell you that we do

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:09.560
have an Isaac's room the like there's a

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.330
pipe dream for me and that's that like

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.970
even if this deal with the devil stinks

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.950
we get into Isaac's room blow up the the

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.630
carpet it has a black market we take an

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.370
item or two on the black market HP

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.870
depending and then we can sleep in the

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.880
bed and get three spirit arts back which

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.860
if we pay three spirit hearts for an

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.140
item from the black market then this

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.400
gives us three spirit arts back just for

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.430
sleeping in the bed so it's basically

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.910
like paying three bombs for two items

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.070
right one item I guess but still we need

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.650
one more bomb to make that trade

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.820
plausible and also it it's very very

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.290
unlikely to happen in the first place

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.410
because we're talking about you know

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:49.310
we're rolling like a d12 and we have to

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:51.140
hit what's like winking snake eyes one

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.200
one is snake eyes I want one too on my

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.730
b12 I want to 12 but anyway I don't

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.400
think I've ever rolled of d12 to be

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.860
honest with you I've rolled I've rolled

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.310
many different kinds of dices certainly

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:07.910
a d6 definitely a d20 because they're

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:10.400
commonly used as life counters in magic

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.890
gathering but I don't know about a d12

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.590
that's that's a little bit more on the

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.690
on the side of dice I don't know if I've

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.490
ever held in my hands to be honest with

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.810
you the even baby is good and it is a

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.530
damage upgrade but I don't know if it's

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.300
good enough

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.730
you should not necessarily have taken

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:30.590
lunch yet but I'd be again it's fairly

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:32.210
minor the mark by the way really nice

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:36.500
for us I would say it has taken our

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:40.270
damage to a point that is okay we should

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:43.790
have probably popped to a spades first

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.020
in fact it's better than okay and the

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.210
main reason it's better than okay is

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:52.610
because our rate of fire is just

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:54.080
disgustingly good sure sack of pennies

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.580
is very solid and we've got enough keys

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.840
thanks to the two of spades even though

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.670
we botched the two of spades play

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.330
obviously it's going to leave us in a

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.330
position where

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:07.220
we can pick up something from our shop

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.320
even if it is just a consumable and

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.470
another bomb and spirit are there is

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.910
acceptable Larry jr. should melt here we

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.280
got enough bombs to make Isaac's room

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:19.070
work if the dream actually comes through

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.320
I will ball out on Isaac's room because

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.630
if it's a black market that is I will

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:27.020
ball out because we're getting so many

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.730
spirit hearts anyway two items for one

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:34.280
red heart and then three spirit has

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:36.560
almost no effect whatsoever on our on

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.570
our HP from a functional standpoint I

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.570
mean literally obviously it has some

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:44.180
effect but from like a functional

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:46.460
standpoint you know we we only need like

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:49.130
X HP to survive right now where X is

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.410
probably like one but we shouldn't get

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.830
that low anyway we kept three bombs for

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.830
a reason

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.400
the crack into these two here it's a

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.320
stinky Isaac's room which is no good and

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.520
that's just a portal to the next floor

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.020
so honestly we're just going to go we

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.670
don't need to go to our shop with ten

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:08.470
cents there's a possible chance of an

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.470
item but unlikely to matter too much

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:13.070
yeah I don't know what I was thinking

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.600
there I'll just own up to it I think I

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.010
thought if I just ran fast enough I

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.090
wouldn't get hit by the spikes but then

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.310
I would have gotten here by the spikes

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.620
on the way out unless we had the perfect

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:24.260
diagonal so it was it was a whiff but

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.150
anyway it doesn't matter I don't know

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.440
what to say honestly it's one of those

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.970
situations where I almost feel like I

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.060
should apologize for the quality of the

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:35.390
run right now because it we've had

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:38.990
probably like close to 11 or 12 runs out

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:41.450
of 13 that have not really been super

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:45.080
difficult and on a couple of them I

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:46.520
played like like actual garbage like I

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.900
don't know why I'm whispering it is if

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.090
you can't just turn up your volume but

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.890
yeah it played like like serious trash

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.420
on some of these not this one this one's

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:55.100
been fine even though there's been a

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:57.770
little bit of brain fart action lately

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.780
um but yeah I mean it's just it's the

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:01.430
innate Canadian inside of me that's like

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.830
I'm sorry I'm not in more misery for

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.970
your entertainment right now but on the

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.350
flip side I think of the commentaries

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.270
been nice as a result you know we talked

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:10.670
about a lot of things I've probably made

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:12.260
myself look like a monster because I

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:14.300
didn't buy the

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.040
a homeless lady at McDonald's that meal

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.660
when she asked me to even though you

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.990
know I certainly do have the means but

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:25.160
it's like I don't know I guess guess it

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:26.990
makes me uh maybe I just got to accept

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.700
that I'm then I am a little calloused in

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.100
that nature you know and calloused I

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:34.130
think is good word I previously you know

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.660
baby soft skin has become the hardens to

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:39.860
the outside world as a result of

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:41.750
multiple abrasions or is that just a

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:47.240
good excuse to close yourself off I

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:48.530
don't know ten bombs is good when we

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.900
have zero but I don't think it's good

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:52.880
enough dog tooth on the other hand might

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.770
only be like effect it's not a I think

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.110
it's a raw damage increase not a

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:58.790
proportional damage increase so this

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:00.380
isn't really fair to say but at least

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:02.360
right now it's like a ten percent damage

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:05.060
up and we don't have the bombs necessary

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:07.130
to use the special effect of it but I

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.600
think that it's one of those things that

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.250
guarantees those kind of some future

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.230
prospects as long as we have bombs to

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:13.790
make it pop it's hard for me to say no

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:17.260
to a damage upgrade even when that

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:19.460
damage upgrade is kind of not that good

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:23.350
like I've kind of I know people are like

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:25.940
Isaac talk really been sleeper but I

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:27.200
understand where you're coming from play

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.390
this game enough but one of the hard

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.920
things for media used to or at least

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:33.170
come to terms with recently is the idea

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:36.860
that I probably over eight like all

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:39.740
damage upgrades most of like what is

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:45.160
responsible for most of our wins on an

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:50.270
attribute standpoint I honestly think

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:52.370
it's probably mostly like a couple of

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:55.700
really good damage upgrades like if we

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:56.840
win this run the mark right now at least

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.550
from the way things are looking is like

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:01.360
a 10 out of 10 and the relic is like a

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:05.060
10 out of 10 how much of our win is

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:06.200
dogtooth responsible for 1% 2% I mean

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.180
it's kind of an abstract thing to

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.650
measure to begin with but I think you

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:13.910
might understand what I'm saying it's

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:18.110
like you know in the electoral college

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:20.060
map you know the mark is like winning

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:23.060
New York it's like 30-something

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.650
electoral college seats right votes

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.850
whatever you call them in the US but um

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.470
and

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:30.649
then like dogtooth is like winning

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:32.389
Nebraska is like nine votes or something

00:10:30.649 --> 00:10:35.509
like that is not worth nothing it's nice

00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:36.889
to have remember I chose to have it you

00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:38.509
know and of course in the democracy is

00:10:36.889 --> 00:10:40.250
supposed to represent the will of people

00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:44.560
in blah blah blah but I'm just saying

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:46.430
like there are there are items that are

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.930
disproportionately useful which is

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:50.420
obvious but then you got to think like

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:51.980
well maybe we should go a little harder

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.449
on our donation machine or sorry our

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:56.149
reroll machine to make those happen but

00:10:53.449 --> 00:10:59.149
this is inside baseball that is honestly

00:10:56.149 --> 00:11:00.889
probably like 99% irrelevant on a run in

00:10:59.149 --> 00:11:04.130
which we have decent damage we're ahead

00:11:00.889 --> 00:11:06.740
of the curve and we are also rockin the

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:09.410
relic which is I don't want to say makes

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:11.660
us unstoppable but it makes us hard to

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:13.930
stop be really nice to kill a few of

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:17.120
these guys before they went down words

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:17.779
obviously didn't necessarily come to

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.880
fruition

00:11:17.779 --> 00:11:21.589
we need more damage if mom's bra is

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.990
going to be good it's very much like a

00:11:21.589 --> 00:11:26.089
rich get richer sort of item if you

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:27.649
wanted to actually work for you the

00:11:26.089 --> 00:11:29.420
thing is like almost every item in the

00:11:27.649 --> 00:11:32.509
game gets better as the items around it

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:35.209
get better so it's a little bit of a

00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:36.740
misnomer to be like oh you know this

00:11:35.209 --> 00:11:38.300
item gets better when you run gets

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:40.069
better because that's it describes

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:43.639
almost every item in Isaac I think like

00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:45.380
sugar would for example you know if your

00:11:43.639 --> 00:11:47.589
run is bad shoopdawhoop is not as good

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:49.759
as it would be if your run was good

00:11:47.589 --> 00:11:52.339
assuming it's bad because of a damage

00:11:49.759 --> 00:11:54.230
reason anyway oh mantras on a hundred

00:11:52.339 --> 00:11:56.689
percent yes rate of fire is going to

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:59.720
suffer but not really because it's only

00:11:56.689 --> 00:12:01.430
our rate of fire if we didn't have

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.100
monstro as long as what's suffering we

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:08.180
got to keep it we could have pushed it

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:12.350
but it's also fine we need to keep these

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:13.519
bombs for dogtooth but crack into it see

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:16.779
what's going on here there's a secret

00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:16.779
room over here it seems

00:12:18.079 --> 00:12:24.660
they will not allow me to exit which I

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:28.649
disapprove of I am an adult and can do

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:30.660
what I want we want to do the room

00:12:28.649 --> 00:12:32.760
regardless because I mean as you just

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:35.190
saw a they were going to get like two

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.380
out of four relic charges which are in

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:40.440
the background here for doing this room

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:42.600
so I mean honestly the team deserves a

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:46.019
lot of credit for this move if we're

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:48.029
going to drag on Nicholas Firth thank

00:12:46.019 --> 00:12:49.950
you for giving me an easy exit if you're

00:12:48.029 --> 00:12:51.870
going to rag on Nicholas for like every

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:53.490
nerf that they add to the game or like

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:55.500
oh well like six of the items have

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:57.000
exactly the same sprite just rotated a

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.290
little bit I understand those concerns

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.570
by the way but we should give them

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:04.529
credit for instituting a very logical

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:07.110
change which in this case was making it

00:13:04.529 --> 00:13:10.800
so that you get charges well you're on

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:12.420
the the mob and boss Trap rooms always

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:16.019
just seemed logical to me to begin with

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:18.480
and a good change I think again making

00:13:16.019 --> 00:13:19.769
good progress here but so be a great

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.199
floor to get a deal with the devil that

00:13:19.769 --> 00:13:24.630
puts us over the top like Sylvester

00:13:22.199 --> 00:13:26.519
Stallone you know what

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:31.459
hell yeah exactly like Sylvester

00:13:26.519 --> 00:13:31.459
Stallone hey should you go for me

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:36.120
Sylvester what are you doing here hey

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.720
you're just using the means of

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.730
production

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.970
oh yeah the Communist Manifesto so

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:45.360
that's just alone I try to keep the show

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:46.769
apolitical hey no the MiGs little about

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.930
redistributing the wealth is a matter

00:13:46.769 --> 00:13:50.459
this Sylvester your net worth is a

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:52.610
hundred and ten million dollars are you

00:13:50.459 --> 00:13:55.380
sure you want to go through with this

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:59.279
subdued you laughing priceless your

00:13:55.380 --> 00:14:01.589
videos is messy good so let's get out of

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:05.820
here Sylvester you're creating an

00:14:01.589 --> 00:14:09.660
uncomfortable tone on the show is really

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:12.240
apologetic about dead well well thank

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:13.980
you I suppose okay let's I can't believe

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:18.360
we didn't get hit on that room we did

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:19.829
get the obvious which is horror Babylon

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.240
very very good

00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:22.980
we have the relic which allows us to

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:26.269
support this Whore of Babylon state like

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:26.269
forever so

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:32.760
I did somebody auto service to 1960

00:14:31.649 --> 00:14:34.170
there are Michael Caine who was

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:38.180
impression I've forgotten how to do

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:40.740
that's right it's me 1960s Michael Caine

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.820
can you name a movie I was in in the

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:46.230
1960s

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:48.269
Northern Line think you will I mean the

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:52.589
original Italian Job that's correct the

00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:56.370
original Italian Job wasn't always old

00:14:52.589 --> 00:14:58.860
man Alfred Pennyworth you know used to

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:01.100
be a womanizer oh now I've got a little

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:05.040
Sean Connery in my voice for some reason

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:08.519
not good at impressions I always like

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:10.350
there's a bit of like a turn up your

00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:12.269
nose sort of thing I had comedy that

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:15.720
involves impressions it's like oh that's

00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:18.870
that's for you know the proletariat I

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:20.730
only listen to anti comedy like Nirvana

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:22.320
the band the show which actually have

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:24.420
seen it I think is quite funny I'm not

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:27.980
turning up my nose at that but I'm see

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:30.209
come on is it hipster comedy for certain

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:31.769
and if you can't embrace that we're at a

00:15:30.209 --> 00:15:33.000
point of cell phone awareness that means

00:15:31.769 --> 00:15:35.399
you shouldn't laugh at anything to begin

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.600
with can't laugh at yourself but you

00:15:35.399 --> 00:15:38.160
know I think that's there's also a

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.660
little element of jealousy there which

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:42.000
is like I wish I could do some good

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:45.570
impressions the Sylvester Stallone

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.399
impression is not worth it like it's not

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:50.220
it's not what get excited about because

00:15:47.399 --> 00:15:52.170
it's just so easy it's like doing an

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:55.230
Arnold Schwarzenegger impression you

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:56.970
know everyone has like at least a 6 out

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:58.860
of 10 Arnold Schwarzenegger impression

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:02.550
cuz you just go you'll put that cookie

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:04.410
down now you're like whoa that's that's

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:07.380
Arnold Schwarzenegger most of the time

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:10.320
he's actually you know probably like

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:14.160
I'll have the Reuben sandwich please

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:17.310
you know did you just that's a line that

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:19.260
he said in a cartoonish voice that's a

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:20.640
little played out Sylvester is the same

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.930
way because if you ever run out of stuff

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.300
to say in the Sylvester Stallone

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:24.959
impression you just go hey

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:28.540
[Music]

00:16:24.959 --> 00:16:29.829
and people go haha yes that's right

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:32.259
that's what he sounds like

00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:33.910
hey everyone made you sound like an

00:16:32.259 --> 00:16:36.779
idiot even though I won an Oscar for

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:40.089
Best Original Screenplay in 1970 and we

00:16:36.779 --> 00:16:41.889
Rockies universally disrespected it's

00:16:40.089 --> 00:16:44.410
kind of a brain dead franchise despite

00:16:41.889 --> 00:16:46.869
the first couple of movies beyou great

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:52.360
story about a working-class man to rise

00:16:46.869 --> 00:16:56.410
above adversity you know it's rocky gets

00:16:52.360 --> 00:17:00.009
a bad rap man but I've gone down that

00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:02.559
road too many times I was seven cents

00:17:00.009 --> 00:17:06.970
why not I try to get people to respect

00:17:02.559 --> 00:17:09.419
Rocky it's an uphill battle to some

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:11.860
extent so I go hey respect Rocky and

00:17:09.419 --> 00:17:16.299
they go yeah but what about the one in

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:20.409
which she's like 62 years old and he's

00:17:16.299 --> 00:17:23.769
fighting that 25 year old man isn't that

00:17:20.409 --> 00:17:26.110
patently ridiculous so that's the point

00:17:23.769 --> 00:17:28.059
of the freakin movie you think dong is

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:30.820
that Rocky the whole time is going I

00:17:28.059 --> 00:17:33.100
don't know I just kidding Webb gray

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:35.139
smashed in you know and they're like but

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:37.690
you know this might be your last hurrah

00:17:35.139 --> 00:17:40.299
Rocky like this might be your last stab

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:44.019
and you know your whole life has been

00:17:40.299 --> 00:17:46.570
defined by being a good boxer and now

00:17:44.019 --> 00:17:49.389
Father Time is cruelly pushing you out

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:51.779
of your spot at the top you know this

00:17:49.389 --> 00:17:54.010
might be your last stab and you know a

00:17:51.779 --> 00:17:55.630
reminiscing about what your past life is

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:57.940
like they're not they don't play the

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:59.830
movie straight like all right Rock

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:01.299
here's this weakness you just gotta you

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:03.340
know punch them in the testicles and you

00:18:01.299 --> 00:18:05.799
got him you okay Micky you know they're

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:08.350
it's actually it's a heartfelt I'll be a

00:18:05.799 --> 00:18:10.559
not perfect movie about you know growing

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:14.049
old when you're when the value you've

00:18:10.559 --> 00:18:15.789
derived from society is very much you

00:18:14.049 --> 00:18:17.679
know tailored to a young man's game but

00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:18.850
you know people just I mean it's like

00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:20.860
ten years old at this point a movie

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:22.990
might be respected but at the time the

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:25.539
discourse quote-on-quote was definitely

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:30.070
like there's no way Rocky can be you

00:18:25.539 --> 00:18:33.309
know mason-dixon of course have you seen

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:35.529
them look at 28-year old professional

00:18:33.309 --> 00:18:37.630
boxer in the prime shape of his life of

00:18:35.529 --> 00:18:39.520
course is a big mason-dixon

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:41.500
point is he doesn't have to beat

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:45.010
mason-dixon he just has to beat

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:46.870
society's prejudice about what it means

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:49.090
to be like a cast-off professional

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:51.010
athlete he just has to beat expectations

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:52.600
and that's enough but even that who

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:54.160
knows if it's going to come to fruition

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:58.360
anyway I haven't seen a Creed yet but I

00:18:54.160 --> 00:19:00.580
hear that it's amazing okay we're on the

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:03.700
crop list so it's really it becomes up

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:05.320
to us how we want to handle this I would

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:07.270
love to get an early teleport card I'm

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:11.200
optimistic about our chances given the

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:12.640
number of sacks on this room devil card

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:15.670
is not a teleport card Wheel of Fortune

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:17.610
is not a teleport card to luck upgrades

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:20.170
is all amazing

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:22.420
so devil strength and Wheel of Fortune

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:24.280
so sadly no teleport card so plenty of

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:28.930
time to make this deal with the devil

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:30.670
that I've never been like you might be

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:32.470
saying NL this is the movies not worth

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:35.620
it I just I get annoyed when people

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:37.690
think by default they're smarter than

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:39.340
media there's a lot of media that it's

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:41.650
easy to be smarter than it like if you

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:43.780
watch the happening and you go this is

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:46.180
trash then you're like you know make fun

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:49.870
of it but I had like the most tilted

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:52.720
moment of my young hipster life in my

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:55.570
first year of university and this is you

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:57.970
know now at this point 11 years ago so

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:59.440
I'm not holding the grudge people change

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:01.630
or even if they don't doesn't matter

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:05.440
just a stupid trivial like anecdote

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:07.030
anyway but my favorite movie of all time

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.340
at the time and still to this day

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:11.530
perhaps because it's wonderful is Evil

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:12.340
Dead 2 it's great mix of horror and

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:15.790
satire

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:18.010
it's very intelligently made I'm a big

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:19.420
fan of that movie and I was like you

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:22.120
know what I'm in college with

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:24.070
like-minded people here let's have a

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:26.140
little movie night and we'll watch Evil

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:27.790
Dead 2 I own turn on DVD because I

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:29.380
wanted to respect the creator even

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:33.360
though he did go on to make spider-man 3

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:35.230
and insult my intelligence

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:37.680
hell we're going to take them both here

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:41.650
anyway the point is I watched it and

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:44.800
it's not meant to be bad that's like

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:47.770
that's ignoring the situation GIMP is

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:50.800
really nice here but it's meant to be

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:52.390
silly it's silly in tone

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.520
and the people that I was watching it

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:56.620
with not all of them but some of them

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.450
were like hey look at how silly this

00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:01.120
thing is don't these filmmakers know how

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:02.440
to make a movie and I progressed first I

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.570
was like haha but like you know it's

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:07.690
meant to be silly and then progressively

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:10.390
over the course of the of the evening I

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:12.160
got I wouldn't say mad but like more and

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:13.930
more annoyed where I was eventually like

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.010
you know what let me just stop why does

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:16.420
the movie if you don't like it and I

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:18.490
know we having a good time making fun of

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.740
it it's like it's a testament to my own

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:23.410
inability to chill out in that situation

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:25.930
but it was a personal nightmare for me I

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:27.580
just say I get so mine flooded when

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:29.320
people are watching a movie and they

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:32.770
don't even give it a chance they just go

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:34.270
isn't that stupid you might be saying NL

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:36.130
what about your treatment of Prometheus

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:39.370
look first off I respect you for trying

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:41.890
to get me to do some self analysis it's

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:43.900
a very valid valuable trait I think I'm

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:45.190
just going to not go too boss rush we're

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:49.530
going to be slightly too slow and that's

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:53.530
okay and I gave Prometheus a chance

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:56.620
genuinely you know even we're talking

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:58.750
like 90% of the way through the movie

00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:01.030
Charlize Theron has that moment you know

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:04.120
what I'm talking about railroads like

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:06.370
just run to the side even then I was

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:08.410
like I you know I'm willing to give it a

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:10.570
shit was only after it was over that I

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:13.870
turned to Kate and when that was like

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:15.490
really stupid and bad I gave it I gave

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:16.900
it a chance but every subsequent time

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:18.940
that I've watched it I've been like this

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.500
is exceedingly stupid

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.670
I recognize that if you're a fan of four

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.110
media's probably it's annoying to hear

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:24.940
me brag on that movie all the time so

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:26.620
I'm not not I'm just using it as an

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:30.760
example of at least being a little

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:33.490
self-aware but yes if I said to say

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:35.860
that's like my number one pet peeve at

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:37.210
the same thing like and this is my back

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:40.270
as I never should have selected this

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:41.710
movie but one hungover afternoon and

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:43.060
university everyone was like let's watch

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:45.070
a movie and I was like oh you guys seen

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:46.360
the good the bad and the ugly one of my

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:48.250
favorite movies and you know there's

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.960
great moments in that that you make you

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:52.120
sort of forget that it is actually it's

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:54.010
opens with like 45 minutes of just like

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:56.920
a single shot of a cactus in the desert

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:59.830
basically you know it's got that yet

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:02.200
Wow Wow and then it's got the legacy of

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:04.540
gold at the end of it you know if you're

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:06.940
going to shoot just shoot don't talk

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:10.570
it's got some great moments in it then

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:12.850
like it's it's extremely slow-paced in a

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:14.710
way that is good if you're watching it

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:16.690
you know in the right environment but

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:18.820
we're like really should have just

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:20.710
watched a like bulletproof monk or

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:22.750
something like that instead they ever I

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:24.940
was like this movie stinks why isn't so

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:27.100
revered and I'm like hey guys you got it

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:29.170
hey it's a patient film I understand but

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:30.610
like gives us you know so I did take

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:33.550
brimstone brimstone monster as long as

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:35.830
kind of fun so basically I'm an idiot

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:38.320
who you know at least at this stage in

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:40.810
my life I now recognize the importance

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:42.670
of the phrase read the room reading the

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:43.990
room is very important you know if

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:45.340
you're in a room full of toddlers you

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:47.200
know oh let's watch Django Unchained

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:49.840
that's going to invite some questions

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:53.830
you may not want to answer and if it's a

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:56.140
room full of you know 17 year olds and

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:58.180
you're the only one self-important

00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:01.450
enough to be the kind of hipster that's

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:04.960
like let's watch you know Rashomon you

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:06.220
know you're maybe I just kept company

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.690
that I shouldn't have kept in my first

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:10.030
year of university like some of these

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:12.100
people are still my friends but person

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:14.560
I'm thinking of with whom I watched Evil

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:16.300
Dead 2 like 8 of us also watched The

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:19.180
Departed together right after it came

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:20.290
out and she was like I didn't really get

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:22.210
it I thought it was just sort of like

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:25.720
just a generic action movie you know

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:28.360
it's a generic action movie my butthole

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:31.030
it's me Frank Costello

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:33.130
don't stop till you're numb you know

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:37.020
another impression it's a little too

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:37.020
easy to be bad Apple get credit for but

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:45.250
the woman is also probably three times

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:47.410
smarter than I am genuinely this is not

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:48.820
just me being selfish to then make

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:51.100
myself look like the good guy in the

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:53.680
situation by being complimentary I don't

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:57.250
think she and I aren't on the same

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:58.630
spectrum with respect to movies if

00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:01.360
anything I think I've probably moved

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:03.250
closer to her spectrum for movies since

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:06.340
that point not that we've ever kept in

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:08.200
touch but you know I was like what does

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:10.600
this mean for the meta cinematic you

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:14.860
know medium she was just like

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:18.250
I really like Alexis Bledel and there's

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:19.720
a thing is I am the dick in a situation

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:21.370
because it took me way too long to

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:25.559
realize that that's actually totally

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:28.049
fine anyway

00:25:25.559 --> 00:25:32.679
that's a very classic little

00:25:28.049 --> 00:25:37.990
encapsulated northernlion bit there well

00:25:32.679 --> 00:25:42.190
I would like to oh I will pay the iron

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:43.500
price for this I don't know if that was

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:46.270
worth it but I didn't really want the

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:50.679
body to mess up our existing HP and

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:52.659
Whore of Babylon for that matter anyway

00:25:50.679 --> 00:25:55.330
yeah it's the perfect northernlion

00:25:52.659 --> 00:25:58.870
anecdote because it starts out by

00:25:55.330 --> 00:26:00.789
vilifying somebody else much to the

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:02.380
point of a grand izing myself and then

00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:04.390
it loops back around to I'm being

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:06.850
condescending in the first place and we

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:09.190
all leave feeling better about ourselves

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:11.440
maybe I don't know it's like there's a

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:13.090
little irony and self-awareness

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:16.059
encapsulated there anyway

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:17.740
yeah I'm studying to my final because

00:26:16.059 --> 00:26:18.760
you need to tell them how many times of

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:21.909
said encapsulation

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:24.150
I got roasted man somebody on stream

00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:27.580
asked me what polymorphism was and

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:30.370
instead of describing what polymorphism

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:33.730
was I described the purpose of

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:35.590
overloaded functions and then they went

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:37.179
like NL are you sure like you know what

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:39.610
you're talking to come on polymorphism

00:26:37.179 --> 00:26:42.190
and function overloading are similar

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:45.100
enough that you don't have to ask if I'm

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:46.419
okay because I messaged two fairly

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:50.110
simple things to get confused I

00:26:46.419 --> 00:26:52.450
understand error of my ways now probably

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:56.530
morphisms when an object of a derived

00:26:52.450 --> 00:27:01.650
class can also act as an object of any

00:26:56.530 --> 00:27:04.360
of its base classes sorry the opposite

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:05.860
when an object of a base class can

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:08.200
operate as an object of any of its

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:10.270
derived classes but not vice versa due

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:12.780
to the is a nature of composition

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:15.549
whereas overloaded function calls at

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:17.110
runtime look at the number and types of

00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:19.500
the arguments in that you guys see a

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:19.500
like a

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:27.760
just stop just stop

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:30.130
BAE I'm in computer science 101 I'm 12

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.670
by the way okay what do we got going on

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:37.960
here

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:40.270
free to play by the way let me in I'm

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:46.870
ready dude you got freaking lagged out

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:49.440
there okay it's a two room hi I mean

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:51.760
certainly take the room

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:54.610
it's not that good but I'll live with it

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:56.590
and then reroll everything else and then

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:59.230
come if all this feels pretty good

00:27:56.590 --> 00:28:06.070
Arawak is irrelevant also sounds like a

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:08.970
foot and Pokemon just pop the Sun then

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:12.280
we got chariot wheel of fortune' Arawak

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:16.080
Arawak I know marelok is Pokemon okay

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:20.560
I'm just want maybe Wheel of Fortune I

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:23.020
think that's probably the the outcome we

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:25.320
would choose to go with ideally at this

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:25.320
point

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:34.420
this run is beyond great in case that's

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:36.760
not obvious I mean if you're looking we

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:38.950
have brimstone good damage monstro as

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:40.330
long as a little silliness factor it's

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:41.770
the second runner in row which we've got

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:43.300
booked a Belial actually which it

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:46.960
doesn't happen all that often used to be

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:49.000
and think back to the glory days book of

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.630
Belial used to guarantee you a deal with

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.450
the devil

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:54.340
I now progressed so far past that point

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:56.260
that I had forgotten to even talk about

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.520
it but yet there is like a people

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:59.800
kicking up a fuss there like book of

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.510
Belial now just gives you like a 25%

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.940
extra devil deal chance it's so much

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:06.880
worse now and it is is still pretty good

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:09.630
but it used to be like a bookable i'll

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:13.330
showed up it's like a viable alternative

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:14.710
choice it because previously you're like

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:16.210
oh i got something that gives me spirit

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:19.000
hearts once every six rooms I'm just

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:21.640
going to take that always but yeah I

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.020
Alice lead like I don't like that nerf

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:28.300
that much because to this day is still

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:31.540
like it's not horrendous but it is made

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:35.200
a book of Belial just like a slightly

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:37.000
upper middle tier space bar item instead

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:39.430
of what it used to be which was like a

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.020
transformative item and I like that

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:43.810
because of the transformative item on

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:45.790
the offensive side which there wasn't a

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:51.220
whole heck of a lot of in this in the

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:52.830
space bar space before I mean to be

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:55.300
honest with you

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:56.980
experimental treatment gave us HP so I'm

00:29:55.300 --> 00:30:00.550
going to pop this and look for a red

00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:01.960
heart first off we can get some HP back

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:07.570
but I want to get back to permanent

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:08.890
polar invincibility if possible it's not

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:10.710
like this is precluding us from making

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:16.360
the hush fight which is completely

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:18.400
sensible still this is a little like

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:21.880
inside baseball we don't have to do this

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:23.050
but health up unfortunately does not

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:25.870
give us a red heart

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:27.760
so doesn't help us right now although if

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:30.130
we got two red hearts that dropped we

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:31.690
could then maybe take both of these or

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:34.120
these boats or Whedon's not like we want

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:37.300
Plan C anyway which people have been

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:39.060
telling me Loki by underrate Plan C a

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:43.380
little bit

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:46.140
I can respect that apparently Plan C

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:48.030
plus nine lives basically allows you to

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:51.120
just systematically destroy every boss

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:53.010
on planet earth but at the same time why

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.870
would you ever most of the time language

00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:59.160
you want to give up eight lives to kill

00:30:54.870 --> 00:31:02.190
eight bosses bosses are sometimes like

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:03.840
the easiest part but I think that's I

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:07.320
have like a personal chip on my shoulder

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:09.240
about Plan C perhaps come on dude just a

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:10.380
read I got 2.65 luck you're giving me

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:13.710
consumables but you're not giving me the

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:17.700
consumables I want you're losing me my

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:20.730
jury okay grab this grab ten boom boom

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:22.230
boom booter do again we could have made

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:25.670
a show out of taking both but who cares

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:28.140
and I don't really want to fight hush

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:29.130
but I will because lusty blood is

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:31.920
actually going to allow us to get to

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:36.240
like infinity damage and by infinity I

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:38.820
mean probably like 18 eventually so

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:44.990
hopefully we get some decent stuff here

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:47.070
I don't like kidney stone anymore

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:48.830
anarchists cookbook is bad but yeah I

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:50.730
was thinking as May daily a bookworm

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:53.670
probably doesn't give us double the

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:55.500
number of shots but I'm assuming it

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:58.290
might give us one extra shot from time

00:31:55.500 --> 00:32:03.390
to time I think I'd rather have the

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:06.000
occasional spiders at this point sack of

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:08.310
sacks is good I hit the sack been too

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.340
long I'm glad to be back I was let loose

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:15.540
from the noose that kept me a hanging

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:17.280
around try the ac/dc lyrics are probably

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:19.920
the band whose lyrics sound the most

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:23.520
ridiculous if you say them in like a

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:25.770
lounge voice yeah back in the back of a

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:27.990
Cadillac number one with the bullet I'm

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:31.170
a magic Mack I don't think he says magic

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:34.710
Mack but you know your magic back let's

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:36.780
go from the news that kept me hanging

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:40.500
around something like that's not that

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:42.990
bad you go amid the lovely the sky just

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:46.230
getting me high forget the house cuz

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:49.980
I'll never die that mean obviously like

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:51.690
he sings about 15 octaves above me can

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:54.480
we tell the pills

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:55.530
I mean should seen that coming I was

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.060
going to say could we tell the pills

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:58.590
into a narrow room that makes them so we

00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:00.240
don't to do this fight but dude swallow

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:01.620
penny is a more fun item regardless

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:10.350
which is actually crooked penny which is

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:12.590
actually dad's omegap any bad mama Willa

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:14.670
[Music]

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:26.610
forgot it in sack of sacks which

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:28.140
everyone hated second sex oh please get

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:32.010
to the phase in which you summon enemies

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:35.340
so I can build up at least a book of

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:45.420
belial level of damage from smacking

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:48.410
yeah y'all so nice we got to make a

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:51.810
decision what do you think should we

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:54.420
should be aim at him should be aim in

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:56.280
the opposite direction like aiming at

00:33:54.420 --> 00:34:00.150
him is guaranteed to hit with at least

00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:01.380
one of the the brimstone lasers but

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:03.660
sometimes if we aim in the other

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:05.400
direction seems like we would we would

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:06.990
get more value out of it I don't know

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:10.610
that I think we should just aim at him

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:10.610
and stop overthinking the situation

00:34:14.399 --> 00:34:24.740
but the closer we can stand without

00:34:19.039 --> 00:34:29.480
actually touching him the more beams

00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:29.480
have a chance to land their shots

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:37.789
because they come out it like

00:34:34.819 --> 00:34:40.470
essentially whether or not the beam hits

00:34:37.789 --> 00:34:44.129
hush is a product of the angle at which

00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:46.200
the beam leaves our body and the the

00:34:44.129 --> 00:34:48.210
tolerance factor becomes way higher the

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:49.500
closer you get you know there's like a

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:51.089
hundred and eighty degrees that will

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.990
actually hit him and hit him instead of

00:34:51.089 --> 00:34:53.579
like where we're standing right now

00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:57.299
where there's like 30 degrees that'll

00:34:53.579 --> 00:34:58.380
actually hit him we've taken more hits

00:34:57.299 --> 00:35:00.859
than I would have expected here but I

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:02.940
think we came down with 12 HP so

00:35:00.859 --> 00:35:09.170
shouldn't sweat it too much yet

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:09.170
I hope we're safe here

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:17.270
seems optimistic I think that was my own

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:19.520
like three dollar bill or I think we

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:20.140
have fruitcake but their own fruitcakes

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:24.529
here

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:27.670
it's getting a little dangerous but GIMP

00:35:24.529 --> 00:35:27.670
is helping out no doubt

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:37.070
usually means he's going away for a

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:46.550
minute unfortunately just awesome just

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:52.130
awesome dude not one of my strongest

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:53.180
hush fights ever bud we're live and

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:55.390
we're going to come through with like

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:58.850
what seems to be yet another like

00:35:55.390 --> 00:36:01.040
completely decent win here to be honest

00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:07.670
we weren't even that low I would like to

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:11.140
pick up worthwhile card like I'd like to

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:15.140
if I'm being honest go back to the

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:18.400
previous card which was fortune teller

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:18.400
or wheel of fortune sorry

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:40.470
for now that's not happening and that's

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:42.450
okay sorry my voice got absolutely

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:44.430
shredded by the ac/dc impression I'm

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:47.340
like I need to go see a doctor that's a

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:49.260
bit of hyperbole but you know I record a

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:51.900
lot of episodes on a daily basis too

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:54.450
many to be honest with you it's it's

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:57.180
selfish I record them because it's work

00:36:54.450 --> 00:37:00.720
and it's fun so I can justify it but I

00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:02.880
do sometimes worry like wonder if I'm

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:05.700
doing like long-term damage to my voice

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:07.650
there are I mean there are probably

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:08.970
careers that are more vocally stressful

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:11.190
but for the most part I'm just having a

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:12.720
conversation here but you know take it

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:15.810
from someone that that taught for a

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:19.230
while teaching was not nearly as

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:21.180
stressful on the voice and you spent a

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:23.010
lot of time talking as a teacher but you

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:24.960
definitely rarely do you spend 50

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:26.610
minutes rambling and you know

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:29.490
occasionally shouting and screaming like

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:30.660
you know admittedly I'm just going to

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:33.930
tell you straight up in case this makes

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:35.880
you angry I am NOT ever going to ignore

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:38.510
the chest to go to the Delirium floor

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:41.580
because there's no point the void is

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:45.830
guaranteed items but it's way more of a

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:49.530
risk and it's less fun so like I will

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:51.270
just go find magazine again but it's

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:54.030
very hilarious because I said that

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:56.070
there's no way I'm gonna do mega satan

00:37:54.030 --> 00:38:01.190
again on this room but and hush for that

00:37:56.070 --> 00:38:04.440
matter but I will do the void

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:07.680
occasionally if it shows up after blue

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:09.720
baby if the run feels right but like I'm

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:12.060
insulted for the most part when it shows

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:15.000
up after the after the Cathedral I

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:18.330
really think that as time goes on the

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.380
worst part of after birth plus from the

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:23.070
perspective of somebody who makes videos

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:25.710
of this is the way that they implemented

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:28.860
the void as like a percentage based

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:31.930
chance I really don't like it because it

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:33.910
makes me the bad guy for being like hey

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:36.790
r-run stinks but they're offering us a

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:43.510
semi unusual opportunity to go to an

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:46.410
alternate floor like I I don't have a

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:49.210
better solution but I also you know

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:51.040
don't make 70% of each sale of this game

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:54.100
so I don't think that's necessarily my

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:55.390
job but I don't think it's handle to the

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.550
point where like ruins the game it's

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:59.970
just annoying when you'd like you got to

00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:02.380
be like well I would prefer to not

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:04.240
actively choose to almost have a

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:07.060
guarantee chance to lose because the

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:09.490
Delirium the void I should know at the

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:13.300
Delirium that I'm talking about the boss

00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:16.630
in this case is just like a super bullet

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:18.700
sponge that also tell if rags use so I'm

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:21.190
not particularly salty about it but I do

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:25.260
think that I I don't think it was

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:25.260
handled the proper way

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:32.970
so there's so many exits for Isaac at

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:34.140
this point but hey thanks for watching
