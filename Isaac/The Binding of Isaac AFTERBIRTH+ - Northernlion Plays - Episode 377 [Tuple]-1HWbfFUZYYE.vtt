00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.650
hey everybody welcome back sir on the

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:09.179
line please the binding of issac ax let

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.620
us go um you know what give me a lot run

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.400
how many means can you pack into the

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.330
start of this video mostly my laser n

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.869
k99

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.109
that's him right there Wayne Gretzky

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:27.269
named kritski the great one number 99 be

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.650
ah be one aah with a little Club you see

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.510
a little bit of Monica in my life a

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.510
little bit of sandra by my side

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.559
sorry Tyrone

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.780
I don't play your game okay you might

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.629
also be asking the question why in the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.789
world does gamma go from 120 to 150

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.280
instead of a reasonable like zero to 100

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.949
I can only assume that because the game

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.680
is made by people in America they assume

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.890
they have to create a system even more

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.359
ridiculously arbitrary than Fahrenheit

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.619
in order represented of course gamma

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.510
goes to 120 to 150 it's just logical how

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.460
else would you know obviously 120 gamma

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.340
is too low and 149 is getting the high

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.369
hat I don't know where I'm going with

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.430
this I'm not going to rehash the Celsius

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:21.140
versus Fahrenheit vs. Kelvin argument

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:24.060
because there is I mean Celsius is also

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.670
arbitrary it's just less arbitrary and

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:32.280
more logically argue arbitrary if that

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:34.049
makes sense I do I appreciate I guess I

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.840
am going to rehash this argument often

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.390
actually makes a good point sometimes we

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.079
argue about this which is that in

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.909
Celsius the difference between a whole

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.420
number to another whole number is

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.090
greater

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.860
whereas in Fahrenheit there's almost

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.420
like a built-in decimal point as

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.149
ridiculous as that might sound you know

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.750
what I mean like in Fahrenheit it can be

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.420
101 degrees to 105 degrees you know in

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.939
Celsius that would all be contained

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.869
within like 27 or something like that so

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.390
it does have a little bit more

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.979
delineation but then I start to you know

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.810
be angry at society more because I

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.849
really think temperatures first off

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.430
probably a couple of degrees difference

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.379
doesn't matter

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.609
on the Fahrenheit scale and secondly you

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.730
can always just use a self-sealing

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:21.659
Celsius decimal point but decimal points

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.760
are getting better but some extent

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:27.939
decimal points are you know scary to

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.260
this general audiences out there instead

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.260
of using decimal points we could just

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:36.609
write it in scientific notation

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:40.150
you know it's 2.7 times 10 to the 1

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:47.950
degrees outside today not a good idea

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:50.049
don't do that yo can you just I don't

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.400
know if there's any another is amines

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.739
which they end their own life do so I'm

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.970
going to do it because I'm silly like

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.819
that but also I think it's the right

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.959
idea even if we can't get the book right

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.790
huh

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.109
rest assured I would like to get the

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.040
book but even if we can't get the book

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:08.620
in the library that is we'll just tackle

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.909
it like this and I feel relatively like

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.409
we're doing the right thing I'm not a

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:12.519
big fan of Book of Shadows necessarily

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.659
but at the time that it showed up we

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.739
didn't have any real rules that we could

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:19.510
draw from so it is what it is basically

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.169
this floor is all about picking up some

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.280
keys

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:28.329
we have 4.20 damage no jokes please

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:31.040
that's the devil's number and we're

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:33.620
desperately searching

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.569
well for a lot of things basically for

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.069
every stat it's not to suggest that

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.519
we're in a bad spot right now just a

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:43.310
spot that could certainly be better

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.870
we've got we've got decent stats and

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.700
everything except for our HP which is

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.890
admittedly kind of bad but also

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.519
self-inflicted in effect that was a bit

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.500
of a whip there I placed a bomb III hit

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.360
left control with my pinky finger by

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.980
accident I have no control over that

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.780
figure that finger just does whatever it

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.790
wants to do that was risky might want to

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.440
slow your roll a little bit on the

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.180
orbital damage here he says while doing

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.440
exclusively orbital damage the orbital

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.349
just screwed me lately

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.030
or the orbitals have provided a means

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.950
with which I can screw myself which is

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.169
almost worse because it's self-inflicted

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.970
like we've been taking so much damage

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.729
from predominantly using our orbitals to

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.100
attack enemies we got a smart enough

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:32.900
mind you it worked out really well right

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:35.419
there we're just going to be cautious is

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.760
not the right word but we're going to be

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.710
not that aggressive about our orbital

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.260
use here and it worked out fairly nicely

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:47.510
actually the good damage booster coming

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:49.789
after it and then a Krampus fight say

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.860
what you will we've drawn some short

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:54.470
straws at the start of this run now

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.830
we've got an angel room precedent it

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.660
could be good we're low on HP of my own

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.419
creation admittedly because of the

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.160
Lazarus respawn which was in hindsight a

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.320
little dicey but I like getting those

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.560
stat bonuses it's like being even not

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.360
getting horrible on you know you can get

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.699
Whore of Babylon it's sitting right

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.220
there behind the glass of your memory

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.630
new camera now we got to be careful here

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.310
because any of these champions will kill

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.800
us in one hit and any enemy that is

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.550
close in to a bomb is they have the

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.380
potential to kill us in one hit as well

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.210
bombs would be really nice instead we

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.240
get spoon vendor which is also quite

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.240
good

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.330
we gotta at least try here we've been

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:42.280
very light on consumables unfortunately

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:44.290
the the last play by the way losing that

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.120
bomb was huge like accidentally pressing

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.780
that left ctrl key which nobody even

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:52.570
remembers is actually an alternate bomb

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.910
placement key has screwed us out of

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.910
getting tinted rocks that would make our

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:01.720
life much more acceptable right now much

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:03.310
more survivable but it is what it is

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.080
we'll head down on the next floor

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.120
largely feeling like we've gotten a

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.680
pretty good draw in terms of items that

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.760
improve ourselves offensively but

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:17.020
defensively is a different story all

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:19.480
together but I have faced a couple of HP

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.270
upgrades and works you know in the money

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:25.440
come on my Hani what's your favorite

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:28.450
song from the 1910s that one's up there

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:31.330
there's also a yanking too little came

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:34.480
to town doo da doo da everybody that's

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:36.730
that's a different song Yankee Doodle

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.910
came to town and riding on it

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:42.880
donkey sucka feather in his heaven

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:47.080
childish mad to smack a wrong key I got

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:49.960
a word pitch mixed up somewhere that was

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:53.760
honestly BAE born in the wrong

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:56.110
generation extra bombs

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.790
you never see that awesome well I

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.380
shouldn't say that because I've never

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.570
looked it up but I wonder if you ever

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.970
see that like if you google or if you

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.080
youtube any piece of music from like the

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.520
last 50 years

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.470
inevitably there's people in the

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.810
comments that go oh I wish they made

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.190
music like this but now my friends these

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.490
days are just listening to Justin Bieber

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:17.530
I'm so much more enlightened than them

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.870
does that exist for camptown races like

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:22.930
a huge YouTube camptown races sing that

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:26.260
song dooda dooda camptown races 5 miles

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:28.960
long all the live long day people like I

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.700
wish I was born in that era music has

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:34.030
never been the same sense now it's all

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.740
about high-definition recordings back

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.470
then it was just about the joy of going

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.619
to the capital races

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.619
[Music]

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:45.040
honestly brings a tear to my eye every

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:48.280
time I hear camptown races dude this is

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:58.300
big blood bag and goat head in quick

00:07:48.280 --> 00:08:00.520
succession here so forgotten era dude to

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.320
some extent like you know I guarantee

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.200
even go back and you know if you watch

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.640
classical music on YouTube or you know

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.170
listen to classical music on YouTube

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.490
read the comments there's going to be

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:11.290
people who are like I wish classical

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.440
music is still popular I understand that

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:16.090
you know classical music is very much

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.070
it's lost a lot of its popularity since

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.810
you know the 14th century at least

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:24.610
different that's my perspective on it at

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:26.410
least it's not really my bag kate loves

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.640
though but i guarantee those people in

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:30.910
those comments that are like I wish I

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.560
was an aristocrat in Bavaria in the 19th

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:37.570
century I could have been the haydn's

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:39.520
patron actually hiding of spending most

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:40.870
of his working life in Ireland weirdly

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:47.350
enough working on the Messiah of course

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:50.590
anyway HP buy a magic mush and a

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:53.770
contract from below we're in a great

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:56.320
spot now uh but if you go back to you

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:59.020
know your ears hang low do they wobble

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:02.670
to and fro can you time in it I can't

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:02.670
hit that now Jesus of Mariah Carey

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.860
okay knew those wrote the movie is

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:11.170
really a good addition

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:16.720
I don't know why I found that so

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:18.340
enjoyable I wonder where that stops I

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.020
wonder what area you can go back to and

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:22.180
they no longer have comments saying I

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.410
was born in the wrong generation I know

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:25.840
one thing for certain and that's that

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:28.690
it's not going to stop anytime soon cuz

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:30.850
again you got people posting comments on

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:33.940
simple plan music videos going I wish I

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:36.520
was born in the year 1989 so I could

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.260
have experienced this nice tune simple

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.750
plan really I mean I'm not sure again

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.700
I'm not trying to insult the simple plan

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:44.890
I never used simple plan as a punching

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:47.140
bag until I saw that comment and I went

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:49.360
to myself sample plan really is a band

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.339
that inspires this much passion in this

00:09:49.360 --> 00:10:00.300
young individual

00:09:50.339 --> 00:10:02.370
your stack otherwise you're entitled to

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.709
like what you like where it steps into

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:06.899
you know really territories when you go

00:10:04.709 --> 00:10:09.029
I wish I was born in a different era

00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:10.980
area right now I had to write the first

00:10:09.029 --> 00:10:12.209
time I was I wish I was born in a

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.249
different era so I could have

00:10:12.209 --> 00:10:18.660
experienced simple plan live when they

00:10:14.249 --> 00:10:23.670
were famous look that's too far there's

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:25.379
like eight bands like in human history

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:29.569
or artists that I'll give you that for

00:10:25.379 --> 00:10:32.550
you know the Beatles Beethoven

00:10:29.569 --> 00:10:34.019
sharing Louis and Bram Rafi you know

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:36.689
we're lucky to live in the same era as

00:10:34.019 --> 00:10:38.999
many of them oh I wish I could give up

00:10:36.689 --> 00:10:41.220
my smart phone to see simple plan's

00:10:38.999 --> 00:10:44.850
saying I'm just a kid in life as a

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:53.100
nightmare live to see Hoobastank perform

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:54.360
the reason at Edgefest Oh for you know

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:57.059
what you'd be singing after you actually

00:10:54.360 --> 00:11:00.720
got back in time to see that I made my

00:10:57.059 --> 00:11:04.259
mistakes and that goes on and then fade

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:07.550
nothing get the idea yeah you know what

00:11:04.259 --> 00:11:07.550
we haven't had dr. fetus yet

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:12.410
why not our shot speed is too high

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.150
that's why not

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:17.060
we do have homing bombs as well because

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:19.400
of the synergistic effects here so the

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:21.230
homing bombs will slightly make up for

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.750
the fact that we're shooting too darn

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:27.070
fast right now and our shots are going

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:27.070
to be tough to hit enemies with

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:34.850
sometimes sometimes they seem to be

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:39.400
working out okay guys creating too many

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:39.400
flies all you wouldn't they already did

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:50.600
sweeps um we still can't blow up angel

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.460
statues huh so forth at all what's up

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:59.900
that all right we should have an easy

00:11:52.460 --> 00:12:02.300
easy easy win right now good damage our

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:04.580
bombs are too fast but at least they

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:06.380
also home which mitigates the fact that

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:10.570
otherwise they're not going to like ever

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:10.570
hit if we had to fire them naturally

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:17.590
polydactyly basically does not matter so

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:22.750
we should on this run it's probably a

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:24.930
better than average eyes or Lazarus run

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:27.850
so we should probably try to like

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:29.650
absolutely maximize everything that we

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:33.330
can do on this run if we could do boss

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:36.630
rush hush could we just call it boss

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:39.400
hush rush you know combine them into one

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:41.020
if we can do hush rush on this run dude

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.370
that's never going to catch on stop

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:44.590
trying to make hush rush Avenue I'm

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:48.160
never going to happen I wish I was born

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:50.140
in 1991 so I could have experienced Mean

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.580
Girls at the time of it I mean it was

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:53.740
I'll be honest with you as someone who

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:56.020
was 16 when Mean Girls came out and was

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:57.880
a snob we have goat heads so I could

00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:00.280
cares here I expected Mean Girls to be

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:02.980
really bad and when it came out and it

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:05.830
was surprisingly clever and acerbic and

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:07.960
you know relatable I was pleasantly

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:11.710
surprised we actually watched Mean Girls

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:15.310
in my psychology class and it wasn't

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:16.840
like that much of us we're gonna go back

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:20.560
for it but I should have not walked out

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:22.560
it was not a stretch like in ninth grade

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:25.240
geography we watched Dumb and Dumber

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:28.180
volcano no wait

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:33.160
we watched Dumb and Dumber Dante's Peak

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:36.310
and Pearl Harbor that was the stretch to

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:39.400
watch Mean Girls in psychology class was

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:43.110
just you know sort of fun we also

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:45.580
watched the matrix in philosophy class

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:47.470
along with I Heart Huckabees

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:49.390
and I got to say I actually like I Heart

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:52.630
Huckabees is a movie again I was loose

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:54.610
knob when I was 16 and I think I love

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:56.740
Jason Schwartzman he seems like such an

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:59.260
affable young fellow if I ever saw a

00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:00.730
video of Jason Schwartzman being a jerk

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.380
I don't know if I could handle it it

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:05.890
would shatter my world view of him being

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:09.330
like the most congenial you know actor

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.330
in Hollywood anyway the point is

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:14.230
do you ever want to experience hell

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:16.870
watch I Heart Huckabees with a class

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:18.580
full of fifteen-year-old alright

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:22.360
pantygram it's good stuff

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:24.459
Browns they're good dogs drunk grab

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:28.990
little brimstone and pentagram work love

00:14:24.459 --> 00:14:31.209
in life we got a lust for life like Iggy

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:35.560
Pop and/or the BAM jet who ripped off

00:14:31.209 --> 00:14:39.550
Iggy Pop's lust for life for their song

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:40.839
are you going to be my girl how long am

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:42.790
I going to hold a grudge for I don't

00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:45.490
know you know again the whole snobby

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:47.019
thing okay well we'll take book of sin I

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.940
think it's a better item to begin with

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:50.680
and then we'll throw in some rerolls

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:54.390
here which we definitely do not have to

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.390
use our bombs for but did nonetheless

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:59.980
we're way ahead I was actually so far

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:04.360
ahead of schedule I tricked myself into

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:06.250
thinking I was behind schedule how does

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.990
that work out for you

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:09.730
did we come down here with five cents I

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:11.019
don't believe so an arcade to be nice I

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:13.270
would throw a spear at how to add an

00:15:11.019 --> 00:15:15.070
arcade to get more money to donate more

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:17.829
because we're in a good-enough petition

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:19.300
right now that that would be completely

00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:22.540
fine I shouldn't have taken little

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:26.100
brimstone I'm a sucker for any media

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:26.100
property that has a little limits name

00:15:27.899 --> 00:15:33.570
I'm trying to think of any example

00:15:30.579 --> 00:15:36.610
literally to fill my point right now

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:37.660
what I was going to do is say at the end

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.640
of it the way I was going to tie it

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:42.970
together is suggest like first I'd

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:45.010
suggest a movie called like you know you

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:47.470
know little something and then I'd be

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:50.890
like yeah LittleBigPlanet Oh big fan you

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:55.240
know a little people big world best TV

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:57.520
show ever made boss baby no boss baby is

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:59.199
different baby does not always mean

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.630
little have you not seen a Honey I

00:15:59.199 --> 00:16:05.050
Shrunk the Kids there's big babies in

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:08.560
that movie alright pull your head out of

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:11.230
your Rick Moranis before you step to me

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:13.140
with a comment like that boss baby yeah

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:17.010
okay

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:19.860
if Spaceballs - maybe Schwartz be with

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:27.360
you this was okay let's go

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:30.120
that was a creepy laugh we already found

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.709
our second secret room you silly we

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.089
might actually have been better off

00:16:31.709 --> 00:16:34.709
going to our shop on this floor but I

00:16:33.089 --> 00:16:36.180
don't know we'll save our chance up to

00:16:34.709 --> 00:16:40.440
possibly get an arcade in the future

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:42.149
here we go problem solved I'm going to

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:44.339
give up a few spirit arts here I think

00:16:42.149 --> 00:16:47.820
we're fine we got gimpy you know Gibby

00:16:44.339 --> 00:16:49.680
could give us hearts now or give us

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.850
hearts later we got blood bag out of it

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.170
which i think is worth it we don't need

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:53.970
the speed but you know there's a little

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.589
extra speed to go along with it and we

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:58.829
don't have our Polaroid yet so it really

00:16:55.589 --> 00:16:59.970
does not matter if we if we don't have

00:16:58.829 --> 00:17:01.709
permanent Polaroid invincibility

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:05.780
conditions Matt we've had to unlearn a

00:17:01.709 --> 00:17:09.929
little bit of our previous Isaak acumen

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:11.610
is there as it's an honest question oh I

00:17:09.929 --> 00:17:14.689
have toilet paper right so the orbital

00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:16.860
does not orbit which is actually okay

00:17:14.689 --> 00:17:18.689
basically means we have a really small

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:20.579
guardian spirit which i think is an

00:17:18.689 --> 00:17:25.140
interesting mechanic if not necessarily

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:29.070
good is there well I know there will be

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:32.610
for most people is there an actor or

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:33.870
actress in Hollywood for whom as soon as

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:36.179
you see that they're involved with the

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:39.120
production you just will not go see it

00:17:36.179 --> 00:17:40.860
or you would have to like move heaven

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.320
and earth to get you see it and it'd be

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:46.169
honestly man I'm going to start by

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:49.559
villainizing my own family my dad has

00:17:46.169 --> 00:17:51.330
this for Meryl Streep not for political

00:17:49.559 --> 00:17:55.049
reasons you know this is well before the

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:57.120
modern political climate like said he

00:17:55.049 --> 00:17:58.860
for whatever reason I don't think he

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:01.080
hates Meryl Streep as a person I think

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:03.720
he just hates the roles that she chooses

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.919
and she's been in such amazing movies

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.720
that he's really depriving himself

00:18:04.919 --> 00:18:08.720
that's being like you know I'm not gonna

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.919
watch any movie that Tilda Swinton's in

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.090
or kids actually you know it's a much

00:18:10.919 --> 00:18:14.100
better example it's Cate Blanchett

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:17.610
because she also has roles and movies

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:20.010
that are not necessarily you know the

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:24.559
kinds of things that a dad is going to

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:24.559
want to go see in every situation but

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:30.840
you know a little jasmine for example

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:32.610
but you know also rolls in a lot of

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.530
nothing the movies are bad just a

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:37.220
different sort of value proposition also

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:39.570
lots of really accessible movies like

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.980
you know the Lord of the Rings series

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:42.960
for example have you heard of it

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:45.140
pretty big one Jack Peterson wrote it

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:48.330
directed j.r.r tolkien was the lead

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:55.470
Hobbit is a great movie I wish they made

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:57.000
more 250 now we're going to 49 just

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:58.590
kidding we're gonna hurt ourselves a

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.460
once for no reason and then get it to 50

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:01.800
come on you got to give me something

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:05.220
next nothing from nothing leaves nothing

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:06.330
ok um still gonna no we've already been

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.679
to our item room that's right we got

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:11.460
lucky foot which is great with gimpy

00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:12.780
actually so I'm not sweating it I'm

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.190
trying to think of who it is for me I've

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.010
got one that I think is obvious if

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:20.670
you've watched a lot of my content

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:22.710
Johnny Depp and I'm not I grew up in an

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:26.400
era where for a movie to have Johnny

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:29.160
Depp in it was actually like amazing and

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:32.809
this era only ended recently but you

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:35.910
know What's Eating Gilbert Grape

00:19:32.809 --> 00:19:37.830
Edie would you know examples like this

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:39.809
with numerous back in the day so when we

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:41.400
saw I'll take it and maybe I shouldn't

00:19:39.809 --> 00:19:44.460
I'm going to take it anyway what a whiff

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:46.920
um when I saw a Pirates of the Caribbean

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:51.360
I was like Johnny Depp is crushing it in

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:53.480
this movie they're all pretty bad here

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:56.550
but we got to try um

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:58.320
and then he just kept making more parts

00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:02.280
of the Caribbean movies and he was like

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:06.590
you know he became like too too fresh

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:09.540
you know Willy Wonka's chocolate factory

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:11.670
beloved original Johnny Depp's portrayal

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.440
of Willy Wonka everyone goes a little

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:15.990
closer to the books sure but it's just

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:17.910
strange and that's that's fine you got

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:20.179
like too weird for we've got mainstream

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.179
weird

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:27.740
let's see all dude Alice in Wonderland

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:29.420
when Johnny Depp became like always a

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:32.870
strange guy in all of your movies young

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:34.940
no Benicio del Toro plays the strange

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:37.790
guy in all the movies you're just like a

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:39.260
weird uncle now I'm not trying to insult

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:40.970
him in say I know he's been going

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.020
through a rough time although not

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:43.550
doesn't necessarily have the best

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:45.320
reputation as well I've never met him

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:47.350
and I'm not going to judge him on a

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:50.090
personal level without having met him

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:51.650
for what our swipes that I've received

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:53.300
is minor towards myself at the very

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:55.250
least later I'm just protecting my own

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:57.500
but because yeah apparently you know you

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:59.330
leave sort of a jerk but you know so you

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.500
can't judge a war criminal unless you've

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:03.290
met them I'm just saying they're on

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:04.700
different Meg okay I if I met him

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:07.370
personally I would give him a chance of

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:11.690
redemption to rebuke the allegations

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:13.780
against him I suppose I need more severe

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:17.600
attacks here I'm getting a little okay

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:19.700
but you I don't think could pay me to go

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:21.980
see a Johnny Depp movie now it would

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:23.690
have to I would have to hear that it's

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:27.710
one of the best movies ever made

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:29.990
probably to be excited to go see it try

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:32.330
to think there's other examples people

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:36.260
always they go with like Tom Cruise I'm

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:39.860
like the opposite I would see a bad Tom

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:41.750
Cruise movie and still I like I haven't

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:43.130
seen The Mummy but I'm even though that

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:46.760
like at seven percent on Rotten Tomatoes

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:50.930
I think I would go see The Mummy and be

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:52.070
like ah you know it's okay

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:54.020
like I don't expect it to be a

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:56.960
masterwork I guess but and I respect

00:21:54.020 --> 00:22:01.750
that it's bad but I find Tom Cruise a

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:04.040
very likable actor we've seen those I

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:06.200
wish they'd stop changing the title have

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:08.360
you seen edge of tomorrow it's fantastic

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:10.610
he's graded he's actually not very

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:12.380
likable in that movie yeah yeah that's

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:13.280
the point of the start ability is that's

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:17.600
a great film

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:19.670
I even like Vanilla Sky largely as a

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.170
result of Tom Cruise just coming

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:24.290
unhinged despite the fact that that

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:26.570
movie is extremely pretentious you

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:28.820
should watch the Spanish original I have

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:32.180
seen a Spanish orig original abre los

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:33.530
ojos remember I was a snob okay of

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:35.960
course the speeds they've seen the

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:38.120
Spanish

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:40.860
try to think of who else

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:43.309
they're definitely actors for whom I'm

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:48.390
like much more likely to enjoy a movie

00:22:43.309 --> 00:22:50.010
Peter Stormare Benicio del Toro as

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:53.720
mentioned Steve Buscemi of course

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:53.720
William H Macy oh dude

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.400
I'll see anything that William H Macy

00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:02.669
same except shameless because shameless

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:04.320
is too long I don't have that kind of

00:23:02.669 --> 00:23:06.900
tie here the show is amazing I just you

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:08.130
know I got Game of Thrones and that's I

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.530
got Game of Thrones and trying to

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:12.419
memorize all the algorithms in the C++

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:14.880
11 FTL and what kind of iterator

00:23:12.419 --> 00:23:16.770
argument to take that's my life outside

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:19.110
of the goal twitch and you can spear

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:22.380
right now okay I don't have room for

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:24.120
shameless until they get dragons now

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:26.760
I'll consider it I think it's pop air

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:29.880
third you know it's it's finished at the

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.780
theatrical run you know it okay ah dude

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.309
let me out of here

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:35.299
thanks for the spirit heart I knew you

00:23:32.309 --> 00:23:35.299
were going to pay out there eventually

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:41.480
I'm trying to think on the accuracy side

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:51.030
okay I was gonna say Cameron Diaz but

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:53.760
she does have the mask and she does have

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:56.550
this Something About Mary but to see a

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:58.020
Cameron Diaz movie in 2016 I'd have to

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:59.880
think about that long and hard I think

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:03.660
of the film don't be gross

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:06.720
I think a common answer is gonna be like

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:10.140
Will Ferrell Ben Stiller Dan gays Lee

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:14.100
hates Ben Stiller I have no ideas what

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:17.670
Ben Stiller has done to deserve that

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:19.200
level of hate he said this on camera I'm

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:21.330
not I'm not blowing up his spot or

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:24.750
anything he said what his be say about

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:26.630
Ben Stiller he's like so we heard

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:30.530
referred to in the business that was

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:33.300
like a POS or something like that means

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:42.120
wait wait wait I got the sound board you

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:43.890
know a piece of he's done it for Aaron

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:47.480
sob it's one of the two I can't recall

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:47.480
pretty much means the same thing

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:55.480
oh dude Tyler Perry yeah well like if

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:57.640
Tyler Perry writes and directs a movie

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:59.740
let's be honest it's not meant for me I

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:02.290
see the buyers in there now this is a

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:06.940
really solid run because the homing

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:08.800
tiers are even I mean first up the

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:11.110
homing peers are great with tech X but

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:13.360
then they're also like the bomb targets

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:15.460
something and then if the homing peers

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:17.170
on the laser kill it the bomb can

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:20.410
reposition itself to hit another target

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:23.620
which is awesome anyway Tyler Perry all

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:25.510
admit was awesome in gone girl he played

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:29.500
a great role in gone girl another great

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:31.420
movement yeah dude hook me up where you

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:33.610
were so stacked on this run this is like

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:36.250
a an actual 10 out of 10 run especially

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:38.320
getting tech ex out of our out of our

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:44.140
boss rush things did look scary for a

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:46.600
little bit there in the middle I think

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:49.000
that's it for me I don't hold drugs in

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:50.530
it and it's not like I've ever met these

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.580
people I was going to say I don't hold

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:58.180
grudges against them i Adam Sandler is

00:25:54.580 --> 00:26:00.490
another one and I got to say I'm not

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:02.020
trying to stir the pot and I don't think

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:05.710
this is even particularly controversial

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:07.900
I've seen Ted twice I haven't seen Ted -

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:09.340
I watched Ted on an airplane and I was

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.990
like I don't like this at all and then

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:12.790
the other day why is probably three

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:14.560
months ago it was on TV when I was

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:16.630
working in the background that kind of

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:18.760
caught little bits and pieces of it and

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:24.250
I was like I still don't like this old

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:26.140
me was right and then I saw like the

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:29.830
opening 40 minutes of 6 million ways to

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:32.170
die in the West Charlize Theron what are

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:35.530
you doing in that movie you have an

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:37.090
Oscar and not even like a Halle Berry

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:38.980
Oscar where you just kind of like

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:40.930
disappeared after that you did Catwoman

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:47.470
you know etc etc you've been in like

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:49.120
great works recently young adults I mean

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:52.390
say what you will about it but for me

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:54.990
thisis a high prestige film at least at

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:54.990
the time of its release

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:59.490
The Fast and Furious movie I mean I get

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:03.540
it

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:07.950
that's money why a car you in of all

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:11.010
things Seth MacFarlane's six million

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:13.860
ways to die in the West like that's you

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:15.810
must be a nice guy or like a good dude

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:17.250
because you got a lot of people to be in

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:20.070
that movie that have no bit lacking in

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:22.980
that movie Liam Neeson is in that movie

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:24.630
I understand Liam Neeson doesn't have

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:26.070
the best track record with films

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:28.020
recently and you're going to say like

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:31.590
yeah since taken and I'm like nah

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:40.290
including taken but still he's a

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:42.210
cultural icon and - Liam Neeson just be

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:47.360
like playing a role in that movie makes

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:49.740
no sense either way so I think yeah like

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:51.390
Seth MacFarlane if I'm ever going to go

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:52.770
see another Seth MacFarlane movie he's

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:56.340
got to have like his Punch Drunk Love

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:58.380
moment and then sustain it unlike some

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:59.040
people like the you know lead actor and

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:04.800
punch-drunk love

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:09.810
I don't blame Adam Sandler though you

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:12.630
know I I think it is it's as a consumer

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:14.940
I like to consume media that makes me

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:16.560
feel good and Adam Sandler's movies

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:18.090
mostly just make me roll my eyes but

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:21.750
he's got a lot of fans that are really

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:23.070
into him and they it's been made like we

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.680
don't you don't quite have the Guffey's

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:26.760
dream do we I think we should just go

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:30.600
you know what we should actually kill

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:32.220
void on this one because we can a lot of

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.990
it's been a lot of discover what has

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.370
been mated like you know oh these movies

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:38.670
always turned a profit so he just goes

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:40.950
and you know F's off to Hawaii for a

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:42.930
month and then makes a movie with like

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:45.060
someone that's way out of his league at

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:47.400
least in conceptually and then you know

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:49.410
they come back and he pays his friends

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:51.480
far too much and the movie makes money

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:53.190
and everybody's happy you know except

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.820
for the reviewers who are you know they

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:57.880
just go is movies that me

00:28:54.820 --> 00:29:01.120
you but as much as that seems like like

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:06.039
he's given up on his art dude that's

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:08.950
like an absolute actual dream job if I

00:29:06.039 --> 00:29:10.809
was a an actor or a filmmaker on that

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:12.730
level I don't know if I would do

00:29:10.809 --> 00:29:14.200
anything different he's like you know

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:16.870
you're telling me I can get paid like 20

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:19.659
million dollars to make its like YouTube

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:22.169
you know I can get paid 20 million

00:29:19.659 --> 00:29:24.340
dollars and pay my friends like you know

00:29:22.169 --> 00:29:26.080
seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:29.019
each to be in the movie that we

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:30.580
ourselves wrote and then you're going to

00:29:29.019 --> 00:29:32.529
keep giving me money because people like

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:36.610
to watch it it's like a dream come true

00:29:32.529 --> 00:29:38.289
I have no ink his position as kind of

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:40.870
like a critical punching bag is very

00:29:38.289 --> 00:29:44.230
well-deserved however you can't deny

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:46.419
that it seems like you've got his head

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:50.039
screwed on straight from like a you know

00:29:46.419 --> 00:29:50.039
getting the job done standpoint

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:58.780
I don't really want that right also I'm

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:01.960
not I do want that because I'm not

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:03.700
leaving the floor I'm not coming too bad

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:05.260
for Adam Sandler necessarily as an

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:08.620
artist I'm coming too bad for Adam

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:10.180
Sandler as as someone who sort of works

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:12.520
in the entertainment industry he's found

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:15.010
a niche and Eve's he's got an audience

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:17.350
that likes it and he gets he's taking

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:20.140
people with him on the way up if I could

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:21.220
never see Rob Schneider or David Spade's

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.440
face again

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:24.940
and has pretty much had the rules of

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.440
which I've been live in my life I'd be

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:30.550
happier but I'm not going to begrudge

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:32.140
him you know I'm I'm happy that he's

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:35.200
found something that he can pursue that

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:36.850
works out well for him sort of I mean

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.890
I'm not happy I'm liking different but

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:44.170
I'm not against it it's what I'm trying

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:45.820
to say you know another actor I will

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:48.910
watch almost anything that they've ever

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:53.110
been in or that they are in Willem Dafoe

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:56.020
ten out of ten I don't like the Boondock

00:30:53.110 --> 00:31:02.470
Saints very much all admit however I do

00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:06.360
like Willem Dafoe a lot he's especially

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:09.880
in Norman Osborn when Ann Mei goes

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:11.590
Norman Osborn she might say Harry Osborn

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:14.230
I can't remember it's when Harry's being

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:18.760
casually sexist it's been a while since

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:21.400
I've seen spider-man one maybe you

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:23.140
should redeem that and become vindicated

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:27.430
that's a reference to spider-man two

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:34.870
actually NL hmm sorry that movie really

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:38.640
duck your uh to poop not a good joke oh

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:38.640
we could add the gobby dream

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:43.160
if they can't trying to get in our

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:48.110
pillow tomo what's the problem buddy

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:53.390
come all have you come to witness my

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:55.220
attendance no mom all right now we find

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:59.180
out if this cat is here to get petted or

00:31:55.220 --> 00:32:02.390

for pets what are you gonna do here Toma

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:09.140
what's your game plan I'm going to put a

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:11.360
one and a half to one favorite odds on

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:12.140
petting but I have more information than

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.660
you do right now

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:21.560
I can also tip things in my favorite

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:23.150
home oh no meows he doesn't want the

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:25.310
Pens yeah you're just looking for a

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:30.370
quiet place to sleep everybody who had

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:37.429
sleep that pays out

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:39.590
congratulations largely not very

00:32:37.429 --> 00:32:41.120
relevant right now yeah I'm heading them

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:43.130
and he's like just leave me alone I want

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:45.919
to sleep that's no way to talk to your

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:48.769
father this should be your first

00:32:45.919 --> 00:32:54.110
delirium Killa of this safe file and I

00:32:48.769 --> 00:32:55.340
mean it was like very easy it's not done

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:57.409
yet so we shouldn't count our chickens

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:58.850
but considering the advantages that we

00:32:57.409 --> 00:33:02.000
have right now it ended up being pretty

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:06.379
easy if it finishes the way it looks

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.269
like it will finish right now mind you I

00:33:06.379 --> 00:33:10.279
would like to find the boss room sooner

00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:13.179
there rather than later and also we have

00:33:10.279 --> 00:33:16.909
not picked up anything useful in like

00:33:13.179 --> 00:33:25.309
all of these rooms and I just personally

00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:27.440
unknown is the most troll of all the of

00:33:25.309 --> 00:33:30.830
all the cursus here there's like it

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:35.809
doesn't even impact me that much it just

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:38.509
annoys me curse of the blind curse of

00:33:35.809 --> 00:33:40.700
the unknown at least well thank you

00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:42.379
at least there's a chance that and I

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:44.360
mean I say this is if I'm like a glutton

00:33:42.379 --> 00:33:45.769
for punishment but at least they have an

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.480
impact on the game in the sense that

00:33:45.769 --> 00:33:51.100
like they can make it a lot harder for

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:55.159
you to succeed meaningfully harder and

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:56.570
all curse of the loss does make you walk

00:33:55.159 --> 00:33:59.330
around these rooms we've already been to

00:33:56.570 --> 00:34:00.679
before I guess there are some ways that

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:03.950
can hurt you like you could end up

00:34:00.679 --> 00:34:07.179
walking on spikes or something but you

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:12.980
know we're getting in a little bit of

00:34:07.179 --> 00:34:14.629
you know come on territory I think we

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:16.040
got to do the void is every single

00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:20.089
character in the game still it's going

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:21.619
to take us like some time but you know

00:34:20.089 --> 00:34:24.619
the more the merrier looks like we got

00:34:21.619 --> 00:34:26.210
one basically done here while talking

00:34:24.619 --> 00:34:29.000
about Adam Sandler my favorite

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:33.109
discussion topic I'm sorry by the way if

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:35.510
you like Johnny Depp I know some people

00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:37.040
there's still Johnny Depp fans and

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:38.149
there's nothing wrong with that you know

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.230
don't let me discourage you from going

00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:46.070
to see the newest

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:47.840
the Caribbeans on my media religion is

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:49.429
just watch whatever you want and if

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:50.780
somebody's being a snob about it just go

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:52.879
hey you're being kind of a jerk right

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:54.859
now remind them that it's more important

00:34:52.879 --> 00:34:58.720
to be a conscientious human being than

00:34:54.859 --> 00:34:58.720
it is to like the right kind of media oh

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:07.550
we found a new area however it's not for

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:09.680
me it's like making another Kane and

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:12.590
