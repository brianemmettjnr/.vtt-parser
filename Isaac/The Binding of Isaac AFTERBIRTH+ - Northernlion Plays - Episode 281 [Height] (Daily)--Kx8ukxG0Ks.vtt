##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.290
everybody welcome back to the land place

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.270
of a new Isaac after plus yesterday's

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.189
daily we did quite well ranked one to

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.420
one one point four eight percentile with

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.700
the score forty three thousand six

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.099
hundred forty eight points today is a

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.650
blue baby run that goes to mom's heart

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:21.119
scores on the front page range from 38

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.490
to 48 thousand and we haven't played as

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.119
blue baby in gosh-darn

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.590
forever I've forgotten everything that

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.630
makes this character tick three point

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.130
six seven damage decent speed I'm

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.079
treating it almost like it's an Eden run

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.360
or something here but this would be a

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.910
slightly subpar Eden run but there are

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.820
you know good things about being blue

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.370
baby for example uh you can shoot your

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.879
poop and get on average you know maybe

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.100
one cent per floor out of that you can

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.370
also hold your poop and have it manifest

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.809
itself as a non-stop all stats upgrade

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.879
thanks to this incredible trinket who

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.680
are we fighting here these guys yeah

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.820
ceremony each other see if I care I

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.750
don't know that's how you use pheromones

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.640
as a verb

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.409
probably releases the verb that you use

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.670
for pheromones but I don't like saying

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.790
the word release on the internet people

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.700
get real weird about it oh yeah release

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.380
me daddy I don't understand how did we

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.970
get down this twisted rabbit hole every

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:24.810
day we straight further from the Lord's

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:26.549
light okay so now okay be careful we'd

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.229
have an interesting decision if they

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.180
gave us shoopdawhoop shoopdawhoop is

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.759
excellent but it would compromise to

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.290
some extent the use of illuminated bulb

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.700
right now which is really like a good

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.130
all stats upgrade one damage one tear

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.140
upgrade the equivalent of one speed

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.970
upgrade I think as well I'm not sure

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.320
about luck but I'm assuming so but we'll

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.979
probably just get a troll bomb anyway so

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.390
don't sweat it too hard what did I tell

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.340
you you know I didn't want to be right

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.840
but I had a suspicion that I could be we

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:01.020
also could still use the poop we just

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.210
have to be more considered in how we use

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.100
it so for example you know we kill these

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.039
guys this is so unlikely to make like

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.270
any difference you know crack into that

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.619
at the very end of the room then you get

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.560
your charge back and then you shoot at

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.550
this and you get nothing

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.980
okay honestly probably not really worth

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.510
worrying about what's the dangerous blue

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.480
baby well I actually don't think blue

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.780
baby is like that heinous of a character

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.290
to start as it's got a you know to put

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.980
it in y equals MX plus B terms blue baby

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.080
is a higher y-intercept than the

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.550
character like Judas you know if you get

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.910
nothing you're likely to live a little

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.099
bit longer but the slope of the run is

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.780
way worse so we need to hopefully get

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.940
things that basically damage upgrades

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:51.190
like that for example and to also speed

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:53.019
up our ability to get stronger and

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.700
obviously cat-o'-nine-tails does like a

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.160
great job there I don't know forty eight

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.940
thousand is a high score we do

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.530
technically want to look for a seam and

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.870
the easiest way to get one is probably

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.130
in a woz room but I would replace the

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.260
poop with the shovel if we got the

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.880
opportunity it's pretty much the central

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.959
reason why I am NOT going to that curse

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:17.250
room right now because I'm a little

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:20.320
worried about our HP interesting a

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.760
little bit of a bummer but a golden

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.970
chest might actually work out for us the

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.190
thing is you know an item room is

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.010
probably much better value than a golden

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.489
chest on average but you can get some

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:37.630
pretty jank item rooms if you can get

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:40.180
some pretty good golden chests so we do

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.350
have to think about it but I'm just not

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.750
going to worry about it too much take

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.400
evil eye instead which is probably like

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.519
one of the items in the game for which I

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.500
have the worst barometer for how good it

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.720
actually is but that's irrelevant at

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.510
this point I don't know maybe we should

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.859
shoot all that

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:02.230
thank you dim bulb thank you dim bulb

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:03.519
this is what also what my teacher said

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.829
to me every time I answered a question

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.930
in class and I only now realized that

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.160
it's a self-fulfilling prophecy because

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.630
there's not even dim bulb that's

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.100
illuminated bulb no my teacher teachers

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.500
I guess I didn't go to like a one-room

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.000
schoolhouse and it wasn't too much but

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.329
it was like an eight room schoolhouse

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.329
but

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.100
not a quite a one-room schoolhouse but I

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.500
never got in trouble or yelled at for

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.970
being too stupid it was more like not

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.720
being able to keep my mouth shut like

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.849
once this is such an NL story because

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.870
I'm like I'm not even a geography nerd I

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:42.910
just like knowing what a map looks like

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.710
which I think is like what a three year

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.030
old thinks geography is and still to

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.370
this day that's basically my

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.050
understanding of the science but you're

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.840
playing this game in like second or

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.970
third grade and it was an alphabet game

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.080
there is a board game that based on I

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.250
don't remember which one it's like

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.530
Scattergories or something like that

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.300
that teacher was like you know you'll

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.650
name a country that starts with F and

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.940
then put it by hannah to go at France

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.880
we're going angel rooms things are not

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.259
good enough name a country that starts

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.460
with J and then I'm like waiting for

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:11.620
everybody in the class blows their hand

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.259
nobody does it on my own Japan and then

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.810
she's like okay someone other than Ryan

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:18.159
name a country that starts with D and

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.289
everybody you know when you're eight

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:23.789
you're racking your brain countries that

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:28.150
start with D are there any oh good

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:30.729
of course we you know now know each lane

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.320
oh I'm poking fun of myself because

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:36.220
that's not the name of Germany in

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.990
English but either way we're just going

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.639
to head down here

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.060
everybody's racking their brain I can't

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:47.530
think of one oh you know the United

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:50.349
States of America no you idiot that's

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.729
not correct so I waited for like what

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:53.650
felt like a hundred years is probably

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:56.949
like fifteen seconds that just could not

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.780
stop myself I went Denmark and then my

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:00.159
teacher was like hey Ryan you don't get

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.810
to play the game anymore cuz you didn't

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:04.900
follow the rules and in hindsight she

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:11.139
was right you know the purpose of the

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:12.969
third grade is not for a child to make

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:14.880
all the other children feel bad because

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:17.320
they don't know Denmark okay I've

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.440
learned that now it was a tough pill to

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.440
swallow

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.170
that's the kind of thing where you like

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.370
you tell your parents that story and

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.890
they're like we should send Ryan to a

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:31.010
private school he's too smart he knows

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:35.330
all the country names the world is his

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:38.180
oyster surely he won't be condemned to a

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.160
life playing the same video game over

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:43.790
and over again yelled effort only being

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.800
in the top six percent of players five

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.890
years after its initial release okay

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.600
here we go curse room for free I could

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.030
have been anything in this world in the

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:56.240
third grade I had memorized countries at

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:59.120
an eighth grade level crammed us to get

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:02.600
11 cents left here the we're really like

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.340
working hard for well to get our fill

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.310
mostly I've realized that everybody

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.590
wants a thrill but we can't for the life

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:12.190
of us make more spirit hearts appear on

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:15.410
this run and we're really really trying

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.790
they just have not existed so far I've

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.650
been a little light unconsumed bulls

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.990
with a luck set of two I'm kind of

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:26.300
surprised honestly because and that is

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:28.310
well above the mean I'd suggest but in

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.690
terms of like our actual like the

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.660
potency of this run right now we're

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:36.710
doing just fine from a damage standpoint

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:38.510
I think we're doing very well we should

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:43.070
save a bomb in case we get a deal with

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:44.810
the angel it would be nice to blow up

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.310
the angel statue although to be fair we

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:47.960
would want to be able to kill the angel

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:50.960
statue without taking damage as well

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:53.900
which doesn't seem overly likely right

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.100
now odds are we probably won't get any

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.450
deal I mean it's like a one in six

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.480
chance that we get a deal with the angel

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:00.470
right now and it's roughly a one in

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.390
three chance we get to deal with the

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:05.270
devil as well but a deal with the devil

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:07.190
is possibly more palatable I don't know

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.870
it depends what the deal is I guess is

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:10.310
what it all comes down to my friends is

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.890
that everything's going to be fine fine

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:14.870
fine cuz I got one hand in my pocket and

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:19.310
the other one is picking up Judas's

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:21.050
shadow let's go pretty good well I mean

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:24.160
very good now if we get a deal with the

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:26.840
devil we could take whatever we get and

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.180
effectively we'll be paying one spirit

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.010
hard to turn our other two spirit hearts

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:34.320
into black hearts and double our damage

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:35.580
so assuming it's a deal with

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.140
that doesn't give us HP to begin with

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:40.200
but we got to get the deal first and

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:41.160
that might not even be that relevant in

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.140
the whole scheme of things but you know

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:46.800
what's nice is that we are making great

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:51.960
time even against the champion gertie an

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:53.460
enemy that's fairly tanky I'm going to

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:57.690
be out of here by like eight and a half

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:59.930
minutes probably one of the top eight

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:04.380
tracks off of the dismemberment plans

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:08.640
1999 classic emergency and die we did

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:10.140
get a deal with the angel we got no bomb

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.580
so there's nothing we can do about it so

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.200
we'll just take the soul and we'll get

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.670
the heck out of there sorry angel statue

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.010
I don't know I can't think of the last

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:18.420
time I use the bomb but thank you for

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.800
giving us the soul nonetheless maybe

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:23.880
this is the best of all worlds we get

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:27.390
the soul I just realized by the way kind

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:31.350
of a moron probably should have know I

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:34.170
was like we could have died on the on

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:35.880
the blue fires and then become dark

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.260
Judas and then taken the soul to get to

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.940
spirit arts and our damage would be

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.650
doubled but there's no guarantee because

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.750
if we died in the angel room we would

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:44.310
have respawned in the boss room the

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.900
angel room might not have remained open

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:48.570
so we might not have gotten anything out

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.860
of that by the way if you're wondering

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.960
why I'm not using the poop it's

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:55.290
basically just like I don't think it's

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:57.480
worth the ask most of the time for our

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.920
you know unique situation here to put it

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.070
politely so I'm going to go to the shop

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:03.240
my hope is that there would be a bomb

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:05.490
neither of these are that good so I

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.810
think we'll pick up this and my hope is

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.730
that we can make an ace of diamonds work

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.930
but I was very eager to spend five cents

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:12.890
on a bomb that would give us unlimited

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:16.490
bombs but hopefully we'll just find a

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:16.490
bomb elsewhere

00:10:19.449 --> 00:10:27.979
so we really like can make up for the

00:10:25.669 --> 00:10:32.329
purchase of this card which is not very

00:10:27.979 --> 00:10:34.129
good by turning red hearts into coin

00:10:32.329 --> 00:10:36.889
because we need every other kind of

00:10:34.129 --> 00:10:39.619
consumable but if we somehow get like 15

00:10:36.889 --> 00:10:40.970
red hearts to drop you know that's what

00:10:39.619 --> 00:10:43.429
we're going to change things up for sure

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:45.949
for certain I would very much like to

00:10:43.429 --> 00:10:48.439
open that golden chest or those golden

00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:50.569
chests but there's no means for which

00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:52.249
you can make that happen so far at least

00:10:50.569 --> 00:10:54.049
we can get to our item room we haven't

00:10:52.249 --> 00:10:55.729
been like wealthy on this run with

00:10:54.049 --> 00:10:57.350
respect to you know are consumables

00:10:55.729 --> 00:10:58.970
including money of course money has

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:02.299
actually been like the best of all

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:07.160
consumables for us so far but we haven't

00:11:02.299 --> 00:11:09.619
been impoverished either like we have

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:12.199
basically just enough to cover what we

00:11:09.619 --> 00:11:14.239
need and none left over for the next

00:11:12.199 --> 00:11:15.979
floor it could be worse honestly like we

00:11:14.239 --> 00:11:17.509
could not be able to open item rooms

00:11:15.979 --> 00:11:18.709
that happens from time to time and

00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:20.509
there's really nothing you can do about

00:11:18.709 --> 00:11:24.079
that situation when it prevents or when

00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:25.429
it presents itself and I think we've

00:11:24.079 --> 00:11:27.230
been doing a pretty good job not taking

00:11:25.429 --> 00:11:29.869
damage either but really like I can't

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:31.639
complain about this daily we've gotten

00:11:29.869 --> 00:11:33.559
great damage and our trinket right off

00:11:31.639 --> 00:11:36.799
the bat really cemented this is a run in

00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:38.809
which we had some pace so you know I

00:11:36.799 --> 00:11:41.389
would say this is a positively Danish

00:11:38.809 --> 00:11:43.819
run right now hear me out here by the

00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:46.009
way I got a bone to pick Denmark I know

00:11:43.819 --> 00:11:51.910
everyone's like always will be good eh I

00:11:46.009 --> 00:11:51.910
mean we should pick this up just to

00:11:52.419 --> 00:11:58.509
possibly get a couple of pennies out of

00:11:56.089 --> 00:12:03.889
it but alright

00:11:58.509 --> 00:12:06.139
America American Britain British I don't

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:10.730
know if that one even applies France

00:12:06.139 --> 00:12:12.559
French Denmark Danish would why not

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:16.129
Denmark you that's I just got to ask

00:12:12.559 --> 00:12:19.339
Germany German Sweden Swedish Finland

00:12:16.129 --> 00:12:21.709
Finnish Denmark Danish explain this to

00:12:19.339 --> 00:12:23.329
me why do you get your own demonym that

00:12:21.709 --> 00:12:26.919
breaks the mold oh dude

00:12:23.329 --> 00:12:26.919
crickets head that's pretty good

00:12:27.869 --> 00:12:32.859
maybe there's a great reason that I'm

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:36.279
not aware of I'm just saying there

00:12:32.859 --> 00:12:37.449
better be because you know I'm sitting

00:12:36.279 --> 00:12:40.420
over here I don't want to be Canadian

00:12:37.449 --> 00:12:41.889
anymore I want to be you know Vaughn

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.600
Feldstein I don't know what that even

00:12:41.889 --> 00:12:46.029
means but you know we're going to figure

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.919
it out for ourselves as we go do it the

00:12:46.029 --> 00:12:49.540
money is out of control but would it

00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:52.239
kill you to give me a single bomb all I

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:54.339
wanted on this floor is one bomb so I

00:12:52.239 --> 00:12:55.739
could get a golden bomb find all of our

00:12:54.339 --> 00:12:58.209
secret rooms and kill enemies with

00:12:55.739 --> 00:12:59.949
relative ease although our damage is 11

00:12:58.209 --> 00:13:04.499
right now so it's not like we're hurting

00:12:59.949 --> 00:13:04.499
on a killing standpoint right now but

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:10.179
again you're the land of the Danes

00:13:08.009 --> 00:13:15.459
Denmark I don't know is that just the

00:13:10.179 --> 00:13:16.749
English name is that one of those that

00:13:15.459 --> 00:13:18.519
one of those things where you know for

00:13:16.749 --> 00:13:19.959
some reason like you have a country name

00:13:18.519 --> 00:13:22.629
that we could pronounce in English but

00:13:19.959 --> 00:13:23.649
we gave it our own country name or is it

00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:26.410
one of those ones where we call it

00:13:23.649 --> 00:13:28.989
Denmark but in Danish the language is

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:30.970
actually like you know Danmark you know

00:13:28.989 --> 00:13:32.559
it's the same thing we just need lessly

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.790
change differ so well not we I'm not

00:13:32.559 --> 00:13:37.600
going to take any credit for it it was

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:41.559
probably the British all right well

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:43.239
we're sad lis moving on here sadly just

00:13:41.559 --> 00:13:45.419
because of the consumables by the way I

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:51.610
mean we could ace of diamonds

00:13:45.419 --> 00:13:53.079
petrified poop everyone's ragging on me

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:55.239
by everybody I mean one person

00:13:53.079 --> 00:14:00.389
specifically saying why do you call this

00:13:55.239 --> 00:14:03.519
guy rah mega his name is rag mega and

00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:07.720
you know the easy thing to do there

00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:10.509
would be to go oh I know but I actually

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.919
didn't I actually for some reason at one

00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:13.720
point maybe I thought this guy's name

00:14:11.919 --> 00:14:16.689
was rag mega because I actually read the

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:18.910
you know description but then it just

00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:20.289
became raw mega and I never questioned

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:22.209
it so you know what thank you for

00:14:20.289 --> 00:14:24.939
forcing me to turn the lens of criticism

00:14:22.209 --> 00:14:26.649
inwards and learn a little bit about the

00:14:24.939 --> 00:14:28.359
Isak world that I surround myself with

00:14:26.649 --> 00:14:30.069
you know if I'm going to spend a little

00:14:28.359 --> 00:14:34.329
bit of every day playing The Binding of

00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:37.100
Isaac it helps to be helps to be abreast

00:14:34.329 --> 00:14:38.970
of the situation

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:41.700
thank you for bringing it to my

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:43.830
attention I don't know why I said it in

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.940
this smarmy voice we I mean didn't need

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.880
to shoot the poop but it's not like that

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:49.200
poop is never going to benefit us anyway

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.790
well that's not sure because respawn is

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.990
dark you just get a bunch of HP upgrades

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.399
and then eventually need the rainbow

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:57.990
poop but all of that happening within

00:14:53.399 --> 00:14:59.339
one floor would be unlikely speaking of

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:02.250
which so would getting one bomb

00:14:59.339 --> 00:15:06.089
apparently on the bright side like if

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:06.779
you did get a bomb I don't know how you

00:15:06.089 --> 00:15:08.940
did it

00:15:06.779 --> 00:15:10.020
but you're probably in the minority here

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.910
so I'm not really worried about

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.500
competing with people getting to you

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.940
know secret rooms and second secret

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.959
rooms and oh look there's a random

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:19.589
crawlspace there that gives you

00:15:15.959 --> 00:15:23.339
Polyphemus so I'm pretty sure that this

00:15:19.589 --> 00:15:25.500
one's gonna I can't take mark not

00:15:23.339 --> 00:15:30.300
without like a bean based weapon or

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:31.770
something it's just no good so I'm

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.230
pretty sure this one comes down to like

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:36.480
how much damage are you taking which is

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:39.180
actually working out like pretty nicely

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.709
for us right now I didn't even have to

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:42.270
lampshade it I knew I was going to get

00:15:40.709 --> 00:15:44.270
hit there it's just perfect timing so

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:48.870
you definitely go for a Half Price

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:50.040
restock we've got power pills we have

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:54.300
PhD that's right

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:57.330
let me get credit card okay if you buy a

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:58.770
key oh I'm not buying a bomb though we

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:01.650
can buy a bomb and maybe get a nickel

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:03.360
out of it but that's not my strat here

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:09.270
the credit card the plan with the credit

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:12.029
card is to use that on a deal if devil

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:13.680
if it shows up or a future shop in the

00:16:12.029 --> 00:16:17.310
end I would suggest that our key did get

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:18.930
used appropriately here by doing the

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:21.329
room will get a little bit of a bonus

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:23.010
regardless but I was hoping to maybe get

00:16:21.329 --> 00:16:24.600
a key and some consumables out of the

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.820
first one so that it more or less pay

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:29.400
for itself but sure we got a bomb we

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:31.620
also needed one of those and we got some

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:35.360
more money for finishing so we are like

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:37.200
basically exactly on schedule for

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.880
getting through this floor and getting

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.440
to boss rush and I think we're strong

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.850
enough to live through boss rush maybe

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:47.730
we could use a little bit more HP on

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:49.290
route but just checking to see we could

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.010
blow that up for 5 extra cents we could

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:52.470
buy a key

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:55.320
I don't know the bombs are also pretty

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:57.120
valuable so I think a bomb is as

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:59.100
valuable as a key right now maybe even a

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:02.430
little bit more tilted towards a bomb

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:05.010
because you know tinted rock potential

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:06.120
which hasn't been an issue so far all

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:08.370
right I don't know

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:11.579
stop with the Skype messages this is

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:15.180
madness it's inanity you're interrupting

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:18.300
an elite eSports athlete in the middle

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:22.589
of his daily meditation this is honestly

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:25.980
it should be illegal I'm going to go

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:27.810
this way a Cuba meet is nice and we will

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.580
have permanent Polaroid invincibility

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:30.690
even if we come back as dark Judas

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:33.360
we'll have permanent Polaroid

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:41.040
invincibility for a bit probably so a

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:45.830
Cuba meet is very good nice one-two

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:45.830
punch moron almost got yourself killed

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:55.470
I've been told it's worth fighting the

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:57.840
angel statue gives you a damage

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:59.340
multiplier I'm sorry a point multiplier

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.410
it's not going to slow us down that much

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:03.060
we also got seraphim as an item honestly

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:06.240
our damage is good enough to not really

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:08.130
be like oh thank god its Seraphim but it

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.600
is a little bit more damage thrown onto

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.790
the pile so I'm not going to complain

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.600
too hard it's a relatively good deal at

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:15.750
the angel item

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.860
there's our key piece also increases our

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:18.360
odds of getting deals with the angel in

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:20.880
the future we're down to the next floor

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.860
I would say like roughly with perfect

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:27.060
timing

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:31.070
because we're fast enough to do whatever

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:34.530
we want but not fast enough or done

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:36.360
quick enough rather to do nothing so a

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:40.830
health upgrade is really nice as Glu Bay

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:45.390
because it doesn't spawn just an empty

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:47.490
heart container via PhD so tella pills

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:49.440
it's not bad power pill is also not bad

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:51.360
but credit card we want to make sure we

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.010
make use of this and really my strategy

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.410
for credit card I've been I've been at

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:57.120
this game a long time but my strategy

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:58.650
for credit card is very very simple in

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.840
this day and age use it the first

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:02.130
opportunity you get don't worry too much

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:05.190
about you know

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:06.990
getting maximum 100% value out of it

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:08.610
just you know if you find a deal with

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:12.419
the devil uses you find a shop item you

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:15.870
want to buy use it you less you'll thank

00:19:12.419 --> 00:19:17.520
yourself later when you're not holding a

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:19.620
credit card on the chest wondering what

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:24.840
went wrong and trust me I've been there

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:32.570
many a time very lucky we found our boss

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:34.669
room quite early we probably want to use

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:37.289
[Music]

00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:39.210
power pill to get into the curse room

00:19:37.289 --> 00:19:41.370
maybe but we got a like the rest of the

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:42.720
floor needs to come into clarity a

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:44.039
little bit more for us first you know I

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.780
need to go to our shop I need to go to

00:19:44.039 --> 00:19:48.780
our item room if we've got the time with

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:50.100
our damage and with a cube of meat we

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:52.080
should be able to kill mom fairly

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:53.340
quickly we could also get more money out

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.309
of that which could be worth more spirit

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:58.380
arts in and of itself okay so here shop

00:19:56.309 --> 00:20:00.620
an item room so as of this point we

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:03.960
could pretty much go to the boss fight

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:05.490
if we're worried about time which I

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:09.480
don't think we have much reason to be

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:12.480
but just in case it's good to keep that

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:17.159
in mind greed no greed convertor doesn't

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:21.030
matter map does so I say we credit card

00:20:17.159 --> 00:20:24.090
buy the map and it doesn't restock after

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:27.950
that bomber dude but we did save our

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:27.950
money I also got another health upgrade

00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:32.460
not going to use converter I really

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.900
thought that it would give us two new

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.340
items I think it's the first time I've

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:41.010
ever used credit card while also having

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:43.280
restock or something don't hate me

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:48.110
because I'm beautiful

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:53.669
it's I don't like the idea of using

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:54.360
stompy because we walk on mushrooms who

00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:56.820
walk on

00:20:54.360 --> 00:21:00.809
I mean skulls obviously are good because

00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:05.240
they give us black hearts and tarot

00:21:00.809 --> 00:21:05.240
cards my favourite crash-test-dummy song

00:21:05.809 --> 00:21:11.730
however we walk on hearts we're making

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:13.049
like a bad decision you know not hard

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:20.850
for those weird enough in the womb that

00:21:13.049 --> 00:21:22.289
give you hearts but never do all right

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:24.360
so we have a tell appeals I don't know

00:21:22.289 --> 00:21:26.850
what my plan is for that but we're going

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:28.950
to go fight mom quickly because we have

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:32.070
to and then we'll do boss rush and I'm

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:33.539
kind of eager for the opportunity if you

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:35.190
get a deal with the angel to be really

00:21:33.539 --> 00:21:39.809
nice because that indicates there cannot

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:41.720
be a Krampus in it that's right I

00:21:39.809 --> 00:21:43.980
subscribe to the multiple Krampus theory

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:46.500
there's not one Krampus there's many

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:48.330
demons masquerading as Krampus to try to

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:52.889
stop us from being able to get the boss

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:54.450
rush on dailies dude blue mom when time

00:21:52.889 --> 00:22:00.260
is of the essence pain in the butt

00:21:54.450 --> 00:22:02.789
luckily we got eleven damage easy money

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:05.720
no Krampus fight permanent Polaroid

00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:09.029
invincibility all right so Pisces

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:12.720
continuum fruitcake anemic

00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:17.399
who so the peers up plus knock back

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:20.000
continuum fruitcake I think we'll go

00:22:17.399 --> 00:22:20.000
fruitcake

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:27.370
don't think it's a particularly strong

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:35.169
item and I think boss rush might well

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:37.660
take us quite a long time here but

00:22:35.169 --> 00:22:39.940
honestly the points are fine and if

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:43.390
we're only looking to get to like 35,000

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:45.340
we really haven't we haven't made it too

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:49.480
easy on the game is the way that I would

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:51.970
describe it you know we haven't taken a

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:53.710
bunch of stupid damage we haven't you

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:55.270
know accidentally picked up an item that

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:59.140
ruins things for us or anything like

00:22:55.270 --> 00:23:00.640
that unless fruitcake ends up dealing

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:03.250
like a ton of damage to us that were not

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:06.130
ready for but I honestly think that

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:07.600
we've kept it pretty much on the level

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:10.090
it's been a little bit of like a I

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:12.040
wouldn't say boring necessarily but a

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:13.750
little bit of like a standard daily

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:18.070
haven't been too many opportunities to

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:24.520
really mess about but it turns out that

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:25.660
that's like completely okay are you not

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.910
dead what happened that was like a

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:29.940
science euthanasia tier or something

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:33.130
like that

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:35.200
there's a lot of gaps in this run that I

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:36.640
would like to I mean it sounds wrong

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:40.419
there's a lot of gaps I'd like to plug

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:45.700
our stats are so good and I'm eternally

00:23:40.419 --> 00:23:49.900
grateful for that however wouldn't mind

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:53.260
replacing our space bar item now it's

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:55.419
kind of a luxury to have a garbage well

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:57.280
not very good space bar item that

00:23:55.419 --> 00:24:02.110
charges very quickly because it works

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:03.309
very well with illuminated bulb makes it

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:06.790
you know probably one of the best

00:24:03.309 --> 00:24:10.980
trinkets in the game not that it's had

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:15.100
much competition on this run however

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:18.630
still wouldn't mind having the

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.630
opportunity to maybe get a

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.909
to maybe get a spacebar and then

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:25.700
actually provides us with some benefit

00:24:22.909 --> 00:24:27.860
at a small cost to our stats

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:32.090
although literally to every one of our

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:33.679
stats I hate I accidentally nudged I got

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:38.179
like a volume knob on my headphones

00:24:33.679 --> 00:24:40.880
because because I'm fancy and I nudged

00:24:38.179 --> 00:24:42.799
it with my knee here and now the game is

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:45.950
at zero volume so I hear myself like a

00:24:42.799 --> 00:24:47.870
hundred percent I'm very much over the

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:49.460
like Oh does my voice actually sound

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:51.350
like that sort of stuff but it's still

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.909
like it's distracting because now it's

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:54.440
more like are those the thoughts that

00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:57.740
are coming out of my head like I'll

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:59.120
eternally be embarrassed about that so

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:01.730
if you'll give me a moment here maybe

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:04.130
after we kill monstro to crank up the

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:06.409
volume I wish I mean I'm going to pump

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:08.240
pump the jam and pump it up while your

00:25:06.409 --> 00:25:14.299
feet are thumping that's much better

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:16.130
okay so fruitcake I mean it's a good

00:25:14.299 --> 00:25:17.450
item for us I think it actually is

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:21.380
upping our damage not that we

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:22.970
drastically needed but it's been fairly

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:26.750
useful for us so far the occasional

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:29.020
expose Evo or Holy Light shot mostly

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:33.289
those ones like Godhead is nice but a

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:37.220
little bit less raw damage than any of

00:25:33.289 --> 00:25:39.110
those other options and of course the

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:41.419
pennies that were getting from it as

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:43.279
well and I guess I didn't even mention

00:25:41.419 --> 00:25:45.620
it though that was pretty bad but the

00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:50.090
the demon hearts from from serpents

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:51.649
kissed tears that was the first tip

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:56.740
we've taken on this boss rush though so

00:25:51.649 --> 00:25:56.740
I'm like decidedly not sweating it

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:02.899
rarely especially on dailies where you

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.950
don't have much of a choice about

00:26:02.899 --> 00:26:08.149
whether or not you do boss rush rarely

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:09.970
does it end up being a decision that

00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:12.950
actually benefits you in terms of like

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:16.070
your HP or any of your other stats for

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:19.970
that matter so so far I'm like this is a

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:21.799
dream come true man I think that was a

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:26.600
booger tear but I was waiting for him to

00:26:21.799 --> 00:26:29.220
explode for like 15 seconds there

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:31.770
mega fatty only scary to us right now

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:34.559
when he jumps you know any other attack

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:36.120
that he does we can dodge super easily

00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:38.510
not even I was going to say be able to

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:40.590
kill him before he gets done with that

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:42.539
just going to watch out for for

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:44.910
teleporting enemies which is effectively

00:26:42.539 --> 00:26:46.710
the same as a jump if they disappear

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:48.780
from the screen and then also enemies

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:52.020
the shoot beams if we can avoid those

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:56.090
two that's like 80% of the damage I'd

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:56.090
expect to have any chance to take here

00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:01.260
just why I'm trying to understand in one

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:04.110
spot for two too long up okay fast enemy

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:05.700
we didn't get hit though I actually had

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:09.929
to double check there I thought we might

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:11.490
have so really this is a pretty

00:27:09.929 --> 00:27:16.860
comforting position to be in right now

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:18.750
because there's no chance for us to

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:21.030
really mess it up at this point

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:26.190
sure it would be great to get a seam and

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:28.169
make it past the the moms hard fight and

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:29.760
make it down to Sheol it's only one

00:27:28.169 --> 00:27:31.200
extra floor it would make all the

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:33.690
difference from a point standpoint but

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:36.030
honestly it's conceivable that deals

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:37.350
with the angel at such a good item it's

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:38.640
conceivable that going for deals with

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:40.140
the angel has precluded us from doing

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:45.570
that like there's a chance that the shop

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:46.710
shows up but it probably won't so I

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:49.169
think at this point we actually should

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:50.730
use tell appeals and we should go

00:27:49.169 --> 00:27:52.200
explore the rest of this floor because I

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:56.809
think that's the best way for us to

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:56.809
accrue like a maximal advantage here I

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:03.929
wish I hadn't messed up the shop of

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:07.200
course the one time I advocate like a

00:28:03.929 --> 00:28:08.490
conservative use of credit card it ends

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.080
up screwing me because I could have

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:15.679
bought like four or five items from the

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:20.190
shop but alas and alack we can't go back

00:28:15.679 --> 00:28:22.980
we have a library potentially and

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:24.659
that'll be an interesting thing to think

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:29.850
about because Book of Revelations is

00:28:24.659 --> 00:28:32.909
like well it's good it's a one down to

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:37.890
basically everything I think we should

00:28:32.909 --> 00:28:39.549
go with this it does make us worse but

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:44.679
not by a ton and this

00:28:39.549 --> 00:28:48.669
is like I don't know it's a tough call

00:28:44.679 --> 00:28:51.789
maybe it's the right decision for us to

00:28:48.669 --> 00:28:54.249
play the self-sacrifice room if it is

00:28:51.789 --> 00:28:56.769
it's the right decision later as well

00:28:54.249 --> 00:29:03.009
which means we might as well you know

00:28:56.769 --> 00:29:06.039
explore a little bit more here he's a

00:29:03.009 --> 00:29:11.289
God he got the penny in the second

00:29:06.039 --> 00:29:13.149
secret room but yeah it's possible

00:29:11.289 --> 00:29:14.950
especially because we got the respawn

00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:16.600
there might be a way to eke out a few

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:18.190
extra thousand points or it might give

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.690
us so much of a damage penalty that the

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:23.129
teleport is not even worth it in the end

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:25.899
but for now I think we have a very very

00:29:23.129 --> 00:29:29.470
luxurious daily ahead of us our stats

00:29:25.899 --> 00:29:31.840
are good and there's not really a hard

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:34.749
decision to be made unless we find a

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:36.759
self-sacrifice room email on this floor

00:29:34.749 --> 00:29:41.139
in which point your average point we'll

00:29:36.759 --> 00:29:43.690
have to think about it but I'd probably

00:29:41.139 --> 00:29:45.399
go through with it I think it's a pretty

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:47.590
easy daily like I think everybody's

00:29:45.399 --> 00:29:49.899
having a good daily today it's like a

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:51.519
good old-fashioned you know hamburger

00:29:49.899 --> 00:29:53.679
french fries in a strawberry milkshake

00:29:51.519 --> 00:29:56.019
you know every not everybody's favorite

00:29:53.679 --> 00:29:58.059
meal every day but now and then hits the

00:29:56.019 --> 00:30:00.700
spot right okay let's leave those in

00:29:58.059 --> 00:30:04.720
case we end up wanting to go to a

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:06.609
self-sacrifice room on this floor it is

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:12.070
that one of the most like reproducible

00:30:06.609 --> 00:30:13.929
scenes in the game so it's up to us to

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:16.720
be like well let's get bacon on our

00:30:13.929 --> 00:30:22.409
burger and then we'll take it to the

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:27.730
next level you know ace of hearts not

00:30:22.409 --> 00:30:30.159
relevant I don't really want to use this

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:32.139
yet either again the whole point is sure

00:30:30.159 --> 00:30:34.330
it would replace the spirit art but I

00:30:32.139 --> 00:30:37.989
like having the stat bonus for now well

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:40.960
we have no other costs associated with

00:30:37.989 --> 00:30:42.639
it and if we want to play the

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.739
self-sacrifice room I don't really care

00:30:42.639 --> 00:30:48.399
what kind of hearts the hearts are I

00:30:44.739 --> 00:30:50.590
just care that we can this should be

00:30:48.399 --> 00:30:52.029
bookworm I just care that we can take

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:53.120
advantage of it we use book of secrets

00:30:52.029 --> 00:30:54.770
that shows

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:57.140
the whole map there is no self-sacrifice

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:59.630
room book of a lile of course quite nice

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:00.200
for damage to the Bible and then book of

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:02.360
sin

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:04.400
give me a purse or a room it gave me a

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:09.880
red heart it's kind of a tough call

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:16.880
because I could see book of Belial being

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:18.500
really nice for us right now you think

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:21.200
it's a secret room below us I think it's

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:23.390
worth checking let's go this means we

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:25.580
don't have to take any extra damage on

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:27.140
this floor which is worth something I

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:29.630
mean stompy admittedly would have helped

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:31.070
us get all this money so I am feeling

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:34.809
the burn in there a little bit we

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:34.809
definitely do not care about matchstick

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:41.780
but again I think you know we're playing

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:44.210
this run right you know we're doing like

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:45.679
a Bob Ross tutorial video right here I'm

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:49.700
not saying it looks as good as the

00:31:45.679 --> 00:31:52.040
Masters but it does look evocative of

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:54.950
it's like you know this this run would

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:57.260
get at least an A if this was Isaac

00:31:54.950 --> 00:32:00.530
daily class right now like we've hit

00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:03.290
every conceivable measure of competency

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:06.230
on the rubric right now sure taking a

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:10.010
little bit of damage but who amongst us

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:13.190
hasn't you know going to every single

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:19.370
room we're not taking needless damage

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:22.040
very often along the way so we really

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:23.809
really like to see a self sacrifice room

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:25.550
on the next floor I think if we don't

00:32:23.809 --> 00:32:29.900
get a rune or something that allows us

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:31.130
to the circumvent the run ending on the

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:36.470
next floor I think we would really

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:39.110
really really like to just speed right

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:40.220
by it now we obviously will not be able

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:43.820
to make the hush 5 of the hush fight

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:46.220
also does not exist on today's run so no

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:49.040
harm no foul there again front page is

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:54.650
usually like my my ambitious goal and

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:56.090
today we got a chance I'd say 35 or 38

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:58.850
thousand to make the front page I mean

00:32:56.090 --> 00:33:00.380
that's a pretty darn good score to be

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:02.210
honest with you and we're still a

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:03.530
distance away from that so I would

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:04.970
almost bet that there is a self

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:06.620
sacrifice room on the next floor or

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:11.450
there was a shovel

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:13.610
and somehow I missed it it's great item

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:15.409
not going to say no to blood clot here

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:17.629
and we'll head down to the next floor

00:33:15.409 --> 00:33:21.350
hey maybe we should look for a second

00:33:17.629 --> 00:33:24.320
secret room two bombs two bombs that's

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:28.820
all I'm going to use okay we found a

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:38.330
crawl space crawl space had data miner

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:42.740
yeah dad yeah oh yeah mine yeah er yeah

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:45.200
dad a miner everybody have you heard of

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:46.340
you anyway that's my way of distract you

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:49.720
from the fact that I didn't pick up data

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:49.720
miner cuz it's garbage

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:58.269
people from everywhere come to defend

00:33:54.919 --> 00:34:02.480
you despite all your weakness I don't

00:33:58.269 --> 00:34:07.750
understand why they like data miner oh I

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:13.460
don't care about that temperance is

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:15.109
technically usable if we get

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:18.079
invincibility we might as well throw

00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:23.960
down temperance and just like enjoy life

00:34:18.079 --> 00:34:28.450
for a bit plenty of bombs we don't need

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:28.450
any more keys because we're not going to

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:36.079
we're not going to the chest it's

00:34:32.359 --> 00:34:39.050
actually not relevant so not so worried

00:34:36.079 --> 00:34:41.060
about the loss of cheese store credit

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:45.379
sadly useless but this room seems to

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:46.879
have mostly paid for itself well very

00:34:45.379 --> 00:34:49.369
much so paid for itself you also got a

00:34:46.879 --> 00:34:50.270
couple of luck upgrades over the course

00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:55.190
of this as well

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:59.690
um Keynes I occasionally you know gives

00:34:55.190 --> 00:35:03.460
us vision of where to go I actually

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:07.700
think it's the wrong decision to go to

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:10.000
the the cursed room what do we need it's

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:14.329
not going to give us like a full guppy

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:17.630
suite even if it did we don't need a

00:35:14.329 --> 00:35:19.940
full guppy suite 48 hour energy I mean I

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:22.069
guess we should still

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:27.109
the battery charge is just in case there

00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:28.940
is a self-sacrifice room even though it

00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:31.970
might compromise our ability to respawn

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:35.299
as dark Judas it's the right call to get

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:38.539
like the maximum amount of raw HP I'm

00:35:35.299 --> 00:35:41.750
telling you I'm basing this whole floor

00:35:38.539 --> 00:35:43.460
and my decisions on it on the idea that

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:45.740
there will be a self-sacrifice room and

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:46.940
there was so we know we're going to get

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:48.920
a deal with the devil as well hopefully

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:50.960
it's the deal with the angel will fight

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:53.089
the angel statue and then we'll do our

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:55.430
teleportation and honestly if you like

00:35:53.089 --> 00:35:57.579
watching me succeed and I I mean I don't

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:59.690
like watching myself succeed but I like

00:35:57.579 --> 00:36:02.270
succeeding on the video I don't you know

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:04.369
watch it back in my own time I never

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:06.410
have any time to myself and you see also

00:36:04.369 --> 00:36:07.640
you do it to reflect badly on my

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:09.470
personality you'd be like this guy

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:11.780
watches his own isaac videos it's like

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:15.470
you know an hour and I have a content a

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:17.720
day that he's already seen what's wrong

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:19.670
with them but if you like watching me

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:20.960
succeed you should be very happy with

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:27.589
the way that things are looking right

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:29.660
now because we are probably about to

00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:35.260
have one of our best relative ranks ever

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:35.260
unless we grossly grossly mess it up

00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:39.650
there's just the reason I'm kind of

00:36:38.119 --> 00:36:41.480
excited about it I was very cocky about

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:45.349
yesterday's daily and rank much worse

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:48.380
than I had thought but the reason I'm

00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:50.270
cocky about it is because I just don't

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:52.670
see too many opportunities for us to

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:53.960
have gotten more points sure consumables

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:58.010
are a little on the light side except

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:59.630
for money but apart from that and the of

00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:05.569
course damage that I don't know why I'm

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:07.940
exclusively getting the exploding option

00:37:05.569 --> 00:37:12.740
here now on our fruitcake tears when we

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:14.329
hadn't had it like ever before but did

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:15.650
we pick up something that no blood clot

00:37:14.329 --> 00:37:17.240
doesn't do that so I don't understand

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:19.099
anyway I don't see too many

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:20.599
opportunities to get a few thousand

00:37:19.099 --> 00:37:22.130
points above me so I have to imagine

00:37:20.599 --> 00:37:24.890
that we're you know I'm not saying we're

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:26.180
in the 40s on today's run but I think we

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:28.720
got a good chance to be in the 30

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:28.720
somewhere

00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:36.069
we don't need that

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:43.339
an angel deal devil deal we could

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:45.109
probably with the amount of consumables

00:37:43.339 --> 00:37:47.299
on the ground we could probably afford

00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:50.210
to take either but it we'd have to

00:37:47.299 --> 00:37:51.380
consider it you know we'd have to pay if

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:52.640
it's the devil deal we have to consider

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:54.619
if it's an angel deal we just have to

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.849
look at the item and determine whether

00:37:54.619 --> 00:37:57.440
or not it's any good at all

00:37:55.849 --> 00:37:59.960
see that was like rock and a hard place

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:01.160
there we've got an angel deal we'll

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:03.380
probably fight forward as we get a

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:04.940
charge anyway I don't know if we can

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:10.400
take both if we can only take one we

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:13.809
want to take dead dove we have unlimited

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:17.900
bombs on this fight that's really useful

00:38:13.809 --> 00:38:20.839
because we need it that was very nice

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:24.170
though on this fight we need the bombs

00:38:20.839 --> 00:38:28.819
to pace the enemy away from us

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:30.529
I still don't think it makes sense to go

00:38:28.819 --> 00:38:32.799
to the curse room and I'm drowsy at this

00:38:30.529 --> 00:38:34.670
point it's just something I have like

00:38:32.799 --> 00:38:36.109
wait a minute wait a minute wait a

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:38.869
minute I was going to say to make the

00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:39.859
lamb fight easier but we could be heroes

00:38:38.869 --> 00:38:42.499
just for one day

00:38:39.859 --> 00:38:44.779
you take the temperance card and then

00:38:42.499 --> 00:38:46.369
you use it along with the self-sacrifice

00:38:44.779 --> 00:38:48.349
room you might be able to snag a blood

00:38:46.369 --> 00:38:54.799
bag out of it if you get a blood bag

00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:57.769
then you get a speed upgrade which could

00:38:54.799 --> 00:38:59.989
be very nice for us as well so you

00:38:57.769 --> 00:39:01.400
definitely like pop temperance use this

00:38:59.989 --> 00:39:05.539
you know it's going to hurt like our

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:06.769
damage penalty is going to go up maybe

00:39:05.539 --> 00:39:08.979
we'll get a reroll or something later

00:39:06.769 --> 00:39:08.979
we'll

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:17.510
got to admit relatively smart idea for

00:39:14.569 --> 00:39:18.890
yours truly we feel blessed that's

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:23.839
better angel deal chance

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:25.250
just in time three plays just to make it

00:39:23.839 --> 00:39:26.569
safe okay I don't know why I would walk

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:26.839
over to that one first but that's all

00:39:26.569 --> 00:39:31.550
right

00:39:26.839 --> 00:39:34.790
life goes on feel blessed again wow what

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:37.400
a terrific audience thank you for this

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:43.579
all the money and we will receive at one

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:50.450
point not that's good that's good let's

00:39:43.579 --> 00:39:54.140
pick it all up the luck there is not

00:39:50.450 --> 00:40:00.559
meaningless help recover some of the

00:39:54.140 --> 00:40:03.339
points as well so we had little delirium

00:40:00.559 --> 00:40:07.430
he's okay you've got positives

00:40:03.339 --> 00:40:09.440
don't touch my temperance card we're

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:14.270
going to go back and start to pick up

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:17.990
some extra charges here because again it

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:19.309
would be nice to become dark Judas and

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:21.710
have the damage bonus but we already

00:40:19.309 --> 00:40:23.210
have a damage multiplier in the form of

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:24.829
crickets head so I don't know if Dark

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:27.349
Judas is actually going to give us an

00:40:24.829 --> 00:40:28.640
added multiplier on top of that doesn't

00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:31.069
mean I don't want to become dark Judas

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:33.380
it just means I'm thinking you know

00:40:31.069 --> 00:40:37.190
critically about the situation as its

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:38.089
presented itself if we became doctors

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:39.710
I think that would be fine

00:40:38.089 --> 00:40:42.400
but I would rather be blue baby with

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:46.670
like four HP than dark Judas with two

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:49.240
and we're making we're making something

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:51.619
out of nothing here which i think is

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:55.339
important this has been a good daily

00:40:51.619 --> 00:40:57.799
strong from the get-go and good

00:40:55.339 --> 00:41:00.700
opportunities for upward movement you

00:40:57.799 --> 00:41:00.700
know it's important

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:10.650
so we forget the blood bank for now I

00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:12.940
know sacrilege but

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:17.320
wasn't the right time to worry about it

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:20.670
we did get seven spirit arts and we got

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:24.010
IV bag which is unfortunate but

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:33.700
understandable IV bag is not something

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:36.160
we want blood bag would have been dope

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:37.720
but life goes on so we're gonna teleport

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:39.750
you'll be very interesting to see how

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:43.930
our points look when we come down here

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:46.810
we're at 32,000 so I'm like a man is it

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:48.700
conceivable to get to 38 I don't think

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:55.360
there's anything we like I this was the

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:57.400
right way to get points but we still got

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:57.880
to take it like a little bit to the next

00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:01.690
level

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:03.040
oh dude health ups and balls of steel we

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:04.870
still got to play pretty well I think

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:12.430
but top hundreds should be very doable

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:15.900
for us don't think we really squandered

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:15.900
too much goodwill from the run

00:42:19.599 --> 00:42:28.690
holy crap we didn't get hit there you

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:31.849
see that it was a it was madness

00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:34.249
never ever teleport and I'll be the

00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:40.190
happiest of all cat yet I was just not

00:42:34.249 --> 00:42:41.479
very shrewd on my part don't squander it

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:43.339
on this floor you know you got i

00:42:41.479 --> 00:42:44.900
wouldn't expect to not take any damage

00:42:43.339 --> 00:42:46.609
on this floor we're not in like the you

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:48.170
know Tammy said brimstone press space

00:42:46.609 --> 00:42:50.839
and everything dies kind of territory

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:56.660
yet fingers a completely acceptable item

00:42:50.839 --> 00:42:59.180
even though it costs us it costs us

00:42:56.660 --> 00:43:02.630
points to pick it up I think it pays for

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:05.569
itself maybe literally in terms of its

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:10.339
time you know the it will kill enemies

00:43:05.569 --> 00:43:12.140
very very slightly faster but also

00:43:10.339 --> 00:43:15.469
compensates in terms of like you know

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:21.170
maybe damage take in and then there's

00:43:15.469 --> 00:43:23.269
the morale fudge factor as well again

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:24.589
it's kind of debatable whether you

00:43:23.269 --> 00:43:26.390
should pick these up at this point in

00:43:24.589 --> 00:43:29.359
fact I'm going to stop picking up items

00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:31.670
that don't give us like immediate

00:43:29.359 --> 00:43:34.449
benefit and admittedly the fly doesn't

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:37.400
really give us a media benefit so

00:43:34.449 --> 00:43:41.029
occasional help maybe immediate benefit

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:42.859
no same with like Gemini's fine it's a

00:43:41.029 --> 00:43:45.969
little too late for it to guarantee that

00:43:42.859 --> 00:43:50.029
it proves it's worth though so just

00:43:45.969 --> 00:43:51.469
going to ignore that for now really

00:43:50.029 --> 00:43:58.420
hoping the heart would die I think it

00:43:51.469 --> 00:43:58.420
has now it's a bad floor for us to have

00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:02.329
no vision on by the way you got to take

00:44:01.579 --> 00:44:09.739
this

00:44:02.329 --> 00:44:10.789
a tears upgrade absolutely I'm looking

00:44:09.739 --> 00:44:15.589
at this and I'm like man we're not going

00:44:10.789 --> 00:44:19.729
to hit 38,000 35 is conceivable if we do

00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:21.499
every room that remains on this floor 35

00:44:19.729 --> 00:44:23.959
is within RIT within reach we can get

00:44:21.499 --> 00:44:27.229
another you know two thousand for our

00:44:23.959 --> 00:44:29.310
time on this room and then whatever our

00:44:27.229 --> 00:44:31.050
bonus is for finishing but

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:33.750
I think 38 is outside of the realm of

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:36.150
possibility unfortunately but still a

00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:38.340
daily to be proud of and honestly if you

00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:41.520
beat me on rank today or came close to

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:43.170
me on rank today you should be proud as

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:45.150
well good this was like a daily where

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:49.010
you had to play at least decently to get

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:52.410
things done you know did you solve a

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:54.510
complex mathematical problem to rank

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:57.450
well today I don't know I know I didn't

00:44:54.510 --> 00:45:00.300
but did you show up to class did you do

00:44:57.450 --> 00:45:03.810
all the homework and you know give

00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:06.810
yourself a pat on the back reward is a

00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:08.670
big part of motivation and you know I'm

00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:09.870
not afraid to give out too many Pat's on

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:17.910
the back I don't know what you say like

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:22.110
that it sounds a little creepy but this

00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:24.570
thirty 2255 obviously the best way to

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:29.850
rank as highly as we possibly can years

00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:36.390
just not take any damage but barring

00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:38.460
that as a guarantee which is you know

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:42.150
basically inconceivable that you could

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:45.120
guarantee that so I knew it I had my I

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:49.830
had him in my freaking sight soldier 76

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:52.140
style - I just didn't quite have the

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:54.690
speed yet - get out of the way now we

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:59.550
might I don't know I don't think I

00:45:54.690 --> 00:46:03.750
should use oh hey I don't think we

00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:05.340
should use Satanic Bible yet we should

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:08.010
enjoy the stat bonus well we have it

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:10.430
hello and then use balls of steel

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:10.430
instead

00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:19.450
come on come on come on no more jumps no

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:19.450
more jumps no more jokes let's go

00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:25.780
we lost like 300 points there Oh up

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:35.930
stop this oh mylanta I still think we

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:41.000
don't use this I prefer having a little

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:46.970
stat bonus right now little grim is gone

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:49.840
now it's a second Seraphim I think not

00:46:46.970 --> 00:47:00.230
bad dude Serpent's kiss thanks for the

00:46:49.840 --> 00:47:03.530
incredible bounty here power pill also

00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:06.080
good we do have some more rooms to go to

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:07.970
so it is like my natural inclination to

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:09.650
be like let's get the heck out of this

00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:14.600
floor you know I don't want to live my

00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:17.440
life finishing up this freakin daily

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:20.060
like I got things like a do today but I

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:22.040
will come down here we'll do our last

00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:23.960
remaining rooms because I really think

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:27.500
I'm feel like it slipped a little bit

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:29.420
towards the end but not much not enough

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:34.460
to be like extremely despondent or

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:35.360
anything so finish this room we'll go

00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:37.160
fight the boss

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:39.860
hopefully with power pill we can fight

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:44.120
that boss without taking damage and then

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:45.830
we'll use oh we might get a void floor

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:49.070
after this - I didn't even consider that

00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:50.480
that would be a way for us to eke out a

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:58.520
few extra points that I didn't even

00:47:50.480 --> 00:48:00.020
consider maybe that's the secret we're

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:01.100
willing it will find out in a second

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:03.520
yeah I don't think so I don't think

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:03.520
that's the secret

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:09.540
I think it probably ends right here but

00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:12.540
once we finish this fight if we have no

00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:14.460
void we will just use Satanic Bible that

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:16.410
will probably give us you know 3/8 of a

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:18.260
point and you know that could make all

00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:21.900
the difference on the leaderboards here

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:23.190
you can't make fun of yourself then you

00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:25.290
know you can't make fun of anybody else

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:27.150
that's why I'm especially cruel to

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:29.820
myself so I can just be vicious to other

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:37.860
people you know it's written in the code

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:40.170
of hammurabi get dunked on no void floor

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:42.210
grab this grab this it was like eight

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:44.700
points and let's go I'm happy with

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:46.170
today's score we got 36 thousand 114 is

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:48.360
