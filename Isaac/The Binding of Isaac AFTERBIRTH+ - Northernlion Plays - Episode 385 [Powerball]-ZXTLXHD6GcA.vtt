##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.879
everybody welcome back to northern line

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.550
place of finding guys get rid plus we

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.840
got so much to do it don't say I know

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.139
you're going to say so much to see I

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.590
know you're going to say so much wrong

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:18.390
we taking the back streets we just did a

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.920
greed mode run I'm kind of more

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.270
conscious about variety now that there's

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.910
only one Isaac run today so I think

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.990
here's I'm going to set up my plan today

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.490
second run of the day is going to be as

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.170
asel greed mode so that we can unlock

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.470
Lilith and then we can do a Lilith run

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.600
after that but I think for now let's

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.340
just we can actually afford to random on

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.930
hardmode and hopefully just get a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.879
character we have not achieved something

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.129
on and that can give us our goal I was

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.640
going to laugh so hard if it gave us if

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.989
it gave us Azazel although I guess I

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.230
wouldn't have mattered

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:53.219
so our post-it note shows we've not done

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.399
the cathedral of Eve 2kl 3ry 1/6 rise 16

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.199
that would be like my nickname if I was

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.149
a professional athlete who wore the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:06.780
number 16 I'm not though so I'm just I'm

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.640
ride 28 you know and they every year it

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.619
keeps getting a little bit on the older

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.840
side I'm excited to play some Isaac like

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.080
to be honest I've been in wouldn't say a

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.140
funk this week but I've had scholastic

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.840
obligations that have been like a

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:25.290
serious drain on my time willingly but

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.850
at the same time you know I just took an

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.360
exam yesterday I'm trying to get in the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.619
habit of not saying I wrote an exam

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.659
because even though that's how we say it

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.700
in Canada every time I say wrote an exam

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.829
everyone goes oh well what questions are

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.990
you going to put on it and blah blah you

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.350
know it's say speak my english language

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.560
or get out apparently but and it went

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.140
well so I'm like free at last

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.490
on my own little version of summer

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.170
vacation that allows me to play a little

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.100
bit of The Binding of Isaac which I'm

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.369
quite happy with because good lord

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.899
maybe I'm it's not really fair but I'm

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.060
going to use that as justification for

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.189
relatively poor play lately and just use

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.810
this as the opportunity to do a soft

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:11.970
reset even though our last episode was

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.500
that greed episode where we won mostly

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.100
thanks the car battery

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.690
years there have there's been some Isaac

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.550
episodes recently that haven't been like

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.020
ten out of ten in terms of like gameplay

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.710
quality we're going to nip that in the

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.090
bud we do also I know we have a bomb so

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.340
we can get this tinted rocker the one

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.570
that was aware or we were aware of

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.430
previously I would prefer to get to full

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.890
whore Babylon state before we do that

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.000
just so we have the extra DPS for the

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.770
next floor but apart from that we're

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.270
good I'm really I like to be random to

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.620
character that we don't do boss rush on

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.730
so we can sort of like ease into would

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.530
take our time this can be like a

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.820
standard 7 Isaac day for me and that

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.130
might sound like a lot of Isaac it's

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:59.310
really not that's like you know five

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:01.590
hours of Isaac five hours of Isaac took

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.600
kids it lives in the case I mean I'm not

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.220
enough of an Iron Maiden fan to follow

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.170
through with that reference built the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.790
whole way but I do remember that two

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.590
minutes at midnight was on the Tony

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.900
Hawk's Pro Skater for soundtrack so it's

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.910
not that I dislike Iron Maiden I'm just

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.220
I'm only cursorily aware of their

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.709
catalog you know I'm aware of the

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.840
trooper I'm aware of two minutes to

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.230
midnight I'm aware of out of the silent

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.180
planet because my my college roommate

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.280
really liked out of the silent planet

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.019
and whenever he would get well now

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.959
whenever but many times when he was

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.510
intoxicated he would play out of the

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:43.019
silent planet and sing along out of the

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.120
silent planet out of the silence but if

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.340
we go something like there's been like

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.040
11 years but you get the idea where was

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.940
that other rock team tip there it is

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:58.620
got tons of bombs now alright try for a

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:00.480
secret room I mean what do you think you

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.920
pick up the HP I'm going to weigh out

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.510
the pros and cons here of taking HP the

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.860
con is that it takes us immediately out

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.150
of the Whore of Babylon state and it

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.910
makes it harder to get into the

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.190
permanent or a Babylon state the pro is

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.500
that we have a chance of getting an

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.150
arcade on the next floor and if you get

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.410
an arcade on the next floor gives us the

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.289
whore Babylon stuff doesn't matter as

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.349
much and it gives us the ability to play

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:27.090
it a little longer but who do I think we

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.580
want to stick with this because our

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.919
damage

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.599
actually 2.63 well we're not in the

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:35.650
Whore of Babylon State we didn't really

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:37.659
get much that raises our damage on this

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.300
floor like I refused to count little

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:43.889
Loki is like a big damage improvement

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:46.330
for us which i think is extremely

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:49.030
understandable this gives us the ability

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.189
to actually like kill enemies fairly

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.710
easily which is nice and dude golden key

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:57.069
one of my favorite additions this game

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:00.370
allows us to actually open that up I I

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:03.879
mean oh why would you pick it up you

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.770
idiot I'm going to actually drop super

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:07.330
magnet I just wanted to pick it up and

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.159
make sure we had it on record super

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.889
magnet is in my opinion kind of a

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:13.419
garbage trinket because it also pulls

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.330
enemies towards you which makes it

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.969
almost unusable in my personal opinion

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:22.990
but it's like a strange attractor but

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:26.909
for like your whole body it works for

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:34.330
your body pulls enemies close you

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:38.740
magnetically you know there's a second

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:45.940
pod - rocks - what's chorus but I cannot

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:49.690
make it no then it goes I don't know why

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.409
that's pingu singing if you do you think

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.139
I'm sexy

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:54.159
I think it's do you think I'm sexy

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:57.909
probably my favorite song about

00:05:54.159 --> 00:06:01.650
intercourse by an octogenarian oh he was

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:04.020
only a septuagenarian when he wrote it

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.629
now

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.190
check our that's absurd is what I meant

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:11.330
to say but check our shop we have

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:15.000
kamikaze which is actually just terrible

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:17.400
unless we get pyromaniac or host head I

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.330
suppose but we're also guaranteed more

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.629
or less to get a deal with the devil

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:25.229
kamikaze takes your top heart like it

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:27.449
takes your uh it takes your spirit

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:28.979
r-right yeah it takes half a spear at

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:30.389
our foreplay it's actually not that bad

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:32.909
I thought it was a full spear at Harper

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:35.879
play it means that and this is like the

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:38.009
lamest most domestic use of you know an

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:41.370
item that allows you to make explosions

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:43.590
but it means that for free we can

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.419
probably blow or for a small cost we can

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.310
probably blow up tenth of Roxon get more

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:49.080
value than we otherwise would have

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.479
although we would never want to do this

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.789
unless we have zero bombs so it's kind

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:57.960
of a it's still a pretty bad pick up if

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:59.190
I'm being straight up with you now again

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:04.770
we're in kind of a weird spot here

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:07.110
because I really would like to take Halo

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:10.080
and I think I probably will regardless

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:13.680
but I don't really want to ruin our or

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.969
Babylon state so is halo I'm in this

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.719
weird position where I'm like I think

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:21.870
halo is worse than most people give it

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:23.789
credit for I think that's why I'm guilty

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.229
of this for a long time as well being

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:27.389
like oh it's and all stats upgrade it

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:30.210
can do no wrong and in many situations

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:32.750
that is a very I would say a productive

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.750
line of thinking

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:45.340
like highly not worth it but I think

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:48.010
we'll take it leo our damage is going to

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:51.070
be just god-awful but I think you still

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:52.600
take it because the tiers upgrade

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:56.199
doesn't go anywhere all we need to do is

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:58.720
find all we need to do is find one shop

00:07:56.199 --> 00:08:00.790
or sorry one arcade eventually and we

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.550
should be okay in that department I'm

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:04.960
also going to donate three cents hoping

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:07.300
to pick up maybe like a luck upgrade it

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:10.570
also jammed up our donation machines so

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:12.190
I mean that's what you get I suppose

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:15.760
yeah so our tears upgrade or speed

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:17.680
upgrade I mean it's it's a complicated

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.449
sentence for me to try to parse here but

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.820
essentially we made ourselves worse

00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:23.320
temporarily and every category except

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.840
for our rate of fire to make ourselves

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.789
better eventually in every category but

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.470
it is a little bit of a gamble I

00:08:27.789 --> 00:08:30.910
wouldn't said like a year ago I would

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:33.339
have taken Halo and just been like sick

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:37.300
it's halo I don't know why I said it

00:08:33.339 --> 00:08:41.979
like that but I said it like bear to be

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:44.290
talking about halo the video game bear

00:08:41.979 --> 00:08:47.260
is the slice of all of our personalities

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:48.970
by the way this is going to sound like a

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:51.130
little bit of a backhanded compliment I

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:53.260
actually don't mean it like that there

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:56.770
is like all of I mean this is genuine

00:08:53.260 --> 00:09:01.480
sincerity genuine as genuine sincerity

00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:03.700
because I've you know I've grown up I'm

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:05.410
not the most cynical person on round

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.330
table I might be like the second most

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:09.610
optimistic but I'm definitely not the

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:11.589
same young man who was reading you know

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:14.709
official PlayStation Magazine in the

00:09:11.589 --> 00:09:16.209
year 2001 and being like everything in

00:09:14.709 --> 00:09:19.120
this magazine is going to change the

00:09:16.209 --> 00:09:20.529
face of games forever you know I'm I'm a

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.690
little jaded that might be one of the

00:09:20.529 --> 00:09:23.980
more jaded members of roundtable all

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:25.990
admit because when I see marketing for

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.160
something that looks cool I'm like yeah

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:28.930
I mean if they can deliver on that

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.640
that's cool but they probably won't so

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:32.140
I'm not like I don't even have to

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.459
prevent myself from getting excited

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.830
about games for the most part I just

00:09:33.459 --> 00:09:37.480
like don't I just said just doesn't tap

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:39.370
into that excitement anymore I get

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:42.310
excited about cool systems in games that

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:44.020
I that I am playing like you know I did

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:46.180
that let's look at for antihero I had a

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:49.089
fun time playing antihero I thought that

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:50.250
game was thought that game was pretty

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:54.720
fun

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:59.190
I have a fun time playing players on on

00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:00.570
battlegrounds it's not that I not that I

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:02.490
dislike playing video games it's just

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:04.500
like you know stuff like III and like

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:06.990
advanced marketing has kind of lost its

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:10.740
luster but not so for the taffy of bear

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:12.420
he loves getting hype for games and you

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:14.360
know even even franchises that have

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:17.040
burned him you might look at that as a

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:19.740
little bit of naivete but I look at it

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:24.420
as clinging on to a you know a little

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:27.000
bit of optimism and an inner child that

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:28.590
to be honest I'm loathe to have lost for

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.270
myself it's turned me into the you know

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:33.090
rusted old curmudgeon you see in front

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:34.830
of you today which is good for

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:37.890
commentary purposes because I think it

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:40.620
leads to some uniqueness but I do miss

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:42.660
it and maybe I went out in the end by

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:44.010
feeling superior but I do miss a little

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.720
bit of that sense of excitement but in

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:48.030
the city I just I would be faking it if

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:50.280
I was like I can't wait for the new halo

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:52.950
did you see the new Cortana design it

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.640
looks amazing it's not a kind of guy I

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:56.280
am anymore

00:10:53.640 --> 00:11:00.330
oh dude potato peeler is like ideal

00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:04.080
right now so we actually should be

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:06.420
stacked here now if we're talking about

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:09.480
roundtable archetypes I'm the I'm the

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:12.900
pro-business guy you know everybody else

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.670
is like but there's no selling a 75 cent

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:17.370
t-shirt with the doom logo on it in

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.930
their game should they be you know run

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:24.140
out of business and I go well maybe a

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:26.460
little market should decide no I'm

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:30.080
admittedly dealing with caricatures of

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.080
my co-hosts at this point but

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:37.089
because I'm not a businessman I'm a

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:39.370
businessman so I have I'm sympathetic to

00:11:37.089 --> 00:11:42.550
business interests won't somebody think

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:45.399
of the businesses for once we should

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:47.440
probably first off stop this anti

00:11:45.399 --> 00:11:51.190
consumer line of reasoning secondly oh

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:54.930
there's no spirit hearts to be had so we

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:56.829
should be very very cautious here all I

00:11:54.930 --> 00:12:00.930
do like it

00:11:56.829 --> 00:12:03.779
potato peelers more interesting but

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:08.410
there's no but really to put after that

00:12:03.779 --> 00:12:10.899
Tammy's head is is better but it's also

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:15.010
much more commonly used a potato peeler

00:12:10.899 --> 00:12:16.480
has definitely more like uncertainty

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:18.430
associated with it which I think right

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:21.880
now is a good thing so let's just roll

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:24.070
with the potato peeler and hopefully on

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.779
the next floor we'll find yeah we have

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:28.269
no mom hopefully on the next floor we'll

00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:29.620
find some spirit hearts early otherwise

00:12:28.269 --> 00:12:31.360
we can find ourselves in a tight spot

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.620
but honestly this is kind of what I

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.019
needed right now is a run that's a

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:39.070
little bit on the difficult side but

00:12:35.019 --> 00:12:40.630
also quite dynamic I will say though one

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:43.260
spirit heart is like that's the most

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:45.579
dangerous lead in hockey you know

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:48.459
because you feel like you have the

00:12:45.579 --> 00:12:50.410
ability to survive a hit but probably

00:12:48.459 --> 00:12:52.420
like a third of the enemies or obstacles

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:54.160
in the game will actually hurt you for

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:58.839
one full red heart even before the womb

00:12:54.160 --> 00:13:00.160
so we certainly are going to very wary

00:12:58.839 --> 00:13:05.140
about the way that we're playing this

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:06.880
one because it's a little scary that's

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.709
mostly what I was concerned with right

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:12.220
there I don't know if it's possible to

00:13:08.709 --> 00:13:13.630
not take damage on that room would I

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.720
live you know obviously we're doing more

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:18.190
damage it shouldn't be a problem but

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:21.820
just stay cool you know stay it stay

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:24.000
loose stay slurpy that's what we say in

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.000
Canada

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:32.130
yeah slobs curse magic mush

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:34.590
you got a look yeah that's why you got a

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:37.050
look that's luck but also a good play to

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:39.210
be in that lucky position so I will

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:42.960
tolerate very little descent about you

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:45.390
know save saved you got a you got to

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:48.480
know when to bomb them know when to

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:50.730
2-under up on Sonoma know when to load

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:53.370
explode on Edward Hawthorne and know

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:56.430
when to stop Luton whoo-whoo you never

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:58.320
count your I don't know any other ultima

00:13:56.430 --> 00:14:00.840
online terms I only know the video that

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:03.540
damn Keys linking us to and I watch it

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:10.920
every time I see you Luton

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:12.570
I'm not Luton great work what back

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.280
that's all it took was like a couple of

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:15.480
spirit hearts that were up to no good

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:18.330
started making trouble in the

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:20.280
neighborhood no words actually like to

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:22.170
say that we're set is probably not fair

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.060
the words in a much much more

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:26.430
comfortable position now we can actually

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:29.880
get hit like at least three times as

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:31.830
opposed to possibly once so thank you

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:35.280
balls of steel and also that random

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:36.870
spirit heart and dude we've probably can

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.580
make boss rush happen here it's amazing

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:42.570
how quickly you can turn from one to the

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:44.700
other I don't know if I've ever seen if

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:46.440
I I'm normally pretty good at the run

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.000
time construction of metaphors and

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:52.500
analogies but I can't really think of an

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.510
example it's like the 2012 Los Angeles

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.490
Kings you know come oh that's so good

00:14:54.510 --> 00:15:00.270
coming out of the West Coast as an eight

00:14:56.490 --> 00:15:02.220
seed and then they go on to win the

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:03.780
Stanley Cup in dominant fashion you know

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:07.530
that doesn't happen very often it's a

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:08.880
rarity to be certain and I mean it just

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:11.190
got even better their magic mush is the

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.780
damage multiplier I don't think it's two

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:15.330
times damage multiplier I think it's

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:18.450
like 1.8 but I didn't see I just I'm

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:21.450
saying that based on recent anecdotal

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:23.400
reports of mine we have like you know

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:25.320
four damage then it goes up to like you

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.050
know 7.2 instead of going up to eight

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.860
but it's not like that matters too much

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:30.750
the whole scheme of things people

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:33.030
probably started by telling me it was a

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:35.110
1.8 damage multiplier and then they're

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:38.680
like this idiot is never going to listen

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:40.120
to us just say it's to and maybe like it

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:43.149
gives us an extra small chance he'll

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:45.850
catch on the secret route definitely

00:15:43.149 --> 00:15:47.019
will not be a secret room so yeah every

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:49.839
everything of this run ended up working

00:15:47.019 --> 00:15:53.860
out okay and it's amazing how quickly it

00:15:49.839 --> 00:15:55.870
popped back into place after basically

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:58.269
being on the brink of death like we also

00:15:55.870 --> 00:16:01.660
did not get a particularly easy room for

00:15:58.269 --> 00:16:04.149
that one room that we had zero wheels

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:06.010
closed or that we had zero tolerance for

00:16:04.149 --> 00:16:08.290
you know we had a room that was not

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:11.140
super tough but one that I would say is

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:14.190
also completely plausible that we could

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:14.190
have taken damage on it

00:16:14.519 --> 00:16:21.760
we have 12.01 damage extremely good we

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:23.320
do have a small bead on the gup-e dream

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.300
so I think you do want to peep this and

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:29.230
see if you get lucky one of these could

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:33.730
be balls of steel I've forgotten bad

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:36.010
strip lockup and it's fine we also got a

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:37.480
Lucky Penny in there so dude that ever

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:38.500
since we unlocked Lucky Penny that's

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:42.080
like a dream come true

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:45.539
oh sorry luck now

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.539
[Music]

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:51.439
yes ever what writing utensil did you

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:53.720
use in school this is becoming like a

00:16:51.439 --> 00:16:58.430
Dan plays with randoms battle Graham's

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:59.869
video which I would dude I'm not in the

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:02.119
interest of getting you guys to click

00:16:59.869 --> 00:17:03.499
away from my content but if you somehow

00:17:02.119 --> 00:17:05.120
find yourselves the void of

00:17:03.499 --> 00:17:08.419
entertainment to watch I cannot

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:10.220
recommend enough dang easily playing

00:17:08.419 --> 00:17:13.520
with random people in players on known

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:15.049
battlegrounds it's just a it's good

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:19.309
old-fashioned fun because you know the

00:17:15.049 --> 00:17:21.679
game exists and it is compelling to

00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:24.409
watch I think but more so it's Dan

00:17:21.679 --> 00:17:28.580
interviewing a stranger over the course

00:17:24.409 --> 00:17:30.289
of like 20 to 45 minutes like he did a

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:32.649
video and he was massive this guy called

00:17:30.289 --> 00:17:35.210
drew G who was like a young adult

00:17:32.649 --> 00:17:38.390
scholar while he wasn't I just reads a

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:40.610
lot I guess but he is from South Africa

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:42.559
originally and he and Dan had like this

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:44.870
conversation by conversation I mostly

00:17:42.559 --> 00:17:46.730
mean Dan asked him like one question and

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:48.020
then this guy talks for like ten minutes

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:50.299
he made himself out to be like a very

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:51.890
nice guy then at the end of the damn

00:17:50.299 --> 00:17:54.470
just grilling him the whole time and

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:58.279
then at the end of the video they die it

00:17:54.470 --> 00:18:00.350
spoilers and druggy is like hey you want

00:17:58.279 --> 00:18:01.850

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:12.080
meanwhile drew keys in the background

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:13.700
like in tears probably you just talk to

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:17.360

for like oh that's so good for like

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.950
almost an hour and then he just gets

00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:26.840
thrown away like you know yesterday's

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:28.730
garbage now that Dan's video is done I'm

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.890
not going to you know start a crowd

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:33.110
sourcing campaign or something but I

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:35.090
really wish Dan would at least friend

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:36.380
drew he drew he was also in the comments

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:38.630
for the video and he's like I don't mind

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:42.350
it was a fun video to be a part of seems

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:44.659
like an affable gentleman you should

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:48.100

00:18:44.659 --> 00:18:48.100
friend druggie

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:53.560
dude our damage is poppin off so I'm

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:54.820
going to give up on the idea of going to

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:58.960
boss Russian instead I'm going to go

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:59.950
straight for this five room just for

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.250
kicks

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:04.870
basically yeah I can't recommend that

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:09.730
enough that's that's high quality

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:12.540
content use in another video what was

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:15.700
this I'm trying to remember always like

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:18.250
duos with the biggest Mimar ever it's

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:23.170
just a dude keeps saying like can I get

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:24.700
a boneless Pizza over and over that one

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:27.100
you know I'm going to give that episode

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:31.480
like a seven the druggie episode is

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:33.130
actually like a nine though also

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:35.890
watching Dan played battlegrounds

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:37.690
explains so much about why our

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:39.520
battlegrounds before I'm not saying I'm

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:41.050
the best battlegrounds player you know

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:44.530
if you've been watching my video you

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:46.240
understand I'm uh I'm not crushing it in

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:49.420
that department either but some of the

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:52.000
dumb like dude like get into the final

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:54.160
circle all he has is a micro Z I didn't

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.870
even know was possible to not have two

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.070
guns by the time you got to the final

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:58.300
sorry it doesn't make sense to me

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:59.260
if you don't play battlegrounds you

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:03.940
probably like what is this guy talking

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:05.560
about just that's like making it you

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:10.600
know it's like playing a self sacrifice

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:12.670
room to get to the like the lam floor

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:16.780
well you have four damaged it's just

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:19.630
it's a bad idea so I'm going to be a

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:21.130
little balls here and keep this and dude

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:24.550
curse of the towers been showing up like

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:28.360
non-stop like is this an Indian

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:33.180
restaurant because for starters the non

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:40.680
don't stop all right feast

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:45.270
marry kill naan bread roti I can't think

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:50.059
of a third Indian or South Asian flat

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:54.140
bread pita I mean it's not really

00:20:50.059 --> 00:20:57.030
pitas not really South Asian or Indian

00:20:54.140 --> 00:21:00.510
obviously but I got to be honest I know

00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:03.540
people that are extremely pro roti

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:05.309
I do like it don't get me wrong if I

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:07.470
order some Indian food in there like we

00:21:05.309 --> 00:21:16.050
don't have none is rody okay I'm like ow

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:19.230

wrong I've got a nice hardiness to it

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:35.250
nice nice firmness it's got a good what

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:37.920
are they saying in the bread industry

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:41.190
it's a good crumb got a great crumb into

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:42.600
it I don't know if that's what they say

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:45.630
in the bread industry I was just taking

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:48.150
a guess it's like when you have a scotch

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:49.710
you kind of run it along the glass you

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:51.270
ever you ever see like a scotch

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:53.580
enthusiast in a movie do that

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:58.290
they roll the Scotch back and forth in

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:59.850
the glass and then they see how it

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:01.890
sticks to the side of the glass and no

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:05.309
matter what happens you go mmm

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:08.340
nice legs that's that step one if you

00:22:05.309 --> 00:22:09.540
want to be like a scotch enthusiast I'm

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.860
telling you straight up I'm giving you

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:13.590
the keys of the kingdom I'm not a scotch

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:17.040
enthusiast myself but I lived with a guy

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:18.720
who was he didn't tell me this I just

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.340
picked up on it you can violate these

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.390
like a look at a nice Scotch here I did

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.010
take it just because I don't think we've

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:26.520
handed yet even if we have we're still

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:29.370
safe but um you get like a nice scotch

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:33.630
and they be like ooh nice legs get like

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:35.910
a $1 $1 Scotch that's ridicul Eyck $1

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:39.740
per ounce scotch roll it around in the

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:39.740
glass let's go some nice legs to it

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:50.560
again like if you're approaching

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:53.320
adulthood I'll give you the secret if

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:57.220
you if you ever want to order wine at a

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:59.260
restaurant but you want to feel like

00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:00.640
fancier you want to like impress

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:06.630
somebody despite not having the

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:09.250
knowledge to do so you just when the

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:10.960
server comes by and is like can I get

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:12.280
you something to drink you go we're

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.590
looking for a bottle of wine what would

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:16.930
you recommend and then they'll give you

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:18.160
something and then just order the

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:20.130
cheapest thing on the menu anyway

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:23.380
because it at least makes it look like

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:25.480
you weren't gonna do it in advance and

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:26.980
then it makes it look like you got a

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:29.050
good eye for bargains because you're

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:31.030
like um take taking your opinion under

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:33.250
advisement but don't actually do that it

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:38.590
makes you you just wasting their time

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:40.780
but anyway whenever you whenever you

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:42.970
order a beer go um yeah we're still

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:45.400
gonna get in the ex but you know what

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:46.780
the IBU on that is and you know

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:49.000
depending on where you are they might be

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:51.040
like yeah or they might be like I have

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.740
no idea you all that's okay I'll just

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:56.230
take it anyway what is this is mr.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:58.570
musics right yeah like might be the best

00:23:56.230 --> 00:24:00.250
item in the game but also I sorta ate it

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:03.460
but it can steal items for us so let's

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:05.170
give it a try these are these are things

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:06.910
by the way I would never suggest that

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:09.670
you actually do because it's going to

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:12.880
take you I mean the servers are going to

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:14.320
hate you it's not really their job to

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.050
like you but you should be nice to them

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.580
and that's wasting their time you know

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:23.740
they got a lot of tables mister that's

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:24.970
all I'm trying to say okay I'm just

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.860
giving you I'm giving you the secret

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:28.000
what you should not do no no we don't

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:30.070
want that we don't want that just wait

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.750
it out is do what Michael al Fox used to

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:36.010
do and be like you know a what do you

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:38.230
have what do you recommend oh I like to

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:40.330
drink a gallon of fruit punch with a

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:42.820
single eyedropper full of red wine

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:45.330
inserted into it oh yeah I mean I'll

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.330
take that

00:24:48.049 --> 00:24:54.149
I've told the story before but went to

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.950
McDonald's with him one time

00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:58.500
the simplest place to order food of all

00:24:55.950 --> 00:25:02.399
time trying to be a smart guy goes up

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:03.389
the counter what do you like to get here

00:25:02.399 --> 00:25:04.740
and she's like I'd like to get for

00:25:03.389 --> 00:25:08.460
Chicken McNuggets from the happy meal

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:10.110
and a Tuscan chicken snack Ram I can

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:12.559
guarantee you that is not what that man

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:16.769
wanted to eat he wanted her to say like

00:25:12.559 --> 00:25:19.649
quarter pounder with cheese instead she

00:25:16.769 --> 00:25:23.279
gave him this weird you know secret menu

00:25:19.649 --> 00:25:27.090
hack that not enough food for you know

00:25:23.279 --> 00:25:32.429
after a night drinking some high ivu

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:33.750
beers all you can do is laugh that's

00:25:32.429 --> 00:25:37.679
what happens when you put on airs I

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:40.830
guess I'm I mean I keep doing it to

00:25:37.679 --> 00:25:45.649
myself here still a little scared about

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:48.029
this situation though we're not in a

00:25:45.649 --> 00:25:49.769
beautiful spot when it comes to our HP

00:25:48.029 --> 00:25:51.419
and we do have to beat the cathedral

00:25:49.769 --> 00:25:55.950
it's not hard to beat the cathedral

00:25:51.419 --> 00:25:59.220
necessarily but I'd prefer to not have

00:25:55.950 --> 00:26:01.649
to do it on one HP so let's see if we

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:05.779
can if we can make that dream of reality

00:26:01.649 --> 00:26:05.779
red mom easy mom

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:12.049
and also sailors the light we can

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.610
actually get permanent polaroid

00:26:12.049 --> 00:26:15.500
invincibility now wait don't we have the

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:18.890
chest unlocked now we went down to the

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:20.870
chest on a recent run at least so I

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:21.980
think we might have the chest unlocked I

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.990
don't know why I'm holding the fool card

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.880
by the way I guess you know even in my

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:27.679
in my head I looked at my damage and was

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:30.890
like 15 damaged six rate of fire how

00:26:27.679 --> 00:26:36.140
could we miss boss rush well we went a

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:39.020
little slowly and we also I hate this

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:40.429
you know what that's a perfect I was not

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:42.559
confident that we wouldn't get hit there

00:26:40.429 --> 00:26:50.600
we went a little slowly and we also did

00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:52.880
the depths one twice so my favorite zany

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:57.950
actor Johnny Depp's won twice

00:26:52.880 --> 00:27:00.289
he's uh he's from Bavaria isn't the

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:07.070
German know he's a Germany's Bavarian

00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:08.390
you Philistine is any French no he's

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:14.779
from the South of France

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:16.010
it's completely different there's a bit

00:27:14.779 --> 00:27:18.409
in there but I don't think the bit has

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:19.730
any legs if you know what I mean you

00:27:18.409 --> 00:27:21.470
know at least I saved it with an

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:24.049
accidental call back to the Scotch snob

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:31.309
a character that will absolutely never

00:27:24.049 --> 00:27:32.690
take off syringe no serving you know to

00:27:31.309 --> 00:27:35.210
me you should avenge

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:36.770
sue really I know what 1% of you out

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:39.049
there are thinking and now was that a

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:40.490
reference to yen's like Mints 2007 Alvin

00:27:39.049 --> 00:27:44.570
night falls over quarter dolla

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:46.789
you got it buster I'm here to make the

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:49.700
most accessible references of all time

00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:54.890
you could say I'm here to mmm get her

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:57.409
done no that's illegal what you've done

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:58.429
to me there I'm also I'm just going to

00:27:57.409 --> 00:28:01.520
be straight with you I'm a little cheese

00:27:58.429 --> 00:28:03.169
because we've been playing real well

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.909
there's a tinted rock on this room

00:28:03.169 --> 00:28:08.440
you've been playing real well for a

00:28:04.909 --> 00:28:11.710
couple of floors now but devoid of any

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.710
tackling fuel

00:28:13.179 --> 00:28:17.540
all right we're going to finish this

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:19.429
floor that might be a second secret room

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:24.280
good deal with the devil chance and we

00:28:19.429 --> 00:28:26.870
can use mr. meeseeks to steal an item

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:30.590
speed downs not bad balls of steel is

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:31.250
beautiful for up to six lakh and X lakhs

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:36.620
is meaningless

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:38.420
okay mister me six I think is like awful

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:40.340
from a damage-dealing perspective so I'm

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:42.940
only I'm saving it to get free deal with

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:45.800
the devil items like a reusable kind of

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:47.840
credit card I guess you can also steal

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:50.860
sharp items that suppose which we maybe

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:54.530
should have done on the Depp's too but

00:28:50.860 --> 00:29:00.470
we've passed that train up a long time

00:28:54.530 --> 00:29:02.030
ago I feel like we've had a lot of runs

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:04.130
lately where it just seems like the

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:07.520
spirit hearts have been a little dry

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:09.559
and that could be operator error you

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:14.059
know just not finding them even though

00:29:09.559 --> 00:29:16.130
they exist and it could be part of a

00:29:14.059 --> 00:29:20.900
larger conspiracy to exclusively impact

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:27.740
my game in my game alone wake up sheeple

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:29.090
of course bunny battery time and we

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:30.650
could use our battery charges to

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:36.080
actually use mr. musics for the first

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:38.990
time ever I would like to do hush

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:41.600
honestly we've within like the last five

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:47.350
minutes we've completely changed the

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:53.000
candor of this run is that a real word

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:54.080
the tri-state Tambor Canberra might be

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.650
real it's like something you do with

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:59.360
like a a machine that articulates

00:29:57.650 --> 00:30:01.610
we're not even going to get to use mr.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:03.200
matrix dude the thing is we don't have

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:05.500
enough HP to do the Haj fight if we got

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:08.120
a lot of HP somehow and consider it but

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:12.110
right now it just doesn't make any darn

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:13.610
sense for us to pursue that sadly we

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:15.770
have given away a little bit of HP that

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:17.390
we probably shouldn't have but that's

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:19.010
half the fun isak you know if you can't

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:23.419
make some bad decisions and Isaac after

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:26.620
you know a million hours of the game got

00:30:23.419 --> 00:30:29.450
to take a long hard look in the mirror

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:31.850
by the mirror I mean my button now

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:33.710
that's you're taking advantage of the

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:36.020
sanctity of the joka definitely thank

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:44.270
you very much I appreciate the spirit

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:47.270
hard and I appreciate the other spirit

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:51.289
heart in advance we really have only

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:54.440
been a hit like twice since the depths

00:30:51.289 --> 00:30:56.570
to persisted since maybe the Deaf swan

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:58.309
now that I think about it but still it

00:30:56.570 --> 00:31:01.730
got to be a little bit vigilant we're

00:30:58.309 --> 00:31:03.289
not rolling in HP what did we get that

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:08.720
allowed us to break the tier cat by the

00:31:03.289 --> 00:31:10.039
way screw yeah you learn something new

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.809
every day that you then proceeded to

00:31:10.039 --> 00:31:14.179
forget because you do like you know nine

00:31:11.809 --> 00:31:15.529
Isaac episodes today and none of the

00:31:14.179 --> 00:31:16.880
information can actually stay in your

00:31:15.529 --> 00:31:18.649
brain because you never given yourself a

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.419
chances you know keep the information

00:31:18.649 --> 00:31:22.990
there you'd like to categorize the

00:31:20.419 --> 00:31:22.990
information

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:29.269
they actually store it properly you just

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:38.840
thrown it in a haphazard pile makes it

00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:41.240
harder to retrieve later okay so this is

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:42.919
one thing on lock press here let's make

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:47.360
a guess I like playing this game what do

00:31:42.919 --> 00:31:49.549
you get when you beat the Cathedral as

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:51.500
Eve I am going to say that you unlock

00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:52.700
the razor blade because it's very much

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:56.120
in keeping with Eve's

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:57.700
style of gameplay which is that you hurt

00:31:56.120 --> 00:32:00.200
yourself to the hurt enemy's

00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:01.850
disproportionate more just unfortunately

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:05.100
more than you hurt yourself so I'm going

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:08.440
to assume that this is the razor blade

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:12.549
[Music]

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:21.289
it's nothing apparently at least not yet

00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:24.590
uh hear me out here okay that actually

00:32:21.289 --> 00:32:29.659
completely worked uh we have so much

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:31.970
luck we should go like do rooms I should

00:32:29.659 --> 00:32:34.429
fight mega Satan dude knocking out mega

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:38.509
Satan is like one of the most finicky

00:32:34.429 --> 00:32:40.159
things that you could ever do as any of

00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:42.860
these characters it's not necessarily a

00:32:40.159 --> 00:32:44.649
hard but it's better to do it as soon as

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:47.059
you get the chance I think rather than

00:32:44.649 --> 00:32:48.860
you know trying to create the perfect

00:32:47.059 --> 00:32:51.470
run to do it which normally requires

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:52.850
angel statues and Angel statues are like

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:56.710
the part of the farthest thing from a

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:56.710
guarantee in this whole freaking game so

00:32:57.159 --> 00:33:02.059
we can just knock it out on this one

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:05.649
that would be perfect but I would like

00:33:02.059 --> 00:33:05.649
to see a little bit more HP first

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:11.380
[Music]

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:14.380
the bombs aren't really worth anything I

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:15.940
mean neither is a you know mr. musics in

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:17.350
this situation I don't know we may we

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.010
can drop them on mega Satan and I'll do

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:20.320
some damage

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:24.490
how do you have six luck do six rooms

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:26.080
and not get any items out of it we also

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:29.950
have contract from below so I'm looking

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:31.690
for like doubled items this is the whole

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:32.620
point of having six luck at this point

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:35.710
it's not like it gives us a better

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:37.480
chance of you know dodge bullets but

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:40.540
when we're ready it means that we won't

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:41.920
have to that's the more I was going to

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:43.420
say the Prometheus promise what I'm

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:45.910
trying to say the Morpheus promise but

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:47.830
my brain is not letting me get the words

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:50.140
out because it's literally something

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:52.150
that sounds like the bad guys planned

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:55.240
from a Mission Impossible movie

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:56.950
it's the Morpheus promise and you're

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:58.540
like what's the Morpheus promise did you

00:33:56.950 --> 00:34:01.810
find out an hour and a half into the

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:03.430
movie that it's actually like the

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:09.760
Morpheus promise is actually like a

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:11.290
biological weapon turns you into that

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:15.060
sweaty Laurence Fishburne from the

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:15.060
interrogation scene in the matrix one

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:22.030
nobody wants to be sweaty Laurence

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:24.610
Fishburne are you actually kidding me

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:26.380
because we've done like almost a

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:29.140
probably at this point half the floor

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:33.820
I'm not asking for the world I'm just

00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:35.200
asking for you know a single payout here

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:37.630
which would actually be a double payout

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.800
but that's not my fault I picked up the

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:41.220
item earlier and now I'm looking to

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.220
collect

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:48.650
I wonder if we kill blue baby but don't

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:51.620
get in the chest do we get the blue baby

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:53.390
unlock as well because if that's the

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:55.280
case we have a fairly obvious course of

00:34:53.390 --> 00:35:01.910
action to knock out as much as we can on

00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:03.140
this very run don't jump don't jump

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:06.980
don't you we're good

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:09.230
Oh finally yeah we have fat odd mushroom

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:10.730
and a guppy transformations the Gumby

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:12.650
transformation changes everything

00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:14.780
sad odd mushroom is kind of a tough call

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:16.850
because it does give us damage it

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:20.690
doesn't ruin a Whore of Babylon the

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:22.730
damage is small and we're going to lose

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:24.770
permanent polaroid invincibility either

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:29.300
way I can't complain anymore because six

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:31.820
locks just got us Guffey so we'll start

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:38.120
by finding blue baby which is right here

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:40.840
good card please acceptable card yeah

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.840
yeah that's fine

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:45.740
this might be the biggest blue baby

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.450
stomp you've ever had in fact it might

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:49.670
be like the first blue baby kill we've

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:51.170
ever had on this run and I guess with

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:51.680
five hearts we're just going to give it

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:53.570
a shot

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:56.240
this is actually like a really really

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:58.190
accomplished run I'm quite happy with it

00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:01.760
let's just do like our last few rooms

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:06.760
here first we're killing everything very

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:09.230
very quickly good random roll dude so

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:13.880
not we actually can't use the

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:15.770
forget-me-now at suck because we use the

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.310
forget-me-now it'll spawn us on a new

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:21.490
floor

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:21.490
we'll lose mr. musics Oh No

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:29.359
and then we won't be able to get back in

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:31.300
the mega satan door nice at this point

00:36:29.359 --> 00:36:35.000
we got to go for it

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:36.200
excuse me well it's a good indication of

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.440
how strong we are if we get through this

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:42.619
without getting hit which it looks like

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:43.910
we will so we did all that

00:36:42.619 --> 00:36:45.859
oh shoot the whoop is actually totally

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:48.530
fine for a boss fight and a prayer card

00:36:45.859 --> 00:36:49.070
gives us one extra hit so maybe I'm okay

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:55.100
with that

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:56.450
and our final room nice all right

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:57.680
well it's going to make it a little

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:58.700
others one more room light but whatever

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.390
is going to make it a little tougher but

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:01.310
that's okay

00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:02.810
I think we just ripped a loop when we

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:06.800
get to that wave that's like the four

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:08.780
mini bosses all we should have killed

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.920
salmon last but honestly with the amount

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:12.710
of damage we're doing by the time I

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:14.480
realized I'm shooting at the less

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:17.690
efficient enemy it's already too late

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:19.130
like they died so quickly that we

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:23.690
especially with the Flies we can't

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:27.670
really turn it around on them so you

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:29.810
should be done yeah that was really good

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:31.850
angel stance you shouldn't even get a

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:37.130
chance to basically exist before they

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:39.470
die and with shielded tears I'm not

00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:42.770
really concerned here it's for just 35

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:44.510
minute run that is taking out so many

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:47.420
different things on the on the eve

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:49.609
checklist here Cathedral mega satan

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:51.800
possibly blue baby as well definitely

00:37:49.609 --> 00:37:53.119
mega saving though and once you kill

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.960
mega satan you get the ending so it's

00:37:53.119 --> 00:37:56.270
not like you could have forgetten

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:58.730
forgotten me now at this oh no wait we

00:37:56.270 --> 00:38:01.190
totally could have do it you have to you

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:03.230
actually have to I'm not even salty

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:04.760
about going to the sack knife has

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:07.609
appeared in the basement dead boy

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:11.420
achieved okay a new pill has appeared

00:38:07.609 --> 00:38:15.050
little babies appeared I'm not salty in

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:16.970
the least about this because we have to

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:18.530
knock it out so we did ruin permanent

00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:19.850
polaroid invincibility but in my defense

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:22.580
I thought that was going to be the final

00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:25.119
floor so and we have exactly the right

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:31.130
item for

00:38:25.119 --> 00:38:33.500
for this floor as well obviously we're

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:36.470
looking to quite delirium laughs and a

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:38.480
level with you I think we're not

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:41.800
guaranteed we're got me that's right

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:44.810
we're not guaranteed to be delirium

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:47.839
we're low on HP this could be delirium -

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:48.680
okay we got lucky we're not guaranteed

00:38:47.839 --> 00:38:51.050
to beat him

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:54.830
we need more HP he's extremely tanky

00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:55.849
that's fun I think so I like it another

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:59.119
pill balls steel

00:38:55.849 --> 00:39:00.970
I'm drowsy gray pill for the hush if we

00:38:59.119 --> 00:39:03.109
can nerve for delirium if we can

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:07.369
guarantee that pill for delirium that

00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:09.560
raises our odds greatly but I'm not

00:39:07.369 --> 00:39:12.670
going to walk in there with a random

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:15.980
pill and then use it on delirium because

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:18.230
I'm excited would be like a nightmare I

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:20.900
don't think it's attempted rock but we

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:22.970
got a look I was just kind of obscured

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:24.500
so it's hard to tell just kind of

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:28.070
obscured you know you probably haven't

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:34.670
seen it we have already had magic mush

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:39.220
infested is fine blind rage blind rage

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:39.220
is probably a good take right here

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:48.770
what's that bonus we get for that it's

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:51.369
actually a real minor right now but we

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:51.369
don't need

00:39:52.060 --> 00:40:01.410
and we don't all need and dance always

00:39:56.470 --> 00:40:06.970
let's go okay we don't it all need

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:08.800
liberty camps so I think that this is

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:10.660
actually going to be completely ok we'll

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:12.340
just try to finish with the shoopdawhoop

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:16.210
but I mean we don't even have to finish

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:19.420
with this we could just hold on to our

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:24.040
full charge and be fine it's a like

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:29.260
really heavy wave right here he's

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:31.630
already like 70% dead I'm not quite 70%

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:33.160
then maybe like 40% so it looks like

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:35.260
we're probably going to come away with W

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:38.290
year this is a really really really

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:41.110
strong run we checked off like every

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:45.400
posted node that we were missing didn't

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:47.470
take a lot of dumb damage and really

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.670
like a dream run we now have so much

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:49.690
each stuff here that we never have to

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:51.820
worry about again so we'll be back

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:52.960
tomorrow with us Anna basil green mode

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:54.000
run just letting you know if you want to

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.990
skip that one

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.970
apart from that thanks for watching

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:59.470
we'll try to make it fun as we give

00:40:57.970 --> 00:41:01.510
ourselves the chance to unlock loath for

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:04.320
now thanks for watching and uh let's

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:05.940
take a look at this post-it note dude

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:10.350
look at that

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:10.350
either way I'll see you next time
