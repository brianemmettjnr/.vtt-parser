00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.750
everybody welcome Eckener the line

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.810
please binding once again three plus we

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.510
did beats the cathedral as blue baby

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.150
which has granted us the d6

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.889
as Isaac and I think access to the chest

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.320
as well so I'm actually just going to do

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.150
an Isaac run because we have the d6

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.150
finally I can't believe this is like

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:29.179
well it's first f9d v CB c PG 8 I want

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:33.510
to say C GP because of CGP grey da e

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:35.579
Lynyrd oh did the daylight savings time

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.079
I don't like it I actually the first not

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.770
I'm not trying to insult

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.969
CGP grey I love his videos it would be a

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.260
lie to say I watched them all the time

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.300
and I don't watch anybody's YouTube

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.600
videos all the time except I watch good

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.940
mythical morning when it's on which is

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.949
lately like twice a week unfortunately

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.270
but and it's like on hiatus for the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.170
summer but I watch it with my wife while

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.550
I eat dinner because we're a nice

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.829
wholesome couple and we love good

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.480
old-fashioned family fun like dudes

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.520
eaten a bunch of you know jellyfish

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.080
hearts and never say in the F word but

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.189
do it also with the gross stuff I love

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.010
that show I'm not even being sarcastic

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:13.770
I'm not being sarcastic yeah that's

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.760
right I'm not being sorry I'm just

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.060
trying to say it in the most sarcastic

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.119
way possible he's like take 40 but when

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.060
I see them I'm not disappointed in them

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.159
I'm like yeah is a good time and I do

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.110
hate daylight savings day it's the worst

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.409
man I understand its historical

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.329
relevancy but I also hate it especially

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.650
because the last daylight savings fell

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:40.829
at PAX so you've go to bed at like 3

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.030
a.m. and 3 a.m. is actually 2 a.m. and

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.280
then when you wake up you're like why am

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.369
I so tired oh because I only had 16

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.990
milliseconds of sleep I can't believe we

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.000
dodged that I stood in like exactly the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.000
wrong spot I mean it barely was exactly

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.640
the right spot but in theory should has

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.479
gotten in the bottom corner he just

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.920
slammed give me a Vegemite sandwich and

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.940
he says

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.650
okay we got a Cuba meet I like it could

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.970
have rear old it as maybe should a rear

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.009
old it because I haven't had the best

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.300
track record with Cuba me lately I'm

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.040
going to be Honus with you I do not have

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.470
any bombs and I hate this room right now

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.320
mini monstro by the way is like my pick

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.450
if I was ever to do like a top-10 most

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.120
underrated items in the binding of issac

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.700
this is up there i straight-up think

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.260
that mini I don't think mini monstro is

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.090
hated to be honest at this point in my

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:43.010
eyes a career I mostly agree with the

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:43.010
community pardon me on item choices like

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:51.570
I've come to agree curse I is bad I'm

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.850
trying to think of what like my most

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.200
divisive item choices some people are

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.790
probably gonna say like guillotine I

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.500
think most people agree the guillotine

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.000
is like a double-edged sword I think

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.820
most people agree that Isaac's heart is

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.459
garbage maybe soymilk I still stand by

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.200
the idea that soy milk usually is better

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.030
than people think it is Lao skill

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.079
probably being the bed pickup but

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.700
mini-monster I just never hear people

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.799
talking about I never you know go to the

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.590
forums see people go mini monster I love

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:23.190
this sytem we should reroll and then is

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.380
the ideas with one more bomb we can get

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.900
that item that was such a terrible dodge

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.959
I don't really care about getting so

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.060
good but I keep I can't get rid of the

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.890
d6 that we just got to go with telepathy

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.630
even though I love telepathy and in a

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.370
weird way telepathy is like a much rarer

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.600
item because we've been using the d6

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.489
since the you know the day we were born

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.489
in this freaking game more or less

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.090
yeah I never year people singing the

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.300
praises of mini-monster I think it's

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.490
like not quite as good as little

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.980
brimstone but I don't think it's out of

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.060
the conversation a little brimstone has

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.319
some obvious advantages because

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.420
brimstone is really good you know

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:04.970
brimstone has brimstone has all sorts of

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.980
crazy advantages decent damage infinite

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.440
range and Pierson's the mini monstro

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.750
charges quickly does a lot of damage and

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.489
fires a lot of shots so it doesn't have

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.620
piercing shots but what I'm getting at

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:19.459
is if even you know some of the shots

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.600
hits some of the other shots are

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.820
probably going to go all the way to get

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.060
to other enemies so you will pick up

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.440
this battery charge and go back and try

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.440
to get a reroll on the item room

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.940
unfortunately to lab at the lovely but

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.220
not for today's run Clarice Aquarius is

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.650
like the definition of a 3 out of 10

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.270
item it's got its uses and if you're

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.580
damaged never gets good Aquarius is a

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:51.100
nice little defensive augmentation to

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:54.500
have I wouldn't deny that come on but

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:58.700
not my ideal choice if I have a reroll

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.979
available that's for darn sure so we've

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.600
done it that's a little example of the

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.700
power of mini monstro right there so I'm

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.760
going to save our d6 and try to use it

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.630
on the deal with the devil if the deal

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.280
with the devil stinks

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.870
even if it doesn't stink we have a full

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.500
d6 charge with that we can then go back

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.030
and use on Aquarius and I think we're

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.169
set up pretty nicely to have a good shot

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.789
on this run although I would like to

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:24.650
have some more consumables doing magic

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:26.419
mush is lovely our deal with the devil

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.820
is garbage but it sets us up for some

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.620
angel deals shenanigans we're going to

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.870
take this damage is going to go to like

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.970
it's not quite a doubling of damage I

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.360
always like shorthand consider it a

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.960
doubling but it's not a doubling on that

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.960
double

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.330
we'll go back in here snag a little

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.409
reroll action and see what we can pick

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.000
up ooh

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:51.870
what are you sit in my lap we will talk

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.770
about Boober hops up I don't know before

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.030
it's pretty good

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.919
that may be an item I disagree with

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.590
people on but for a long time I thought

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:01.800
before it was bad and and honestly

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:07.949
that's just stupid and before is a

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:10.020
lovely item and it might I think it

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:11.490
might be slightly overrated but I got to

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.110
admit this is like my least favorite

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.210
kind of issac commentary it's useful for

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.440
a segue but I'd like the Isaac videos

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.759
where I go off on tangents as well I

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.199
don't like the Isaac videos where I talk

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:20.879
about you know the relative quality of

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:23.639
items we've discussed you know 70 times

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:26.190
before I'm screen about Isaac Isaac is

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:28.879
totally unique it's a game that I've

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:31.680
again I've been losing a lot but I've

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:33.750
mastered it to the point that I can play

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.120
it I could do a whole Isaac episode

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.590
without ever actually consciously

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.259
processing what's happening on the

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.949
screen and some of those have happened

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:44.940
judging from the commentary it's

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:46.409
completely unique I've never had a game

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.050
like that before where I can I could

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:50.699
talk for like 40 minutes about random

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.759
stuff that is completely unrelated to

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:54.960
the game while playing the game that's

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:56.789
what makes it so cool that's why I think

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.440
it's such like a unique thing not just

00:06:56.789 --> 00:07:00.629
for me but kind of like on YouTube to

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:03.839
begin with although hilariously what I

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:07.020
think it's most similar to is like 2011

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:08.159
Eric Call of Duty videos where people

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.810
would be like what stop it's you boy

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:11.339
just giving you a quick update video by

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.729
the way here's like a 50 kill streak on

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:16.500
Nuketown another type of content I will

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:19.849
not disparage but have not really

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.849
watched very much of as you might expect

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:25.080
it's funny to think of how YouTube has

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.669
changed because like and this is not

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.069
really getting sentimental but back then

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:31.589
it really was like minecraft ik call of

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:33.089
duty call of duty zombies everyone is

00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:34.770
even at the time they're very cynical

00:07:33.089 --> 00:07:38.819
about it YouTube has changed a lot man

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:42.930
like that most of the gaming channels

00:07:38.819 --> 00:07:44.339
don't just do gaming stuff anymore you

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:47.940
know a lot of the especially the huge

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:50.370
ones also do like you know variety

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:52.770
videos they'll do like skits or you know

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:54.520
reaction videos and stuff like that tech

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:57.140
mutant spider mine

00:07:54.520 --> 00:08:00.010
again my prospective mutant spider

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:02.360
pretty good

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:04.220
triple shots not that good but I'll

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:07.540
still take it to get the achievement

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.540
checked off the list

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:12.830
not that that scent I like that's not

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:14.360
even that much recent of an evolution I

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:19.040
guess because like when I was in college

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:21.590
there were reaction videos like you know

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.980
grandma reacts to two girls one cup and

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:29.180
it's just an old lady going like yeah

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:30.890
we've strayed so far from God's life I

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.750
guess it's like a little bit more

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.400
popular now I mean you know what is big

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:36.110
now and it's been big for a year to say

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.640
what do you mean now this has been big

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:39.890
for like four years you don't understand

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:42.200
it's a 28 year old the last four years

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:45.530
is now as far as I'm concerned now is a

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:50.000
period that exists from 2015 to 2020 for

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:52.460
me is like challenge videos like to try

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.050
not to laugh challenge I actually and

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.690
I'm not trying to disparage this content

00:08:54.050 --> 00:09:00.710
either whatever it whatever you like to

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:02.240
watch you like to watch right yeah we

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.500
blew that one pretty hard whatever you

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.060
like to watch you like to watch and I'm

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:07.700
not going to you know crap on anybody

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.980
for it however I don't understand things

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:12.950
like to try not to laugh challenge

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:15.050
because I it's the easiest thing in the

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:17.150
world for me to not laugh all I have to

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:19.430
do is watch Amathus games okay no okay I

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:21.920
wasn't going to go there but it looked

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:23.870
convenient in the moment I feel bad

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.220
because man he's been on vacation so

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.540
I've been firing all these shots and

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.970
there's no opportunity for him to fire

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:30.770
back on Twitter you know he's been

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:33.080
unplugged from the internet playing some

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:38.600
handsome poker he hasn't actually been

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:40.010
playing poker anyway nothing I think we

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.300
should open the chest to try to get

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:44.190
enough money to get an arcade on the

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:46.980
next floor but

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:51.329
like they try not to laugh challenge or

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:53.160
you laugh you lose I love to laugh haha

00:09:51.329 --> 00:09:53.670
look I just did it right there I laugh

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.699
all the time

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:58.440
I'm not humorless I'm actually like I've

00:09:56.699 --> 00:10:00.569
been self-conscious that many times in

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.649
my life is I think I laugh more than the

00:10:00.569 --> 00:10:03.240
average person does

00:10:01.649 --> 00:10:04.949
it's not because I'm seeking their

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:11.129
approval because they just find things

00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:12.959
funny but then like I can also turn off

00:10:11.129 --> 00:10:15.180
the laugh muscle extremely easily

00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:16.529
especially if it's like a 15-second vine

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:22.259
or something like that it's got no setup

00:10:16.529 --> 00:10:24.120
got no soul Jerry by the way a 15-second

00:10:22.259 --> 00:10:26.730
vine it's kind of a joke among the of

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.850
itself as opposed can't have a 15-second

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:31.199
vine is good the idea though

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:33.689
now the cinnamon challenge I think I

00:10:31.199 --> 00:10:35.430
would lose that or like I would spit

00:10:33.689 --> 00:10:36.209
cinnamon out of my nose and they you

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:38.100
know it's just not for me

00:10:36.209 --> 00:10:39.629
ice bucket challenge was a cool thing

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:42.839
and did it for charity it's very awkward

00:10:39.629 --> 00:10:44.189
I was a little awkward I did the ice

00:10:42.839 --> 00:10:45.180
bucket challenge thing because I was

00:10:44.189 --> 00:10:46.529
challenged and as soon as you're

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:49.079
challenged you either get to do it or

00:10:46.529 --> 00:10:50.910
you become a bad guy you know you don't

00:10:49.079 --> 00:10:55.170
take a stand for something that costs

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:57.509
you almost no time and is for charity

00:10:55.170 --> 00:11:00.899
anyway right so I donated some money to

00:10:57.509 --> 00:11:02.880
the ALS research Society or whatever it

00:11:00.899 --> 00:11:06.240
was an als related cause I recall and

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.740
then don't teleport me like that I did

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.839
the ice bucket challenge video and I

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:12.569
went to a media event like literally the

00:11:09.839 --> 00:11:14.220
next day and I flew out there and we

00:11:12.569 --> 00:11:15.509
were having dinner and people are like

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:18.149
so what about his ice bucket challenge

00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:19.439
stuff and everyone at the table except

00:11:18.149 --> 00:11:21.389
for one person who was being silent

00:11:19.439 --> 00:11:23.069
which was me was like yeah it's stupid

00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:27.700
it's like a meme and I hate it and I was

00:11:23.069 --> 00:11:30.890
like I just did it like a week ago

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:35.330
so or not a week here like a day ago it

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:36.410
was it was mildly uncomfortable letting

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.790
you know and just not like I held the

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.890
grudge against them I can understand why

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:41.240
you feel that same way I always think

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:43.190
like the ice bucket challenge is like

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:47.450
sure maybe it's just like a it's a bad

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:49.130
mean oh dunk like 20 ice cubes on your

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:52.730
head in a bathtub with some water and

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:54.620
then be like I challenge you but you

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:56.420
know it was for a good cause so I look

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:59.300
back on it it's a little ridiculous but

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:01.580
mostly like not even just a victimless

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:03.140
crime like the opposite like it not only

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:08.150
did it not have any victims and help

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:10.280
victims hopefully oh you know what there

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:14.360
are two bombs back there it's like damn

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:15.800
Daniel for a cause it's like if the they

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.240
catch me outside how about that girl

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:20.000
instead of doing sponsored posts on

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:24.680
Instagram and milking her 8 minutes of

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.900
fame was like you know catch me going

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.270
around soliciting donations for UNICEF

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:31.100
this you know Halloween season that

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:34.270
would have been a much more you know

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.270
feel-good story about it

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:39.190
[Music]

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:40.630
nothing dude come on Oh actually that's

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:43.420
pretty good the Stars card allows us to

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:45.550
get in here I'll take it but I'm not

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.090
thrilled about it it's not ten out of

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.920
ten

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:49.840
we're in ok spot on this run though I

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.040
mean we got good damage the downside is

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.270
that our rate of fire is bad the good

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.950
side is that our rate of fire can get

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:55.690
better pretty easily and you know mini

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:58.480
monstro still doing a pretty good job of

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.840
carrying us and we're doing ok with what

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:02.410
we've got

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:03.700
keep in mind we never had anything on

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:06.490
our first deal with the devil so we have

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.690
no deal with the devil precedent it

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.950
could be good it could be bad depending

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:15.130
on what we get on this floor

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:18.310
an angel devil deal or none we haven't

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:20.830
had a lights-out run so far so I'm

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:22.360
holding out hope I'm also holding out

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:23.980
hope that we can get like a luck upgrade

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.020
for the first time in infinity years

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:30.550
feel like we've had six runs in a row

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:33.570
that had like under one lakh total that

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:36.370
is no no stats to be proud of because

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:38.050
you know so many items actually feed off

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:39.280
of luck to get better themselves but I'm

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:41.200
not going to belabor the point we're all

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.180
I'm familiar with what they are it says

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:51.280
before launching into like a 20 part

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:52.840
list stay away from me see I dude I

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.280
can't help myself

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.510
even when my damage is pretty good I'm

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.150
like you got to use the orbit of the

00:13:55.510 --> 00:14:00.250
deal a little damage I should point out

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:03.400
as well as close Evo makes the damage

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:05.470
that we have not as bad and I mean even

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:11.320
6.12 damage is pretty good in and of

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:14.680
itself plus a LS gave us the best venue

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:17.560
mallesh song right do it just do it

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:20.080
it's the ice bucket challenge it's the

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:24.100
ice bucket challenge great song

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:25.960
I encourage you or you explode or not I

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.670
encourage you to go look that one up

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:29.530
buying on iTunes it's an all-time

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:32.250
classic is it as good as it's my life

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:36.420
whatever I want to do no but it's like

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:39.900
you know is it in the same ballpark no

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:41.310
not even close but it's like pretty good

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.440
you're still not giving me angel

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:46.440
statutes okay well we got a lock upgrade

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:52.650
the future is now there's no end to the

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:54.930
possibilities the world card will save

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:59.250
that for the next flubber caves too so

00:14:54.930 --> 00:15:01.950
we're like exactly on pace for a boss

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:04.290
rush entrance I would be okay with

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:05.790
teleporting out of boss rush if we get a

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:08.910
little stronger I'd be okay with doing

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:11.250
boss rush as well but I'd have to to

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:13.550
consult with my Isaac guidebook because

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:15.950
I'm not sure our stats fit the

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:20.550
requirements I'd normally consider

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:22.650
fairly compulsory all right so let's

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:24.090
just donate we don't have anything in

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:25.710
here that really tickles our fancy too

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:28.950
much okay we can't even donate anymore

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:31.620
so we will just bounce try and genuine

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:33.420
peace trying to squeeze something out of

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:35.010
this run but I don't think this is the

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:38.190
save files problem by the way that a lot

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:40.710
of runs have been kind of Mia lately I

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:43.320
think it's more variance leaps to

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:45.090
clumping sometimes in the in our Isaac

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.770
run so sometimes we have like five runs

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:48.690
in a row that are ten out of ten and

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:50.430
then we might go like two weeks without

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:55.080
a run where we get double digit damage

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:56.670
so it happens it's part of the fun of

00:15:55.080 --> 00:16:00.870
Isaac if I'm being honest with you is

00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:02.400
that you know you go on you go on

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:04.410
streaks and you go on slogs

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:10.710
you get slumps and streaks so they call

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:14.010
it but in the interim period here we're

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:15.870
doing fine I can't be stopped from using

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:17.310
my orbital and one day that will

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:19.140
probably lead to us getting killed or at

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:20.820
least slowly losing enough damage this

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:23.250
is where I become complete self-aware NL

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:24.540
will lose enough HP slowly but surely

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.560
that eventually will come to the point

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.630
where we're like how could we possibly

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:29.550
be expected to win with these stats when

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:31.800
really I've just sort of insidiously

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:33.450
been losing HP at a pace those slightly

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:36.090
above our burn rate for several floors

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:38.220
in costing us big-time in the end but it

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:39.720
only became apparent when it was too

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:41.930
late for us to do anything about it you

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.930
know

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:56.200
hopefully it does not befall us do need

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:57.730
the key there's really not like a 10 out

00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:01.210
of 10 item for us right now that is

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:03.760
unique to this run I will say I would

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:05.640
love to see static tears and I would

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:08.260
love to see Jacob's Ladder

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:12.370
those are cool effects and they're

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:16.140
magnified by having four shots instead

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:19.750
we cut little haunts into wait what

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:22.300
little hond every now and then there's a

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:26.110
spectral famiglia who constructor in the

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:28.720
heart little haunt of enemies big uns

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:31.650
mouth from the chest a girl scared and

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:35.650
running away from your hunter a man

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:43.930
bright eyes every now and then a little

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:47.640
hon around right I'm I'm sorry but it's

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.640
like my favorite archetype for a bit

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:54.490
NL gets way too enthusiastic about a bad

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:56.680
parity these snaps playing player

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:58.000
unknowns battleground I was talking

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.560
about this with Austin earlier we were

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.980
just keeping the seat warm for him until

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:06.540
he turns his mid maxi eye to becoming a

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:08.650
true eSports champion in battlegrounds

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:12.190
you'll want to meet him on the field of

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:14.020
battle I'll tell you that much you I'm

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:15.730
the exact player you want to meet on the

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.770
field of battle in battlegrounds and

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:19.900
that's not even a joke like if you ever

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:21.610
find every time you shoot somebody in

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:26.260
battlegrounds I want you to go look in

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:28.930
the in the bottom-left corner and see if

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:33.100
you just killed me there's a decent

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:34.300
chance we used all of our keys which was

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.710
a bad idea

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.210
there's not a decent chance there's

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:38.470
literally like hundreds of thousands

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:43.000
people playing that game on a daily

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:44.620
basis but I'm saying inevitably somebody

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.940
out there has killed me in player

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.380
unknowns battlegrounds if you got the

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:50.050
clip I'd love to see it it's probably me

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:51.790
spraying you know half a clip of a kmo

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:53.200
into the tree that you're standing

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.770
behind and then you just step out on one

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.020
tab me

00:18:53.770 --> 00:19:01.150
I understand my lot in life that's a bad

00:18:56.020 --> 00:19:02.200
tears downgrade I think we're just going

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:04.150
to go we're going to go down to the next

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.860
floor our dps continues to not improve

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:07.060
but we did get oh you know what I mean

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.800
here's why I can't complain

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.900
we got a holy mantle holy mantle is a

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:12.640
beautiful item and we have an orbital an

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:15.030
orbital plus holding mantel gives us

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:17.440
like zero chance to mess this up

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:19.210
although giving away all of your red

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:23.200
hearts if there was a way to mess it up

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:29.260
that's probably up there all we have to

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:31.830
do we could probably play super

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.830
aggressive

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:38.090
and just use our orbital to deal all of

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.190
our damage and not really suffer that

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:41.720
much but I'm not going to do that and

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:44.210
use the world cards here there's a curse

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:45.710
room probably you know what there's no

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:48.230
probably about it we should just go to

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:51.020
the curse room you might be saying NL

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:52.610
you're being so reckless with this holy

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:54.560
mantle you know there's no prizes for

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:57.260
like not getting hit while you're

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:59.390
holding holy mantle right I feel like

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:01.040
any room in which we don't get hit is a

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:02.840
complete waste now that's just

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:06.460
ridiculous but you know allow me to use

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:06.460
it to illustrate my point nonetheless

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:14.090
check it out boys look at that two free

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:16.430
scents you play 3000 hours in this game

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:19.970
you can become great like me abusing

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:21.860
holy mantle to get 59 and 60 cents from

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:23.150
the shop for from the curse room

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:26.660
sometimes I say the names of the

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:28.400
segments of the game run because I get

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:30.500
distracted with my own commentary while

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:33.260
I play dude this is actually really good

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:34.670
because we should have you got 60 cents

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.410
so we know we're not going to have greed

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:38.210
in our shop which means we can donate

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:40.640
hope under our donation machines already

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:46.670
pop isn't it donation machine has been

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:48.530
very cruel we've had like one run where

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:50.270
we were able to donate like 80 cents and

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:53.810
then every other run is like 3 cents

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:57.730
that's my fill for today see you in a

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:57.730
year nine hundred and ninety nine cents

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:06.110
are we going to make vostra how long you

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:09.320
gonna make me wait for posture we're

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:11.680
we're looking pretty bad for the boss

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.680
rush

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:16.970
certainly we're going to go shop we're

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.910
going to go item room both of them are

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:24.680
connected to the same room so we win in

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:30.470
terms of efficiency there we don't have

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:32.540
very much time to kill mom so to get

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:34.430
something extremely good right here

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:36.560
would be very nice yeah that's the

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:39.320
ticket okay I mean cream shops are sort

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:43.940
of okay don't take that out of context

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:45.710
please we got in here the latter at all

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:48.020
time class it will grab the spirit are

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:50.120
do that sure I'll take high of mind I'll

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:52.720
take broken modem I'll grab the world

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.720
card again

00:21:55.929 --> 00:21:59.499
this pretty much settles it that I'm not

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:02.909
going to be able to make posture rush

00:21:59.499 --> 00:22:04.960
this room always takes us a while

00:22:02.909 --> 00:22:06.999
especially if we want to avoid taking

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:10.869
damage which apparently I don't care for

00:22:06.999 --> 00:22:12.549
I think we focused a little bit too much

00:22:10.869 --> 00:22:15.610
on ba Suresh here at the expense of our

00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:18.460
own survivability so my apologies for

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:20.350
that but again you know it's the beauty

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:22.059
of Isaac is that we can go on autopilot

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:25.059
a little bit and still be relatively

00:22:22.059 --> 00:22:27.369
okay alright so let's finish up his mom

00:22:25.059 --> 00:22:29.710
fight get down to brass tacks we've had

00:22:27.369 --> 00:22:32.019
a little vain going on on this run no no

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:33.460
talking about waffle stomping but not

00:22:32.019 --> 00:22:35.619
every Isaac episode needs to have an

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:38.200
incredibly gross anecdote related to

00:22:35.619 --> 00:22:39.690
human bodily functions by speaking of

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:44.679
which what's the grossest human

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:46.119
violation I'm going to say vomiting any

00:22:44.679 --> 00:22:47.470
and I'm not I'm not going to go down

00:22:46.119 --> 00:22:49.149
this road I'm going to take a Polaroid

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:51.039
it's our first chance for permanent

00:22:49.149 --> 00:22:52.929
Polaroid invincibility both of these

00:22:51.039 --> 00:22:54.159
items are great we can't take them both

00:22:52.929 --> 00:23:00.159
so we're going to roll with the wafer I

00:22:54.159 --> 00:23:01.240
think that's the safe smart money purse

00:23:00.159 --> 00:23:05.409
little labyrinth is like the perfect

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:07.259
floor to use this on and feeling pretty

00:23:05.409 --> 00:23:09.820
good I don't know what it is but like I

00:23:07.259 --> 00:23:11.409
can't buy more than one damage upgrade

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.580
per run the way I phrased that made it

00:23:11.409 --> 00:23:14.289
sound like I'm trying to buy it from the

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:17.200
shop but I mean like in a philosophical

00:23:14.289 --> 00:23:19.629
sense I can't seem to get more than one

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:22.059
damage upgrade per run I'm lucky you

00:23:19.629 --> 00:23:24.039
know on our last green mode run it was

00:23:22.059 --> 00:23:26.379
the damage upgrade be God was crickets

00:23:24.039 --> 00:23:27.700
head on this run the damage up gravy God

00:23:26.379 --> 00:23:30.480
was magic mush at least we're not

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:33.639
getting like a junk damage upgrade but

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:35.879
it would be very very helpful to also be

00:23:33.639 --> 00:23:40.659
able to have more than one of them

00:23:35.879 --> 00:23:44.289
because 6.12 damage you know we're not

00:23:40.659 --> 00:23:45.639
setting any records probably I mean I

00:23:44.289 --> 00:23:48.249
don't know what the record is but if

00:23:45.639 --> 00:23:51.240
this will set it then you know that

00:23:48.249 --> 00:23:51.240
record has problems

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:56.230
our deals with the angel have been

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:59.440
pretty nice though this might be like

00:23:56.230 --> 00:24:02.260
the first successful deal with the angel

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:05.760
setup we've had and that's a at least it

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:05.760
tears upgrade so I'm happy about that

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:13.150
are you a home invader or my wife oh no

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:19.060
it's a home invader that sounds and

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:23.320
looks just like my wife I have eyes on

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:27.940
the side of my head I'm the invader

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:30.580
invader from space that'd be a great

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:31.770
title for video game the invaders from

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:35.410
space

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:39.040
somebody should pitch that to Atari are

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:41.170
they still around I thought they did go

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:43.090
bankrupt but I saw that a tari was

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:45.010
pitching like on the back of the NES

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:47.380
mini being popular they're coming out

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:49.270
with like an Atari mini and I was like

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:51.010
you know more power to you I understand

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:53.680
a lot of people have nostalgia for that

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:54.930
era but because those games aren't that

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:57.220
good

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:58.930
I'm not going to people will wait in

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:02.860
line they'll they'll pay an extra like

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:05.410
75 bucks on eBay to pick up you got

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:07.630
there you want a great sell because I

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:16.180
just came back from recording studio

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:17.740
right yeah are you Oh big dog nice boy I

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:22.870
didn't know is I don't know I was

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:27.580
spoiling the lead okay yeah but it is

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:32.140
big dumb Atari and our new friend forum

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:35.410
player to make these cat name is big dog

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:37.030
because it don't really like I gotta ask

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:41.290
her about that because that game is like

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:44.440
you know it's alright there isn't really

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:47.320
much yeah it's like it's okay well you

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:49.840
know it's just if you like to think you

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.830
like so we one of the pieces that we

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:54.110
recorded today

00:25:50.830 --> 00:26:00.500
SiC dogs so there you go that's pretty

00:25:54.110 --> 00:26:02.720
cool it was really awful I feel like

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:05.600
we're on like a late-night talk show my

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:08.270
welcome to the show Kate greener Burnett

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.580
have been in it been in it so what have

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:13.400
you been working on lately

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:15.799
hahaha segue into an anecdote that we

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:17.630
plans to talk about wow that's hilarious

00:26:15.799 --> 00:26:22.159
way back after this word from our

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:24.289
sponsors Dorito chip can you do an

00:26:22.159 --> 00:26:27.230
impromptu Dorito ad read for me Kate

00:26:24.289 --> 00:26:30.230
thirty Seconds sell me some Doritos

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:32.150
three two one go

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:36.169
this is a Dorito flavor shake Nick

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:38.870
burrito you get a pouch full of tasty

00:26:36.169 --> 00:26:40.280
onion mix and you shake it up in the

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:41.169
thing and then there you go there we go

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.370
chicken eggs

00:26:41.169 --> 00:26:45.710
not a little bit anywhere in the world

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:47.750
definitely the weirdest Dorito that I've

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:51.890
ever conceived of but you know what I do

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:56.650
want some burritos with onion powder now

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:58.669
shake shake shake Doritos Nate we've

00:26:56.650 --> 00:27:00.679
honestly we have such pull on the

00:26:58.669 --> 00:27:03.020
internet that they can't ignore us and

00:27:00.679 --> 00:27:06.950
they probably tried many celebrities

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:08.210
have I mean I'm not going to touch upon

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:13.820
that because I think we can sell that

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:17.799
idea like yeah boy I've never seen Kate

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:21.210
but then it's also slang for bad

00:27:17.799 --> 00:27:23.679
marijuana is an odd shape

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:25.090
Thank You safety I don't think it's

00:27:23.679 --> 00:27:27.010
shakeshake but if you were like hey boy

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:29.309
I'm just saying there's a situation

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:31.390
where maybe somebody offers to sell you

00:27:29.309 --> 00:27:33.130
marijuana on the street and you buy a

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:36.940
thinking of Doritos that would be a very

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:38.529
strange interaction yeah but you could

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:40.960
say the same word twice you know it does

00:27:38.529 --> 00:27:42.279
happen once I won't say okay I got to

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:46.059
get back guys get out it we're talking

00:27:42.279 --> 00:27:49.049
about Doritos Dookie all right thanks

00:27:46.059 --> 00:27:51.370
for being here we're out of time here

00:27:49.049 --> 00:27:54.549
I'm going to take this and I'm going to

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:55.840
take that and we got to focus here this

00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:59.710
could be our first chest win on this

00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:01.419
save file and this run is a lot better

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:02.679
than the last run we had which made it

00:28:01.419 --> 00:28:06.149
to the chest which was that blue baby

00:28:02.679 --> 00:28:12.190
run we just did but it's still not

00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:14.830
particularly amazing well I mean it is

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:16.120
actually that's a lie holy mantle means

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:18.580
that it's amazing but in terms of our

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:20.020
actual stats it's not that amazing holy

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:23.169
mantle elevates it to a level that's

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:26.890
certainly above that but we're missing

00:28:23.169 --> 00:28:29.049
out to some extent on DM glow walk into

00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:31.380
a room and just crush it Vaynerchuk

00:28:29.049 --> 00:28:31.380
style

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:37.390
shouldn't have done

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:38.860
I think we're going to be completely

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:40.570
fine I mean since we got only Mansfeld

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:42.580
we've only lost like three spear in

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:46.080
hearts total it seems like a lot but it

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:48.220
has been like four floors of safety so

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:49.120
okay and then we just lost one more but

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.740
I still think we're going to be

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:53.830
completely fine here it's nice because

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:54.850
this run wasn't always set in stone

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:58.090
though we were going to pull out the

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:59.560
victory here especially when we turn

00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:01.750
into a late-night talk show for a little

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:05.860
bit there you go happens all the time

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:08.980
but that's what to luck gets you you

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:10.180
replace your d6 with the d-10 I still

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:12.580
think it'd be cool if the d-10 could

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:16.050
reroll bosses shouldn't have stood there

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:18.370
I basically just took damage from

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:23.560
Excellus Evo for no reason I didn't take

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:25.300
damage but I lost my ability to use holy

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:26.500
mantle effectively which is important

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:28.780
because I could use that for orbital

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:30.280
damage but it's doing fine I took common

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:31.630
cold as well because I was figured you

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.980
know any port in the storm

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:35.620
give me some extra damage and I'll be

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:37.300
okay fast run I had a good time I hope

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:40.030

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:42.220

Isaac Spears as well an item that you

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.620
