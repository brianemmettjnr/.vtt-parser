00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
[Music]

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.020
and everybody welcome back to normal and

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.339
please binding my sketch with Plus let's

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.189
just make sure the last episode actually

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.490
recorded properly here we go everybody

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.519
well please tell me this game sound yeah

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.960
game sound that's what I like the seat

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.660
OBS has been acting weird lately forgive

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.539
me that indulgence there um this run is

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.310
easel greed two reasons it's got to be

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.869
done and it unlocks Lilith at which

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.160
point will be able to actually do a

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.800
Lilith run but npj MMC 3e h &amp; pj and c

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.960
3h guys said that right the second time

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.820
we've got squeezy for a nice little

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.250
tears upgrade wait a minute

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.520
he's going to say where's my freaking

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.770
spirit hearts squeezy and i'll continue

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.789
to put the blame on squeezy instead of

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.160
acknowledging that i made a mistake

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.120
there and almost neglected to pick them

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.660
up so we can probably make do with

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.059
blackhole it seems like a decent wow

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.379
that was bad damage on my part it seems

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:06.150
like a decent Azazel item here we will

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.549
get enough money for it but we got to

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.700
not take damage I'd also love to get

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.290
like I now that I think about it I don't

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.790
know how it could happen there is one

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.979
way it can happen but I want to get red

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.210
hearts so that I could actually play

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.320
that demon judgement and there's a

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.659
couple of red hearts in there that we

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.880
could use a refill in fact I guess we

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.920
could actually hedge our bets or not not

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.799
hedge our bets the opposite like go for

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:34.259
broke I think is what they say in the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:36.450
industry yes yes go and buy an HP

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.579
upgrade and then use that HP upgrade to

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.170
try to play the demon judgment to the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.700
point that it'll actually pay out with

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.810
something and then as far as I'm

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.439
concerned we basically you got two

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.600
upgrades for the price of an HP upgrade

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.470
but we need to get an HP upgrade and I

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.270
don't know how that's going to happen

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.750
the ideal way would be if it happens

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.719
right here Wow okay so we actually can't

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.969
take this oh well we can take it we

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.100
don't want to use it though because we

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.159
need this as asel win or at least would

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.069
like it so I think I'm going to say

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.989
sorry black hole and I'm going to go for

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.819
the rear old that was like barely

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:16.260
re-roll at all

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.420
we're gonna go down to 15 cents because

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.879
I'm looking for HP the other thing is if

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.500
we get an HP upgrade we go you know we

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:27.659
play that a demon judgment then we

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.310
hopefully can just trade that HP upgrade

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.959
away to for a good deal with a devil or

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.310
something like that but we're getting a

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.870
little ahead of ourselves normally I

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.159
don't like to buy HP upgrades when you

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.049
start with zero things they're a little

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:41.310
different I guess we're throwing money

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:43.319
away sadly well I mean chaos is probably

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.939
worth buying long term so you know the

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.730
best laid plans of mice and men right

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:49.730
they're all going to fall apart here I

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.510
don't know what bag lunch is you know

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:03.480
what let's look it up let's let's be

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:06.120
good habits here bags lunch Issac is my

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.950
name and Isaac's taking damage has a

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.459
small chance to destroy the trinket and

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.480
spawn lunch dude we can get an HP

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.019
upgrade out of this is what you're

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.180
saying

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.549
but the most efficient way to get that

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.840
small chance to pay out is probably by

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.250
playing that demon judgment which we

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.379
might consider depending on what our

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.510
deal with the devil looks like but I'm

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.780
not necessarily getting my hopes up just

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.780
yet

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.340
run looks fine though I mean it's Azazel

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.940
so we got a lot of early game bonuses as

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.100
long as we can eventually turn them into

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.210
late-game greatness we with chaos I

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.350
think we'd rather have deals of the

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:47.330
Angels so we'll see what we've got in

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:49.280
here I can't really see the value behind

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.860
this oh that would have terrible bit it

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.360
unless does this give us twice the money

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.560
I don't think this gives us twice the

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.240
money I was taking let's find out so I'm

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:08.180
going to be an idiot here come on work

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:08.900
with me yeah was it worth it uh can I

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.820
ask you something

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.300
let me work it i put my thing down flip

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:16.190
it and reverse it infamy is good we

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.920
didn't in the end we probably did spend

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:23.740
about as much HP as infamy will save us

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:26.690
from taking but I think that's fine

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.430
we'll check our item room it's Anarchist

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.680
Cookbook which is garbage Guppies tail

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.660
which is a lovely head start towards

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.680
making our guppy dreams come true

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.540
and we don't love anything here so I

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.140
think this is an okay place to use

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.140
Anarchist Cookbook

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:49.640
wow that was real bad um I'm going to

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.380
blow this guy up because we actually

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:56.540
just don't care now keep bag lunch for

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:58.010
now I do want to go into the curse room

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.240
because I think that red chefs have a

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.770
higher chance that have guppy items

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:07.270
still even with chaos but we'll find out

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.800
I like to play these greed runs a little

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.480
not fast and loose like not like I'm

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.090
trying to rush them but I like to play

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.470
aggressively because it's more fun to

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:20.930
kind of build your own synergy from

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:24.580
scratch and get it off the ground is all

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:27.560
I was so dumb as opposed to just like

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.730
playing it slow and yellow like I don't

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.820
know if I could afford to take this my

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:34.280
HP fed force yourself into a situation

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.880
from which there is no backing down and

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.169
then die in respawn is dark Judas

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.740
hilariously I actually think we have

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:46.039
done a dark Judas while he's not doctors

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.380
we've done a Judas greed mode run

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:50.570
already so I basically I was about to go

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.729
on like a Shia LaBeouf ask motivational

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.229
speech about how like you know you've

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:59.570
got to force yourself to make progress

00:05:54.229 --> 00:06:01.820
and then instead I just die so this will

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:05.210
just be a great mode run for fun I

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.979
suppose it's more reflective of like

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:10.130
what an actual greed mode run for me

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:12.500
would look like guardian angels okay but

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.890
it's not at good blow this up save your

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.100
money

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:19.220
ing direct don't care about bookworm GB

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.410
bug is pretty bad starter deck is okay

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.270
x-ray goggles I'm going to say that

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:26.419
x-ray goggles will probably pay for

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:32.030
themselves over the course of this whole

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:32.900
run never a go-for-broke here again we

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.880
got one penny

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:38.780
it could be worse honestly oh and dude

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.610
we gotta buy Guppies pot because we're

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.740
almost at the guppy dream here it was

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.660
made really sloppily played here and

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.830
this actually won't unlock Lilith which

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.510
means we're gonna have to do in his asel

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.750
greed mode run some point in the future

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:53.539
and and I believe that greedier does not

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:56.060
count as greed for the purposes of

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:57.950
unlocks at least so we got to do we got

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.750
to do both but I know I'm acting like a

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.479
basil greed motive slog when it

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.760
literally just killed me so but we're

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:06.789
guaranteed to win except for the time

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:10.150
that we did it and we lost badly and

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:15.020
what we lost in a productive way

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:16.970
hey how about you just shove off buddy

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.700
sorry to use strong language but I

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:22.729
really want to get you off my case you

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:25.690
are a jerk and a charlatan and I do not

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:25.690
respect you

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:30.909
and we should hold Guppies paw I think

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:36.639
could leave but I think that we

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:38.019
shouldn't leave so what's that what's

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:43.449
the end game for us here well obviously

00:07:38.019 --> 00:07:44.860
like becoming guppy is usually a win we

00:07:43.449 --> 00:07:46.989
have a 50% chance of a deal with the

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:50.709
Angels coming right up and it could have

00:07:46.989 --> 00:07:53.079
anything in it and really we could make

00:07:50.709 --> 00:07:55.239
do with almost anything at this point so

00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:58.149
if you want to give me some HP normally

00:07:55.239 --> 00:08:00.369
a pretty bad angel deal in this case I

00:07:58.149 --> 00:08:04.149
would love to see that but if the devil

00:08:00.369 --> 00:08:06.459
deal it's not Krampus dude how could I

00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:16.209
live with myself if I didn't give it a

00:08:06.459 --> 00:08:22.119
shot he is a god what where this magic

00:08:16.209 --> 00:08:26.769
mushroom come from no idea existed so

00:08:22.119 --> 00:08:28.959
we're got we will almost definitely win

00:08:26.769 --> 00:08:30.550
this run there's still we're so early in

00:08:28.959 --> 00:08:33.189
the game here in terms of like overall

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:37.360
progress we have so much that we can

00:08:33.189 --> 00:08:40.240
accomplish on this run the big deal I

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:44.169
mean telepathy for dummies is okay the

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:45.730
big deal is definitely donating the more

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:50.350
we can donate to our donation machine

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:52.059
the better so I'm not I'm not too

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:55.110
cheesed about the whole Azazel you know

00:08:52.059 --> 00:08:57.519
responding is dark Judas thing because

00:08:55.110 --> 00:09:00.040
we can still just especially now that

00:08:57.519 --> 00:09:03.129
our run is somewhat set a little early

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:04.809
on try to get to the point where we can

00:09:03.129 --> 00:09:07.930
donate a bunch of money to our donation

00:09:04.809 --> 00:09:09.370
machine and that would fulfill the

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:11.170
reason for this run to exist to begin

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:13.420
with so what are we looking for I would

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:15.850
say faster rate of fire is up there good

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:17.589
fire rate if we can get like blank cards

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.970
to of something that would be great

00:09:17.589 --> 00:09:20.980
there's a lot there's a lot of good

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:23.920
options here I don't really want to pay

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:30.759
for dog - where's the secret room I went

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:32.410
oh it's actually right there I mean

00:09:30.759 --> 00:09:34.079
we'll buy a key I think that's what we

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:36.220
should do is buy like one key per floor

00:09:34.079 --> 00:09:38.920
save the rest of our money we have the

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.820
battery which is not useful for colep

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.320
a--they for dummies

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:43.420
and I mean to be real with you will

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.310
probably just scrap telepathy for

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.839
dummies on the next floor enrolled of

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:49.660
Guppies paw instead because it gives us

00:09:46.839 --> 00:09:51.220
the ability to actually take damage

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:54.670
against super green and be fine but

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:56.440
that's good it's good man I have to I

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:58.600
have to ask you to blow my mind today

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.070
because my mind was already blown and I

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.390
want you to blow my mind by telling me

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:03.790
that this doesn't blow your mind because

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:06.790
it's like an obvious thing I was at a

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:11.019
coffee shop it rhymes with good lucks

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:13.240
and I said hey can I have a guy I mean

00:10:11.019 --> 00:10:14.410
they're pretty weird like I don't know

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.760
if you've heard of a coffee shop that's

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:18.220
ever done this but instead of ordering

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.200
like a small medium or large you order

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:22.810
it's really cool with like the Italian

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:25.060
name of it so I went all the venti iced

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:30.370
coffee you got to order like that too

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:31.540
and they went they rang me Internet page

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:36.279
and then they're like actually we all

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:38.529
have any iced coffee right now would you

00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:40.570
like like one brewed in what they called

00:10:38.529 --> 00:10:42.550
the clover system which I can only

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:45.130
imagine is like the Hovis method from

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:47.740
the Xbox one but they said you want

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:48.970
something brewed in the clover system

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.800
because we can make you an iced coffee

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:52.060
in that and I was like sure but in my

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.329
head I was like they're just going to

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:56.589
make me a hot coffee it's like a brewed

00:10:55.329 --> 00:10:58.990
hot coffee and give it to me and that's

00:10:56.589 --> 00:11:00.820
fine this lady like fiddles around with

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:03.760
the Machine two minutes later she goes

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:05.230
here's your iced coffee we forgot to

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.790
take Guppies probably took Guppies head

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:10.390
instead which is way better so we got

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:11.769
lucky there um and nine lives might be

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.269
worth getting I think we got to try to

00:11:11.769 --> 00:11:17.140
see if this 2 of diamonds which it's not

00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:19.149
anyway two minutes later she pulls out

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.870
from the machine a cup containing iced

00:11:19.149 --> 00:11:22.120
coffee

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:25.660
if you don't understand how coffee is

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:27.550
brewed this might not seem like that big

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.850
of a deal and I mean in the end I guess

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:33.339
it's not really that big of a deal but

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:37.089
normally it's like very very hot water

00:11:33.339 --> 00:11:39.880
runs over ground coffee and brews it

00:11:37.089 --> 00:11:41.440
into a cup and then stuff like cold brew

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.550
is we shouldn't have taken this we were

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.990
going to get nine lives but we probably

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.459
were not going to get nine lives anyway

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:49.270
or didn't want to

00:11:45.459 --> 00:11:51.760
cold brew has to sit for like 12 to 24

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:55.089
hours in order to essentially steep

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:56.860
so to make a nice coffee on the fly and

00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:59.440
have it come out of the machine cold

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:01.949
makes no sense it tasted not quite

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:05.230
indistinguishable from a normal one but

00:12:01.949 --> 00:12:07.810
almost indistinguishable I don't know if

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:12.010
it brews date a hot and then cools it

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:14.889
down really quickly or if it somehow

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:16.990
just like cold presses coffee beans and

00:12:14.889 --> 00:12:20.260
water to create it but this might not

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:22.389
seem like it's a big deal and again it's

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:24.250
not a big deal but I would it got my

00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:27.550
head spin and trying to figure out oh my

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:29.260
lord how mechanically they did this like

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.699
what is the inside of this clover

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.980
machine looked like you know it's like

00:12:30.699 --> 00:12:34.360
there's a tesseract from Marvel's

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.490
Avengers in there is something to

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.500
accomplish this witchcraft is it it just

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:41.769
doesn't make scientific sense to me and

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:46.990
I like that it's cool it is ignited my

00:12:41.769 --> 00:12:49.990
imagination we're gonna go in here and

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:52.000
we're getting close to bookworm we are

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:54.880
so close to bookworm we're actually at

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.589
bookworm oh there's a secret room in

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.420
here I didn't check as well so it might

00:12:56.589 --> 00:13:03.639
seem a little lame but I'm avoiding

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:05.500
buying items at this point because we

00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:06.670
don't need them and I'm if I'm not going

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.889
to accomplish what I meant to accomplish

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:10.329
on this run why not just donate as much

00:13:08.889 --> 00:13:12.069
money as we can you know there's

00:13:10.329 --> 00:13:14.290
probably a better equilibrium point

00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:15.940
between likely where we are right now

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:17.769
and where we could be if we bought like

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:20.230
half as many items as we wanted to but

00:13:17.769 --> 00:13:22.420
what is this the audiobook for

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:24.579
algorithms to live by no this is me

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:26.170
coming up with a strategy on the fly

00:13:24.579 --> 00:13:32.380
Thank You infamy I really appreciate

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:34.959
that and we're going to try to strike a

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:36.910
good balance between having a run that's

00:13:34.959 --> 00:13:41.529
powerful enough to fairly easily beat

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:43.569
greed without actually spending so much

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:44.860
money that you know it costs us doing

00:13:43.569 --> 00:13:46.029
another greed mode run in the future not

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:48.699
that I should look at it as a cost

00:13:46.029 --> 00:13:50.649
necessarily but you know what I mean you

00:13:48.699 --> 00:13:52.690
probably know what I mean I think I'm

00:13:50.649 --> 00:13:54.819
articulating myself reasonably well

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:56.470
binky's fine you know we still got one

00:13:54.819 --> 00:13:59.410
keeper floor that we can use to get an

00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:00.550
item and we've still got the deal with

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.170
the devil they can give us an item and

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:04.560
we still got the item room on most

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:07.270
floors that can give us an item

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:09.100
we'll head down I would like to get and

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:11.470
we're all on the we got a couple of

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:17.290
fours left here but I would like to get

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:20.290
a better card because the fool doesn't

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:27.040
really do much for us well it gets us

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:28.420
out of the curse room for free okay now

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:32.560
that that's done it doesn't do anything

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:34.000
for us just grab this with chaos we

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.560
could play the demon or the regular

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.920
judgement but I don't see a reason for

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:40.270
that I think we see if we give away HP

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:43.570
to our deal with the devil person then

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:46.630
we then we take nine lives if it's

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:48.279
proven I don't I I don't really want to

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:51.730
sacrifice nine lives even if it's for

00:14:48.279 --> 00:14:53.620
one HP even if we only lose one HP in

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:55.510
the process to gain nine lives because

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:56.740
the odds of us beating greed this is

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:58.959
like the most boring sentence I've ever

00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:01.649
said well let me calculate a minister

00:14:58.959 --> 00:15:05.440
matrix multiplication here no but it's a

00:15:01.649 --> 00:15:08.800
the odds of us beating greed with one HP

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:11.620
are very low I would rather have one

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:13.839
life with two HP than nine lives of one

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:17.080
HP possibly it would be it'd be close it

00:15:13.839 --> 00:15:21.010
wouldn't be like a snap decision but I

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:22.420
would I think that's probably where my

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:26.830
allegiance lies there

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:27.910
so that's 71 cents we can always use our

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.890
bomb because we're not going to use them

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:32.800
against greed we can use our bombs and

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:34.959
try to like blow up the reroll machine

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.400
until it gives us all of the available

00:15:34.959 --> 00:15:38.500
choices that we can see and then we can

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:41.320
choose like okay this item is actually

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:42.940
worth the time that it would take us or

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.250
the money that it would cost us because

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:47.560
we probably will not be able to donate

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:49.180
99 cents but I wouldn't be surprised if

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:52.329
you know on our first green mode run of

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:55.709
the day we could donate like you know 80

00:15:52.329 --> 00:16:00.010
I wouldn't be surprised if you donate 99

00:15:55.709 --> 00:16:02.070
I'd give it close to even odds because I

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:05.970
don't know how fast the the percentage

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:05.970
to break goes up

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:13.440
we already have bookworm so it's

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:14.760
irrelevant well I mean this is a stupid

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.190
decision but I'm going to take monster

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.660
man well then go back to guppy spawn

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:20.279
what's the reason for doing this I guess

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:22.830
it will never sea monster man well again

00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:24.330
and now we have a good excuse to take

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.160
nine lives even though we probably

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.839
shouldn't have done so to begin with and

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.279
then we can use some bombs here and see

00:16:27.839 --> 00:16:31.560
if we get something great and we did

00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:35.760
think that was well worth the cost and

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:36.990
now I'm going to leave and in the end I

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.610
think that ended up being a pretty good

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:40.529
decision although we already had magic

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:41.640
mush so it wasn't as much of a damage

00:16:40.529 --> 00:16:44.310
upgrade as I thought it would be and

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:46.740
then I tried to hedge my bets even

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:48.180
further and got shut down so let's get

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:50.480
the heck out of here no item room on

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:52.410
this floor will they get to $0.99 no

00:16:50.480 --> 00:17:01.560
probably not at least but we might get

00:16:52.410 --> 00:17:03.930
to like you know 88 why not rent some

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:05.189
quality items in here but I'm going to

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:07.470
choose to ignore those because this

00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:11.699
could be like 10% of our greed machine

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:15.000
taken care of here why why buy a bomb of

00:17:11.699 --> 00:17:16.679
all things dude okay well we had a bomb

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.030
but let's just pretend that that was the

00:17:16.679 --> 00:17:23.309
lucky bomb that got it done for us okay

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:26.010
I'm going to say 84 cents is where we

00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:28.400
finish this one now where we finish this

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:28.400
one now

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:44.070
of snooker and I'm telling you straight

up there's like four of us as as

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:48.900
pronounced the same way so just back the

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:51.060
heck off also if you like it you should

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.500
did not correct people's pronunciation

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.360
it makes your hobby look like it's only

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:57.120
meant for people who are heavily

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:59.340
invested in pedantry to choose he didn't

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:01.380
react I'm trying to meet you halfway

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:03.090
talking about this niche billiard sport

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.410
that nobody in North America cares about

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:07.110
in they're like oh and I was talking

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:09.030
about a sport I like but he's saying it

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:10.530
slightly differently because he comes

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.060
from you know a different part of the

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:14.850
planet is it possible that we have

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:16.290
different experiences and you know he

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:17.790
might actually understand how it's

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:19.710
pronounced in this country of choice no

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:25.650
that can't possibly be it he's just

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:29.490
incorrect you Joker's you gotta you got

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:31.740
to turn off the the nitpicking man when

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:33.270
you're in a social interaction here it

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:36.620
makes me mad because I know that you're

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:36.620
destined for so much more

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.900
but you know here in bed with a

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:44.500

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:06.700
somebody's like hey I'll take a hot dog

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:09.550

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:02.440
it but we also said we're adults we know

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:03.940
that this dude's trying to write March a

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.260

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:22.990
times they say doing a class of length

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:24.370

extra you know ten percent on an

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:32.020

percent of your grade like dog let me go

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:37.390

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:47.610
mine yet at the same time I'm also

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:49.900
selflessly using this as an educational

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:51.500
opportunity to explain to you that

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.780
people will like you more

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:56.350

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:59.630
errors that are meaningless no

00:21:56.350 --> 00:22:03.470

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:53.140
obligation to each other to get along
