00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.319
everybody welcome back there on the line

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.910
please abiding by see a trick plus in

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.760
case you couldn't tell still a little

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.420
bit under the weather unfortunately but

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.519
but life goes on one way or the other

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.859
unfortunately we did die on ultra hard

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.080
last time which was extremely annoying

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.539
and and pretty much due to my own idiocy

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.160
but at the same time that doesn't mean I

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.430
can't be a little upset about it anyway

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.820
this time we have the pong challenge

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.610
which is actually one of the easier ones

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.649
like throughout the entire existence of

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.100
the game I think just Joker card right

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.430
now why not add a little excitement by

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.680
taking nine lives early um I say it's

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.390
one of the easier ones because you start

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.850
with a hundred damage which is like

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.140
possibly the highest no that's not true

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.340
now that I think about it I have seen

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.930
that like cheap engined videos where you

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.390
can get into it I think like then the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.800
millions on damage but I only saw that

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.660
one time I think this is like a a

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.250
Spanish youtuber who did it

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.019
you know those Spanish youtubers they're

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.920
always pushing the envelope I don't

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.250
really know what I'm talking about

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.740
basically um our rate of fire of course

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.330
is 150 which is garbage but it doesn't

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.040
really matter cuz our shot kills

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.170
everything in one hit and also bounces

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:22.470
around like crazy so I'm not actually

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:24.619
sure if we conceivably oh come on rocks

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:31.290
are like our worst enemy right now oh

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:33.329
wow well in that case I'm not sure if we

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.340
can raise our rate of fire functionally

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.500
enough to have it like no longer be a

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:43.590
big deal but we'll find out I can't

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.939
shoot yet can't shoot yet please enemies

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.520
the chases are gonna be a problem but

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.799
yeah either way I apologize you know I

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.720
it impacts your your listening

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.880
experience for my voice to be like a

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.009
little congested but I'm uh I'm a

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.960
believer that to some extent the show

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.070
must go on

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.310
people tell you to rest when you're sick

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.719
and I think that there's there's many

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.920
valuable reasons for that one of which

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.439
is you don't want to overexert yourself

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.879
another one is you don't want to go to

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.030
your job and get other people infected

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:14.940
luckily I work from home

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.190
and the only person I'm liable to infect

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.960
with any kind of common cold virus would

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.700
be my wife and I'll tell you a little

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.880
secret of marriage is that you just you

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.470
see someone gets sick one of the two in

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.890
the in the couple gets sick and you just

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.290
you know you're like there but for the

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.490
grace of God go I I can't believe I

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.900
ruined my deal with the devil chance by

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:40.400
walking into those oh my okay okay you

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.660
can't criticize my Isaac play I'm sick

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.970
but ya didn't no I'm not saying that

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.270
what I do by the way is not work and

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.370
that you know doing something else would

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.530
not be restful I'm just saying to some

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.200
extent the show must go on and I I value

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.380
a kind of routine here plus some I'm

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.740
like I'm on the up and up oh my Lanta

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.900
dude like I'm on the upswing of getting

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.060
better and I'm like yeah okay I'm good

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.660
to go I think at least let's see what we

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.690
got in here

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.700
uh do we actually I can't believe I used

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.960
the Sun card to deal damage when one

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.570
shot probably would have killed either

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.920
enemy instead I have a 1% deal with the

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:22.080
devil chance because I was acting like

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:24.750
an idiot there are no item rooms which

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.760
is what I was gonna ask so what I am

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.260
gonna do is go to the curse room to try

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.300
to get this copy dream going cuz if we

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.540
can get flies that deal 200 damage each

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.250
like we're in heaven we're also gonna

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.220
teleport out of here to the shop anyway

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.540
and we probably won't be able to buy

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.320
anything but we might get a little lucky

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:46.880
you never know so yeah and as I always

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.880
tell you I sound worse than I am

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.980
nothing there really gets me here we

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.930
should go to the secret room first

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.970
i I sound worse than I am I don't feel

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.440
like a hundred percent but I I there's

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.340
there's people on earth more deserving

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.480
of your of your sympathy I would suggest

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.800
what just now sounds like I'm trying to

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.620
tough it out and that's not really the

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.900
case please let me just slip in my pili

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.350
heart voice here okay

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.810
second secret room

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:20.140
this pill gives us Guppies head no what

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:23.200
makes you larger pretty fly very good

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.970
range down largely irrelevant and at the

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.650
way the tears up did nothing so I think

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.730
that we're actually add like a static to

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:33.790
your level that we can't affect

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:35.320
unfortunately it will pop this over you

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.880
know what let's use one make one makes

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.710
you larger why not and then the reason

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.660
why not is obvious but there's also like

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.120
I'm trying to explore the benefit of

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.160
possibly using the the one makes you

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.660
larger transformation forget what it's

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.010
called but that doesn't mean I don't

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.980
know the sound it makes when it takes an

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.690
enemy's life you know and also like to

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.430
see what if he got like pupula duplex I

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.290
mean are shots twice as large you know

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.110
in all likelihood I'll probably only

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:06.640
have one crack at the at the King here

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:09.730
so I would like to experiment with some

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.550
of the more strange options I actually

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:16.030
would also love to get some bombs

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:17.380
because our shot is too wide I think to

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.940
easily fit into a lot of those

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.250
situations and I'm not gonna turn on my

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.169
nose at spirit hearts either there's a

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:27.700
lesson in Avril Lavigne's magnum opus

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:29.350
skater boy Oh their friends turned up

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:34.290
their nose cuz they had a problem with

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:36.370
his baggy clothes for shame 13 year olds

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.229
you didn't like him because he wore

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.030
baggy clothes by the way that song about

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:42.570
being counterculture went to number one

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:46.050
in like 18 countries but that's okay um

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:51.280
I think we just ignore this for now I

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:54.430
want more money that was a masterstroke

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.590
rape there but we can't really use our

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.110
money to reroll the donation machine

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:02.200
safely here I think so except the range

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:07.300
upgrade which probably does nothing now

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:10.540
we're cooking with gas pardon me I mean

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:15.010
thinking about it logically I don't

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:16.510
think we really need more damage so I

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:20.320
think the way I'm gonna do it is

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:22.930
actually like this why like that well I

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.659
actually did want more speed and then if

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:28.009
you're going to take the

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:32.269
if you're gonna take ceremonial robes I

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:35.659
think it makes sense to take it last we

00:06:32.269 --> 00:06:37.369
can do it we did not do it just run just

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:39.709
run just run okay we made it out at

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:41.569
least we can by spirit hearts then

00:06:39.709 --> 00:06:43.579
reroll the machine and get more spirit

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:45.589
hearts and then probably be fine again

00:06:43.579 --> 00:06:49.159
we shouldn't have anything to worry

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:52.279
about at least to a large degree here we

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:54.139
should try to be cool cuz you never know

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:57.919
when when things could like completely

00:06:54.139 --> 00:07:00.829
go wrong three room is all consumables

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:02.269
so I probably should not have rear old

00:07:00.829 --> 00:07:03.469
those bombs even though it ended up

00:07:02.269 --> 00:07:07.449
looking out okay

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:13.939
we will moon card get some more bombs

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:15.709
we've already been to the shop you think

00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:17.209
we can on that it rerolls all the

00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:18.499
consumables on the floor so I'm done

00:07:17.209 --> 00:07:20.269
because I could have probably gotten

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:23.709
that spirit heart if we'd played our

00:07:20.269 --> 00:07:26.539
cards right so let's use a bomb here and

00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:28.249
I will take champion belt just to see it

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:33.529
does nothing okay so that was probably a

00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:35.689
big waste a waste fellow we could have

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:38.419
gotten diplopia instead but you know

00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:40.129
what mistakes exist to be made which is

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:42.110
an expression that I just made up and

00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:43.610
might sound deep until you think about

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.110
it for like more than 10 seconds it's

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:47.119
like a rules are made to be broken sort

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.309
of things actually I didn't understand

00:07:47.119 --> 00:07:52.099
the the poetic mists of the expression

00:07:49.309 --> 00:07:53.929
rules are made to be broken I always

00:07:52.099 --> 00:07:57.379
thought that was just bad justification

00:07:53.929 --> 00:08:00.349
for you know behaving poorly like a boys

00:07:57.379 --> 00:08:03.409
will be boys sort of thing my son you

00:08:00.349 --> 00:08:05.689
know crashed his bicycle into the moon

00:08:03.409 --> 00:08:07.399
why are you just quoting the plot him et

00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:11.149
filtered through 13 years of having

00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:12.409
never seen it but actually it's kind of

00:08:11.149 --> 00:08:14.539
genius right rules are made to be broken

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:15.649
because if you never made the rule it

00:08:14.539 --> 00:08:17.449
couldn't have been broken in the first

00:08:15.649 --> 00:08:19.819
place rules are made to be broken it's

00:08:17.449 --> 00:08:21.669
kind of a an ingenious saying now is it

00:08:19.819 --> 00:08:25.189
used predominantly for justification

00:08:21.669 --> 00:08:26.749
most rules are not made to be broken and

00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:28.519
I think I've had this bit on the show

00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:30.889
before even where I took like the

00:08:28.519 --> 00:08:32.300
opposite position but if I make a rule

00:08:30.889 --> 00:08:35.449
that's like hey don't drink and drive

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:37.250
that's not really well you made the

00:08:35.449 --> 00:08:37.640
rules so now we got to break the rule

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.160
but

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:42.470
I guess by definition you can't make a

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.120
rule without creating the possibility of

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:46.070
it being bro you get what I mean like

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.600
it's kind of it's it's mildly

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:48.980
interesting to think about at best but

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.800
I'm still milking it here for some time

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:56.600
okay because my brains not working that

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:58.640
well today I'm genuinely trying I woke

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.600
up today I felt pretty good it's one of

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.910
those things you know with you when you

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:04.040
work with your voice you don't actually

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:07.250
know how you feel until you can hear

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:09.170
yourself so I woke up and I was like got

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:10.430
10 or 11 hours of sleep last night

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:11.330
that's the kind of rest you need when

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:13.120
you're feeling a little under the

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:15.290
weather

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.610
thought I felt pretty good and then Kate

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.260
was like how are you feeling and I was

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:20.750
like oh pretty good

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:23.570
like I sounded like I was a 200 year old

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:28.130
like I got transformed into a frog by a

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:30.710
witch or something like that but I feel

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:36.190
good nananananana I knew that I would

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:41.150
now a tenon and an Internet I feel good

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:45.350
all right P James Brown uh okay this one

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:47.630
goes all the way so we should be smart

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:48.770
but I could definitely take some deal

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.380
with the devil items we've got a ton of

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:54.500
HP recently don't really care about moms

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:57.050
underwear which i think is very

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:59.510
advisable I think you go Guppies paw and

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:03.110
goat head like there's a case to be made

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:05.540
and I think it you know we have so many

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:09.230
lives take a little bit there's a case

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:10.760
to be made for little brim uh and I took

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:12.980
it the case being made here was that

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.870
nine lives means that we can get HP back

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:18.280
later anyway but I think the the more

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:20.750
like kind of logical case is the idea of

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:22.670
you know we we can now choose when to

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:24.320
shoot sometimes if we have a tear in the

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:27.470
air already we can still charge another

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:33.470
one up the downside is if I shoot to try

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:37.580
to hit an enemy with little brims then I

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:40.190
might fire a terrible pong tear that

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:44.240
allows us to not hit any enemies for far

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:45.950
too long it works

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.720
but yeah I think this look this will go

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.220
fine we just got to be careful to not be

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.600
like a little over-aggressive on deals

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:53.000
with the devil but with nine lives like

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:55.220
if we if we create guffy it's over

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.770
because here's how the the meta will go

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:58.940
we'll shoot at one enemy that enemy will

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.589
die because it's getting hit for a

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.660
hundred damage it'll create a fly that

00:11:00.589 --> 00:11:06.770
does 200 damage and then these flies

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:09.290
seek out enemies to kill so we're uh and

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:10.850
not to mention like the eternal hearts

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:12.350
have been out of control but we're

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:14.810
pretty much golden if we get one more

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:21.080
copy item which i think is almost the

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:22.940
more likely outcome now try to give this

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:25.160
like as straight up and down as possible

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.120
and he should be dusted you got our deal

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.750
with the devil chance at one hundred

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:31.880
this wouldn't be a bad one to have no

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:32.750
deals for and it effectively has zero so

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:36.470
I'm okay with that

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:38.120
all right I think I was lucky that I

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:40.940
only did like one Isaac episode

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:43.130
yesterday because after the ultra heart

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:45.620
debacle like we totally had the win and

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:47.600
I ruined it and it's hard for me to

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:50.240
accept that like I did get a bad roll of

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:52.779
the slot machine but it's like you know

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:56.240
gambling or something like that

00:11:52.779 --> 00:11:57.800
if you gamble and lose even if you had

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.510
the odds on your side you got to accept

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:01.730
that you know you you made the decision

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:03.950
there I think I understand that like

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:06.260
gambling addiction is an illogical thing

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.550
but I I understand it more than you

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.290
would know because of the fact that I

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:12.050
always I have a gambling addiction to

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:13.430
pills in this game cobalt talks to me

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:14.690
says why do you still take pills in the

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:16.880
binding of issac and I say I don't know

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:18.680
man I'm addicted to the thrill it's kind

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.120
of not on the same level maybe as you

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:23.600
know they're like a pathological

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:25.070
addiction but even the the stakes never

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.649
get higher than they were on the last

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:33.470
run and I still I didn't know how to say

00:12:27.649 --> 00:12:35.089
no so I'm hoping that you know we can

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.709
make it through this on the next one but

00:12:35.089 --> 00:12:38.329
I think I got lucky that I only did one

00:12:36.709 --> 00:12:40.700
yesterday cuz I was feeling like that

00:12:38.329 --> 00:12:43.820
amazing I don't like the the mr. Meeks

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:44.959
excited to be honest with you cuz

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.339
otherwise I could have liked it or

00:12:44.959 --> 00:12:48.920
tilted myself and do like another

00:12:46.339 --> 00:12:51.560
stratosphere I think fine

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.790
find recorded like six yesterday plus by

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.649
the end I would have sounded and

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:56.570
probably looked like just a slightly

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:59.029
more seth rogen ask version of the crypt

00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:03.860
keeper's so glad I didn't follow through

00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:05.199
with the theological extreme there but

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:07.399
I'll level with you we're pretty much

00:13:05.199 --> 00:13:10.910
you know running the clock on this one I

00:13:07.399 --> 00:13:13.459
mean we're at a mom 11 minutes into the

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:19.310
run it's a very good sign for our future

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:27.019
should peep that got book of sin which

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:30.190
is like zero percent worth getting can

00:13:27.019 --> 00:13:32.209
we might want to take a look at this

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:34.579
sadly not good enough cuz that you know

00:13:32.209 --> 00:13:36.199
this is the last challenge in the list I

00:13:34.579 --> 00:13:37.370
don't think it's the last one that we're

00:13:36.199 --> 00:13:38.420
trying for the first time because we

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:40.250
have other challenges we haven't

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:42.019
unlocked yet but after this we'll be

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.639
doing a bit of a reset again so I would

00:13:42.019 --> 00:13:45.529
I would like to have like a little bit

00:13:43.639 --> 00:13:47.600
of a soft send-off to the challenges and

00:13:45.529 --> 00:13:50.779
be like you know thanks for keeping me

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:52.639
busy for like just over a couple of

00:13:50.779 --> 00:13:55.730
months here or just over one month at

00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:57.110
least and you know don't let the door

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:59.690
hit you on the way out I'm a little

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:03.320
eager as you might expect to get back to

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:07.310
the the basics like Amy Winehouse style

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:09.110
but is that back to basics Amy Winehouse

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:12.380
or is back to basics Christina Aguilera

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:14.089
it might be Christina Jennifer Lopez for

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:17.500
kids and I gotta take all of their

00:14:14.089 --> 00:14:17.500
blanks to showbiz

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:28.819
we're done here we're done here thank

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:30.259
you I think we might have been in a

00:14:28.819 --> 00:14:31.790
tough spot on this run I mean now that

00:14:30.259 --> 00:14:34.100
we have the ability to fly it's like a

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:35.360
joke but um I think we might have been

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.139
in a tough spot if we didn't get like

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:40.459
the world's most seemingly unlikely

00:14:38.139 --> 00:14:42.230
quantity of eternal hearts like I think

00:14:40.459 --> 00:14:44.269
we've had more eternal hearts show up on

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:47.690
this run that we've had in like our

00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:49.370
entire history of after birth challenges

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:50.810
sir after birth and after birth plus and

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:54.769
then rebirth shout as I guess now that I

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:56.540
think about it still kind of a weird

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:59.690
weird one I'll be honest with you ponds

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:01.790
not like and hopefully this doesn't you

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:03.440
know counter what I said eight months

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.209
ago when I played it but it's not one of

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:08.420
my favorite challenges necessarily it's

00:15:05.209 --> 00:15:11.839
just kind of it exists it's the

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:13.639
overpowered ones are kind of fun to do

00:15:11.839 --> 00:15:15.680
but not that exciting to beat whereas

00:15:13.639 --> 00:15:17.540
like ultra heart is not that fun to play

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.850
or speed is not that fun to play but

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:21.339
it's it's very exciting to to have

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:23.509
destroyed

00:15:21.339 --> 00:15:25.279
hopefully we experienced that one day

00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:26.870
and overall like if we win this

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:28.459
challenge I think we did okay on the

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:32.689
challenges there weren't too many that I

00:15:28.459 --> 00:15:34.850
was like we got screwed we screwed

00:15:32.689 --> 00:15:36.560
ourselves on a couple like I know we for

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:38.449
the memory we screwed ourselves on ultra

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:42.079
hard although it still would have been

00:15:38.449 --> 00:15:44.990
tricky towards the end no doubt we

00:15:42.079 --> 00:15:46.819
screwed ourselves on brains and I think

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:49.430
speed is just you except that it's

00:15:46.819 --> 00:15:52.009
difficult so I don't think we really had

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:53.990
much agency over that but I'll take that

00:15:52.009 --> 00:15:58.730
over getting like unwinnable seeds at

00:15:53.990 --> 00:16:01.310
least if I'd if I died I did it my boy

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:02.480
very very good Frank Sinatra impression

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:05.959
there it turns out all you need is about

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:08.300
like 20 milligrams of mucus shoved up in

00:16:05.959 --> 00:16:11.660
your nostril that might be actually like

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:13.069
a negligible amount of mucus I don't

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.389
know how much mucus ways cuz it's

00:16:13.069 --> 00:16:17.620
attached to the cave walls of your

00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:17.620
nostrils most of the time

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:22.570
stop stop thank you

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:24.490
I forgot about the next step set it up

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:26.110
open up shop we have one luck I'll take

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:27.700
it we got HP for the next floor anyway

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:29.410
we've only got one deal with the devil

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:35.350
remaining I think we're in a glorious

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:37.150
spot here and this one it's Polaroid so

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:39.430
it goes to the chest which is of course

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:41.860
great for us where do those flies come

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:45.880
from I did it fly away

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:48.870
I mean we're clearly not Guffey maybe we

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:52.480
killed a champion they gave us a bunch

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:56.350
stompy that's the transformation luck

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:59.850
please luck be a lady okay we're not

00:16:56.350 --> 00:17:03.720
gonna go down that road too much I

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:06.190
almost feel like I should just take

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:08.560
every single rangedown pill we have

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:10.810
maybe our tear will last less long and

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.160
we can shoot faster but I worked it out

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:15.940
of my head and I'm like that's not how

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:26.080
that works that's like that's like some

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:28.660
badass science right there so think like

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:30.220
it's just they probably change the

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.930
parameter correct me if I'm wrong here

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.670
they probably set the parameters so your

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:37.900
rate of fire is about as long as your

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:38.950
tear survives on default range so I

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.930
think we would just end up walking

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:43.450
around a little bit more frequently

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:47.830
without anything showing up to hurt

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:51.070
enemies which would be poor pardon me by

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:53.380
the way I know it's unpleasant a little

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:54.850
bit to listen to to listen to a sick guy

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:58.690
talk if you got that like Florence

00:17:54.850 --> 00:18:02.770
Nightingale sort of that should remove

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:04.620
our transformation screamer if you've

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:07.060
got that Florence Nightingale like

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:10.750
compulsion going on there I promise you

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:12.490
I feel okay it's not like a you know we

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:14.470
watch professional athletes go out there

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:15.880
and take a hit from do two weighs as

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:17.620
much as a freight train and we go he

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.870
deserves it you know that's what he gets

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:22.050
for picking this career we are going

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.050
down

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:34.400
feel for them don't feel for me ah look

00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:38.710
I'll do it I should not do it it's the

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:41.630
perfect like mistake here nine lives and

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:43.130
fighting hush on a challenge not a good

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:43.880
idea but what do we have working in our

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:47.450
favor

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:52.370
guppies pas really good damage also

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:57.710
being guppy pretty positive tears down

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:59.870
doesn't affect us thankfully rotten baby

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:01.130
or it tears upgrade well I don't think

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:03.559
our tears upgrades are ever going to

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:05.270
affect us so getting the occasional fly

00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:11.780
that does 200 damage is way more

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:13.370
valuable thank you for the key now you

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:15.590
should be really asking if I'm feeling

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:22.460
okay cuz I just chose to fight hotshot a

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:25.909
challenge in which it was optional but I

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:28.429
think we should be good to go I also

00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:31.159
feel like you know with low shot speed

00:19:28.429 --> 00:19:34.190
it's kind of bad but as long as we shoot

00:19:31.159 --> 00:19:35.990
like straight left and right we should

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:38.480
be in a pretty good spot here the shots

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:42.580
will like a hit appropriately ideally

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.580
first phase was a joke more or less

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:50.000
second phase we just want to I guess hit

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:52.130
with little brim as much as possible get

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.020
those running baby shots in there and we

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:55.309
I mean I wouldn't say that we got the

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:57.230
the keys to the kingdom here but we

00:19:55.309 --> 00:20:01.429
didn't get an insignificant kind of set

00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:05.049
of upgrades there if we could only get

00:20:01.429 --> 00:20:05.049
our flies

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:12.310
to actually target the right enemy this

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.930
might even be like close to the ideals

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:18.940
set up to fight hush considering like

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:24.190
his super armor should rarely activate I

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:27.310
hope I don't like that our shots

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:33.730
ricochet off the flies that's that's

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:38.530
doing me dirty please that was a good

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:40.120
shot we only get one blinding light

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:42.970
every time the blinding light comes in

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:44.380
there on the eye like the entire shot

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:46.180
has blinding light but when it collides

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:48.040
with the enemy does it only make one or

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:50.230
does it make like one per tick or does

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:54.460
it have a chance or I think it only

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:55.600
makes one one per enemy I should say cuz

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:59.860
if there were multiple enemies I think

00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:04.090
we could get more but to be honest it's

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:05.350
a question better answered by someone a

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:10.570
little bit closer to the metal than

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:12.460
myself probably I know what you're

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:15.130
thinking NL you got a perfect nerd voice

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:17.500
right now I won't do it I won't do it

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:20.890
you know why cuz I resonate with the

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:22.630
Nerds there's probably plenty of jocks

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:24.310
who sound like I sound right now they

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:26.260
just got you know their nose all stuffed

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:28.120
up with whatever I don't even I don't

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:31.240
understand what gives the the nerds this

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:32.800
voice in popular media but the Nerds are

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:35.620
my people I won't insult them like that

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.240
you can be a nerd as long as you're not

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:40.050
a dweeb then you're cool with me

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:44.950
you're cool in my eyes they should say

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:49.750
Peter Gabriel style so mercifully this

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:51.160
is like an actual 10 out of 10 run we

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:55.870
killed hush without getting hit which is

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:57.670
quite rare and on top of that like

00:21:55.870 --> 00:22:07.270
rotten baby is actually a stone-cold

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:10.440
killer what we must go this way and then

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:10.440
like down into the left

00:22:12.149 --> 00:22:19.480
yeah Rawdon baby is gonna absolutely be

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:20.799
a menace here no the first time we get

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:28.320
hit in a hundred years and it's by a

00:22:20.799 --> 00:22:28.320
freaking spider verus it's not okay I

00:22:30.269 --> 00:22:42.639
would like some keys clips has told me

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:43.629
that they open doors push a tea just

00:22:42.639 --> 00:22:49.779
keep it going

00:22:43.629 --> 00:22:51.220
easiest win of my life and dude all like

00:22:49.779 --> 00:22:53.200
you know like I've worked in our office

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:56.470
job I know like 2:30 on Friday rolls

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:59.649
around you got visions of crack and open

00:22:56.470 --> 00:23:02.440
a cold one with the boys watching a

00:22:59.649 --> 00:23:04.869
movie something like that I got that

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:07.929
right now but with like dayquil and

00:23:04.869 --> 00:23:10.539
tomato soup like I'm gonna finish this

00:23:07.929 --> 00:23:13.720
video I've had a can of garden vegetable

00:23:10.539 --> 00:23:15.399
soup in my cabinet for like probably a

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.960
year and a half it's still good don't

00:23:15.399 --> 00:23:19.899
worry

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:21.309
there were war rations man who's good

00:23:19.899 --> 00:23:21.840
enough for granddad it's good enough for

00:23:21.309 --> 00:23:24.519
me

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:28.509
no I'm gonna do this whole floor because

00:23:24.519 --> 00:23:31.239
I can and because YouTube rewards you

00:23:28.509 --> 00:23:33.519
for time watched on a channel based

00:23:31.239 --> 00:23:34.749
level so it's really like win-win as

00:23:33.519 --> 00:23:39.820
long as you guys enjoy watching the

00:23:34.749 --> 00:23:45.249
content um let's go full on permanent

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:47.320
Polaroid here plus we can get some more

00:23:45.249 --> 00:23:51.100
items like pyromaniac for example than

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:52.989
that which we can't use but still like

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:57.600
that can of soup is gonna be demolished

00:23:52.989 --> 00:24:01.450
put a fight I know that it's not like

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:04.210
this easy but like can you just cure the

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:06.700
common cold already it's the stupidest

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:08.799
disease now there's probably people who

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:10.899
have the same level of education or less

00:24:08.799 --> 00:24:14.859
as me that would tell you why what I

00:24:10.899 --> 00:24:16.809
just said is idiotic as I will always

00:24:14.859 --> 00:24:18.249
tell you as far as I'm concerned you can

00:24:16.809 --> 00:24:21.399
quote me on this even if we're in a job

00:24:18.249 --> 00:24:26.019
interview together my bachelor's degree

00:24:21.399 --> 00:24:27.999
is like deprecated it doesn't mean as

00:24:26.019 --> 00:24:31.539
much as it did you know the day after I

00:24:27.999 --> 00:24:33.220
got it however I just don't understand

00:24:31.539 --> 00:24:36.159
that we've we've cured polio but the

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:38.190
common cold is like still sitting there

00:24:36.159 --> 00:24:41.470
we got like eight different kinds of

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:43.539
erectile dysfunction pills can't cure

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:45.100
the common cold cut it might seem like

00:24:43.539 --> 00:24:46.899
it's relatively minor and I think it is

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.600
it compared to like you know a terminal

00:24:46.899 --> 00:24:51.279
disease or something like that but

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:53.730
common cold costs like billions of

00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:57.299
dollars a year in lost productivity and

00:24:53.730 --> 00:25:01.389
that's just talking about the youtubers

00:24:57.299 --> 00:25:03.519
yeah curse thy great item make our rate

00:25:01.389 --> 00:25:08.700
of fire like even worse look at how long

00:25:03.519 --> 00:25:08.700
it takes to charge this is beautiful

00:25:09.659 --> 00:25:14.409
luckily I don't even need to shoot

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:17.200
anymore it's probably not that easy it's

00:25:14.409 --> 00:25:18.609
probably not like they wanna cure the

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.019
air they have the ability to cure the

00:25:18.609 --> 00:25:24.519
common cold they've just chosen not to

00:25:20.019 --> 00:25:30.669
but still listen to me I'm suffering get

00:25:24.519 --> 00:25:34.029
on it doctors you see I'm afflicted

00:25:30.669 --> 00:25:38.049
still a flick still afflicted with you

00:25:34.029 --> 00:25:42.039
oh dude

00:25:38.049 --> 00:25:45.999
let's go easy win we should really wait

00:25:42.039 --> 00:25:48.669
for our charge to be ready just in case

00:25:45.999 --> 00:25:49.980
cuz I'm pretty sure one shot from this

00:25:48.669 --> 00:25:53.470
will destroy him

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:56.529
it wasn't even close honestly but I was

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:59.169
worried about the teleportation green

00:26:10.749 --> 00:26:14.889
