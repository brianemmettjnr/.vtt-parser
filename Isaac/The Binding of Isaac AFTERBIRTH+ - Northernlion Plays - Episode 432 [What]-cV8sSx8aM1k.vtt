##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.449
everybody welcome Megan online please

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.870
binding of issac

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:12.889
after birth plus you got a look at it

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.839
you got a look at who we got here

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:19.830
Samson No Azazel it's perfect

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:23.100
Azazel has not done a run to the end he

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.800
has done wait a minute he's not done a

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.720
run to the negative that's fine don't do

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.199
Lizzy's I'll just do it on this we got

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.469
to do is asel at some point okay c n9 v

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.910
7m three Zed

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.890
there's always the chance with Azazel

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.700
you end up having a little bit of a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.430
snoozer

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.649
I would never dispute that so you know

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.510
you start with brimstone even a short

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:51.090
brimstone is like it's powerful you know

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.520
it's like being in the culling and

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.899
you're like oh I only have a shotgun

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.430
look I'm probably shouldn't reference

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.739
player unknowns battlegrounds instead

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.840
but in battlegrounds you know you get a

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.180
gun all the time so what I'm trying to

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.460
do is Park him back to the more modest

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.590
days of the Battle Royale genre when

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.090
perhaps that firearms were a little bit

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.860
more rare so if you had one you were

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.750
already in like an amazingly

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.479
advantageous position which is how we

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.520
are raid here you know we got such

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.280
ridiculous damage output yeah we got to

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.460
get close to enemies but it's a small

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.299
price to pay the Sun card is also really

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.579
good either way though you know we did

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.409
our last run as blue baby it was tough

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.150
to start with then we got the shears and

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.220
it was actually pretty easy then we

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.680
ruined the shears by using them

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.290
accidentally and that wasn't very smart

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.700
but we came out of the you know he

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.750
smelled like a rose at the end of it

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.360
regardless I also picked up magic much

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.710
magic mush not magic much like much

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:56.579
music in Canada so magic mush obviously

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.570
I mean our damage is now absurd it was

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.920
already really good but it's approaching

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.570
madness levels I think we got to check

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.490
this double key room unfortunately not a

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.149
reroll room but hey you know a little

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.149
bit of HP

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.640
not gonna turn up my nose at that

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:17.910
because I've got a problem with his

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:19.560
baggy clothes trying to think like well

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.000
what do we need is to say so first off

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.370
we need to provide an entertaining run

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.250
secondly we don't need boss rush so we

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.510
don't have to speed through the run

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.920
unnecessarily I mean it's kind of hard

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.790
to avoid when you got nine point

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.520
whatever damage little Molly percocet

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.650
their mom's wig doesn't oh my god mom's

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.050
wig is azazel I think we just got really

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.140
good luck there but as long as you're

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:47.270
holding the charge button down you can

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.130
spawn spiders that's amazing

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.820
so as like this interim period where

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:56.280
we're going from room to room we can get

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.540
like an unbelievable cache of spiders

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.860
working out in our favor here

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.480
potentially you know I gotta hit this up

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.450
a little bit I mean like every time we

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.000
charge up these shots we're presumably

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.330
gonna be making like one to five cents

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.830
so I'm probably not gonna break all the

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.690
poop on the room but that card ended up

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.450
being very valuable at least it wasn't a

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:23.459
freakin a hang demand card like we

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:26.280
usually get sometimes you got to do two

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.330
passes and that's just outrageous I mean

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.160
I don't want to spend my whole life

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.200
shooting these poops I think we're we're

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.180
striking a balance between you know

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.760
taking forever and doing our due

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.530
diligence here so you know this gives us

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.750
enough money to be very productive for

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.500
the remainder of the game and I'm

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.160
excited to be a part of it let's just

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.600
bust up these ones okay maybe not those

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.090
ones those ones didn't want to be busted

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:53.400
there you go one cent per quadrant here

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:55.800
there you go oh you broken my heart two

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.209
of them broke my heart

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:02.170
probably should go to the secret room

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.790
but I'm I'm like back on my BS again if

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.590
you know what I mean this run is it's

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.510
triggered the Zane right off the bat and

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.470
a little range upgrade as Azazel never

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.489
hurt anybody

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.709
let's take a Thames and Bank this

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.930
remaining HP for the future we might end

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.370
up doing boss rush just because we can

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.810
at this point when we were three minutes

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.610
in on the caves one as long as bombs

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.620
can't destroy my spiders I'm never gonna

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.810
complain about it so how do we use the

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.210
Thames to our maximum advantage on a run

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.790
that's already like so powerful that I

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.010
doubt we'll get hit very frequently at

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.660
least until the final bosses that punish

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.169
you for having a little bit of a lower

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.450
range cap but uh honestly do we have

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.160
dull razor unlocked is that a booster

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.360
item or is that an afterbirth + item

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.729
because if it's afterbirth Plus you

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.340
might have to unlock it but we might

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:53.440
have already unlocked it otherwise dull

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.540
razor once every two rooms you pop a

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.220
Thames crush the enemies with the circle

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.990
gain some demon hearts in the process

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.130
and like before you know it you're off

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.130
to the races my dudes

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.740
and I'm loving this mom's wake payout as

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.480
well

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.340
it also I'm assuming that you know

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.139
behind the scenes it's kind of tied to

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.510
our tier stat cuz you know that the tier

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.830
said with charge tiers just changes the

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.300
speed at which you charge but I am

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:27.570
assuming that it also influences how

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.639
frequently it checks to see look I don't

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.710
know if you guys know probably like a

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:33.810
superstar programmer I've taken a couple

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:37.380
of program while I take a vacation but

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:39.150
anyway I'm assuming that every time the

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.250
tier fires we have moms wig it

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.380
essentially behind the scenes rolls the

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.180
dice or flips a coin and goes does this

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:49.080
guy deserve a spider on this one due to

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.669
the the arbiter of randomness and I'm

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.770
assuming the higher your rate of fire is

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.270
even with charge tiers the more

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.479
frequently it's gonna flip that coin and

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:00.810
thus the more the more times you're

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:04.710
probably gonna get heads because you're

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.270
buying more lottery tickets you got to

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.160
go blank card and then you got a check

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:15.450
blank card Emperor dude I mean that's

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:18.210
like extremely good yeah I think we're

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:20.460
out of here so blank card Emperor is I

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.979
mean it's amazing for like several

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.390
reasons but one of the big ones here is

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:26.450
that if we wanted to we could probably

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:29.190
finish this run in like eight minutes

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:33.210
the other one is that we can use it to

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:35.430
get out of boss rush and if we end up

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.200
being low on HP which you know I'm not

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:41.729
gonna say I'm a perfect izing player has

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:43.650
happened even as Azazel sometimes we can

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:48.300
skip a lot of those floors that are

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:50.400
unlikely to have good benefits to being

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.900
there you know rewards for existing on

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.070
those floors like the womb for example

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.479
and instead just rush it so remember

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.090
we're going to Sheol this time I got to

00:06:54.479 --> 00:07:00.030
remind myself that because it's it's

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.320
happening pretty quickly here no I don't

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.510
want whatever you're selling I don't

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.160
want it yeah get out of here that's

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:09.360
that's a garbage item for a garbage

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:11.070
player that's not for me look I'm like

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.350
that Bruno Mars song that's what I like

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:16.980
you know

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:18.330
I what does he say I forget because I've

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.730
heard it on the radio but usually I'm

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.870
driving and when I Drive I am focused

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.670
because I treat driving as a

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:29.340
responsibility and not a pleasurable

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:30.960
activity he says a beach house in Miami

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.940
not interested personally but if that's

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:36.480
what you want more power to you I mean

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:38.340
as a millennial the cul rune bag blank

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.070
card now we're talking that's what I

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:43.080
like as a millennial the concept of

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.820
owning a house is a little outrageous

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.440
and then you're talking about a beach

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.240
house I don't know what the real estate

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.670
markets like in Miami I mean it's a

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:53.070
major city so I'm assuming it's like you

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:55.580
know not cheap but maybe cheaper than

00:07:53.070 --> 00:08:00.450
some other places

00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:04.320
hmm as we move down here we might as

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:06.660
well I mean we got the perfect like

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.130
mom's wig payout here we got more rate

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:10.170
of fire which is what we wanted and then

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:13.410
combine that with a little bit of this

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:14.730
hot action from hivemind and all of a

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:17.250
sudden we got these spiders that are

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:19.230
doing you know 18 point three six damage

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:21.180
when they collide into an enemy not

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.770
enough to kill most enemies but you know

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:26.820
when you get eight or nine of them in a

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:28.320
row it's enough to put a damper on even

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:30.450
like the heaviest boss here so I think

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.070
you blank card the gauze and then you

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:34.200
two Goss grab yourself a little bit of

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:36.690
extra HP as you move forward here I'm

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.979
exploring because why wouldn't I you

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:40.289
know we got plenty of time here and

00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:43.169
these floors have a tendency to provide

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:45.240
us with some useful advantages so I

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:47.850
think we're you know we win the more we

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:49.640
explore on this floor at least in the

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:52.730
future that could change pretty easily

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:54.990
he also that Bruno Mars says everything

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:57.210
24-karat and I don't even know what that

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.770
means I don't even want a salad with 24

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:02.100
karats Center I recognize that it's a

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:03.770
reference to jewelry I just don't this

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.840
is 24 karats

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:09.000
high value jewelry is it the more carats

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.520
the better is 24 karats like a standard

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.760
luxury item I don't know because that's

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.440
not what I like that's what I like if I

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:19.830
was Bruno Mars love interest what would

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:22.380
I ask him to get me I don't know if he

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.690
could max out my RSP and TFSA

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.340
contribution room

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:27.380
that'd be nice it's like our version of

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:29.180
a Roth IRA and whatever the other one

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.710
you guys have is I can't remember in the

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.850
US I say you guys as if you're all

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:34.070
American watching this which

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:40.760
demographically is not quite true but

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:43.370
it's up there I think we should just

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:47.690
walk so that we save our our charge here

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:49.780
I would ask him hey you know you make

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:52.160
millions of millions of dollars a year

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:53.420
if we're flying somewhere cuz you pay

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.710
for my ticket I don't want to sit in

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.330
first class I've never bought a

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:58.400
first-class ticket in my life perhaps

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:01.550
one day we'll be will reach that point

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.140
where I feel comfortable paying way way

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:05.120
way too much money for like an

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:10.640
experience that's usually less than ten

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:12.110
hours long somehow doubt it though but

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.730
if you could pay for my economy ticket

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:17.210
that'd be fine honestly Bruno you're not

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:18.230
even gonna notice is the thing we got to

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:20.270
be careful by the way cuz if we

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:21.980
accidentally teleport into the mom fight

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:27.080
we're stuck in there well we could use

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:28.880
our emperor card like I'm not I'm not

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.890
gonna ask you to make sure we're flying

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:35.030
on a private like chartered jet through

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:35.900
just let me let me sit in coach I kind

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:39.830
of don't understand the value

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:42.650
proposition of first-class and I'm gonna

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:43.880
be honest with you there are times when

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:45.590
I could probably afford getting a

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:48.320
first-class ticket and not sweat it too

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:50.150
much it might be dishonest to suggest

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:53.270
otherwise however I talked to other

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:54.230
content creators and I'm not naming in

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.310
shame in here because I don't think

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:57.920
there's anything to shame you know they

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:59.840
pay for the ticket they they can talk

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:02.360
about it however they're always like

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.800
they have a tendency I think to almost

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:07.090
talk down to you they're like we'll have

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:11.420
you fly a lot there's a big difference

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:12.680
and I like I fly all the time are you

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.930
there's nothing special there nothing

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:18.790
special day I fly all the time oh if you

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:21.110
took long flights you would know I dude

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:23.720
second flight I ever took in my life

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:25.940
14 hours in South Korea then back to

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:27.130
I've been not back to South Korea but

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:30.040
I've been in Japan

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:32.680
you know like to in from like seven

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.940
times or something well seven is an odd

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.890
number because that implies that I'm

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:38.530
there right now I suppose but no you

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:40.120
know I've I've been flying overseas I've

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:43.840
taken a lot of 10-hour flights

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:45.550
here's my airplane situation all right

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.760
here's what I do I get on pop the

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:50.110
headphones in watch a movie

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:53.800
rinse and repeat it's like a while loop

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:55.740
while the flight is not on the tarmac at

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:58.560
the destination that we're going to

00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:00.820
watch movies that's it

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:04.990
try to sleep sometimes you can catch

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:07.510
like a catnap rarely though I just think

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:08.800
the first class is like some wealth

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:13.950
signaling or something that I don't

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.950
understand and I used to like when I

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:19.270
when I would walk you know you board the

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:22.090
plane the first class people are already

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:23.410
on the plane people just donate a bunch

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:25.510
here this is the kind of run where this

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:27.760
is suitable but you walk past the first

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:30.940
class people and they're like getting

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:33.850
champagne and you know suka threw a

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:37.540
towel and you know when I was younger I

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:40.000
was like dude one day I would love to be

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:41.410
a first class boy but now I don't feel

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.270
jealous when I walked through the first

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:46.120
class section cuz I understand that they

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:50.050
give them free alcohol so that they are

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:53.050
a little too inebriated to realize that

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:54.970
they're paying you know $800 to sit in a

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.680
nicer chair for like two hours these are

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:59.080
the same people to go to the mall and

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:01.210
their kid would be like hey mom can I

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:03.700
sit in the massage chair sweetie that's

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:05.380
two dollars from ten minutes it's a

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:08.860
waste of money I don't think one

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:12.610
first-class ticket please of madam that

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:15.070
would be $1500 uh they just put it on my

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:18.250
miles yeah I mean when you get it for

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:19.990
miles that makes sense but I know some

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:22.060
of these people they're paying cash for

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:23.560
it by the way as always I want to point

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.210
out many people watching this a probably

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.680
flown first class like you don't

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:28.450
understand it's worth it if you think

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:31.650
it's worth it that's the spirit of

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:35.800
economics okay I'm an unabashed

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:37.210
capitalist despite it you know sometimes

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.610
you get too much credit for it don't

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:40.450
read that far into it sometimes you know

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.010
it's a car

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:43.240
no sin on the internet don't read too

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:47.920
much into it that's all I'm trying to

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:50.590
tell you it and that's the spirit of the

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.510
of the capitalist system is that you

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:55.510
know you you pay what you feel good is

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:56.830
worth or what they're charging you for

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:58.510
it and you have no choice because it's

00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:02.800
medicine you know one of the two either

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:05.170
way I just if I could if I could Bank a

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.790
few hundred to uh you know a thousand or

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:09.700
more extra dollars just by sitting in a

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:11.320
chair that's relatively comfortable but

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.180
not quite as comfortable

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:15.070
sign me up dude that's that's the

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:18.610
easiest money I've ever not spent in my

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:21.810
life we just yera nothing despite there

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:21.810
being an emperor card on the ground

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:29.410
I find out in you know let's let's turn

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:30.790
it back around on myself I find it hard

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:37.720
to spend money on myself as an

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:42.790
experience 5050 cuz you know it's no

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:45.460
secret Kate and I do travel we I've cut

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:46.300
down on it massively oh that's two God's

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.470
not yera

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:50.310
right right right right it's the visual

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:52.480
studio logo mostly because you know I've

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:55.690
come to terms of the fact that I have a

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:57.580
job to do and and I love doing it so I I

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:59.200
don't like to be away being away is

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:02.350
almost more stressful than being on the

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:04.570
job a lot of the time as bad as that

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:06.070
sounds and I do think it sounds bad you

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:07.720
might think that I'm trying to you know

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:09.040
sound honorable that's not the case I

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:14.440
think you you know knowing when to

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:16.210
disconnect is very healthy uh know okay

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.950
we got to see what the eyeball tears do

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:20.710
as is asel even though they're garbage

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:23.950
they don't seem to do anything get out

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:25.860
of here dude is that oh that's a double

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:28.870
tinted rock I think right there

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:31.630
interesting but apart from that I don't

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:33.040
know I find it find it hard to spend

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:38.800
money on myself

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:40.839
I don't want goods most of the time

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.880
anyone else relate to this there's got

00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:44.080
it cuz I'm cut from the same cloth that

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.050
I think a lot of people watching this

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:51.910
video will be cut from I actually don't

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:56.650
like owning expensive material goods

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:58.180
because I'm clumsy and like prone to

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:59.560
losing things from time to time so it

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:03.070
almost feels like giving me it short

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:04.690
like for for our anniversary

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:07.990
Kate was like I gotta get you something

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:10.209
nice and I was like no you don't you I

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:12.459
would actually I'm not gonna take any

00:16:10.209 --> 00:16:14.500
offense and I'm not just saying it I'm

00:16:12.459 --> 00:16:19.120
gonna take zero offense if you get me

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:21.310
nothing and she goes no I can't do that

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:23.070
and I go I mean you believe you could do

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:25.510
that

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:27.850
how does it's a bad hug Allah is

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:29.140
actually kind of dangerous you could get

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:31.260
me nothing in the end she didn't give me

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:34.480
another she got me a nice belt so now I

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:36.220
still dressed like I'm in 11th grade but

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:38.320
I got a nice belt to go along with it

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.940
you doesn't matter because I never tuck

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.830
in my shirt cuz I'm self-conscious about

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:44.560
a little ponch that I'm developing at

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:46.330
the end of my young adulthood but you

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.470
know one day one day that's gonna be

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:51.670
taken care of and I'm gonna show off

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:53.590
this belt definitely okay grab that and

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:55.270
we're steamroll in this run right now we

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:58.540
almost like half the fight hush just a

00:16:55.270 --> 00:17:02.950
pat out the video length here I don't

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:03.340
understand it you know I mean I guess I

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:07.240
do

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:11.500
I suppose the the idea we're gonna by

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:12.850
the way go for uh we're gonna go for

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.560
this cursed room because we could get

00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:16.450
the guppy dream which with high mine you

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:20.890
got to go for it I guess the idea is

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:22.630
that luxury goods are nice you know my

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:25.420
parents are pretty modest I think I

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:26.860
inherited that to some degree well I

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.940
don't even want to know who crashed the

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:30.280
game if we go through the room like that

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:31.960
I think I inherited a little bit of that

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.720
from them and you know they were like

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:36.850
you know their philosophy was I you know

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.350
a discount good is just as good as a

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:40.300
luxury good you're just paying for the

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:42.580
label I think that a lot of the time

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:44.290
that might be true but you know I have

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:46.690
encountered some luxury goods and I'm

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:48.820
like you know what that's nice we park

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:52.330
our Ford Focus next to like you know a

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:54.310
couple Mercedes coupes down here in our

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:56.050
parking garage or you gotta grab this I

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:59.110
look inside the interior and I go you

00:17:56.050 --> 00:18:00.370
know what their interior is nice it's

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:04.510
nicer than our car and I'm not ashamed

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:06.370
to admit it but I just don't you know

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:08.050
someone will like Drive a Tesla and I

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:11.080
see it and I'm like that's a nice car

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:12.730
but I don't really want it I mean if you

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:15.370
were giving me a car for free in the

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:17.290
year like do you want your Ford Focus or

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:20.080
do you want this Tesla I'd be like you

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:22.059
know what you've been good to me focus

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.529
but give me the Tesla but if they were

00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:25.210
like you're gonna have to pay for the

00:18:23.529 --> 00:18:27.970
Tesla or the Ford Focus sorry you know

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:32.799
what oh that's scary you know what I'm

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:36.669
fine with the focus dude does not bother

00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:41.850
me PhD now I'm not trying to make myself

00:18:36.669 --> 00:18:43.779
out to be a saint here or like extremely

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:47.140
what's the word I'm looking for

00:18:43.779 --> 00:18:51.100
frugal cuz I'm not really you know I'll

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:52.240
buy name-brand foods I eat out now and

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.230
then probably more than the average

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:56.110
person

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:58.510
except Austin isn't really eating out if

00:18:56.110 --> 00:19:04.330
you order in I would say yes but you may

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:05.889
disagree but the material goods thing

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:07.720
I'm just never understood I was the same

00:19:05.889 --> 00:19:09.820
way like as a child and I'm telling you

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:11.559
this not to seem braggadocious but

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:13.059
rather so that if you're out there and

00:19:11.559 --> 00:19:16.230
you're like I feel like I'm the only one

00:19:13.059 --> 00:19:23.380
you're not and there are dozens of us as

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:24.850
you answer adulthood here I see it a lot

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.230
in the YouTube community and I'm not

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:29.340
gonna you know bite the hand that feeds

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:32.110
here at all but think it's you get this

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:34.059
you know you kind of are in the interest

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:35.889
of maintaining a public image I guess if

00:19:34.059 --> 00:19:37.659
you're running a big youtuber a twitch

00:19:35.889 --> 00:19:39.250
channel and then combine that with the

00:19:37.659 --> 00:19:41.350
fact that a lot of people running these

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:43.000
you know a lot of these personalities

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:45.370
because it's video game focus tend to be

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.519
a little bit on the younger side I see a

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:50.919
lot of people bragging about spending

00:19:48.519 --> 00:19:52.990
their money on luxury goods and I'm like

00:19:50.919 --> 00:19:54.399
Dawg your salary is basically publicly

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:56.110
available information I don't know if

00:19:54.399 --> 00:19:58.269
that's an astute financial decision but

00:19:56.110 --> 00:20:00.549
you know what you got a first off you

00:19:58.269 --> 00:20:02.919
choose what you value and you throw your

00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:06.789
resources after it no question about it

00:20:02.919 --> 00:20:08.500
but then secondly like don't let me tie

00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:09.820
out a live your life you got to make

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:15.240
your own mistakes and that goes for me

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:17.409
as well I'm sure but when I see like a

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:19.330
19 year old youtuber and they're like

00:20:17.409 --> 00:20:27.789
check it out I bought a Ferrari I'm like

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:32.399
ah don't do that that's crazy just my

00:20:27.789 --> 00:20:32.399
personal advice just my personal feeling

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:39.110
why don't you throw that in an index

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:45.260
fund making 7% annually then 30 years

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:47.390
you could buy eight Ferraris or like 200

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:50.060
Ford Focuses which is really weapon we

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:51.860
operating my own Ford Focus taxi fleet

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:54.560
assuming the corporation still exists

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:57.860
when I'm 65 also cars will probably be

00:20:54.560 --> 00:21:00.860
self-driving by then so it may be save

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:02.240
on labor costs either way I'm just

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:06.280
laying you know I was the same way as a

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:09.290
kid you know when I was when I was young

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:11.030
like really young I wanted things you

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:13.610
know I always wanted this is like my

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:16.000
crown jewel like if I had a million

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:19.850
dollars what would I buy I would buy the

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.620
$300 Toys R Us pool table that also

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:23.780
converts into a ping-pong table that

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:25.970
also converts into a bad pinball machine

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:27.530
that also you know it's like master jack

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:30.890
of all trades master of none sort of

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:33.170
thing that was like my dream purchase

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:34.760
and I never got it but one of my friends

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:37.070
had it and it sucked and I was like you

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:39.080
know what I'm glad I didn't have it but

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:40.940
then like from the time I was like 11

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:43.090
onwards my parents to be like hey what

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:45.260
do you want for Christmas I don't know

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:47.660
and then they'd be like you know it's

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:49.970
December 20 if you got to give us some

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:52.580
clues and I just like write down you

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:56.900
know some some names of some CDs and be

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:59.080
like yeah this is what I want the

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:01.700
self-titled debut album from bewitched

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:04.970
you know in hindsight not a good

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:06.590
fiduciary decision unless you know one

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:08.690
day it becomes a collector's item which

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:10.040
it's kind of why I keep bringing it up

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:12.830
in the hopes that maybe one day that'll

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:14.150
that'll come to pass anyway that's just

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:16.730
that's just my two cents

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:18.620
I'm not you know I'm not like you're an

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:21.500
idiot if you want to buy a you know a

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:22.490
Gucci pair of leggings or something like

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:24.010
I don't even know what that means we

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:28.190
just got my little boy dude that's

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:30.430
dynomite um but I'm just letting you

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:33.350
know if you're out there and you're like

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:34.010
everyone seems so vain don't worry about

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.930
it man

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:37.910
see my philosophy is you don't judge a

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:39.380
person by the clothes they wear the car

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:40.910
that they drive you judge them by the

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:43.310
decisions that they make at the grocery

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:44.350
store cuz that tells you who's who we

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:46.590
have no keys bye

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:51.640
way we definitely should not have opened

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:52.900
everything on the on the hush fight but

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.549
I'm glad we did the hush fight cuz we

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:57.340
actually have not done it before we did

00:22:54.549 --> 00:23:03.070
do boss rush before but as Azazel but

00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:07.000
we've never done hush what oh no I was

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:10.900
supposed to go down to Sheol I'm a big

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.690
ol moron man well thank God we fought

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:16.150
hush then we took the negative and then

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:17.770
we fought Isaac well what a great idea

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:20.350
hey for now thanks for watching i

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:22.450
acquiesce and request permission for my

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:23.740
idiocy never attribute to malice that

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:25.299
which can equally be explained by

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.770
ignorance if you enjoyed the episode
