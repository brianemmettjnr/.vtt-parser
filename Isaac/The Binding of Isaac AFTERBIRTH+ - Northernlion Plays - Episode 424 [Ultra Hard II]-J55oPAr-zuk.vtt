##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.290
hey everybody welcome back to nor the

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.259
lion place the binding of issac

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.230
afterbirth plus we got one challenge

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.679
remaining and our second like reunion

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.970
tour is gonna be complete here LFA p3

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.369
re6 I'm gonna hold our cuz it's ultra

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.400
hard and the the gist of voltar I wait

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.310
are there item rooms on ultra hard there

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.740
might not be item rooms I might be an

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.000
idiot and we also probably should not be

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.120
going to curse rooms right off the bat

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.030
okay either way we're gonna we held our

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.950
to start with ultra hard to refresh your

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.040
memory I believe now that I think about

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.320
it no item rooms definitely no HP has

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.829
ever dropped including spirit hearts so

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.969
that grossly changes the kinds of items

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.020
we want to see the number one thing I

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.520
think if you want to make an alter our

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.110
challenge work and I say this is an

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.359
expert a guy who's beating the challenge

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.699
what in time before you want to there's

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.920
two ways to do it now both of them

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.090
unfortunately essentially have no we

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.710
have no control over them I should say

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.939
it's really just what shows up but I

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.119
mean I don't know if there's a point to

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.009
using a bomb there to be honest we could

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.500
either get so strong we never get hit or

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.790
we could get defensively powerful so

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.009
that getting hit doesn't matter as much

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.110
you're not gonna drop a spirit heart

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.210
that makes me a little upset but you are

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.979
gonna drop a cube of meat I really think

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.990
that the the genesis of winning the

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.280
ultra hard challenge is like a little

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.079
bit of a a merit-based slot machine

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.850
merit based well it's a slot machine

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.380
because we're really relying on this

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.320
first deal with the devil to carry us

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.549
and merit-based because we need to get

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.759
the deal with the devil which requires

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.070
us to make it through a an Excel floor

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.930
without getting hits because we can't

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.899
really generate spirit hearts either I

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.009
feel like maybe with Book of Revelations

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.340
or something like that we could generate

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.930
them but we'll find out perhaps or we

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.119
won't I goes I guess those are the two

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:08.069
options that exist here little horn and

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.069
this is the hardest of all the little

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.900
horns this is the one that shoots the

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.370
bombs that do contact

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.310
to you so I'm just gonna try to stay

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.290
away as far as I can if I can get him to

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.040
go into the fires that he creates that's

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.780
excellent

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.790
apart from that though I'm not even

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.569
gonna use my own bomb I'm just gonna try

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.310
to keep him like as far away as is

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.720
plausible and if I can get him to hurt

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.720
himself then the world's our oyster

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.379
we're almost almost set here like five

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.510
more hits that could've hit me okay

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:46.859
we're safe

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.989
we got HP we got headless baby mi got

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.190
Guppies hairball neither of these are a

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.829
ten out of ten let me check this

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.829
ultra-hard have item rooms ultra-hard

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.750
all enemies of Champions curses no

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:06.530
hearts can be found there are totally

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:11.159
item rooms we just got a bunch of like

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:13.260
pretty bad seeds I guess that did that

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.730
didn't give us one to start with so we

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.709
should definitely go back and look for

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.819
those that would have been idiotic I

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.650
know you're gonna say didn't you just do

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.419
this challenge recently well with every

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.910
challenge being a little bit different

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:25.500
you know I'm trying to keep them all

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.530
straight up top but it doesn't always

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.859
happen that way small rock is I think if

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.389
not the best perhaps the only good setup

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.849
that we can get at this point from a

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:37.530
tempted rock technology zero is a good

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.379
item I say that because we can't get

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.729
spirit arts is what I mean and scapular

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:46.620
scapular won't do anything for us but

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:48.720
that's okay I actually think we have an

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.780
adequate start good damage good rate of

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.129
fire unfortunately pretty not amazing HP

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.690
because we went hard on the deals with

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:59.310
the devil I guess another approach we

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.540
could take is to just not take our deals

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.859
with the devil because we have curse of

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.500
the blind always but that doesn't sound

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.090
like me does it I don't think it turned

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.739
out badly like guppies hairball could be

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.810
excellent for us so we'll save a key and

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.199
get an item immediately the item is

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.599
Butterbean which is I'll just call it

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:22.019
it's useless I know what you're gonna

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:23.700
say but you have no spacebar items so

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.210
you can use it to deflect bullets okay

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.830
like one in 80 rooms this

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.419
might be used worth something but

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.270
compared to what we could have gotten

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:36.370
from like a random drop from an item

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.370
room it's pretty disappointing I think

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.979
either way though there's there's very

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.759
limited reason I think to be

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.759
disappointed by this run right now

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.940
there's a couple of things we should

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.590
really keep a close eye on though like

00:04:49.940 --> 00:05:00.919
we definitely want to get read chess

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:03.830
wherever they're available come on

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.750
because red chests are a basically a

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.280
cost free way to potentially get guppy

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:13.910
items which as of right now is extremely

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:16.250
important I will use a bomb here magic

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.190
must be like amazingly good we didn't

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.889
get magic much but pushpin is a little

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.659
bit better than useless and that's that

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.009
says you know I don't want to dammit

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:26.479
with faint praise but that's about as

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:34.509
good as we can get there on that subject

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:36.770
so we'll continue to move on here

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:38.120
second item room also high on the

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.400
priorities list and by the way if you're

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:44.090
hoping for a good commentary in this

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.680
episode so am i but I would I would warn

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.020
you to prepare for an acquiescence and

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.180
that acquiescence is that Evanescence is

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.800
no we're not gonna go down that road but

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:56.000
wake me up inside please we're gonna

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.539
probably be focusing a lot on the

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.060
commentary because we more or less saved

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:04.009
the worst for last I think I mean it's

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:08.889
the last in the list as well except for

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:08.889
pong which we handled pretty easily but

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:15.289
15 cents I don't know there's no way to

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.550
purge these curses right like black

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:18.889
candle will not purge them for us

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.479
anymore uh we need to focus is what I'm

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:22.580
trying to say here was I get like you

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:25.940
know a sidetracked on different topics

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.469
over and over but we need to focus one

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:31.610
way or the other try to make this one

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:33.110
work stay vigilant I'm disappointed that

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.520
I took damage but our odds on this floor

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.169
of the deal with the devil were low and

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.680
it wasn't because of the tangents that I

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:39.350
was going

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:43.039
I took damage I just I got worn down

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:49.759
alligator took me down in my prime so

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:51.800
this floor stay vigilant if we could get

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:53.990
permanent piercing shots with static

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.940
tears that would be amazing a really

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.610
good rate of fire increase number two

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:01.520
you might think that I'm against number

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:04.330
two that's not the case though I'm I'm

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.590
mostly very for it

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.860
not gonna spend my whole life looking

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:11.539
for uh you know mushrooms to blow up

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.130
with number two but anything that gives

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:15.500
us some extra damage is pretty useful if

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.030
we can get like maybe glitter bombs

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.580
number two I'm wondering if we can make

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.770
something happen there you know it

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.270
endless consumables I'm kind of grasping

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:29.780
at straws because that's that's all we

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:32.660
got also oh no we got a scapular does

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:35.240
work I thought I'd drop the spirit heart

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.610
but it does not it uh it creates a

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.380
spirit heart out of nothing so actually

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.970
this is potentially really useful I know

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.139
you're saying this items been in the

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.820
game for ten years and you don't know

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:47.060
what scapular does it's always been an

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:48.260
item I've kind of shied away from for

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:53.330
worse there's no for better or worse

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:56.240
behind there's just for worse but we are

00:07:53.330 --> 00:08:00.530
actually in a really really good spot as

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:02.510
a result of that I don't know what I'm

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.460
gonna do with it but what I will say is

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:06.080
that at the very least it raises our

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.370
odds of a deal with the devil I mean it

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.330
raises our odds of a deal with the devil

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:13.820
on this floor because we're pretty

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:15.650
unlikely to get to get hit at this point

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:18.490
I'd say I'm not not right now but

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:21.970
against them it's gotta be magic or mini

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:24.320
magic we're in a such a good spot now

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.610
but it raises our odds on this floor

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.050
because we're more unlikely to take

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:29.840
damage against the boss now is what I'm

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:32.300
trying to say which give allows us to

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.880
preserve that like 18% chance whereas

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:36.380
before we would be beholden to the the

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.149
traditional rules of trying to just not

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:42.289
get hit which we'll still try to do but

00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:44.180
oh no I've gone cross-eyed again but now

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:47.529
rate of fire hasn't increased but our

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:47.529
damage is up in the eights there

00:08:48.639 --> 00:08:54.829
which is good enough to be very very

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:58.810
pleased with mom's pearls is range which

00:08:54.829 --> 00:08:58.810
I'll accept with static tears is not bad

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:06.889
but definitely I'm a little bit more

00:09:03.439 --> 00:09:08.329
interested in improving in particular

00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:12.379
our rate of fire yeah that's gonna

00:09:08.329 --> 00:09:13.759
that's gonna hurt bad positioning I'll

00:09:12.379 --> 00:09:15.860
own that one we could have placed

00:09:13.759 --> 00:09:17.689
ourselves better the Dodge was

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.279
impossible but we could have been a

00:09:17.689 --> 00:09:25.310
little bit more proactive about putting

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:27.350
ourselves in a spot to not get hit this

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:30.949
would be an amazing deal with the devil

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:33.230
chance if the items are good no deal

00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:36.259
with the devil chance binky is a nice

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:38.180
tear upgrade though I don't know if I'd

00:09:36.259 --> 00:09:40.069
say we've got like a great chance of

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.420
winning this because I don't know if you

00:09:40.069 --> 00:09:44.839
ever have a great chance of winning

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:47.930
ultra hard but I think this is looking

00:09:44.839 --> 00:09:51.259
real strong and kind of uniquely strong

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:53.300
for ultra hard as well we have great

00:09:51.259 --> 00:09:56.420
damage deceptively great damage I might

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:58.129
add missing tear effects that can make

00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:00.470
it like 11 out of 10 but we were

00:09:58.129 --> 00:10:07.610
probably the solid like eight camp right

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:13.129
now he sounds about as surprised as I am

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:16.009
in phase 19 sense is a shop item you got

00:10:13.129 --> 00:10:18.379
a try for a shop item a better space bar

00:10:16.009 --> 00:10:20.360
item then Butterbean will be worth it

00:10:18.379 --> 00:10:22.579
like all and of course there's good

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:26.089
passives as well like you know champion

00:10:22.579 --> 00:10:27.649
belt but all of the traditional Isaac

00:10:26.089 --> 00:10:28.610
know how kind of goes out the window for

00:10:27.649 --> 00:10:29.750
this one really go why don't you just

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:31.250
wait for the next floor but it's not a

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:34.040
curse about oh right oh well why don't

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:35.629
you just you know try to get into Gaza

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.220
Renault right why don't you just lean oh

00:10:35.629 --> 00:10:39.350
there's no way to purge these curses so

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.720
we we kind of have to make low

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:42.769
percentage plays and then Bank on more

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.930
of them than we would otherwise expect

00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:46.670
coming through for us and I'm okay with

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:51.050
that I'm okay with rolling the dice here

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:55.429
cuz it's only got to work once oh there

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:57.629
was a an exit there okay we'll fight the

00:10:55.429 --> 00:11:00.160
first boss

00:10:57.629 --> 00:11:03.579
you know me well enough to know perhaps

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:05.230
that I want to fight both bosses right

00:11:03.579 --> 00:11:06.550
here but I'll start by just fighting the

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.949
first one and then we'll remember that

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:12.189
like that was close

00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:15.699
just up and to the left is where we

00:11:12.189 --> 00:11:17.470
would expect to find the boss fights

00:11:15.699 --> 00:11:19.779
we're not worried at all about boss rush

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:23.889
by the way box of stuff not a better

00:11:19.779 --> 00:11:26.709
trinket another infested card or pill

00:11:23.889 --> 00:11:29.559
the Justice card which does not give us

00:11:26.709 --> 00:11:32.230
HP it's tempting but that's the wrong

00:11:29.559 --> 00:11:34.209
play the right play and this is kind of

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:36.009
like my you know Luke Skywalker in the

00:11:34.209 --> 00:11:37.209
forests of daga bah I know dag abuzz a

00:11:36.009 --> 00:11:38.980
swamp but you know he goes into that

00:11:37.209 --> 00:11:40.870
tree and fights like the holographic

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:43.209
Darth Vader this is my moment here I

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:46.269
have to slay myself to beat the ultra

00:11:43.209 --> 00:11:49.120
hard challenge I have to not rush even

00:11:46.269 --> 00:11:51.189
though this is the stupidest challenge

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:53.319
of all time and I mean that curse of the

00:11:51.189 --> 00:11:55.240
maze plus curse of the lost is just the

00:11:53.319 --> 00:11:56.949
dumbest and I'm not saying the people

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:59.259
who made it are dumb I'm saying the

00:11:56.949 --> 00:12:01.839
setup as they've chosen it is dumb lord

00:11:59.259 --> 00:12:04.209
knows I consider myself you know I'm

00:12:01.839 --> 00:12:05.470
decently smart individual that doesn't

00:12:04.209 --> 00:12:09.009
mean every decision I've ever made has

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:11.319
been smart that it's just infuriating to

00:12:09.009 --> 00:12:12.970
not only not know where you're going but

00:12:11.319 --> 00:12:19.149
be forced into making wrong turns as

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:21.699
well so I am kind of tempted to go to

00:12:19.149 --> 00:12:27.639
this curse room but I'm gonna abstain

00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:28.959
for now continue try to trying to find

00:12:27.639 --> 00:12:30.279
the item rooms here and the shop for

00:12:28.959 --> 00:12:34.480
that matter we've seen none of the item

00:12:30.279 --> 00:12:35.740
rooms which means I actually have a high

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.519
degree of confidence that hopefully

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.519
we'll see some over here

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:47.440
the battery not good for what we're

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:49.300
presently using it for the Sun is

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.130
actually an amazing card for us though

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.680
it's not good for what we're presently

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:56.920
using it for but it's not bad if we can

00:12:53.680 --> 00:13:01.500
get a better item like can we blow this

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:03.900
guy up maybe you'll give me 6 cents okay

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:07.450
no such luck

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:10.810
it's ok we got work to be done here to a

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:12.310
diamonds Joker card uh let's just use it

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:15.490
cuz we're gonna save the Sun card anyway

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:18.520
I I have to and I think that this has

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:20.440
done it actually you might look at this

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.760
and say you idiot what have you done I I

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:26.620
don't think that's the case I think

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:29.050
we've done it because now we can

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:30.670
actually regenerate HP we could have

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:33.550
done it with a scapular earlier but it

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:37.900
would have been tedious now we've got

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:40.810
like genuine fairly easy means to

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:48.040
improve our HP so multi-dimensional baby

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:49.480
was not worth what we paid for it I do

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.010
think it's not worth going to curse

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.390
rooms anymore either I don't know what

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:54.130
you're gonna say like the Sun card you

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:56.670
just you just squandered its usefulness

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:58.660
do I have to agree to disagree there I

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:02.680
think there's still a chance that the

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:09.130
Sun card could be could be important for

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:10.900
us just not yet obviously we're not

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:13.650
gonna be able to use it for mapping dude

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:17.770
I'm just see this is where I like to

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:22.840
kill the boy Jon let the man live we

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:25.030
gotta get over our bad habits this is a

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:27.420
floor we haven't seen either item room

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:34.470
yet we should explore we should be

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:34.470
diligent to a fault another Joker card

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:39.790
potentially honestly more useful than

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.860
the Sun card but the Sun card has value

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:43.750
later and I can't help but feel that the

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:46.830
Joker card kind of is also like the

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.830
spectre of my own demise

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:53.830
well we've found a new room but it

00:14:51.700 --> 00:15:02.320
doesn't border anything but it does give

00:14:53.830 --> 00:15:07.960
us a battery charge I think this is the

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:09.700
shop no it leads to the shop this could

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.560
be a secret room which might be a puzzle

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:14.529
piece here god I hate that

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:17.860
just take one the challenge would still

00:15:14.529 --> 00:15:21.070
be as hard if you just remove one of

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:22.330
this stupid like oh you can't see where

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:22.900
you're going and you can't see where

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.700
you've been

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:27.490
like just take one of those away and

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:31.330
it's still annoying like you still troll

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:36.790
people holds up spork but like you're

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:38.680
kind of double dipping on the madness

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:40.450
here with this double curse silliness

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:42.779
and it is a little bit of frustration

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:45.850
talking but at the same time I'm jeez

00:15:42.779 --> 00:15:48.339
people talk about you babe say I'm doing

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:50.050
me wrong doing you wrong but don't you

00:15:48.339 --> 00:15:52.930
worry don't you worry don't you worry

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:55.180
worry cuz I'm right here right here

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:57.460
right here where I belong

00:15:55.180 --> 00:16:04.330
I believe that was Oscar Wilde who said

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:12.010
that no I'm not leaving until I get both

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:13.900
item rooms I would love to leave but I

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:15.760
would hate to watch me go so we been

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:18.910
down this way 20 times so we know that

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:20.680
that's just like oh okay we know that

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:22.450
that leads to despair we've obviously

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:25.510
been in this room you've obviously been

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:27.910
in this room this is the curse room

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:30.820
don't you know what I'll do it you

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:32.140
you've you've broken my heart and you

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:35.080
forced me into coming into the curse

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:37.510
room I'll blow that guy up you got an

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:40.360
eye can see forever he'll pay very close

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:42.040
attention because I want to know where

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:46.240
those secret rooms are this is shop

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:48.279
access I think the secret rooms could

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:51.100
hold the key to getting to the item room

00:16:48.279 --> 00:16:52.450
and maybe breaking this curse okay so

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:55.270
that was the curse of the law so I have

00:16:52.450 --> 00:17:01.420
no idea where we are now

00:16:55.270 --> 00:17:03.340
haha oh what fun we'll have so that's

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.570
another I can see forever pill which I

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.700
shouldn't have taken it in hindsight

00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:08.170
we're not gonna use it because we have

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:11.940
to we're gonna store the stun the Sun

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:16.420
card instead got a second secret room

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:18.400
pinky I um honestly I think the 10%

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:20.770
chance of the piercing shots is actually

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:23.110
better but I think we could probably say

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:25.690
the goat of giving us the speed is even

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:28.330
better than that it's not a decision I

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:29.680
make lightly but the piercing shots are

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:33.610
great when they work but it they're

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:35.920
unreliable and low percentage this is

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:36.670
what I'm hoping for here yeah yeah this

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.460
is fine

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:41.350
kill greed get just enough money to have

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:42.880
given us the ability to buy the other

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:44.530
item now we did get enough so we're

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.670
gonna go back for it and now we're on

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:47.770
the other side of the map that was

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:49.300
apparently like impossible for us to

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:51.670
access otherwise I know it like

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:53.350
literally wasn't but if you'll allow me

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.940
to complain I'd appreciate it you guys

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:58.480
are not gonna give me spirit hearts

00:17:54.940 --> 00:18:02.220
unfortunately it's okay the more rooms

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.220
the merrier dude because we also get

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:10.650
more charges for Satanic Bible so I

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:10.650
always say the more rooms the marion

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:17.470
came let's try this way instead then and

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:19.270
this is why this challenge is dumb in my

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:22.480
opinion like i know we're kind of

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:25.360
railing against it try not to be overly

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:27.100
dramatic or disrespectful here but we

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:31.300
spend like eight minutes just walking

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:33.160
around cool that's extremely challenging

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:35.410
it's challenging on like a personal

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:38.110
level is like a why am i subjecting

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:40.110
myself to this level and i will

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:42.220
appreciate the sense of you know

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:44.320
accomplishment once we finished it but

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:46.240
until we reached that moment I'm kind of

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:49.240
like please God spare me

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:53.080
blue baby's only friend is actually just

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:55.780
fine not not in not a negative word I

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:58.620
can say about this one we're not going

00:18:55.780 --> 00:19:02.170
to use it to productively I think

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:05.440
probably focus more on the tears which

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:07.629
are already very high damage but

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:10.720
certainly not disappointed to see it now

00:19:07.629 --> 00:19:13.570
I got to find the way back otherwise I'm

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.389
gonna be stuck forever now quietly goat

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:19.889
head there's like goat hoof just like

00:19:15.389 --> 00:19:19.889
completely justified its existence there

00:19:21.269 --> 00:19:28.029
because I could have easily taken damage

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:33.700
by it a little bit less speed so that

00:19:28.029 --> 00:19:35.049
0.15 you know it makes a difference so

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:37.360
that's where we entered okay so let's

00:19:35.049 --> 00:19:40.860
they probably join up back there I'm not

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:43.299
worried about money essentially at all

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.710
take me back to the shop if we just walk

00:19:43.299 --> 00:19:50.799
right curse of the maze will eventually

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:52.120
take us back I'm sure now are we back at

00:19:50.799 --> 00:19:57.639
the spawn or we back we're back at the

00:19:52.120 --> 00:20:00.100
shop we buy this item converter I think

00:19:57.639 --> 00:20:01.629
you still you do it with one even though

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.700
it's gonna mess up permanent polaroid

00:20:01.629 --> 00:20:06.429
invincibility it's an important get

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:07.750
because this allows us to take a deal

00:20:06.429 --> 00:20:09.639
with the devil without it costing us

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:10.899
three we're not gonna take a deal with

00:20:09.639 --> 00:20:13.059
the devil here cuz we've already taken

00:20:10.899 --> 00:20:14.500
them but we will potentially want to

00:20:13.059 --> 00:20:17.230
take deals with the devil in the future

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:18.879
so the sun card also now is a little

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:20.559
closer to having merit although

00:20:18.879 --> 00:20:23.649
admittedly not quite there yet

00:20:20.559 --> 00:20:26.710
now we know where to go this is an

00:20:23.649 --> 00:20:29.860
important one read mom probably the

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:34.269
easiest now an orbital will make pretty

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:37.139
short work of earth as long as we don't

00:20:34.269 --> 00:20:37.139
get hit by our own bomb

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:43.980
easy easy easy okay the negative so we

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.810
died we don't have to worry about polar

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:47.340
item instability whoa but there is a

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:50.400
tinted rock which golden chest I guess

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:51.270
is the best outcome yeah okay down to

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.250
the next floor

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:54.720
we still beat boss rush or like made it

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:59.880
fast enough for boss rush which is

00:20:54.720 --> 00:21:01.920
really just a testament to took curse of

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:04.260
the labyrinth basically making it almost

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:07.500
impossible to miss boss rush plus our

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:09.810
damage is good I guess okay so you

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:12.690
should really end it it's hard for me to

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:14.910
be the bigger man in this situation but

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:16.290
we should pretty much except here that

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:18.300
the longer it takes us to beat this

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:21.120
floor the better it is because it gives

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:23.040
us more charges on Satanic Bible which

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:27.840
gives us a much much greater chance to

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:29.490
win as is right now I think we're in a

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.710
good spot we also have a lot less

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:33.000
incentive to backtrack because we don't

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:38.190
have to worry about item rooms or shops

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:42.000
anymore but the temptation is still

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:43.830
there to try to go fast and going fast

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.410
gets a bad rap usually it's an

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:50.640
indication of strength not just

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:52.890
impatience but here it's really I was at

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:55.020
attempted we'll never know

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:57.680
going slow is more an indication of

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:59.700
uh-oh right we have no control over

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:02.910
being able to see where we're going on

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:06.360
this one no as long as if we die on this

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:08.250
run we die it's a hard challenge it's

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.810
not like we're throwing an easy win this

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:12.990
is definitely a ticket in the lottery

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:15.360
like this a good ticket as well like a

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:18.540
golden ticket like having a Golden Sun

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:21.180
up in the sky but if we got ourselves

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:23.220
killed on this run by using number 2 I'd

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.600
be real sad now it's not like we had a

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:28.470
choice whether or not to take number 2

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:29.580
all of our items or question marks that

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:31.160
being said I would have taken it

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:35.000
regardless so it's kind of an argument

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:35.000
taking in bad faith I think

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:46.120
battery charges please

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:49.960
I might not reroll my whole run because

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:52.270
I like this run that we've managed to

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:55.210
inherit for ourselves but you know we do

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:56.770
have a lot of keys and I'm I can be a

00:22:55.210 --> 00:23:00.790
wild card sometimes let's see what we

00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:02.380
get done I'm hip I'm with it have we

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:03.970
finished like a full charge of this yet

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:07.410
are we always just getting batteries I

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:07.410
like it that way

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:20.470
no oh my god now I'm like begin the

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:23.020
impossible step of like retracing your

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:26.860
steps impossible task I should say

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:28.690
batteries none good floor so far though

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:32.830
remember we don't actually have like

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:35.140
Excel floors after this point just go

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:41.650
straight down to Sheol I believe this is

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:46.179
uh I can see forever the other pills nah

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:47.800
that's uh that's for the birds man pills

00:23:46.179 --> 00:23:51.280
that we already know are good I'll roll

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:53.970
with everything else you know why why

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.970
mess with it right now

00:23:56.010 --> 00:24:01.650
fish ed it could be good but I'm gonna

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:01.650
stay away

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:09.970
mostly because the extra speed Trump's

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:12.610
the ability of us to get the occasional

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:14.830
extra fly I think okay so one boss dead

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:16.900
this guy I think we got him on the ropes

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:18.940
honestly our range is high enough that

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.590
we can abuse the size of the room to

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:25.930
make sure we don't get hit too often if

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:27.400
ever that guy can be a real jerk so I

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:30.370
think it's a testament to the strength

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:32.560
of this run i watch that so badly that

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:34.360
we're in a good spot here PJ's is a huge

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.280
get those spirit arts could potentially

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:38.200
like you know allow us to coast to the

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:41.860
end of the game now we still do have to

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:49.800
beat mega satan here not to mention you

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:49.800
know all of Sheol Satan himself etc etc

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:54.730
two hits

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:56.620
okay maybe not enough to take us to the

00:24:54.730 --> 00:25:00.580
end of the game in hindsight but still

00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:03.130
pretty good you got it you definitely

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:08.920
like do not have to and that's gonna do

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:12.340
nothing for us whoa that's gonna do

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:14.560
nothing for us but still so now the Sun

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:15.670
card is going to be worthless so what we

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.130
should do is very simple

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:20.530
find a room that's bad use the Sun card

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:26.020
to make it not so bad and then take your

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:29.040
time again the longer this goes on the

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:29.040
better it is for us

00:25:32.919 --> 00:25:37.809
you got a like charged key or something

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:37.809
there

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:46.100
I would say that is decent use of that I

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:52.250
wish that we'd gotten the fourth one but

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:54.560
I understand the shoal here is the last

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:56.270
floor as well we go down to the dark

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:58.190
room we hope to get to copy items out of

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:59.680
our red chest probably won't life goes

00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:04.580
on

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:07.910
then we fight mega Satan we're in a very

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:13.100
very good spot to make that mega Satan

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:15.110
fight turn out decently we have kind of

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:16.640
gotten a little bit slower in our

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:23.270
ability to kill rooms here as time has

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:29.330
gone on still rocking that 8.4 damage

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:30.580
from like the caves XL but as long as

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:34.810
we're patient

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:34.810
we got everything going here

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:45.590
didn't leave ruin the the challenge for

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:47.210
ourselves last time by taking the health

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:55.070
down pill at the very end is that what

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:57.800
happened it seems to ring a bell no I

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:59.360
don't understand I wanted to blow up the

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:02.080
door so we didn't have to finish this

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:09.200
fight because I think that it's just

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:13.720
unnecessary for us to be here so make it

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.720
worth my while please single bomb

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:25.299
that was pretty dumb that was ten times

00:27:22.539 --> 00:27:27.700
dumber which is I think we had they got

00:27:25.299 --> 00:27:29.200
the name for the movie uh what movie

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:35.169
Pride and Prejudice of course what do

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:37.780
you think I was talking about just hold

00:27:35.169 --> 00:27:39.520
it together we have so little to

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:42.309
actually worry about if we just handle

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:45.880
this you know in the normal way it'll

00:27:42.309 --> 00:27:48.520
also be such a good like cap off to our

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:50.470
reunions who are on these challenges to

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.400
finish every single one of them the

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:54.429
second time

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:56.380
yeah maybe a couple different attempts

00:27:54.429 --> 00:27:59.200
per video on some of them required but

00:27:56.380 --> 00:28:00.760
some of these challenges real hard man I

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.510
mean this one has got it right in the

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:10.960
name there

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:15.520
I do wish these floors could stop being

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:21.010
25 light years long that's another

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:22.659
problem for another day okay I mean this

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:24.130
is the secondary problem here is don't

00:28:22.659 --> 00:28:25.960
really want to walk through the same

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:27.940
room 20 times just to figure out if it's

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.590
a dead end or not but I digress

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:30.909
I don't think about the fact that you're

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:32.320
still on the challenge think about the

00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:34.510
fact that the challenge is almost over

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:37.590
don't cry because it's over smile

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:37.590
because it happened man

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:46.529
only using blue baby's only friend here

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:55.769
because this guy is a real jerk about

00:28:46.529 --> 00:28:59.159
knock-back good good I'll call it if we

00:28:55.769 --> 00:29:03.419
beat Satan without getting hit 100

00:28:59.159 --> 00:29:05.219
percent chance we're gonna make it

00:29:03.419 --> 00:29:09.779
through the the mega Satan fight okay

00:29:05.219 --> 00:29:15.299
I'll downgrade us now to like a 95

00:29:09.779 --> 00:29:20.969
percent chance remember this this

00:29:15.299 --> 00:29:26.719
version of Satan cheats by the way he

00:29:20.969 --> 00:29:26.719
moves oh I blew myself up

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:33.530
it's got to lay off that trigger finger

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:47.180
from time to time

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:49.940
no nur no no stop it it's okay we need a

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:54.730
couple of things right now to play

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:57.530
better and to have a little bit of faith

00:29:54.730 --> 00:30:03.410
we have one luck we could do rooms I

00:29:57.530 --> 00:30:06.980
don't think we want to please we can't

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:10.400
get we can't get spirit arts so we're

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:13.670
looking for guppy items pills are fine

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:15.790
if they're good it doesn't matter that

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:15.790
much

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:31.410
this could pretty easily be the dumbest

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:36.240
thing I've ever done but I'm gonna try

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:37.380
to ride it I want to get another I want

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.950
to get another item I want to get

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.950
another charge

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:46.890
no no battery charges

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:49.140
you're the battery charge boys you gave

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:51.540
me no charges well at this point we kind

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:56.430
of got a tough it out don't we that's

00:30:51.540 --> 00:31:05.220
gonna hurt okay just I would say that

00:30:56.430 --> 00:31:06.510
this was probably a bad call but Winston

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:11.970
Churchill said if you're going through

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:13.950
heck keep going and you know what that

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:16.500
guy had a lot of sick burns in his day

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:18.750
so I'm gonna treat that as some wise

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:22.230
words I think this is gonna be the last

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:25.170
room that I do though it's a little on

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:28.620
the easy side which is good if we get

00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:36.510
like a battery charge an item good card

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:41.430
or pill nothing keep keep trying keep

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:44.940
trying we got this you may well disagree

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:49.620
with me but I think this is the right

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:53.040
thing to do and if I was rushing oh dude

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:54.630
no if I was rushing I would have just

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:57.300
bolted we'd be out of this run you know

00:31:54.630 --> 00:32:02.130
ten minutes ago probably for worse but

00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:03.630
maybe for better I'll admit what I'm

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:05.280
trying to do is do the right thing even

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:09.330
though it cost me a little extra time

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:10.500
here and perhaps ironically time will

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:14.730
tell if it's the right or the wrong

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:16.110
decision to begin with got a bomb one or

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:21.080
two more oh there's a secret room there

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:26.180
one or two more rooms and we get another

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:29.280
Satanic Bible charge here not see it

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:36.550
this is a bad one

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:39.130
these champions might actually be I was

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:41.050
gonna say that they're easier in

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:53.470
hindsight that looks a little ridiculous

00:32:41.050 --> 00:33:04.870
now know how much HP is it plausible for

00:32:53.470 --> 00:33:05.620
one jerk to have nothing dude this guy's

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:08.160
no problem

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:08.160
probably

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:21.640
just like some items please it is highly

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:23.350
a crime to give me all these rooms and

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.660
give me no HP well I guess we got the

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:26.770
charges but this is wait you can't give

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:30.160
me anything useful anyway give me

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:32.800
charges you can give me batteries you

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:35.440
can give me crystal ball you can give me

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:36.940
good cards I'm seeing the spirit are

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:39.160
it's like fall by the wayside here I'm

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:48.640
not happy money equals power that's a

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:51.480
very modest damage increase I'm the

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:55.240
luckiest man on planet earth right now

00:33:51.480 --> 00:34:00.670
well played but also like extremely

00:33:55.240 --> 00:34:02.830
lucky I'm Oh nurse save it save it save

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:04.150
it okay so that's that's our get out of

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:06.660
jail card here and it's certainly not

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:06.660
free

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:26.230
I was very close not a charged key

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:27.460
unfortunately fairly simple room okay

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:31.300
we're starting to pull something out

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:39.420
here I can no longer claim we got zero

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:41.770
items well we know there's gonna be like

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:43.450
yeah I was gonna say enemies down here

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:52.480
so you've already done this room it

00:34:43.450 --> 00:34:54.760
stinks that was their creep well I think

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:56.290
we basically got to own it now we're

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:58.900
gonna get to three and a half what's the

00:34:56.290 --> 00:35:05.470
right play do you try to fight mega

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:08.620
Satan or do you just you do you continue

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:14.710
down this path which this is not the

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:18.190
battery charge you continue down this

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:19.990
path which is quite dangerous could

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:21.300
yield benefits but also the more time

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:23.410
that goes on the more likely we are to

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:26.640
accidentally you know send ourselves a

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:26.640
head first into oblivion right

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:40.790
I think you try I think you try with

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:44.080
three and a half now you might be saying

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:48.590
NL you're pretty dumb for that no

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:50.090
battery the parasites okay you might be

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:52.820
saying NL you're pretty dumb for trying

00:35:50.090 --> 00:36:00.440
to explore the floor and you may well be

00:35:52.820 --> 00:36:01.940
correct but I had I had a strategy did

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:03.470
the strategy work I would say in

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:05.120
hindsight no it didn't unless the

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:06.620
parasite ends up being like 20 out of

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:09.160
ten somehow it's good but I don't know

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:09.160
if it's that good

00:36:16.099 --> 00:36:19.190
so we're gonna be fighting a lot of

00:36:17.509 --> 00:36:23.390
champion enemies in just a second

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:25.779
assuming they can become champions my

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:25.779
own bomb

00:36:26.019 --> 00:36:34.670
we got a hope as I like just abandon the

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:36.940
idea of using number two we got a hope

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:40.309
that some of these champions drop a

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:43.009
battery charge that was an accidental

00:36:40.309 --> 00:36:44.029
number two it worked out but don't let

00:36:43.009 --> 00:36:51.559
that trick you into thinking it was

00:36:44.029 --> 00:36:52.519
worth it okay you might think I'm stupid

00:36:51.559 --> 00:36:55.640
for this but I think we've made it

00:36:52.519 --> 00:36:58.690
through the first phase not catastrophic

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:58.690
ly badly

00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:13.880
certainly I'm far from like outrageously

00:37:05.849 --> 00:37:13.880
pleased but I'm also determined

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:24.069
determined to never do the ultra-hard

00:37:20.289 --> 00:37:26.200
challenge again enemies with creep have

00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:30.359
to go because I like cannot for the life

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:30.359
of me differentiate my creep from theirs

00:37:31.289 --> 00:37:34.440
save me

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:45.249
that bomb exploded so quickly

00:37:40.769 --> 00:37:46.390
that's brim and I get up pretty early in

00:37:45.249 --> 00:37:50.200
the morning to catch me with one of

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:53.140
those brimmer's okay now we just smart

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:55.599
be smart gamble you know be smart

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:58.720
gambler know you know where these shots

00:37:55.599 --> 00:38:00.630
come in just trust your instincts you

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:06.220
follow these angel statues 100 times

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:08.579
probably like actually 1,200 times not

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:08.579
Brimmer

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:17.980
now the final phase is no joke

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:24.869
did that bomb explode I didn't hear an

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:24.869
explosion

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:33.830
No

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:48.000
he's like barely wounded just stop

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:51.530
shooting every now and then can't afford

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.530
to compromise our ability to dodge

00:38:58.610 --> 00:39:06.760
we have actually done it good lord

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:09.110
there was no reason for that who

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.980
Sampson feels healthy well hey thanks
