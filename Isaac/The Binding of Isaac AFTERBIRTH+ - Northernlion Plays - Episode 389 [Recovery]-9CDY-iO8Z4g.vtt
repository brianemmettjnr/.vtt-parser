00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.350
what's up with you boy end of the or

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.629
than lion northern lion here with

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.929
another Isaac episode we lost badly as

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.570
lil as last time and I feel bad about it

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:15.839
but you know what let's try to make it

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.300
like productive badness does that make

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:23.970
any sense who do we not have boss rush

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.529
on Magdalen congratulations you just

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.990
made my list of things to do today

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.579
SX mv0 qc6 renew those bad feelings from

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.880
our last loss even though it was like

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.770
seven hours ago at this point we're

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.410
going to use those feelings productively

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.450
so hopefully few will a victory here

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.460
there's no you know there's no excuse

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.610
said to the run sort of spunk and

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.370
there's no there's no infuse necessary

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.559
is how I would describe it because

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.570
there's no secret that Lilith is you

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.940
know far from my best character we

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.969
didn't exactly have a killer run there

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.620
and we paid the consequence but I also

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.719
could have played better I firmly

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.909
believe that you know within that run

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.920
somewhere was a victory on some runs I

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.960
don't think there is at least not for a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.330
player in my skill level if you're like

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:17.400
extremely good you might be able to pull

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.860
it out but on that one I don't know it

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.509
was it was distant but it existed mostly

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.790
because we had a hive mind infestation

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.650
too but we also had like almost no

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.090
ability to kill things which you know

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.460
comes back to bite you in the butt

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.950
sometimes especially when you combine

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.150
that with the fact that I took deals

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.799
with the devil that maybe we're a little

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.720
bit overly aggressive but I digress

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.479
we're dwelling on the past year my

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.060
present is a present weight my presence

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.680
is a present kiss my butt because that's

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.220
what Kanye West says please stay away

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.720
from me

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.439
I do want your spirit R because

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.700
apparently I can't get bombs to open up

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.310
the other tinted rocks it's like he

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.439
moves slightly further on every attempt

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.799
even if he's already basically colliding

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.799
with the wall

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.770
you know what I never got about Game of

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.660
Thrones why is it that one of the

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.760
brothers is called the mountain and the

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.980
other one is called the hound there's

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.630
two ways you could do this you can call

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.390
the mountain the Fox then you got the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.950
Fox from the hound or you could call the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.190
Hound of the valley and you've got the

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.300
mountain in the valley is this the worst

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.690
idea I've ever had

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.480
yeah like absolutely but at the same

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.610
time didn't it kill 15 seconds of dead

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.530
air and also give me the chance to go

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.120
dun dun good Adam boom through the thumb

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.250
Game of Thrones it's a contentious show

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.320
dude because like a lot of people

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.260
there's like a subset of people that

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.240
have never seen it this is not for you

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.060
there's a subset of people who have seen

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.510
it and don't like it this is not for you

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.340
either

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.340
there's the subset of people who love it

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:01.420
this bit is not for you this bit is for

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.910
the people like myself who like it but

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.450
find themselves like increasingly self

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.580
judgemental about it like season 1 of

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.790
Game of Thrones I was ladies bold

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.320
television season 2 I was like as little

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.910
boring but you know it's setting up the

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:22.330
Dominos seasons three and four or no my

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.700
reaction seasons three and four and five

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.560
and then the end of six I was like we

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.860
got some good stuff going on here except

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.570
for you know Dorne and then in season

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.120
seven so far I found myself kind of

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.640
being like why is the lead singer of

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.090
three doors down terrorizing our poor

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.040
heroes this bit has no staying power I

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.070
just wanted to point out that this

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.570
season's villain if you google it this

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.860
season's villains name I'm not going to

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.970
say because these people haven't caught

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.250
up to this point yet and I know

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.600
everybody everybody's so flippin with

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.120
spoilers these days they're always like

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.070
a tit episode aired on Sunday they

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.840
haven't seen it by now scrolling yeah

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.660
it's not realistic in today's world

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.910
people got responsibilities and studies

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.470
and kids and you know stuff like that

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.040
but you can't do you might not have HBO

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:12.010
they got it they got to wait it out

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.610
google him and send me the responses by

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.400
the way I would love to see them

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.380
that guy's name and then search for the

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.340
lead singer of three doors down and then

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.860
is there any way you could put that

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.509
through the face app to make him like 15

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.220
years older than he was at the time of

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:29.530
the Kryptonite music video and then

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.970
compare them swap outfits I don't know

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:36.009
if I could tell who's who that's all I'm

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:39.280
saying like it's a common face type like

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:40.840
I also have not not necessarily a friend

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.750
not that it matters for the purposes of

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.020
this conversation but there's there's a

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.930
an acquaintance I used to have who has a

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.120
similar face to the three doors down

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:55.720
singer and even as like we met when we

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.949
were like 12 even then I was like kind

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.169
of look like the singer of three doors

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:01.419
down I didn't say it to him at his face

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.250
or to his face at that point because you

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.900
know I wasn't quite the Northern Line

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.400
that you know and love today add the

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.110
self-confidence to just be like hey

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.070
anyone ever tell you you look like dude

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.410
from three doors down view is that you

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.470
baby I'm not going to go down that road

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.990
again because I mostly don't really like

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.400
that song and every time I bring it up I

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.870
end up regretting it cuz everyone goes

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.750
how do you not like that song and I go

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:28.360
oh my God look it's good then everyone's

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:32.349
they go for the jugular dude when I say

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:34.300
I don't like here without you they

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:37.389
always go like Oh with name a song you

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.789
do like Rio by Duran Duran it's trash

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:41.199
let me present my primary sources as to

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:43.030
why you can't convince me that Rio by

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:46.330
Duran Duran is trash I've got the

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:49.570
dirtiest bassline in 80s music great

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.699
vocal line hold the line love isn't

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.770
always on time and each end no chance

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:56.380
okay check our shop here we're actually

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.510
like extraordinarily well equipped for

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.310
party here I don't want any of that

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.099
stuff because it's garbage I will take

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.150
the hangman did a heck out of Dodge so

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:08.210
many bombs now

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:11.960
look at that wonderful situation I think

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.639
it's because people get personal because

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.699
here without you is like one of those

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:19.070
it's a sentimental song if you're the

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:20.900
kind of person who's like you know if

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.949
you're attractive that sort of music and

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.680
I don't mean attractive in like a

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:27.580
capital A sort of way like like you want

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.840
to have intercourse with the song but ah

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.650
you know that's your thing then more

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.990
power to you

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:36.919
contact TLC make a quick buck out of it

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:39.320
that's my suggestion it's the kind of

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:43.520
song that could be like your why did I

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:45.289
take the kind of song that could be like

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.729
your song with your wife or something

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:51.590
like that was like our first dance and

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:54.199
our wedding you know it's another song I

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:58.090
do not like that I have experienced this

00:06:54.199 --> 00:07:03.380
with when I've insulted it is amazed by

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:08.060
Blue Rodeo that no I only do what you do

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:11.419
so in love with you it just keeps

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:16.729
getting better you know that song I'm a

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:18.470
songs trash people you would expect most

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:20.479
of the time are not very defensive about

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.370
their musical tastes are like yo yo bro

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:26.630
though that one is the sacred cow don't

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:28.039
even touch that one I don't know if I

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:32.750
have a song like that for me there's

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:34.849
probably somewhere I'm like you just got

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.260
to respect it I do feel that way a

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:38.990
little bit when people and I'm not

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.940
dangling but when people just write off

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.620
Kanye West because of his ego I don't

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.240
get overly defensive about it but when

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.889
they're like I don't think he's going to

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.310
have any impact on the music industry

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:51.229
like the most influential artists in the

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.750
mainstream at least of like the past 15

00:07:51.229 --> 00:07:55.940
years well when we went to college

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.560
dropouts on that last 13 years he's made

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.630
a huge mark on the music industry you

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.610
just it's okay if you just say I don't

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:03.139
really like his music and I also think

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:05.630
he's a bad person that's one thing

00:08:03.139 --> 00:08:07.580
whenever and not whenever but sometimes

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:09.289
you know this was in a Dan video he was

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.180
talking to a guy who was otherwise like

00:08:09.289 --> 00:08:14.479
really nice and he's entitled to his own

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:15.650
personal opinions but he's like Holly is

00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:17.210
just superficial I don't think

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:19.850
is going to have any effect on the music

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:21.139
industry you know long term like five

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.930
years down the road and I was like you

00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:25.699
listening to yourself

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:27.770
dude still rocking banana pancakes by

00:08:25.699 --> 00:08:29.150
Jack Johnson he thinks Kanye West isn't

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:33.229
going to have any impact on the music

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:36.460
industry anyway but that's just ignorant

00:08:33.229 --> 00:08:36.460
man that's just being ignorant

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:43.219
please give me a deal with the devil the

00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:45.170
opportunity to remove from my possession

00:08:43.219 --> 00:08:48.320
are two remaining red heart containers

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:51.080
in favor of that item is still forgotten

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.680
the name of that takes all of our red

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.660
hearts

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:58.100
I don't think butter does anything for

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:59.959
us here we've never picked it up I think

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.610
so sure let's hold onto it but there are

00:08:59.959 --> 00:09:05.690
items this will work with and we might

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:07.910
be able to find them so I think that

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:10.730
item is actually just gone for my memory

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:13.070
dude say no more team we got this

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:14.450
continuum dude why not our range kind of

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:16.670
stinks right now but continuum can be

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:19.550
cool moving forward and we're opening up

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:22.880
all of these because it's our solemn

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:26.320
hope and dream okay so butter not the

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.320
best choice I would say for shoopdawhoop

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:33.230
it makes it unusable so I would suggest

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.790
that probably we don't want to roll with

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:36.230
it but I'm going to keep it for now just

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:38.690
in case because what we want is like the

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:42.620
gift right from the shop if we can get

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:44.240
the gift we should be good I'm like

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:47.000
backpedaling here because I already

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.070
regret having brought up musical tastes

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.870
over the course of an episode because

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:55.400
it's a sore spot for me when I was

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:58.339
younger I was invested you know I was

00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:00.709
like no you don't understand the best

00:09:58.339 --> 00:10:02.450
album of 2004 is not funeral by Arcade

00:10:00.709 --> 00:10:04.339
Fire it's apologies for the Queen Mary

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:05.930
by Wolf Parade because mom loves Penta

00:10:04.339 --> 00:10:07.700
crowd blahblah and you know that's all

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:10.430
fine and well and good but it turns in a

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:12.290
kind of a snob and the arguments over

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:16.100
like whose taste is better is just like

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:18.529
the stupidest thing to use as a penile

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.880
measuring contest you know choosing your

00:10:18.529 --> 00:10:21.680
friends based on what kind of music they

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.110
listen to is a very don't take this the

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.250
wrong way okay so a lot of people do

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.690
this and I did this for a long time my

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.850
life as well it's kind of a juvenile

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.540
exercise to be like oh why are you guys

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.220
friends well

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:34.459
like you know does it Kendrick Lamar

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:37.339
okay I mean it's not a certainly not a

00:10:34.459 --> 00:10:39.230
bad thing dude I really thought that

00:10:37.339 --> 00:10:43.790
this would give us a second diplopia

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:45.259
just leveling with you there's I mean

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.120
there's worse reasons you can be friends

00:10:45.259 --> 00:10:49.759
because you both don't like Kendrick

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:51.829
Lamar in which case that seems both

00:10:49.759 --> 00:10:54.139
wrong and not necessarily spiteful but

00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:55.490
at the same time you know there's other

00:10:54.139 --> 00:10:56.959
things like how they treat the people

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:59.839
around them you know the values they

00:10:56.959 --> 00:11:01.220
hold since humor they have which of

00:10:59.839 --> 00:11:03.529
course is influenced by the media to

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:07.699
some extent the media they like I should

00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:08.899
say either way I'm getting off topic all

00:11:07.699 --> 00:11:10.519
I'm saying is didn't mean to turn it

00:11:08.899 --> 00:11:12.470
into like them you know your music

00:11:10.519 --> 00:11:13.850
versus my music sort of things I don't

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:15.259
like that argument I think we should all

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:17.750
be free to say our opinions without

00:11:15.259 --> 00:11:20.560
turning it into like a you know an

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:23.480
ego-driven sort of like oh yeah well

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.610
pitchfork media thinks that my taste is

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.259
better than yours

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:31.839
get dusted you've unlocked something

00:11:27.259 --> 00:11:33.860
cute in the depths could we not though

00:11:31.839 --> 00:11:36.220
dude this is going to be like record

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.220
time

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:42.410
we are absolutely torching this run I'm

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:48.949
using I knew I shouldn't be because we

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:54.620
have good damage but I am dusting this

00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:55.970
run to a high degree looking for an

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:58.519
arcade I guess because I could use a

00:11:55.970 --> 00:12:02.350
little bit more speed but we did not get

00:11:58.519 --> 00:12:10.279
one which is OK in and of itself

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:12.589
scheduled handled taken care of and I'm

00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:14.290
guaranteeing personally life on the line

00:12:12.589 --> 00:12:17.600
manage of mush is in one of these

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:21.589
mushrooms right here we went through

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:22.850
this whole floor I really really I mean

00:12:21.589 --> 00:12:24.709
that's almost magical mushroom you don't

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:26.389
want to get technical I really really

00:12:24.709 --> 00:12:26.630
gave it a shot but er didn't do it for

00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:29.029
us

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:32.000
I was I got diplopia I was hoping I'd be

00:12:29.029 --> 00:12:34.759
able to reuse diplopia over and over it

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.560
didn't work I tried the lesson is never

00:12:34.759 --> 00:12:39.050
try so instead we're going to roll

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:40.459
Liberty Cap and Liberty Cap + shift loop

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:42.270
like our competitive advantage is

00:12:40.459 --> 00:12:43.830
getting read oculus

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:46.770
at this point we should have pretty much

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:51.780
no means to fail this run which I've

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:53.370
said many many times and sometimes it

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:56.910
proves to be incorrect but we'll see how

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:58.470
that happens as time goes on either way

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.150
I'm not saying you shouldn't be

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:03.630
passionate about music I'm just saying

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:07.430
you know as I've gotten older things

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:09.570
have become more I guess like I've

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:12.020
reprioritized elements of my life I

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:15.270
understand by the way what it's like

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:20.970
growing up I grew up in the suburbs Ben

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:24.180
Folds Five style lock up and health up

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:26.220
over and over you and I basically like I

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:29.720
don't know about you guys but I was in

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:33.300
the suburbs basically I went to school I

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:34.860
came home as soon as I got home I did

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.990
all my homework and then I was like I

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:38.880
got nothing to do for like 4 hours after

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:41.040
this so I would just play like video

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:43.020
games listen to music watch movies you

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.430
know TV nothing wrong with that's how

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:47.730
the majority of people live their lives

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:49.200
but at that young age you know you're

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.900
still kind of searching for an identity

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.490
that sort of came to define me you know

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:55.260
I mean I think that's true for for

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.460
teenagers in general in particular young

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:59.100
adults you know they define themselves

00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:00.960
to some extent by by their hobbies would

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.520
also by the media that they consume and

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.650
then you know it's nothing wrong with

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.570
them just comes everything comes into

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:08.160
more focus from an identity standpoint I

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:09.720
think though the older you get in the

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.880
more life experience that you accrue

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:14.910
behind you like I could care less in

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:18.270
this day and age like what what your

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:19.560
favorite movie of 2014 is I mean to be

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.600
honest II couldn't remember what my

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:27.090
favorite movie of 2014 is what came out

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:28.260
in 2014 that was good I'm not this is

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:31.020
mostly me trying to think of a single

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:33.410
movie that came out in 2014 you know

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:37.890
what I mean let me go aside your best

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:39.840
movies of 2014 here we go

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:42.660
boyhood didn't see it heard great things

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:44.400
Nightcrawler loved it whiplash oh dude

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:48.360
there we okay yeah do I love the

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:51.120
whiplash Winter Soldier great movie gone

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:53.790
girl also fantastic but guardians of the

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:55.940
galaxy sure yeah interstellar I think I

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:57.950
like it more than the average person

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.880
and I don't give it too much flak for

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:01.970
the ending even though I think it's a

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:04.400
little silly I also think people take

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:06.440
Anne Hathaway's quote near the end of

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.120
that movie out of context deliberately

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:13.790
to get mad but that's a story for an NL

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:17.450
SS either way where was that going here

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:18.620
oh yeah like I'm much more inclined I

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.390
think as I've gotten older to judge

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.980
people less on you know the kind of

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.630
media that they consume and more on like

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:26.090
you know how does this person treat the

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:28.040
people around them you know do they do

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:30.110
they take pride in what they do you know

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:33.350
are they good nature in another wise

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:35.810
affable are they reliable etc etc these

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:37.670
have become more important as you know

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:39.950
priorities and life have shifted and

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:42.580
then like number five is like how do you

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:44.900
feel about Charlie Kaufman's magnum opus

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:47.090
adaptation flash Eternal Sunshine of the

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:48.770
spotless mind are you more of a Charlie

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:52.250
Kaufman or a Donald Kaufman from

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:54.110
adaptation and moreover who's the true

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:56.240
antagonist of that movie is it Meryl

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:58.760
Streep is it Chris Cooper is it is it

00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.590
Charlie himself these are questions for

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:03.110
another day dude if you haven't seen

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:05.900
adaptation I'm not hinting it as a joke

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:08.780
but it shouldn't be because it's a

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:14.890
wonderful movie it genuinely wonderful

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:14.890
delightful brave imaginative filmmaking

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.810
yeah we'll just take Robin baby we don't

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:22.940
need anything else here what we do need

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:25.250
to do is explore our item room in our

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:26.870
shop yeah I mean this has been like kind

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:28.670
of an overly preaching start to an Isaac

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:30.380
episode but you can't always jump right

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:32.750
into a reverence I wish I could I tried

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:36.110
with that Game of Thrones thing it

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:37.910
didn't take the graft was rejected so

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:40.340
instead you know what's the secondary

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:42.680
fallback is uh-oh let me tell you you

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:46.310
know the places you'll go after-school

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:51.380
special all right let's throw a bomb

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:53.270
down here and we got nothing anyway I've

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:54.830
been going well thank you for your

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:56.030
support in the new save file I think

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:58.550
we're trucking along we're still

00:16:56.030 --> 00:17:00.770
unlocking like a new thing every episode

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:01.970
which we should enjoy well at last

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.350
because that's not going to be the case

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:05.450
forever eventually it's going to be you

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:07.040
know one new thing two out of every

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:08.270
three episodes and before we know it

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.250
it's you know we've got to have

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:12.160
so I do appreciate this period of

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:14.870
novelty where we're dealing with a

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:17.030
smaller item pool which is actually kind

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:18.319
of fun to you know labor under this

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:22.429
restriction

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:23.660
if anybody's asking a two of hearts sure

00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:24.679
I'll just use that again I don't think

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.750
we should buy anything else I think we

00:17:24.679 --> 00:17:29.090
should donate it would be okay to get an

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:30.710
arcade on the next floor and I should

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.820
remember that I have to do boss rush

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:36.230
that's the whole reason for being here

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:37.090
at this point why can't I think of that

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:40.840
item

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:45.920
dude this is bothering me item Issac

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:50.380
takes all hearts gives spirit hearts

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:53.929
fear shot not to be roused demon hearts

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:58.780
give me a so evil plus damage up plus

00:17:53.929 --> 00:18:03.770
fear shut evil plus damage Abaddon

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:09.080
Abaddon good returned if I wanted to

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:14.000
serve you just keep on watching my run

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:18.170
thanks to the abalone I will never

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.280
forget that one again until tomorrow we

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:21.320
don't need to fix I mean there's no

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:24.200
reason not to pick it up but spike but

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:26.920
let's do it dude grab this kit gun fuck

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.920
outta Dodge

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:33.980
just of course you know it's a lot

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:35.510
easier to bond over the kind of media

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:37.010
that people like because the otherwise

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:38.390
you end up turning into me you know you

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:42.470
meet somebody no what are your little

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:44.450
your passion life what drives you I'm

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:46.700
running my friend criteria on you right

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:50.179
now to determine what our compatibility

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:53.480
matches if I ask you to help me move

00:18:50.179 --> 00:18:55.850
what would you say for the record the

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.860
answer should be no if you just meet

00:18:55.850 --> 00:19:00.290
someone they ask you to move you should

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:01.970
say no I won't help you move not because

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:04.840
you're a rude person but because that's

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:08.210
way inappropriate of an ask for somebody

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:09.770
after just meeting them I know you've

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.910
seen a lot of Wes Anderson movies this

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:13.940
is how sometimes you know the

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:16.070
protagonist meets the love interest but

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:17.570
if I made someone Friday night and

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:18.950
they're like I'm moving Saturday morning

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:20.270
can you help me like with your truck

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:23.290
first off I'd be like I don't have a

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:23.290
truck you have a Ford Focus

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:29.810
50 bucks every time I say that thanks

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:30.800
for Motor Company secondly I'd be like

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:33.560
no that's ridiculous

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:35.890
you're asking me to give up you know in

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:39.440
theory what would be a weekend day

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:42.710
someone I've just met I'm not a saint

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:48.380
I'm selfish with my time to some extent

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:50.480
I'll admit that I think you have to well

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:51.740
sometimes you have to be being generous

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:56.450
with your time is considered a good

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:57.620
trait but sometimes you're too generous

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:58.370
with your time people will take

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.870
advantage of it

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:01.850
you got to strike the balance between

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:03.620
being charitable without being like a

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:05.420
pushover I guess this I don't know again

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:07.940
why this episode is tilted into being

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:09.140
like a you know after-school special

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:13.100
episode I never got to give a

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:15.200
valedictorian speech I don't even know

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.790
if our school had a valedictorian and

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.710
I'm being straight up with you I

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:20.930
wouldn't have qualified on marks alone

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:24.170
probably you know maybe top 10 out of a

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:25.960
graduating class of 80 not bad I can

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:29.210
live with that

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:31.280
very small high school but just can't

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:37.910
remember if we even had a valedictorian

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:40.580
speech but I did I was at that our High

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:41.990
School commencement last month and I

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:43.850
heard the valedictorian speech and it

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:45.500
was done well but I was also like all

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:49.610
right I remember valedictorian speech

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:51.830
it's like it's been extra it's been it's

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:53.270
been you know X years since we you know

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:55.400
walked into these doors and man when I

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:57.440
first started I was really anxious at

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.940
first I was afraid and I was petrified

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.230
but now if I'd known what I know now I

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.880
would go back and try to enjoy the

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:04.010
experience and then you'd follow it up

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:08.390
by like a montage of inside jokes like

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:11.960
old from mr. mr. hard homes nose hairs

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:13.880
all the way to Miss Trunchbull hammer

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.920
throwing we all had a good time at the

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:18.140
school although I think we all agree

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.640
meat loaf Mondays could have been a

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.050
little better and then everybody laughs

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.370
and you laugh because you get the joke

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:24.040
even though you you don't have the

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:26.590
shared experience

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:29.870
that's right you cheat a lap in there

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:32.450
not laugh like a cheetah which is my

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:34.660
favorite Steve Miller Band song left

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:38.090
like a cheetah

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:40.250
obviously Polaroid dog choose your way

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:43.670
out of this oh we want dude we get a

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:48.530
chance at redemption here infestation -

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:54.980
I'm a happy man not go I was pretty bad

00:21:48.530 --> 00:22:01.300
not great for dealing with boss rush

00:21:54.980 --> 00:22:01.300
specifically but really really good for

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:07.520
the rooms like pretty much every room

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.780
that comes after it we might be able to

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.310
do the hush fight on this one as well

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:12.800
and I don't believe we've done the hush

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:14.750
fight as Maggie so that's a it's a

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:19.340
pretty big get for us I'm hopeful

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:24.290
actually that we can get to the point

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:27.110
where we fight like a chub you know

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:29.600
Larry jr. hollow sort of situation and

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:32.000
as a result we just get enough spiders

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.890
to carry us for a couple ways I think

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.200
it's more likely than you might consider

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:38.600
it first blush should not just be

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:41.750
walking into enemies that's a that's

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:44.660
laziness and honestly laziness kind of a

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:47.810
a slow and insidious killer in Isaac

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:49.400
especially on boss rush some nasty

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:52.750
damage there would be pretty got me High

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.750
Priestess actually good

00:22:54.370 --> 00:23:00.280
does this guy smoke that guy easy money

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:04.090
you almost got me there

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:09.920
so what do we need to be able to fight

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:14.510
hush here honestly rate of fire with the

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:23.570
pickup solely of wide try then with the

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:25.430
pickup of of skinny odd mushroom our

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:27.440
rate of fire has pretty much been sorted

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:28.760
forever here we are a little bit light

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:31.820
on damage as a result of the damage

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:33.710
multiplier even if it is a downgrade it

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:39.340
is a multiplier it's just as you know

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:41.510
the relative proportion under 1.0 it's

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:42.800
it's holding us back a little bit in the

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:47.300
damage Department but I think it was

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:48.920
worth it for the very very quick tears

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.840
upgrade that it gave us and kind of

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.280
allowed us to start balling out of

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:54.290
control pretty early on this one which

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.940
was important especially after you know

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:58.490
my confidence took a hit on the last one

00:23:55.940 --> 00:24:00.470
so I'll take my licks right now as a

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:05.690
result of you know getting stronger

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:09.980
earlier tanky dude or he was below

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:11.900
ground the whole time should give a

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:14.140
healthy amount of spiders here if any

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:16.190
amount of spiders is a healthy amount

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:18.530
there's probably a healthy amount of

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:20.780
spiders to have right spiders are good

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:25.310
bugs and from a human standpoint because

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:30.920
they eat other bugs the university I

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:34.880
went to it's kind of slightly unique but

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:36.830
also infamous for students after the

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.440
first year never living or very rarely

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:41.810
living in dormitories instead they live

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.790
off-campus in houses that are you know

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:47.450
close to the university it's basically

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:48.800
like a pseudo slum it's because I we

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:50.330
used to call it the ghetto but in

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.830
hindsight that's ridiculous because you

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:53.540
know everybody's there their parents are

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:55.250
like they have a household income of

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:55.920
like you know at least ninety thousand

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:57.990
dollars a year

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.700
or something like that it's not like I'm

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:02.010
just being honest with you it's not like

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:03.150
living in a in a favela or something

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:04.470
like that I'm not trying to say living

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:06.270
in a favela sucks I'm just saying I have

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:10.710
no concept of it except for Max Payne 3

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:12.510
but you know we have to use a TV that my

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:14.040
parents don't want anymore probably does

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:15.720
not qualify it as a ghetto but either

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:18.840
way despite not really being a ghetto

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:21.570
there were like centipedes that

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:23.310
inhabited the area that I don't know if

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:24.510
there were centipedes millipedes I'ma be

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:28.470
honest with you there might be Giga

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:31.800
beans they were outrageously large they

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:33.810
were called ghetto bugs and dude

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.520
everyone was always like don't kill the

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:37.200
ghetto bugs they kill the spiders then

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:39.540
when you see a ghetto bug you're like oh

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:45.510
my god what's going to kill that cuz

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:47.190
we're we're screwed dude people in

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:50.070
Vancouver don't know how lucky they have

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:52.440
it I'm not speaking about the Tri City

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:54.420
area you're the greater metropolitan

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:58.050
area of Vancouver I mean like Vancouver

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:59.460
proper there are almost no bugs

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:01.200
depending on what part of the city

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:02.340
you're in this is the first city in my

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:06.450
entire life where I've ever encountered

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:08.580
silverfish which are weird pests that

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:10.410
eat through your clothes and they're

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:12.560
pretty disgusting but apart from that

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:16.440
dude it's like a bug free existence

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:18.450
might see the occasional fly very very

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:22.050
rarely a mosquito but apart from that

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:24.150
it's like growing up in you know more

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:25.860
rural Canada it's you know the summer

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:27.900
time you can go the whole summer and get

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:30.600
like one mosquito bite that's outrageous

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:33.450
now lucky that is that's incredible

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.590
I hear though in Seattle did and you

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:36.090
know correct me if I'm wrong you're

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:37.350
right I'll get to every city eventually

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:38.850
by the way if you're watching this and

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:41.370
you're like I live in Riyadh Saudi

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:43.290
Arabia I'm coming with a Riyadh anecdote

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:44.970
I don't know when but I assure you that

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:47.160
it's on my list

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:50.190
okay might as well take strength it

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:53.270
could be valuable and actually is well

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:58.100
it's not valuable but it could have been

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:58.100
we didn't need all this but so be it

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:01.740
stick with e ah you know what the

00:27:00.299 --> 00:27:04.440
strength card is actually really good

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.850
for fighting hush for the multiplier the

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.320
damage multiplier although losing

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:10.370
permanent polaroid invincibility will

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:18.929
stink something it's worth it

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:19.679
help me good stop dude scary but we made

00:27:18.929 --> 00:27:24.779
it happen

00:27:19.679 --> 00:27:28.350
I heard Seattle's spider Central is what

00:27:24.779 --> 00:27:30.659
I was going to say which I'm actually

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:34.500
fine with I don't love spiders but I'm

00:27:30.659 --> 00:27:36.210
not I'm not a person that I would say is

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:39.450
afraid of spiders I'm not particularly

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:41.340
perturbed by spiders I when I see them

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:43.200
if cait's like get rid of that spider

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.460
I'm like all right I can get rid of I'm

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.740
not going to you know I have a panic

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.970
attack from touching that spider

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:49.470
jellyfish if there was like a jellyfish

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:51.389
on the floor in our living room I'd be

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:53.100
like we have to move first we have to

00:27:51.389 --> 00:27:55.590
burn the place down and then we have to

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:58.799
move because I it's not that one

00:27:55.590 --> 00:28:00.570
jellyfish cognitively I can handle one

00:27:58.799 --> 00:28:01.799
jellyfish if I was like if I touch this

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:04.710
jellyfish I'll never have to see another

00:28:01.799 --> 00:28:08.460
jellyfish again no problem

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:10.379
you know I I'd suck it up but it's it's

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:12.960
the idea that if there was one jellyfish

00:28:10.379 --> 00:28:15.269
that then made it into the you know

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:17.700
living room how many jellyfish are there

00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:19.500
that I'm unaware of and what are they

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:21.149
going to do like are they I'm going to

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.710
be going to bed at night thing and a

00:28:21.149 --> 00:28:24.330
jellyfish first thought when I wake up

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:28.350
is there a jellyfish there like it's

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:31.860
going to be jellyfish Central dude not a

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:34.379
good environment for me live near

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:40.879
jellyfish I can eat jellyfish no problem

00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:40.879
and I have rarely but more than once ah

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:51.160
but touching a jellyfish not really

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:53.960
interested to be honest I'll pass

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:57.350
Hunger Games no thanks

00:28:53.960 --> 00:29:01.940
I'm still full from the jellyfish that I

00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:03.920
ate earlier that's a joke obviously cuz

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:05.900
you ain't getting filled up on jellyfish

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:08.240
this Beach jellyfish like its whole body

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:11.390
weighs like we're talking about like a

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:17.540
Portuguese Man O War what is a jellyfish

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:21.800
weigh like eight grams okay so we've got

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:23.750
kind of a an archetype here and the

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.640
archetype is before the hush fight we

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:28.810
throw away all of our HP that would make

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.810
it plausible to defeat hush

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:35.590
just be careful here I know we shouldn't

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:38.980
use sac dagger probably but it's also

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:44.590
like by far our best damage dealer we do

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:46.570
have a strength card backing us up good

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:50.260
good good good good we do have a

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:52.060
strength card backing us up the idea

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:53.530
from my perspective at least is we could

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:56.170
probably still do the hush fight we're

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:56.830
getting two items out of it hopefully a

00:29:56.170 --> 00:30:01.240
good deal

00:29:56.830 --> 00:30:02.860
Abaddon these deals are not they are

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.870
take Abul but I don't think they're

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:07.990
worth using what we would have had to

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:09.610
use so this is almost like near suicidal

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:11.860
but I still think it's it's worth

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:15.730
checking so we're checking let's go peep

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:17.710
this halo do sorted ruins permanent

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:19.140
polaroid invincibility and actually

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:21.930
doesn't give us that much benefits but

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:25.300
it's hard for me to say no to the halo I

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:28.120
don't know if we care about either of

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:35.010
those we don't care about anything in

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:35.010
here bomb bag that BOM BA Bom Bom Bom

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:45.700
is not great to be honest sherry is

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:47.559
pretty pretty useful you can't donate

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:53.590
anything we don't need a ladder you

00:30:47.559 --> 00:30:56.340
don't eat at well we'll take bomb bag to

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:56.340
blow this thing up

00:30:57.149 --> 00:31:02.289
tell appeals well this could give us an

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:07.179
error room if one can exist we use

00:31:02.289 --> 00:31:10.000
action but no you fool you don't want a

00:31:07.179 --> 00:31:12.370
narrow room what have you done you were

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.809
gonna fight hush well now honestly I

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:15.850
think we were in a tight spot and we

00:31:13.809 --> 00:31:17.080
might have died so you know the longer

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:18.909
I'm thinking about this the more I'm

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:21.690
like maybe this is actually completely

00:31:18.909 --> 00:31:24.399
fine because we've gotten the benefit of

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:29.710
at least the items from being down here

00:31:24.399 --> 00:31:32.110
and we got an escape route I am that was

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:34.059
a mistake or let me put it this way it

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:36.970
was unintentional I think it might be

00:31:34.059 --> 00:31:39.779
like good unintentional I think it might

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:44.320
be for the best a happy accident

00:31:39.779 --> 00:31:46.270
for instance either way we got boss rush

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:49.270
done that was not very smart of me you

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:50.740
got boss rush done we will probably be

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:53.890
Sheol which will check something off

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:56.610
we'll probably beat the chest which will

00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:59.350
knock something off here and we're

00:31:56.610 --> 00:32:01.990
guilty of having a successful Maggie run

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:04.289
although we could have could have gotten

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:04.289
more

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:10.140
yeah not tomorrow on my behalf there but

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:16.570
we will go back here because we want to

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:21.190
get to Thanks we want to get to the

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:25.120
curse room even if it costs us our life

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:29.260
it's still worth it because it could be

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:32.500
a guppy item and either way we're

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:34.030
getting the spirit heart on the way out

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.140
we might have to cost ourselves two

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:35.970
lives I haven't really thought that far

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:41.830
ahead

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:44.920
let's see here come on one gum p1 gum no

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:46.860
guppy died on the way out respond

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:49.390
outside that's perfect

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:51.690
sounded sarcastic was genuine that would

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:53.440
that actually is completely okay for us

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:55.930
how we're definitely I'm going to get

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:57.190
the chest done this might actually be

00:32:55.930 --> 00:33:00.280
the end of this run now I think about it

00:32:57.190 --> 00:33:02.380
cuz we're on we run sholde not on the

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:04.980
cathedral so I'm not actually sure if

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:07.330
the if the dark room has been unlocked I

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:11.320
would hazard to guess that it has not

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:14.290
been online how many times did we get

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:15.700
this choice like every run it's like do

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:16.870
you want to ship the whoop how about I

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.820
can then just doing a Tammy's head

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:20.200
instead they're both they're both fine

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:22.870
ship it was probably a little bit better

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:27.190
but Tammy said we can use more often and

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:29.920
I have a big bias towards that who knows

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:32.410
with continuum it might be a better

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:34.480
choice than normal but probably not

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:39.850
because our range is not particularly

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:44.130
huge maybe a little bit above average

00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:44.130
but even at I'm sort of skeptical of

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:51.740
so we can't really cheese a multi-phase

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:55.630
boss just by running into it you gonna

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:55.630
have to play a little better

00:33:56.690 --> 00:34:01.399
than we otherwise would have to here

00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:03.529
phase one should be done without taking

00:34:01.399 --> 00:34:05.720
any damage this guy you want to you want

00:34:03.529 --> 00:34:08.270
to roast him like right away this is the

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:11.480
hard part bait him into an attack drop

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:12.829
bombs remember when I thought Satan was

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:15.889
like the hardest enemy in the game I

00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:17.059
mean this run is good enough that we

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:20.059
shouldn't be complaining about many

00:34:17.059 --> 00:34:27.260
enemies you never fear are many enemies

00:34:20.059 --> 00:34:29.149
you can clearly look good we got it as

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:39.020
long as you know what to do the dark

00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:40.700
room we got it I mean we won okay let's

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:45.319
just count that as a win and we'll try

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:46.789
this it should not work but you got to

00:34:45.319 --> 00:34:49.149
pay the piper sometimes right especially

00:34:46.789 --> 00:34:52.730
this is like my penance for losing a

00:34:49.149 --> 00:34:54.260
class run now we go into this one and we

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:59.059
got to beat Delirium like without taking

00:34:54.260 --> 00:35:01.329
any damage with nine lives so prepare to

00:34:59.059 --> 00:35:01.329
suffer

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:09.220
it doesn't matter like as long as we

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:11.370
don't get hit at the end of this fight

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:14.110
we're good

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:16.650
HP is important but really we don't

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:18.550
possess the tools required to beat a

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:20.560
delirium at the present moment

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:26.620
infamy helps one spirit art for infamy

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:28.720
is a totally okay trade now when I said

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:30.640
that HP doesn't matter you know thinking

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:33.100
about that for like two seconds it's

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:36.610
just not correct every spirit art

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:38.230
actually matters a great deal here if we

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:42.010
can get up to like eight spirit arts I'd

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:43.720
give us an okay chance at winning but

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:45.790
every spirit art probably raises our

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:47.980
chances quite a lot up to a certain

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:50.170
point at least but whether or not we get

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:53.230
there remains to be seen lockdown I

00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:56.650
don't really mind you know obviously the

00:35:53.230 --> 00:36:00.120
more the merrier but we're not going to

00:35:56.650 --> 00:36:00.120
be relying on too many drops

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:07.930
because they don't give us guaranteed

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:10.560
items down here anyway so why bother

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:10.560
right

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:18.840
congratulations so we should use Book of

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:20.430
Revelations like persistently I wish we

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:23.790
could store our Book of Revelations

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:27.510
spirit or it's not on our person but it

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:29.520
is what it is so just play well we had a

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:31.470
license to not play well earlier because

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:33.090
if I died uh you know who cares and take

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:35.369
a little damage you respawn later and

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:37.530
make the best of it there's a spirit are

00:36:35.369 --> 00:36:42.660
down the drain unfortunately fast bombs

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:44.450
are actually like highly irrelevant wow

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:48.030
we're so small we can fit through there

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:49.500
well that's what she said doesn't make

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:52.860
any sense he liked robbing a bank or

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:54.810
something that's what she said like a

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:59.119
Martin Lawrence Bluestreak sort of

00:36:54.810 --> 00:37:07.950
situation halo applies is again

00:36:59.119 --> 00:37:10.380
basically like okay power pill this is

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:14.130
fine right now we can we can take power

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:15.810
pill in with us to a boss fight we

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:18.570
should do one room first so we get the

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:20.400
maximum charges here I'm genuinely given

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:25.590
this a shot I am playing in my you know

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:27.960
may trademark aggressive style but I'm

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:29.400
for real given this my own

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:32.190
I'm leaving those spirit arts behind

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:34.770
until later until the final moment I'm

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:36.060
not anticipating you know walking into

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:38.820
this fight and just rolling over and

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:40.650
dying if it happens at least we were

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:43.530
going to die knowing that we tried to

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:45.060
make it work right it would be nice and

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:49.830
this is obvious but it'd be really nice

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:51.930
as we get gum Ptah that way we could get

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:53.790
HP permanent polaroid invincibility and

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:55.500
the gup-e transformation do some real

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:57.210
damage with SAC dagger and feel a lot

00:37:55.500 --> 00:38:01.369
better about things so I'm going to use

00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:05.609
power pill and I probably should not but

00:38:01.369 --> 00:38:08.790
we oh we owe it to everybody to try to

00:38:05.609 --> 00:38:11.640
win on this one I don't think we will in

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:15.420
fact just take I'm going to try to take

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:18.869
me out basically okay get your get your

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:20.790
spear in our back here so again we're

00:38:18.869 --> 00:38:22.240
underwear understanded for dealing with

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:26.170
this but

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:28.480
things go right we can be okay now we

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:29.950
know where delirium is and you know your

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:36.190
life is a resource Magic the Gathering

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:38.350
style yeah can I get those fries Magic

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:40.860
the Gathering style please we don't have

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:43.570
any extra HP so as of right now that

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:46.630
bloody penny is not worth anything but

00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:49.120
it could be our saving grace if we get

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:50.920
more HP and somehow an ability to create

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:52.900
money now that I think about it we're a

00:38:50.920 --> 00:39:01.420
few steps away from greatness but it

00:38:52.900 --> 00:39:07.210
could happen some point in our own

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:09.850
future here that was not smart masks of

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:13.420
infamy alright I almost walked right

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:18.250
into that dustin become Guster

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:26.110
please roid rage is good not good enough

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:28.570
okay well I would give us like a five

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:31.900
percent chance of winning but there are

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:33.430
there are outs for us as low percentages

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:35.590
they might be there are outs and that's

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:40.510
why there's a health upgrade and full

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:44.180
health we can store that it might be for

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:46.430
the best not to do these but

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:48.020
I think we're we're taking the low

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:49.490
percentage plays because you have to

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:52.369
take the low percentage plays at this

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:54.710
point we need spirit arts wherever

00:39:52.369 --> 00:39:56.150
available and it's going to be a lot of

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:58.040
due diligence here but let's just think

00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:59.809
of it less as doing due diligence that

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:02.059
we don't have to do and more as like

00:39:59.809 --> 00:40:04.010
doing exactly what we have to do to not

00:40:02.059 --> 00:40:05.510
squander like 35 minutes of beats and

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:07.730
eyes that could happen just before this

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:12.770
so we're blowing up absolutely

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:15.079
everything nice okay very good actually

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:18.230
I would say that probably we're at the

00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:19.849
point already we're blowing up or well

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:21.140
yeah I think it's a smart idea but I

00:40:19.849 --> 00:40:23.089
think we're at the point already where

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:27.140
we're better off using our full health

00:40:23.089 --> 00:40:28.790
card and then or flail pill and then

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:33.740
holding onto our devil card for the boss

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:38.859
fight so we got as of right now six HP

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:38.859
we can always get a little bit more by

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:43.940
not taking damage but getting Book of

00:40:42.559 --> 00:40:47.900
Revelations charged up it's working

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:49.579
pretty well so far this stuff we might

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:52.040
be able to oh there's delirium that's

00:40:49.579 --> 00:40:53.990
right there might be you know one more

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:55.609
spirit hard to eke out in terms of

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:57.650
gameplay like Book of Revelations

00:40:55.609 --> 00:41:00.559
Salomon whatever can get from tinted

00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:02.780
rocks and random skulls and etc etcetera

00:41:00.559 --> 00:41:07.819
at this point

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:09.500
sign me up dude oh he's fun right on top

00:41:07.819 --> 00:41:13.520
of me that's alright we've actually

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:17.260
we've made like huge strides here come

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:17.260
on come on you got this now

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:30.859
blow this up another full health pill

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:35.509
and a power pill well we'd be silly not

00:41:30.859 --> 00:41:37.369
to use the power pill dude this is like

00:41:35.509 --> 00:41:40.220
if we had dark bombs this room is

00:41:37.369 --> 00:41:42.559
actually an instant wind well a very

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:45.079
belabored wind actually but a win

00:41:42.559 --> 00:41:47.180
nonetheless together the world card okay

00:41:45.079 --> 00:41:53.869
see a little bit more about place we

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:58.759
call home pale blue dot sun card fair

00:41:53.869 --> 00:42:02.619
play so red I mean I'm just thinking in

00:41:58.759 --> 00:42:04.849
terms of our maximums red 8hp right now

00:42:02.619 --> 00:42:07.430
we got two spirit arts sitting on the

00:42:04.849 --> 00:42:08.869
ground what did I say if we can get the

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:10.640
eight spear in arts I'd consider us to

00:42:08.869 --> 00:42:11.839
have above a 50% chance or something

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:14.569
like that that's what I was thinking in

00:42:11.839 --> 00:42:17.720
my head at least and sure I could see

00:42:14.569 --> 00:42:21.529
that I can see that case being made for

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:22.519
that we're slowly getting to the point

00:42:21.529 --> 00:42:24.380
where this run actually seems

00:42:22.519 --> 00:42:26.630
conceivable that we will succeed and

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:28.190
just a testament to like you know when

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:31.579
you do your due diligence and Isak

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:34.130
everything changes also by the way the

00:42:31.579 --> 00:42:38.869
Book of Revelations pick up in hindsight

00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:41.779
actually like ten out of ten there's

00:42:38.869 --> 00:42:43.400
even one more spirit heart remaining

00:42:41.779 --> 00:42:46.490
back here if we have combat on all these

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:48.049
rooms so again better to think of it not

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:49.910
as due diligence that's like you know

00:42:48.049 --> 00:42:51.319
homework but instead this is like how we

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:53.859
don't squander all the time that we've

00:42:51.319 --> 00:42:53.859
already spent

00:42:55.970 --> 00:43:01.820
oh my god we should we don't have to go

00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:03.140
back forward yet we should have gone

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:04.520
back forward earlier probably but we

00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:09.310
don't go back for it yet we should still

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:09.310
be able to get a maximum benefit here

00:43:12.609 --> 00:43:19.940
now the problem with this in the end is

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:25.330
that it's still wool it's still just

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:28.160
going to be a long and annoying fight

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:29.890
but I'm actually even if we lose I'm

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:34.280
pretty proud of myself for the way that

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:35.869
everything went down here because we

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:37.940
could have just squandered it pretty

00:43:35.869 --> 00:43:38.560
easily and then my god what do we care

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:43.280
right

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:45.109
instead the Sun card instead we decided

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:46.820
to try and look at we're being rewarded

00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:48.619
we're being rewarded with a chance which

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:50.680
is really all we could have ever asked

00:43:48.619 --> 00:43:50.680
for

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:58.369
now if I could be rewarded with like a

00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:01.700
little bit more damage that would be

00:43:58.369 --> 00:44:05.210
nice as well but no beggars can't be

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:07.940
choosers all right we'll take this and

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:10.100
we'll take this and we're one HP away

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:11.480
from complete Redemption so we'll go

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:13.730
back into this last room here and get

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:18.200
that done and we'll leave with our devil

00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:21.590
card and go fight the boss look yes here

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:27.290
we go kind of surprised the descended of

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:30.610
work in output surprised but happy there

00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:33.619
we go alrighty so we should have like

00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:36.500
twelve eleven eleven to twelve damage

00:44:33.619 --> 00:44:43.400
for the box right here it's not horrible

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:46.760
it could be better and this is very much

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:48.290
not my style nor the style with which

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.760
I've played this run up to this point

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:52.010
but we should sadly

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:55.010
stay far far away from enemies whenever

00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:57.050
possible sac dagger is good

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:59.390
in fact it's substantially better than

00:44:57.050 --> 00:45:02.869
good but it doesn't output damage fast

00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:04.730
enough to like make up for the the

00:45:02.869 --> 00:45:07.640
damage that we'd take in the process so

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:11.109
just slow and steady wins the race dude

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:14.300
we're also going to get very little

00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:16.970
infestation to action here only from

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:20.500
enemies that spawn normal enemies the

00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:24.950
remaining enemies don't die they just

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:26.240
are repurposed into another form okay

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:29.450
that was two hits that we couldn't

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:30.470
afford to take but you're doing well you

00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:31.820
know don't throw the baby out with the

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:39.290
bathwater here you made a bad decision

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:42.540
and now it's time to change that

00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:44.300
in the future you can't go back my

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:49.310
presence is a present

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:49.310
kiss my tail Kanye West said that one

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:59.220
that's one of the few enemies I will

00:45:51.800 --> 00:46:02.190
forever advocate using using sac dagger

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:09.119
again this guy not so much

00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:13.580
we should also use bombs in the right

00:46:09.119 --> 00:46:13.580
circumstance it could work out for us I

00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:21.240
think you know we have so many bonds we

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:23.700
can just place them and walk away if

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:24.720
they hit sweet if they don't hit as long

00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:27.720
as they're not hitting us what do we

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:29.990
care oh this is the perfect yeah we got

00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:33.440
a lot of spiders out of that hopefully

00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:33.440
still got tons

00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:45.220
beep we got half of our HP left

00:46:41.349 --> 00:46:48.400
delirium adds like 20% those seem like

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:49.690
good odds to me right Book of

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.130
Revelations actually came through in the

00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:52.240
clutch with one extra spirit heart that

00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:55.059
we squandered almost immediately

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:59.170
afterwards it's still 5 HP left

00:46:55.059 --> 00:47:01.150
now easiest decision I make ever in my

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:03.359
life let's just win right now so we

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:06.880
don't have to do this fight seven times

00:47:03.359 --> 00:47:09.339
with a decreasing chance versus what we

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:11.140
have right now we've got a 4 HP

00:47:09.339 --> 00:47:12.880
remaining and we've squandered so much

00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:21.250
okay that one I just I take grave

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:22.660
offense to you spawned on top of me hard

00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:24.430
thing to accept right now is that if we

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:27.150
lose this one it's on me because I threw

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:27.150
away a lot of HP

00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:46.850
not because we got tella frag ones and I

00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:52.050
think that's well I was not ideal to HP

00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:58.280
should have taken bloody penny dude or

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:58.280
spiders or spider school that was close

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:04.530
feet no feet

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:05.420
delirium got some Dustin this is our

00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:08.760
time

00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:10.500
it was highly our time okay we never

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:11.910
should have gotten into such sticky

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:13.200
syrup over the course of that episode

00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:15.600
bye hey what's done is done

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:17.040
