00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.389
hey everybody welcome back and online

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.420
place binding of issac answereth plus

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.820
where we escaped by the skin of our

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.290
teeth last time never understood that

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.150
expression it's probably something you

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.010
can just look up right give me a second

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:19.500
here k k p ZL k RQ decent HP for having

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.779
spirit arts only tears are okay damage

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.730
is okay speed is okay this is like a

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.320
decent start and the beam is at least

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.179
useful skin of your teeth let's see see

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.850
the origins this idiom the meaning and

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.120
origins of this phrase the phrase first

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.980
appears in English in the Geneva Bible

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:43.350
1560 in Jo 1920 which provides a literal

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.030
translation of the original Hebrew I how

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.550
escaped with the skin of meth heads

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.960
alrighty well I think that answers any

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.559
conceivable questions that we could have

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:01.100
had let's move along here oh don't make

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:04.290
me want to do it ah get jerks it jerks

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.229
so the cute play there which is idiotic

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.530
and I should not do it is to pick up

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.900
curse of the tower walk into the fire

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.810
and then I hope that the bombs don't

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.090
explode on me and instead explode on the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.150
blue fires and give me as many spirit

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.659
hearts as possible if you do that

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:28.320
honestly more power to you you are you

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.720
are God's chosen children but that is an

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:36.210
easy otic play for which I cannot abide

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:38.040
either way feeling good about today's

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.229
run here I'm going to say today's daily

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.150
but obviously it's not what today's run

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.799
is well it's not what this run is at

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.890
least we have already done a daily today

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.780
and it went very well

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.280
so you know what I find myself looking

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.640
at this and being like I'm in a good

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.329
situation our last run was quite scary

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.570
but only temporarily once we got through

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.189
the fear of that last run and managed to

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.049
get through or get to a place of

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.899
relatives not just safety but like we

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.899
were killing it it became a lot easier I

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.599
think we should just blow it I thought I

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.590
was like we're getting spirit arts back

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.480
maybe we should just walk

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.980
go over the spikes but then what are we

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.510
going to use our bomb for you know blow

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.769
that guy get a little money find a

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.650
secret room or something like that

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.720
it's basically who cares so instead

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.830
we're just going to be thrilled that we

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.810
have super bandage an item that doesn't

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.099
necessarily amp up our offense but gives

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.780
us a red heart and that red heart

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.890
hopefully can be used to amplify our

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.870
offense a little bit later in the game

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.980
we find our first deal with the devil if

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.030
we don't find a deal with the devil on

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.349
the next floor something has gone

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:47.730
terribly horribly wrong tears please yes

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:50.250
and actually like we hit the the mother

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.349
lode now that's an expression I'm not

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.549
going to look up the meaning to but we

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:58.200
hit the mother lode on the on the health

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.489
roll there we got a lot of health that's

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.530
actually useful for so one of these

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.349
should be a library or at least yeah a

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.420
room of some specialists guy Emperor we

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.209
got fooled and we got algae's so what

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.040
we're going to do is actually basically

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.450
make a quality-of-life play here I like

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.230
when these happen because it gives me

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.970
the ability to kind of like guilt-free

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.500
start to steamroll a little bit so we're

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.060
gonna take the emperor card hopefully

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.720
there's like a boss trap room pretty

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.130
close here there is this is getting a

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.480
little too convenient starting to freak

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.709
me out we're going to open it up we're

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.720
going to take that it's the ability to

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.430
fly then we're going to bounce out and

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.310
we're going to fight the same boss that

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.109
we were just about to fight anyway and

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.069
hopefully get this blogging guaranteed

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.120
you get this deal with the devil and

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:44.459
hopefully pick up something that gives

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:48.930
us better damage ASAP I mean you

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.069
definitely want this and then you

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.700
probably want that does that give you

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.169
any spirits no we know we have HP

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.549
waiting for us on the outside the

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:59.250
question is more whether or not we

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.450
actually want to well we're going to get

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.400
HP anyway I thought that was going to

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.200
take our eternal heart but it didn't so

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.220
what i'm doing here is is quite dicey

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:11.069
but ended up being very much worth it we

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.620
will still fly if we get placenta

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:17.940
because we have faith which is why fate

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:20.039
is actually fine here empty vessel is

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.359
also like the invincibility from empty

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.520
vessel is the big thing to be honest

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.650
with you but i'm happy with everything

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.570
we got here we also got two demon hearts

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.730
out of picking up empty vessel mine

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.110
you we effectively paid three spirit I

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.700
was painting one red heart but you know

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.650
the equivalent of three spirit I was to

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.420
pick it up in the first place so we

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.070
didn't actually really improve our

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.400
damage but we did get piercing shots

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.350
which I think are useful one of the

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.860
Layton not that it's like deserving of

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.630
incredible amounts of celebration or

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.490
anything like that but I'm really glad

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.630
they added another avenue to get

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.220
piercing shots because it's one of my

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.630
favorite upgrades in the game upgrade

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.480
archetypes in the game at least and

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.580
there weren't that many ways to get it

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.470
you know as long as we're ignoring

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.660
things like mom's knife and brimstone

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.630
you know you basically had Sagittarius

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.790
and Polyphemus a little bit and then

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.970
Cupid's arrow and that was it like those

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.110
were your waves to get piercing shots so

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.880
you can get shoopdawhoop but that's not

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.770
really what I mean you can give them

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.850
some mom's knife that's not really what

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:23.850
I mean so to have a slightly more likely

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.650
way to get a piercing shots even though

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.670
it cost two red hearts I think is

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:31.500
totally worth it and we should keep the

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.380
the demon's tale I think it's working

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.050
wonders for us right now so the last

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.310
thing I mean we haven't been to our item

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.600
room this floor so we're going to do but

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.730
the last thing we need to make this run

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.890
really pop is is still just damaged so

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.570
even our rate of fire is great now if we

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.870
can just get like a literal damage

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:51.300
upgrade I'd be a happy camper the zodiac

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.980
is an item that me I don't know if there

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.360
is like a competitive metaphor Isaac

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.000
there definitely you know there's racing

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.960
in the game which I'm completely

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.160
ignorant of the meta of that but zodiac

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:08.420
is an item that to the best of my

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:11.280
knowledge is not really taken because it

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.480
gives you the potential to get stompy

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.700
which gives you the potential to hurt

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:22.020
yourself which is just you know bad all

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:23.640
around I take it though because first

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.230
off sucks - you're a smart and secondly

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.120
I got nothing to lose on this run anyway

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.500
we did get stompy so we shouldn't be

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.410
crushing mushrooms I was doing that

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:34.830
mostly just to see if we had it but yeah

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:36.330
Leo is I guess one of the one of the

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.650
lesser draws that you can get from that

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.950
you really want to pick up like Scorpios

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:44.310
pretty good Pisces is okay I guess

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:45.540
situations Virgo or you know once you

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:49.950
get down to like the wound the cancer

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:53.340
item will be great as well power pill

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:54.870
that was that always what power pill

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.120
sounds like or is it just power feel

00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:01.860
probably just speeds up like the next

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:04.050
spot of music right so where there's

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:09.540
like the Dolby or not Dolby what is it

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:11.100
thx sound from like the they don't do

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.320
that at the movies anymore but you know

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:17.630
in like 1998 you go see a movie in

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:19.710
theaters and the thx sound comes off mmm

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:23.910
just to let you know how good the sound

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:25.290
system is now whenever I go to the

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:27.780
movies if I'm seeing something that's

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:31.410
like new you know it's special effects

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:34.740
heavy they do the thing we're like oh we

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:37.250
got to take these pentagram love the

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.210
damage packed love the damage thank you

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:42.780
they do the thing where like if it has

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:44.400
Dolby Atmos like this is like the sound

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:47.160
of popcorn popping and it goes like all

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.750
around binaural sound like the back of

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.950
your head and then out both ears and

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:55.020
then you had well it's pretty good I

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:57.330
can't wait to see you know this the

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.280
remaster of Schindler's List they little

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:03.840
sound like all the dialogues coming from

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:06.660
all around me they also have that on

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:11.010
like every season of Game of Thrones on

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:14.400
the on disc copies does that and like

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:16.980
man our TV you got our TV for like 200

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.150
bucks in a sale when I store went out of

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.280
business I don't know if we're really

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:22.770
taking advantage of the dolby atmos

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:27.090
right now we have not a sound system

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:28.590
sort of guy I'm not an audiophile I

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:31.230
guess is what I mean to say and I I

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:33.360
respect people who are like you know who

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:34.320
is to some extent is I mean you by the

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.640
way you're saying I know you're not an

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.240
audiophile if you heard your mic cliping

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.320
but yeah to be sick I can't disagree

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.120
with that um

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.220
mouth is kind of an audiophile he's a

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:46.980
detail-oriented guy he likes he likes to

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:48.930
get things right and I respect that to

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:52.340
be honest with you despite not really

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:54.329
being that kind of person myself but

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:57.119
like I

00:08:54.329 --> 00:08:59.249
music when I do it's on like a cheap

00:08:57.119 --> 00:09:01.920
pair of earbuds and then like one of the

00:08:59.249 --> 00:09:03.809
ears has like a short in it so I have to

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.420
pull on the cord to get it to sound

00:09:03.809 --> 00:09:08.519
right it's not the ideal way to listen

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.649
to anything much less you know

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:12.509
contraband the best of men at work but

00:09:10.649 --> 00:09:13.739
I've been doing it for years I'm just

00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:17.279
sort of like I'm used to it at this

00:09:13.739 --> 00:09:19.829
point I live a you know I try to have a

00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:23.970
laconic lifestyle I guess as Spartan as

00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:28.259
possible for things like that really

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:31.379
like if I want something nice I just

00:09:28.259 --> 00:09:34.199
wait for like a special occasion and

00:09:31.379 --> 00:09:37.649
then my wife will get it for me and then

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:39.869
that saves me the the hassle you know

00:09:37.649 --> 00:09:41.970
like shoes like I'll wear one pair of

00:09:39.869 --> 00:09:43.230
shoes until there I see other youtubers

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:46.709
they're like check out my ease ease and

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:49.230
I'm like damn dude it's like a seminar

00:09:46.709 --> 00:09:51.799
NLR shoes that's absurd

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:54.329
I'm wearing these like $50 new balances

00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:57.389
once a year on my birthday new pair of

00:09:54.329 --> 00:10:00.899
new balances that's my I'm not saying

00:09:57.389 --> 00:10:05.309
I'm Steve Jobs I'm saying it's the way I

00:10:00.899 --> 00:10:07.230
choose to live my lifestyle here that

00:10:05.309 --> 00:10:09.179
wasn't a shot at dangling as well

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:12.480
dang jeez Ling's got that big brother

00:10:09.179 --> 00:10:16.709
CBS money if he wants to buy a pair of

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:18.389
Yeezys then by all means how's this run

00:10:16.709 --> 00:10:20.009
popping off caves two at eight and a

00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:21.839
half minutes should basically tell you

00:10:20.009 --> 00:10:23.399
everything you need to know about this

00:10:21.839 --> 00:10:25.499
run and our deals of the devil just keep

00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:27.119
getting better and better technically we

00:10:25.499 --> 00:10:30.720
did not get a deal with the devil on our

00:10:27.119 --> 00:10:32.069
last floor which is absurd because that

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.480
means we have a great chance to get one

00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:35.399
on this floor and we did get one the

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:39.199
last floor via teleportation and it was

00:10:35.399 --> 00:10:41.819
amazing so we're still I mean I wouldn't

00:10:39.199 --> 00:10:45.360
because it wouldn't complain or deign to

00:10:41.819 --> 00:10:46.829
complain about this run whatsoever deign

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:51.749
to complain of course is my punk album

00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:55.470
but it's a it's a still slightly light

00:10:51.749 --> 00:10:57.660
on the literal capital D damage I say

00:10:55.470 --> 00:11:00.179
say capital D damage to distinguish it

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:02.129
capital D distinguish it from our DPS

00:11:00.179 --> 00:11:03.689
which is very good because we have

00:11:02.129 --> 00:11:08.010
piercing shots and the great rate of

00:11:03.689 --> 00:11:12.680
fire six damage is just a little light

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:14.970
bad it's a little lighter than we does

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:17.010
we'd ideally be eight I mean of course

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:20.570
we'd ideally be at infinity as long as

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.570
it didn't cause the game to crash but

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.580
wouldn't mind popping up just a little

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.530
bit more

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:30.030
tella pills I mean at least until it

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:31.410
builds us to a good place and Gertie is

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:34.560
a pretty good test you know we can see

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:37.760
how our damage is stacking up at this

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:40.230
point and the answer is like a little

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.720
and Gurney's a tanky boss but it's a

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.680
little slow here but that's okay we

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.030
should have a good chance of to deal

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.440
with the devil hopefully we get HP we

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:48.240
can turn that deal with the devil and

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.430
you know working for us pretty easily

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.690
and actually you know if we get Krampus

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:53.220
that would be fine as well I could take

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.360
a lump of coal or Krampus is head

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.430
this runs still got a lot of room for

00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:00.150
improvement despite being very good so

00:11:56.430 --> 00:12:02.040
binky is lowers our tear cap and gives

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:05.820
us like a spear at heart and then guppy

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:09.660
items no guppy items so a bit of a whiff

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:14.790
on the deal with the devil but binky is

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:17.280
okay it's better if we can actually find

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:19.700
a way to improve our our rate of fire

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:22.710
more because I think it's a tear cap

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:24.450
improvement but we're getting to the

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:26.730
point where like we don't have to talk

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:29.130
about this run anymore because it has

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:30.900
everything it's not the cup is not

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:33.360
running over in any particular direction

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:35.430
but you know we've got great HP we've

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.810
got great utility items basically the

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:39.150
ability to fly

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:41.370
we are consumables are doing fine you

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:44.490
know everything about this is completely

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:46.680
set and our dps is is actually above the

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:49.710
average by like a great degree when you

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:51.990
when you factor in the piercing shots so

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:53.930
certainly I would I would say that we're

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:56.880
lucky to be in this situation right now

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:58.560
mom's contacts mom transformation means

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.930
nothing but the mom's contacts pickup is

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:03.060
quite good if nothing else that at least

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.560
means I was gonna say and I was actually

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:06.300
wrong about this I was gonna say it

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.620
means that we can go over there and you

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:10.950
know fart on an enemy when they're

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:12.110
frozen but because of the way that is

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:15.950
our COO

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:17.420
because of the way that status effects

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:19.160
work we actually can't have two applied

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:22.430
simultaneously which I still think is a

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:23.660
little silly it's not like status

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:26.630
effects for the most part are

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:28.250
overpowered at all but you know I I also

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:29.600
didn't work on QA on the game so it's

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:31.209
possible it throws the whole thing out

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:35.660
of whack

00:13:31.209 --> 00:13:38.269
not really rushing but to be straight up

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:41.720
with you finding it hard to to slow down

00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:44.300
here as a result of the speed with which

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.959
we're able to kill enemies so we're

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:49.490
going to do everything we'll probably

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:51.529
hazard a crack and boss rush here as my

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:53.240
guest I'm totally cool at face reward

00:13:51.529 --> 00:13:56.720
which at this point is basically just

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:59.300
like a familiar that will shoot freezing

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.700
tears on occasion so I'm definitely not

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:03.050
against that although it's not the idea

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:07.279
light amount of a golden chest we did

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:08.810
pretty well in that room regardless this

00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:10.220
floor not as likely to give us a deal

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:14.540
with the devil but we have gotten Steam

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:16.670
sale so I will take either agreed fight

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:21.130
that give us a Steam sale again or super

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:24.770
greed I guess or you could hook me up

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:26.990
with like a restock then this run starts

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:31.070
to become like a hush territory for

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:33.680
certain and I mean car battery

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:35.329
we definitely there's no need for us to

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.430
take sharp plug just so we can get you

00:14:35.329 --> 00:14:39.110
know incredibly expensive double uses

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:40.399
out of the beam but we will take car

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:42.829
battery with the beam I don't know if it

00:14:40.399 --> 00:14:44.870
works look as far as I'm concerned a

00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:47.750
fart so far if you're in my company and

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:50.779
you rip a little one that's audible and

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:52.060
you rip a big one that's you know it

00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:54.410
sounds like we're in Carnegie Hall

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:57.380
they're both equally uncool to me

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:59.329
shouldn't I'm not against you know human

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.680
bodily functions here but some things I

00:14:59.329 --> 00:15:02.449
think are better left private we had

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.339
this conversation on the LSS because

00:15:02.449 --> 00:15:07.310
Austin and Rob were of the opinion that

00:15:04.339 --> 00:15:09.649
you know to burp in someone else's

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:11.510
company is not rude and I'm very much I

00:15:09.649 --> 00:15:13.779
disagree with that although I do

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:16.190
understand where they're coming from

00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:20.089
namely that they're you know still

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:22.390
living that bachelor lifestyle but well

00:15:20.089 --> 00:15:23.920
I just live in a house in college with

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.959
I'm going to play

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.459
by the way this isn't a mistake they may

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:28.869
be a mistake but is not unintentional at

00:15:27.459 --> 00:15:31.509
least I used to live in a house in

00:15:28.869 --> 00:15:33.910
college with six dudes and one girl who

00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:35.799
you know fancied yourself being one of

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:39.639
the boys cracking a cold one if you know

00:15:35.799 --> 00:15:41.079
what I mean see today's hottest memes so

00:15:39.639 --> 00:15:42.790
you know I've been around burps I've

00:15:41.079 --> 00:15:45.759
been around farts it's not like somebody

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:48.730
burps around me and I go oh my god how

00:15:45.759 --> 00:15:50.350
dare you you know that's I'm not an

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:53.169
unsullied like grey worm that's what I'm

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:56.410
trying to say I'm sullied however I'm

00:15:53.169 --> 00:15:57.819
sullied like Tom Hanks who could totally

00:15:56.410 --> 00:16:05.410
kick the crap out of grey worm if you

00:15:57.819 --> 00:16:06.970
wanted but excuse me sir I don't like

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:08.109
the way our shots look now like it feels

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:09.669
like it's harder to hit them because of

00:16:08.109 --> 00:16:12.309
the mini much pickup but I do like

00:16:09.669 --> 00:16:14.619
having this level of speed I just find

00:16:12.309 --> 00:16:17.980
the concept of a burp is gross like

00:16:14.619 --> 00:16:21.459
you're summoning a smell from the depths

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:23.649
of your of your of your belly then I

00:16:21.459 --> 00:16:26.559
don't want to smell is it ivy farting is

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:28.779
also pretty bad I don't know I kind of

00:16:26.559 --> 00:16:30.549
feel like a fart is a fart a burp has

00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:33.610
like its own signature to it that I

00:16:30.549 --> 00:16:37.119
I don't like everybody's fart smell like

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:38.619
a different variety of poop everybody's

00:16:37.119 --> 00:16:42.069
burp is like what you had for lunch

00:16:38.619 --> 00:16:43.899
combined with like your mouth flora and

00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:45.970
then like you know your dental hygiene

00:16:43.899 --> 00:16:48.339
factors into that is there's a lot of

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:51.160
like variables in there that it's like a

00:16:48.339 --> 00:16:53.410
bouquet and I don't like it and people

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:55.779
then you know Robin Austin go well my

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:57.669
birds don't smell they do you just don't

00:16:55.779 --> 00:17:01.600
it's like you don't smell your own bread

00:16:57.669 --> 00:17:02.919
you know it's because because you're

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.289
smelling it all the time you become

00:17:02.919 --> 00:17:06.699
desensitized to it you go nose blind to

00:17:05.289 --> 00:17:07.649
it as they say in those for Brees

00:17:06.699 --> 00:17:10.329
commercials

00:17:07.649 --> 00:17:11.649
I'm not suggesting that my breath is

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:14.079
better than yours by any stretch of the

00:17:11.649 --> 00:17:16.510
imagination all I'm suggesting is that

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:18.220
everybody you know smelling another

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:20.500
person's breath most of the time is not

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:24.610
a pleasant experience and you're going

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:27.130
to have that on a on a burp but moreover

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:29.970
I just that was a great face from mega

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.970
ma here by the way

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:37.060
Thank You gimpy um I just think you

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:40.720
shouldn't subject somebody else to your

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:42.370
own to involve to voluntary bodily

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:44.020
functions if you're like you know

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:45.820
sitting on a train or something like

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:48.070
that and you had a soda and you got to

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:49.300
go like like I understand okay it

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:51.700
happens but you can kind of like

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:53.410
diminish the sound the only time I ever

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:55.450
go like what's up with this this guy's

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:58.180
being an actual jerk as when he goes I

00:17:55.450 --> 00:18:00.430
mean let's be honest is usually a dude

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:02.800
I'll own up to it for the rest of you

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:04.930
guys you know you summon air into like

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:07.180
the depths of your gut and then blow it

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:08.860
out with the it's like it's not an

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:10.600
intentional burp necessarily but it's

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:13.240
like oh I'm gonna lean into this burp

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:17.410
that's when I go okay you've gone too

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:19.180
far I've had some you know you can ask

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:23.740
him out I've had some flatulence in my

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:28.030
life um and you know I've had some just

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:32.110
terrible terrible odorous flatulence we

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:33.790
gotta try it I'm not sure if this is

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:35.200
worth it or not worth it but because our

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:37.090
shots are piercing the knock back

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:39.280
shouldn't be that bad I'm sorry if I'm

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:42.430
shattering your image of you know the

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:43.900
the you know sophisticated northern line

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:46.540
here but I'm not going to apologize for

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:49.030
the smell of my flatulence I have no

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:52.240
idea what makes it smell that everyone

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:54.520
always assumes you know oh you're your

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.870
fart smells terrible like your diet must

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:58.810
be bad I don't know if that's true at

00:18:55.870 --> 00:19:00.910
all how do you know maybe maybe bad

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:03.310
smelling farts is a sign of great diet

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:04.570
you know if your farts smell like cotton

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:06.520
candy you should stop eating so much

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:07.630
dang cotton candy anyway I don't know

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:12.460
where I've gone with this for the point

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:15.610
is you know I've I've had times in my

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:18.880
life what I've been a farty man but it's

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:20.260
always possible to hold it in there are

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.610
some situations in which you'll want to

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.980
you know maybe try to sneak out a

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:27.610
clandestine one I can understand that

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:29.740
but you know for the most part like 95%

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:31.270
of farts don't have to exit in public

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:32.560
you can wait till you get outside maybe

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:34.390
it's a little unpleasant but hey that's

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:36.550
what society is like you know sometimes

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:39.100
you deal with unpleasantness in order to

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:40.750
not make everybody else's exist in

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.299
slightly more unpleasant as a result of

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:44.890
your selfishness

00:19:42.299 --> 00:19:47.049
you know it's what separates us from the

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:51.220
beasts or my the only one around who

00:19:47.049 --> 00:19:52.210
here cares about the rules anyway I

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.070
don't know where I was going with this

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:56.710
make sure to LIKE the video if you think

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:58.690
burping is gross if you think burping in

00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:00.160
public is gross at least if you think

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:01.420
burping in public is cool make sure to

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:04.960
leave a comment that says burping in

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:06.820
public is cool and then like the video

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:09.220
if you like the video

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:11.520
so got algae's we got black rune got

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:13.630
many black runes actually yeah it was

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:17.590
which I should have used to skip boss

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:18.610
rush that was stupid all right we're

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:21.160
gonna take black rune because we can

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:23.830
still get the statistics bonus out of

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:26.020
black room if we want to but I don't

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:30.840
know if I want to do boss rush anymore I

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:30.840
guess we'll see what the run looks like

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:39.330
once we see what we get there like a

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.400
deal with the devil year cuz soy milk

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:45.120
was a bad pick up it could be good later

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:47.890
but it was a bad pick up for right now

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:52.059
it's not doing what I wanted to do which

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:54.070
is like really amp up our DPS I don't

00:20:52.059 --> 00:20:57.370
think it was terrible but it was like

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:59.440
nearly proportional like we lost like 80

00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:01.120
percent of our damage and improved our

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.809
rate of fire by 4 times or something

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.809
like that so

00:21:08.169 --> 00:21:12.650
and it's still like a pretty easy fight

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:15.770
you still got a deal with the devil

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:20.000
and a little brim deal that was not bad

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:23.419
with full HP little brim you know no no

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:27.520
no no I mean you black rune and fight

00:21:23.419 --> 00:21:29.809
for it shouldn't have done this

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.179
tell you that straight up there was

00:21:29.809 --> 00:21:38.450
there was no reason for us to have done

00:21:32.179 --> 00:21:40.580
this this is going to take a hundred

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:42.280
million years we are going to be doing

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:44.720
this boss rush until the day we die

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:47.470
these are too tanky enemies I'll give

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:50.600
you that but please God give me like a

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:52.190
devil card or so okay see like this is

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:54.049
where things are starting to get a

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:55.549
little scary this there's just no reason

00:21:54.049 --> 00:21:57.110
for you know what though now that I

00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:59.240
think about it little brim is like a

00:21:57.110 --> 00:22:00.860
static damage dealer just make sure that

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:03.400
you're firing little brim is often as

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.400
possible

00:22:11.409 --> 00:22:18.289
might not be the fastest boss rush we've

00:22:16.039 --> 00:22:23.149
ever had and it might not have been for

00:22:18.289 --> 00:22:29.269
much and also little brim take it

00:22:23.149 --> 00:22:32.539
forever to get charged up dude I was

00:22:29.269 --> 00:22:35.000
stunned when when little Gertie died and

00:22:32.539 --> 00:22:37.490
I saw how much damage still had to be

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.070
done - I actually almost lost my mind

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:41.600
okay so you know throw bombs out here

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:44.899
you got golden bombs I just realized

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:49.399
it's actually you know I entered a state

00:22:44.899 --> 00:22:50.899
of deep regret merely temporarily when I

00:22:49.399 --> 00:22:52.429
looked at this run or when I looked at

00:22:50.899 --> 00:22:53.029
this boss rush I was like this is a bad

00:22:52.429 --> 00:22:54.500
idea

00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:58.690
I shouldn't have done this and that's

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.690
correct however we have golden bombs

00:22:59.679 --> 00:23:05.659
golden bombs are going to buy us a lot

00:23:03.529 --> 00:23:07.159
of a lot of damage basically we're going

00:23:05.659 --> 00:23:08.419
to live longer as a result of their

00:23:07.159 --> 00:23:10.070
existence I don't know what we did to

00:23:08.419 --> 00:23:14.840
the other enemy I guess they just were

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:18.879
not very tanky see if every wave was

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:18.879
like that I'd be a happy man

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:29.030
can our shots from the lyall tears do

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:31.370
like more damage than the first hit if

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:42.530
there's only one enemy I don't believe

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:51.890
so I thought you died I thought I saw

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:53.120
you die either way I'm glad I realized

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:55.930
that we had golden bombs we're actually

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:58.310
going to get out of here I think in a

00:23:55.930 --> 00:24:00.680
hello hello hello

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:05.390
wait there we go in a relatively timely

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:07.010
fashion albeit probably with a little

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:08.300
bit less HP than I would have liked and

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:10.430
the little brim pickup might have saved

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:12.080
us as well but again was it worth it for

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:19.210
the for the value we got out of this

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:23.600
almost certainly no my favourite

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:27.970
fan-made sequel to a James Bond film dr.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:27.970
no and then doctor almost certainly yes

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:37.630
doctor doc dude tell me the no I got a

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:41.120
Golden Gun my name is James bones that's

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:43.520
that's my spy parody of doctor no it's

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:45.200
called doctor doctor tell me the news I

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:50.840
got a bad case of loving you and then in

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:55.250
parentheses it says James Bond theme in

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:57.490
parentheses that says Superman it's not

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:57.490
easy

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:03.090
you know I read an article buzz its

00:25:00.809 --> 00:25:05.010
Wikipedia let's be honest I was it might

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:06.780
have been defecating today I was reading

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:09.270
about Savage Garden because I live in a

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:10.980
Savage Garden well I was a deep rabbit

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:13.320
hole actually I wikipedia'd men at work

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:14.970
and then you're like oh man at work you

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:18.120
know down under was ranked four in

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:19.890
Australia's 30 best songs that they did

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:21.179
you know about their countries that

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:23.160
would have been produced in Australia by

00:25:21.179 --> 00:25:24.900
Australian bands and singer-songwriter

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.640
something okay what else is on that list

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:29.610
uh Savage Garden

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:32.669
I forgot that savage garden's Australian

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:35.789
so I read up about Savage Garden for a

00:25:32.669 --> 00:25:38.400
band that was on the radio for like 22

00:25:35.789 --> 00:25:40.230
years Savage Garden had like a six-day

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:44.669
career which is amazing to me they'd

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:46.350
made two albums blessed and guided by

00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:50.370
voices made in a month

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:51.960
but either way there's like not that I

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:55.440
wanted but there was a savage garden

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:58.110
like reunion post they asked the lead

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:59.490
singer like hey ancient Savage Garden

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:01.250
would ever get back together because I'd

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:03.480
like to hear truly madly deeply for the

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:04.830
134 thousands of time instead of just

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:09.720
one hundred and thirty three thousand

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:12.419
999 times and the lead singer said if it

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:15.750
would cure cancer I would get back

00:26:12.419 --> 00:26:21.049
together apart from that no some bad

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:25.679
blood dude why not we'll take fruitcake

00:26:21.049 --> 00:26:29.940
like what if it would cure oral herpes

00:26:25.679 --> 00:26:31.919
that would help a lot of people out not

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:35.700
quite at the same level of one of the

00:26:31.919 --> 00:26:37.710
most deadly diseases I don't think we

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:39.000
need the virus honestly but it would

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:40.590
still be helpful but like that's not

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.570
enough you duck sorry no I'm looking for

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:46.460
more I don't think he tried to be by

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:50.309
there I should have stuck with the virus

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:53.720
don't it all seem to go you don't know

00:26:50.309 --> 00:26:53.720
what you got till it's gone

00:26:53.780 --> 00:27:00.110
I mean I guess I could understand it

00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:01.940
like if I'd ridden like I don't want to

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:03.410
hear any Savage Garden song every I'm

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:05.650
not insulting Savage Garden by the way

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:08.780
you like Savage Garden more power to you

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:10.250
but if I could never hear another Savage

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:13.670
Garden song as long as I lived I

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:16.940
wouldn't even know it I've heard truly

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:20.060
madly deeply infinity times a bee or

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:23.660
something something something else I'll

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:26.180
be I'll be Oh something me of something

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:30.560
something instead I'll be you know just

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:33.770
I think that the flight of the conchords

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:36.140
song that Bret writes about his

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:38.780
girlfriend in season one is a parody of

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:40.790
that you know it's like I'm just

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:43.160
stealing the bit but at least I'm giving

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:45.020
credit you know I'm sourcing the bit you

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:47.870
know he says like I climb the highest

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:50.660
mountain and then you know Jermaine is

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:53.090
like would you really climb the highest

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:54.830
mountain forth and in Brett's like no

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:56.990
and Jermaine's like why'd you save it

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:58.580
and then Bret said that's a metaphor and

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:59.960
Jemaine stay as a metaphor for what he

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:03.170
says you know for how I'd do anything

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:04.820
for and then bread or Jermaine says what

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:07.190
would you climb the highest mountain for

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:09.440
and then Greg goes I see your point

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:13.030
which I always thought that was a genius

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:15.050
bit that I've butchered incredibly here

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:18.320
but then you know they also had there

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:21.470
was like that the animal song for that

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:23.150
about a million and a half times is that

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:25.910
who I want you I don't know if I need

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:27.410
you but what died to find out not a big

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:29.150
fan out one either to be honest with you

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:32.390
or at least if I was at one point is

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:33.710
then played it's been granted dust the

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:36.410
amount of times they played that at the

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:38.780
the old radio shack and by that I mean

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:43.160
the shack where the radio comes from not

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:48.380
Radio Shack the now-defunct brand anyway

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:50.210
I took this rent is just strange now I

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:55.130
took white pony I think white ponies

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:58.730
like it's a good item good spacebar item

00:28:55.130 --> 00:29:00.300
it's our third ability to fly getting a

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:02.220
little silly but

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:03.300
I like the fact that once every four

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:04.820
rooms are going to be able to do some

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:09.960
good work with it

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:12.930
it's a collaborator mostly like the the

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:14.760
inherent strength of this run is we

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:15.960
shoot really quickly and some of those

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:18.150
shots are going to give us blinding

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:19.380
light I'm not trying to disparage you

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:20.700
know the other good qualities of this

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:23.940
run but that's really the moneymaker

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:25.980
right now is the fact that we're rolling

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:30.770
the dice to get a good effect quite

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:33.120
frequently what makes you larger is

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:35.270
basically extraordinarily irrelevant

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:37.410
right now anyway the run should be a

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:39.330
fairly easy win I think we might have

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:42.240
soy milks ourselves which is a strange

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:44.400
expression out of the that's my key she

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:46.260
took it might have soy milk ourselves

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:50.880
out of a great ability to do the hush

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:55.100
fight with confidence but it's not not

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:57.510
at all bad it's just not may be quite as

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:59.850
quite as good as it looked but when you

00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:03.390
see soy milk like you're already sort of

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:05.610
screwed you just have to lean into it I

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:07.740
think and I like soy milk soy milk is in

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:09.840
no danger of entering the pile of like

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:12.090
items that I will not take every time

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:13.470
that it shows up like Isaac's heart I

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:15.690
will never take because I've had enough

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:19.050
tangible bad experiences where it

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:21.090
basically ruined my run and rerolls

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:23.090
maybe should enter onto that pile but I

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:24.960
like doing them so you know so sue me

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:28.640
there's a girl that's been on my mind

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:31.290
all the time so so sue me

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:34.070
it's a Sussudio riff it doesn't really

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:34.070
work but you get the idea

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:40.620
but soymilk is God redeeming

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:42.090
characteristics and it's fun so I'm

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:44.100
gonna I'm gonna keep taking it but on

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:46.020
this on this situation it was probably

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:48.930
the wrong call the reason that I took it

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:50.970
is because once you see it you might as

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:53.040
well take it you've already lost a great

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:54.300
chance to get special items in the

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.920
future you might as well go with a

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:58.110
special item they gave you even if it's

00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:00.750
not so good unless it would actually

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:01.950
ruin your run in which case don't take

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:03.930
it but I don't think it ruined our run

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:06.570
it just it's seasoned dinner we you know

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:08.510
we should have gotten buffalo we got you

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:11.120
know honey garlic instead

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:13.070
whereas the place is called Buffalo Wild

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:17.090
Wings we should have good why would you

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:20.330
get the honey garlic but I've never been

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:22.580
to a Buffalo Wild Wings I phrased that

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:25.220
as if it was like a political thing like

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:28.340
I've never been to a Buffalo Wild Wings

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:30.710
but really it just site I don't think

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:33.429
I've ever been around a Buffalo Wild

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:36.710
Wings if I'm being honest with you I

00:31:33.429 --> 00:31:40.490
don't know if they have it in British

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:42.080
Columbia I mean we probably should take

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:44.540
this as long as we don't die immediately

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:46.790
upon picking it up we have a place here

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:48.860
called wings but I don't think it's

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:50.450
Buffalo Wild Wings all I think is like

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:55.429
that's like getting the Twitter handle

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:57.440
like twitter.com slash you know USA or

00:31:55.429 --> 00:31:59.080
something like that like which we call

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:01.340
our restaurant would we sell their wings

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:03.110
all right look it up it's got to be

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:05.720
taken but if it's not taken sure we'll

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:07.429
call it wings and then you comes back

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:09.410
the next day and he's like take in here

00:32:07.429 --> 00:32:16.780
and we got it take it how could we not

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:16.780
take wings it's out of control

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:28.160
anyway this has now become a run where

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:38.660
like I've exhausted my riffs dude

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:43.640
I need more riffs you're alive but I

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:45.140
actually got soul mine flooded I was not

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:46.820
really paying attention there's a little

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:49.520
like white popcorn thing going on in the

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:50.929
screen there this is two floors in a row

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.520
but personally unknown and I find myself

00:32:50.929 --> 00:32:55.059
slightly perturbed and frightened about

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:57.350
the situation but as long as we I mean

00:32:55.059 --> 00:32:59.390
if we find a second secret room we can

00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:01.520
make you supportable slot but if you're

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:05.330
like that's portable slot ends up being

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:07.929
useful and like literally maybe like 5%

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:09.950
of the times you actually find it but

00:33:07.929 --> 00:33:14.600
that doesn't mean that we should ignore

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:19.580
it 100% at a time I just want to see my

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:21.860
HP please I haven't seen my HP in three

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:26.860
years it's long enough to declare it

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:28.880
legally dead spent its fat body from

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:30.049
Austin Powers to the Spy Who shagged me

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.299
you remember him

00:33:30.049 --> 00:33:35.690
I thought his name was different no you

00:33:32.299 --> 00:33:39.049
must be oh you saw the you saw the

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:40.460
Unrated version in the version that's

00:33:39.049 --> 00:33:44.540
safe for you to be is called fat buddy

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:46.669
it's very you know it's a Berenstein

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:49.190
bears you know Mandela effects sort of

00:33:46.669 --> 00:33:51.410
situation could you do me a favor and

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:52.970
grab that please bump oh thank you see

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:55.429
the thing is Bumbo I'm going to need you

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:57.860
to deal like all of the damage that we

00:33:55.429 --> 00:34:00.020
ever do on this run so if you could find

00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:02.840
it in your heart to get to max level as

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:05.860
soon as possible I'd be an extremely

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.860
happy camper

00:34:08.349 --> 00:34:19.239
I don't like that these are exploding

00:34:16.569 --> 00:34:20.799
more often I liked it when they weren't

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:24.489
exploding that much and I felt better

00:34:20.799 --> 00:34:26.319
about my ad my chances of survival but

00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:27.669
it is working we're getting the coins

00:34:26.319 --> 00:34:30.549
I'm just now realizing because of

00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:32.829
fruitcake and I guess piggy bank when we

00:34:30.549 --> 00:34:34.419
get hit as well but fruitcake is

00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:37.919
occasionally even giving us head of the

00:34:34.419 --> 00:34:40.960
keeper which makes sense

00:34:37.919 --> 00:34:42.789
we've got enough bombs to go for these I

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:46.119
think take those you've got to be

00:34:42.789 --> 00:34:48.579
getting pretty close here pretty close

00:34:46.119 --> 00:34:50.589
to him reaching max level I mean so

00:34:48.579 --> 00:34:52.929
we're just waiting for Libra I mean it's

00:34:50.589 --> 00:34:54.099
I could try to spin it a hundred

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:55.509
different ways we know what we're

00:34:54.099 --> 00:35:01.630
looking for here we're looking for Libra

00:34:55.509 --> 00:35:03.190
in all the right places a Libra pickup

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:06.009
completely changes the game we probably

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:08.650
go from like we go from one rate of fire

00:35:06.009 --> 00:35:10.599
to two rate of fire we go from two

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:12.339
damage to you know probably like 70

00:35:10.599 --> 00:35:14.710
maybe said it's a little bit of a

00:35:12.339 --> 00:35:16.630
stretch but you understand where I'm

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:18.729
coming from oh I shouldn't have made the

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:21.519
leap but it still work all right max

00:35:18.729 --> 00:35:24.329
level Bumbo is where I want to be but I

00:35:21.519 --> 00:35:24.329
guess I'm already there

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:36.620
I'm still trying to like divine how I

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:41.150
feel about static electricity tears I

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:42.830
think they're like not that great but

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:44.150
they look cool as heck and then they're

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:46.250
especially not that great if you can

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:47.810
only get them like now and then but if

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:49.640
you get them consistently I think they

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:53.030
can be interesting I'm just not sure if

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:54.800
they're like a 10 out of 10 yet please

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:55.880
don't give me curse be unknown for one

00:35:54.800 --> 00:36:01.840
more floor we're about to get win number

00:35:55.880 --> 00:36:05.990
12 curse of the maze is okay by me I

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:07.070
like this actually Midas Touch gives us

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:09.200
something we can really use to take

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:11.510
advantage of for permanent Polaroid

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:13.720
invincibility or power bill for that

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:13.720
matter

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:23.790
all right like not quite the greatest

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.240
amount of damage that I've ever seen in

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:31.080
my life

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:32.820
I don't care pick up them pick up the

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:36.180
money I don't need it we got to go from

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:40.110
91 damaged 92 damage per tick to 99 who

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:41.460
cares man the soul was a nice pickup

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:43.590
it's pushing away the shots that would

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:45.440
otherwise be annoying for us to deal

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:49.950
with it again we should have like a

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:53.480
pretty easy win coming our way right

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:57.120
fire mine stop shooting

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:58.950
but I feel the need to apologize not

00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:01.770
necessarily for picking up soy milk but

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:03.510
you know some items with cher shall

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:06.690
remain nameless that rhyme with you know

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:08.640
boys silk well if all the rhymes you

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:12.390
could enjoy chosen why did you go boys

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:20.370
silk that's just the water something

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:23.460
that rhymes with Thole elk yeah - al

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:24.780
that'll do it hey it's me your cousin

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:31.500
this is the sound you've been looking

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:32.760
for toy al that's I'm a little

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:34.740
apologetic for picking that up because

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:36.840
it kind of it squandered a little pace

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:38.190
on this run but you know what you can

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.810
squander some salsa you still got

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:43.670
tortilla chips left in the bag you're

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:43.670
going to eat the salsa nonetheless right

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:49.650
problem lets you some kind of weird

00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:52.560
I mean I'll lead tortilla chips without

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:54.480
salsa but if I have tortilla chips and

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.740
salsa they go together it's not like I'm

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.820
just going to leave some salsa in the

00:37:55.740 --> 00:38:00.870
fridge and eat some tortilla chips

00:37:56.820 --> 00:38:02.550
that's that's madness much more of a

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:05.180
social affront than burping in public I

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:05.180
promise you that

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:10.280
I promise you that is my personal

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:16.100
opinion is how that sentence should have

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:18.230
been ended anyway the dusting continues

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:21.530
but the run never ends man this is just

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:23.240
at this point we're approaching the

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:25.100
Platonic ideal for an Isaac Graham which

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:27.470
is as soon as I get a damage upgrade on

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:28.940
the first floor you might as well just

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:34.550
say Game one and let me reroll the

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:36.050
Eden's start to see what happens we got

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:37.630
to play this one out though just to see

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:40.490
you never know

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:43.930
rogue v4 could show up and throw

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:43.930
everything into disarray

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:54.650
Thank You gimpy like great work gimpy I

00:38:54.770 --> 00:39:05.360
think we're just going to walk into this

00:38:56.970 --> 00:39:07.350
guy like mathematically and

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:09.210
psychologically this seems like the best

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:12.360
option because there's literally no risk

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:14.010
of death didn't end up popping off

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.600
damage-wise quite like I expected but

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:17.340
that's where number 12

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.720
nothing that's means that and we're

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:19.860
looking pretty strong here for now

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.510
