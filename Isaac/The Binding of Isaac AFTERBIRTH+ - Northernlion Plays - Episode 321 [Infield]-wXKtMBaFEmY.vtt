00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.330
everybody welcome back northernlion

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.680
binding of issac let's go

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.050
why did it call The Binding of Isaac

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.900
there's 11 characters in it you ever

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.190
think about that probably not huh you

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.139
ever catch me outside how about that

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.060
okay well thanks for watching I hope you

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.490
enjoyed the episode

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:24.720
fy8 pd-1 8xa we got three numbers in

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.160
there that's pretty good as we know from

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.590
the thing that I made up like two

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.260
episodes ago the numbers give the seed

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.500
its strength and the letters give this

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.989
seeded Zane so a three out of eight

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.510
strength at a five out of eight Zane you

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.000
know that's got potential means you

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.950
can't actually get you know an 8 out of

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.680
8 unless you had a gun character that

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.719
was both a number and a letter you know

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:54.149
that's not possible but I would allow it

00:00:48.719 --> 00:01:01.289
if we got oh oh oh oh it's magic you

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:06.960
know oh it's gonna be one of those

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:09.330
episodes huh hmm oh that was a little

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.659
dicey there okay so well I'll sacrifice

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.729
a little bit come to this room that was

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.740
slightly dangerous but this ended up

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.710
actually working out fairly nicely for

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.080
us and considering we have placenta and

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.540
a little bit of row gauge P a little bit

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.070
of extra HP I wouldn't mind being able

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.619
to get to that fifth cent so we could

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.860
actually create a an arcade on the next

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:36.780
floor maybe get IV bag and start balling

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:39.030
out of control oh let's magic looking

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.579
for a bomb as well you got to tinted

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.290
rocks so one bomb might not even be

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.659
enough to take full advantage of that

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.659
but it's enough to it's enough to dream

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.560
there we go okay so our fifth set gives

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.060
us as good a chance as anything else we

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.580
just want one more bomb that we probably

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.110
will not get but honestly like a tax fly

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.550
right off the bed that could be our

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.380
three out of ten strengths or three out

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.990
of eight strengths sorry got very

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.810
confused there temporarily that is

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.030
perfectly decent for killing a lot of

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.230
these enemies so we'll leave the spear

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.610
at ours it's nicely we have the half

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.650
black heart at least to keep us in the

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.630
game here when it comes to a deal with

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.380
the devil purposes but you know last run

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.880
we it was too easy it's fine it's not

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.030
like I'm disappointed by the way the

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.610
last run when it was actually great but

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:35.160
we're due for maybe a little bit of

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:38.260
difficulty here and I wouldn't mind you

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.060
know some controlled difficulty with the

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.590
little Zayn head you know what I mean

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.540
like some notes of Zayn good good start

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.400
just walking into the fire to remove

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.140
like one of your biggest advantages so

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.970
these are good trinkets but curved horn

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.910
is the the one that's cheap amongst them

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.380
I think although I will say occasional

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.730
holy mantle has been very good

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.380
originally that's an item or a trinket I

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.480
guess I should say that I was somewhat

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.310
skeptical of cuz really odd you know I'd

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.110
rather have the real deal than the diet

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:13.660
holy mantle but the the truth of the

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.670
matter is that it's not really diet holy

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.440
mantle like a lot of the time it

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.030
actually hooks you up with that holy

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.030
mantle taste with none of the calories

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.630
dark bomb obviously like also fantastic

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:34.030
that's not a secret room I would have I

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:36.190
would have bet my life on it like a

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.160
Mumford &amp; Sons song said Mumford &amp; Sons

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.560
I don't know it's it's in the beard rock

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.260
category and I always associate that

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.420
with like you know Mumford &amp; Sons and

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.530
Old Crow Medicine Show might not be

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.530
Mumford &amp; Sons though

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:59.640
HP not what I was hoping for ooh this is

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.620
interesting I'll take a little delirium

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.690
even though I sort of hate it because

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.070
I'm a masochist in that department and

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.360
obviously I'll work towards the GAVI

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.940
transformation which we have not been

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.500
able to bring to fruition lately the run

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:15.000
is otherwise like really completely fine

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:20.120
mostly as a result of that curved horn

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.370
pickup admittedly but I would love to

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.410
get like a spirit heart and I realized

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.970
we squandered the last one but I would

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.410
like really love to get us beer at heart

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.150
the easiest way to do that without a

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.000
doubt is just to get like a couple of

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.780
red hearts and have dark bum pick them

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.320
up but we've made some snack rifice is

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.820
for the for the good of the team here

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.130
went down to our starting level of HP

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.390
just to just to pick up some weird deal

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.440
with the devil stuff and now it's time

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:54.960
for you know us to have dividends paid

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:58.560
sounds like a PlayStation 4 exclusive

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.060
dividends paid david cage has written a

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.360
game in which you play as a cyborg

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.560
banker but he's also on the inside he's

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.950
a whistleblower because he hates

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.380
corruption dividends paid you can choose

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:13.350
to seize the means of production you

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.210
could choose to keep your mouth shut and

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.790
Bank your you know one hundred and

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.630
twenty two million dollar bonus or you

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.830
could you know be a real person and be a

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:27.390
multi-layered and uncomplicated

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.770
individual I'm just oh it's a David cage

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.450
game you can only choose those two

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.400
anyway

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:34.590
I'm not anti David cage I'm actually I'm

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.540
Pro David cage because I've never played

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.340
a David cage game but I love the idea of

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.650
it and I think that's where I will

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.240
choose to stay for now unless Detroit

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.610
ends up being amazing in which code in

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.200
which case all uh I'd love to take a

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.890
look at I still need to play until dawn

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.180
that's like until dawn is my own

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.510
personal Everest because it highlights

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.310
the depth of my laziness where I'm like

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.250
I would love to play until dawn I think

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.860
that game is like a ten out of ten me

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:04.370
game from what I've seen which is

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.170
admittedly not that much because

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:10.190
I don't want to spoil it for myself and

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:13.160
I know it will never come to PC I'm just

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.780
too lazy to bring the ps4 from Kate's

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.800
office into the living room to play it

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:21.350
and I don't have a defense of myself I

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.090
can't say like yeah the shooter just

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:27.050
came out with it on PC like I understand

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:29.960
how the business works I just I wish I

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:33.350
wish I had the motivation to do this one

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.780
thing in particular I mean it's not like

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:38.180
I'm rushing to used all of our tees but

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.930
it's not like I'm just doing nothing

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.920
in the meantime like if anything I

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.990
didn't this is going to make me sound

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.970
like a better person than I am but my

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:51.520
life is sort of backwards and that I

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:54.110
work too much and then I have to budget

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.600
free time and force myself to do it as

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.580
ridiculous as that sounds but even then

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.530
like a lot of the time I'm like I'm

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.080
going to force myself to stop working

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:07.370
now so I can do my C++ homework you know

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:08.750
it's I'm like an I've become an anti

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.420
procrastinator in a way that might

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:13.850
actually be deleterious to my to my

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.640
well-being some mild extent at least but

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:20.990
I really should play until dawn

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:27.320
it looks like my sorta Jam okay good

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:30.140
damage with your flies here ever wonder

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:33.020
why this joke has to be one that already

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:36.310
exists I refuse to believe that this is

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:39.380
a northernlion original why do you call

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:41.900
there's no punch line why do you call

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.940
the zippered part of your jeans the fly

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.260
I don't understand well there's the

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.460
flight of the conchords joke they call

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.620
it a fly because it takes you up to

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:51.980
heaven but I I'm asking from a genuine

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:54.220
standpoint I almost feel Ellie if we're

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:58.940
going to take something we should take

00:07:54.220 --> 00:08:00.500
everything I think the proper way to

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:03.020
handle this is this you take the shovel

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:06.080
you take spirit of the night and then

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:07.790
that actually gives you one extra spirit

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.580
heart so word we did that in the right

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:14.990
way even if we hadn't taken all of them

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:17.330
ooh we wouldn't have been in a better

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.319
position I don't like the clicker as far

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:23.990
as I'm concerned that's

00:08:18.319 --> 00:08:26.449
that's out why do we call it a fly fly

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.889
does not refer to the button fly refers

00:08:26.449 --> 00:08:29.509
to the flattened material covering the

00:08:27.889 --> 00:08:30.949
opening or fastening of a garment the

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:33.259
term was originally used in England to

00:08:30.949 --> 00:08:35.569
refer to the flap on a tent which flaps

00:08:33.259 --> 00:08:38.000
or flies when the wind blows if not tied

00:08:35.569 --> 00:08:39.500
down this is why the English language is

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.440
stupid because that makes perfect sense

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:47.240
but only in like the most idiotic

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:49.910
conceivable fashion hey I'm an alien

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.949
visiting from the planet Nebulon what's

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:53.839
that thing on your pants called a fly

00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:57.079
I'm so confused by your human customs

00:08:53.839 --> 00:08:59.540
isn't a fly a verb that you use when you

00:08:57.079 --> 00:09:01.040
go up in the air oh yes you see we named

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.360
that thing after something that looks

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:06.220
similar on a completely different

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:10.040
apparatus and rather than come up with a

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:11.420
new name literally trillions of possible

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.069
combinations to put letters in the

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.690
English language into we just chose to

00:09:13.069 --> 00:09:15.769
use another word that normally means

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:18.079
something completely different

00:09:15.769 --> 00:09:20.420
all right well I will be dropping space

00:09:18.079 --> 00:09:25.760
nukes on you now thank you so much for

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:30.470
your brevity enjoy cosmic in existence

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:32.300
so I took another fly here basically for

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:34.430
Beelzebub but it's actually in hindsight

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.959
not really very smart because we can

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:38.899
already fly which is the best part of

00:09:35.959 --> 00:09:41.319
the elves above the best part of the

00:09:38.899 --> 00:09:45.339
house the bub

00:09:41.319 --> 00:09:45.339
soldiers in yup

00:09:49.229 --> 00:09:53.639
you know people make fun of that slogan

00:09:51.699 --> 00:09:56.769
but I think it might be true

00:09:53.639 --> 00:10:00.759
not Folgers like but I think the best

00:09:56.769 --> 00:10:02.319
part of waking up is coffee Oh unless

00:10:00.759 --> 00:10:04.689
you're waking up and you're like in a

00:10:02.319 --> 00:10:06.399
hotel that has a breakfast buffet in

00:10:04.689 --> 00:10:09.179
which case the best part of waking up is

00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:12.729
the breakfast buffet no flippin doubt

00:10:09.179 --> 00:10:15.519
but like obviously like on a non-ironic

00:10:12.729 --> 00:10:17.109
level the actual best part of waking up

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:19.719
is like wow another day

00:10:17.109 --> 00:10:21.969
you know to enjoy this beautiful planet

00:10:19.719 --> 00:10:23.469
if you're in a position to enjoy it at

00:10:21.969 --> 00:10:25.029
least you know I know I'm not going to

00:10:23.469 --> 00:10:27.639
say that everybody's always happy when

00:10:25.029 --> 00:10:29.619
they wake up but you know I'm like when

00:10:27.639 --> 00:10:31.239
I wake up I am imagine there is sort of

00:10:29.619 --> 00:10:33.429
an implicit thought that's like sweet

00:10:31.239 --> 00:10:37.059
I'm not dead and then it's like I could

00:10:33.429 --> 00:10:38.799
really use some coffee those are the two

00:10:37.059 --> 00:10:41.919
big ones those are the two human

00:10:38.799 --> 00:10:43.149
emotions I don't know if I want to buy a

00:10:41.919 --> 00:10:44.829
spirit heart I was kind of over

00:10:43.149 --> 00:10:47.499
something a little bit more robust in

00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:52.689
there those are the big ones for me at

00:10:47.499 --> 00:10:55.119
least like that in like there's like the

00:10:52.689 --> 00:10:56.919
Holy Trinity is sweet I'm not dead well

00:10:55.119 --> 00:10:58.539
I've got cold brew coffee concentrate in

00:10:56.919 --> 00:11:00.069
the fridge I can mix into a cup of

00:10:58.539 --> 00:11:02.709
coffee and have inside of my body within

00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:05.349
the next 45 seconds and oh my god we got

00:11:02.709 --> 00:11:06.789
takeout yesterday and we didn't eat it

00:11:05.349 --> 00:11:07.899
all so there's like cold takeout in the

00:11:06.789 --> 00:11:11.469
fridge that I can eat for breakfast

00:11:07.899 --> 00:11:15.359
that's my perfect morning I'm a weird

00:11:11.469 --> 00:11:17.679
cold food boy not afraid to admit it

00:11:15.359 --> 00:11:19.209
this why wouldn't people suggest that

00:11:17.679 --> 00:11:20.199
I'm still a picky eater because I go

00:11:19.209 --> 00:11:21.549
like oh I don't think you should eat a

00:11:20.199 --> 00:11:23.319
whole bag of potato chips for dinner

00:11:21.549 --> 00:11:26.259
every night they go onl you're a snob

00:11:23.319 --> 00:11:28.359
but like in college I got used to it

00:11:26.259 --> 00:11:29.919
like I would go out for dinner with my

00:11:28.359 --> 00:11:32.589
parents you know a couple times a month

00:11:29.919 --> 00:11:35.469
usually because I went to university in

00:11:32.589 --> 00:11:39.099
the same hometown that I that I grew up

00:11:35.469 --> 00:11:40.839
in although I lived off off parents I

00:11:39.099 --> 00:11:43.119
mean I lived off my parents as well

00:11:40.839 --> 00:11:45.039
which I'm very grateful for but I also

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:47.379
lived away from them during that time

00:11:45.039 --> 00:11:48.729
period anyway the point is um you know

00:11:47.379 --> 00:11:51.309
we go out for like Thai food or

00:11:48.729 --> 00:11:53.889
something like that and then the next

00:11:51.309 --> 00:11:56.409
day I would just eat the cold like

00:11:53.889 --> 00:11:58.539
bamboo shoots rice noodles whatever it

00:11:56.409 --> 00:12:00.279
is man and I'd be the happiest person in

00:11:58.539 --> 00:12:01.920
the world people go oh yeah oh and cold

00:12:00.279 --> 00:12:05.519
food cold pizza and I not

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:08.220
cold pizza as like stage zero when

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:09.690
you're eating like cold spaghetti which

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.370
obviously is alive because I don't even

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:13.829
really like spaghetti but you know when

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:19.709
you're eating cold pasta that's how you

00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:22.860
know when you're eating a you know just

00:12:19.709 --> 00:12:25.649
a hunk of raw Swiss Chalet chicken then

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:30.930
you got left in the refrigerator

00:12:25.649 --> 00:12:34.740
please just stop this that's actually a

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:40.519
very worthwhile health upgrade that's

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:44.550
why I think like Twitter is for babies

00:12:40.519 --> 00:12:46.050
like myself included but um you know

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:48.839
people are like they'll have debates

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:50.790
like cold pizza is it okay and I'm like

00:12:48.839 --> 00:12:52.860
I mean biologically is 100 percent okay

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:55.019
and then people go I mean I realize this

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:57.300
is also my brand quote-unquote because

00:12:55.019 --> 00:12:58.920
of the NL SS but you know they're like

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.690
if you had pineapple on a pizza it's

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.670
sacrilege the creator of having

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:04.260
pineapple on pizza said that grabbin

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:07.800
pineapple on Pisa was bad and then he

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:09.449
died you're like okay well here's the

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.490
thing I'm just going to enjoy the thing

00:13:09.449 --> 00:13:14.250
that I enjoy I will argue with you about

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:16.320
the absurdity of it like when we talk

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:17.370
about someone's like oh my favorite

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.050
sandwich is like a grilled cheese

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:20.339
sandwich on a PITA I would be like you

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:22.260
got to tell me more about the way you

00:13:20.339 --> 00:13:24.300
live your life because it's absurd and I

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.800
want to know from a place from a human

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.480
curiosity level I want to know why

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.880
you're eating grilled cheeses on a PITA

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:32.720
that's very strange maybe you're onto

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:35.220
something probably not but tell me more

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.649
whenever someone's like you know Gordon

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:39.870
Ramsay doesn't like pineapple on a pizza

00:13:37.649 --> 00:13:44.970
I'm like this I'm never gonna eat pizza

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:48.959
with gordon ramsay gordon ramsay is not

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:52.079
the inventor of food is it you realize

00:13:48.959 --> 00:13:54.390
dude is boring like 1960 there was food

00:13:52.079 --> 00:13:57.180
before that people were making you know

00:13:54.390 --> 00:14:01.230
a ham and bananas hollandaise serving it

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:04.270
at their Tupperware parties I don't care

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:06.980
what Gordon Ramsay thinks of pizza

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:08.450
people is not an English food to begin

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:10.370
with I'm not saying it's a Canadian food

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:13.130
either I'm just saying you know it's

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:17.210
like hey mmm Gordon Ramsay what's

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:19.550
acceptable in a pad thai uh chicken and

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:21.020
bananas Gordon Randy you're not from

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:23.090
Thailand you don't get to be an

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.830
authority on all foods just because it's

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:27.200
all I know I understand I like Gordon

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:28.640
Ramsay to begin with spend far too much

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:32.150
money in one of his steak houses one

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:34.670
time in my defense it was my money but

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:39.050
part of it had come from Amazon so it's

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:42.110
okay but it's people are like look

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:44.480
exhibit a pineapples not okay on a pizza

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:47.600
what I will say and I say this is

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:49.730
someone who probably my most consumed

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:53.810
pizza in the last five years is Hawaiian

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:56.450
which is the Canadian Pizza has ham and

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:57.770
pineapple on it but anyway there are

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:59.870
some times I don't like pineapple on a

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:02.660
pizza canned pineapple on a pizza is

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:04.100
like a little too sweet if it's it

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.690
doesn't and I don't mean that it has to

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.940
be like good freshest organic pineapple

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:09.890
but something about like sometimes you

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:14.050
order like a pineapple pizza and you're

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:17.630
like this is literally like from a can

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:18.020
of pineapple that was in syrup this is

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:23.690
weird

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:27.050
ish but anyway I digress my opinion on

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:31.130
the pizza argument of pineapple on a

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:34.010
pizza is that you should get whatever

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:36.020
you like and if you're being like a

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:38.180
fascist about pizza ingredients you can

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:40.610
buy your own freakin pizza okay that's

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:42.740
the thing like if we're if there's two

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:44.120
of us let's say there's like four people

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.589
two of them want pineapple two of them

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.900
don't and they're all trying to decide

00:15:45.589 --> 00:15:51.440
on one pizza and one group is like we

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:52.730
you can't have olives on a pizza is that

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.380
they don't like them it's like you can't

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:56.300
have them it's not a real pizza

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:58.339
it doesn't belong even though this pizza

00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:01.550
place has been in business for 82 years

00:15:58.339 --> 00:16:02.930
is their top seller doesn't belong then

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:04.820
you know what or your own pepperoni

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:06.380
pizza you freaking baby I'll tell you

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:08.480
what babe I'll pick up the pineapple

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:10.250
pizza tab you and I can enjoy it

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:14.390
together we seem like kindred spirits

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:15.830
you guys enjoy your well I only would

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:17.959
like pizza with the garlic bread

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:19.610
crust can we get but I only like it's

00:16:17.959 --> 00:16:21.320
like the one of us always lives one of

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:23.540
us always tells the truth meme trying to

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:27.470
give these fascists to order pizza

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:29.660
together one of its only locks original

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:33.709
hand tossed crust and one of us only

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:35.500
lots of deep dish calling the the

00:16:33.709 --> 00:16:39.529
hostage negotiator

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:42.709
can we all agree just one step forward

00:16:39.529 --> 00:16:45.380
we all want tomato sauce yeah but like a

00:16:42.709 --> 00:16:50.810
pesto can be good just come on me me in

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:56.089
the middle here I'm a mediator not a

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:58.279
meat eater just not a good joke for one

00:16:56.089 --> 00:17:00.589
but anyway alright we're close to death

00:16:58.279 --> 00:17:02.149
but we have a respawn that's great so we

00:17:00.589 --> 00:17:04.220
actually at this point and especially

00:17:02.149 --> 00:17:06.920
with an eternal heart existing I think

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:09.589
we should just you know bow out and and

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:11.540
let ourselves respawn as dark Judas so I

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:13.520
mean I actually worked out kind of

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:17.630
nicely even though I didn't mean to die

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:19.520
right there and this run is actually

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:20.689
it's kind of a I haven't talked about it

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.449
in like three floors here but it's a

00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:25.040
little bit of a dangerous run of an

00:17:23.449 --> 00:17:26.720
archetype at least it's a dangerous

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:29.240
archetype of a run and I say that

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:33.440
because it tricks you into thinking

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:35.570
you're completely set but we're probably

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.570
completely set long term in the short

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:40.550
term variants could put us in a bad spot

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:42.620
if I play badly take some bad damage

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:44.510
before duck bum can get us up to you

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:46.540
know like eight spirit hearts anything

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:49.340
could happen

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:52.070
but you know we're already at four

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:55.250
spirit arts and effectively in five HP

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:57.020
so we're we're closing in on being very

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:59.870
very strong here and this is the depth

00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:05.210
to like these have been easy runs today

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:08.419
easy runs and very very fast so I

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:12.179
shouldn't be too perturbed I think

00:18:08.419 --> 00:18:14.400
misplaced but it's fine

00:18:12.179 --> 00:18:16.190
it's only like a 25% chance of getting a

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:19.320
spirit heart out of it anyway and

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:23.190
unlikely to matter uh you don't really

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:25.169
care about the IV bag anyway that's a

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:29.610
there's a couple discussions that like I

00:18:25.169 --> 00:18:33.179
think even with the perfect NL SS

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:34.860
loadout they've just overstayed their

00:18:33.179 --> 00:18:36.600
welcome and it's hard to talk about now

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:38.100
one of them is deli counter etiquette

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:42.510
admittedly and I'm guilty of bringing

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:45.270
that up more often I should another one

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:49.620
is is blank of sandwich now that it's

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:51.899
become a Reno me meme it's just like I

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:56.309
get these tweets people send me like you

00:18:51.899 --> 00:18:57.720
know is a piece of bread on the top of

00:18:56.309 --> 00:18:59.070
the earth at the North Pole at a piece

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.980
of the bread at the bottom of the earth

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:04.080
of the South Pole of bread or an earth

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:08.669
sandwich and I don't honestly I don't

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:10.559
care ok we've crossed that line I'm more

00:19:08.669 --> 00:19:12.720
interested in discussing the differences

00:19:10.559 --> 00:19:15.059
between us like for example one I'm so

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:18.570
attached to the idea of being an adult

00:19:15.059 --> 00:19:19.799
and wide you know Rob cooks five-star

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:22.590
meals and then serves them on paper

00:19:19.799 --> 00:19:23.880
plates and then argue that that's

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:27.360
objectively the right choice because

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:30.029
doing the dishes takes ten seconds the

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:33.840
diffic because I kind of see you I think

00:19:30.029 --> 00:19:36.240
you go for it the reason I make fun of

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:39.980
that is because I see my younger self in

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:42.210
that to be honest with you it's it's

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:44.429
serving all your meals on paper plates

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:49.100
is the epitome of like work smart not

00:19:44.429 --> 00:19:54.140
hard but for impotent reasons it's just

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:56.190
it's it's more valuable on I feel like a

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:59.340
level and you may disagree with me on

00:19:56.190 --> 00:20:01.950
this and that as such as your right to

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:04.289
get used to doing a chore that takes

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:06.659
five minutes if you do it every day then

00:20:04.289 --> 00:20:09.510
it is to come up with a bad way to

00:20:06.659 --> 00:20:11.220
circumvent it that is also harmful for

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:12.899
the environment but anyway that's like

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:15.740
another aside that makes it almost too

00:20:12.899 --> 00:20:15.740
real but you get the idea

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:22.170
all right that's more of what I'm

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.980
interested I don't care about food

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:26.290
classification that's why I always want

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:30.910
a description of ingredients when I

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:32.290
order food it's like a ham sandwich I'm

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:34.090
like you know what I'm good but I

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:38.530
understand what that means what that

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:41.560
implies at least I don't care you know

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:43.810
our pizza has you know croissants on it

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:46.360
I'll be like that's weird I've never had

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:48.130
a pizza with croissants on it but I'm

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.240
not brave enough to suggest that it

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.490
should not be okay

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:55.200
maybe your croissant Pizza is actually

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:55.200
fantastic you freakin weirdo

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:04.050
that's that's my two cents Larry Larry

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:09.420
King anyway

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:10.860
food classification is boring I'm you

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.030
know what's interesting to me is like I

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.890
was at the grocery store the other day

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:15.810
and I was trying to think of where I

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:19.410
would expect to find batteries at a

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:21.540
grocery store and it like the truth of

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:23.460
the situation is that I just I was like

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:27.030
they're gonna be near the front

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:28.770
somewhere we have like a built in from

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:30.300
we're not built in like from birth but

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:32.430
from being in the grocery store enough

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:34.410
if you asked me where I would expect to

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:35.970
find an item I have never purchased in

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:37.650
the grocery store I think I could

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:40.290
pinpoint it to within one or two aisles

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:42.270
it's like we have a grocery store neural

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:44.040
network in our own brains that just

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:46.950
tells us where we would exist we would

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:48.810
expect to be expecting to find a food

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:50.760
like if you were like where can I find

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:52.950
jasmine rice I would be like oh that's

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:56.910
got to be in the international foods

00:21:52.950 --> 00:22:01.650
aisle or possibly the bulk section but

00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:02.970
you know where would I find tampons oh

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:05.640
that well I mean obviously that's in

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:08.760
either the pharmacy or the hygiene

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:10.320
aisles I'm trying to think of an example

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:13.080
that's a little bit better but sometimes

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:14.940
like a look at grocery lists

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.110
my wife has placed something on there

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:18.690
that I've never purchased at a grocery

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:20.670
store before you'd be amazed how easy it

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:23.520
is to find most of the time I thought

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:26.430
batteries were a good example it was

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:28.050
like I expect them to be over here and

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:34.980
you know where they were they were over

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:36.630
there I the same thing should apply but

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.160
doesn't when it comes to finding a

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:41.330
bathroom at a restaurant I don't know if

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:43.290
anybody else has this exact same like

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:44.490
situation that happens whenever I'm in a

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:47.880
restaurant I have to go to the bathroom

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:49.890
it's like I'm Indiana Jones is a quest

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:52.920
for the crystal throne the porcelain

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:55.650
throne you know I'm going around like

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:57.420
you know Tonto Steph only okay done said

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:58.650
on that's the broom closet done said I'm

00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.880
dumb hey guys keep up the good work

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:03.080
didn't mean accidentally go into your

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:06.480
kitchen Denton and out the back door

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:09.060
round the corner there's a shared

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.630
bathroom in the hotel that's attached to

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:14.350
the dining room

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:16.120
no it's it's not always confusing but

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:19.030
it's always like confusing in a new

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:21.280
restaurant go in you go where's the

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:23.020
bathroom sometimes they're like oh

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.700
they're nice and they say it's back

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:27.310
there there's this one place we ate at

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:28.390
in Seattle once we ask where the

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.250
bathroom was and they're like you have

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:32.410
to leave the restaurant and then there's

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:34.090
like a code for this door and you open

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:35.500
it up and then you take the elevator up

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:39.340
to the second floor and there's the

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:42.490
bathroom it was a sushi restaurant that

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:44.200
shared its locale with a like a boutique

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:44.560
hotel or something like that and I got

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.850
you

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:47.080
there's a bathroom on the public

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:49.510
bathroom on the second floor of the

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:55.120
hotel is not only a health code

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:56.320
violation or something I'm just throwing

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:59.170
it out there I was not having an

00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:01.660
emergency at the time but if I were I

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:04.350
would have been very displeased about

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:07.480
the situation at hand oh you gotta take

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:08.770
Capricorn and I think that worked out

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:12.960
probably for the best so that we could

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:12.960
have enjoyed having mom's wig as well

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:18.790
I'm not saying the restaurant should be

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:20.260
shut down I'm just saying like I thought

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:24.030
that was like one of the things yeah

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:27.280
even if you go into like a like a little

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:28.390
15 square foot taco stand it's like

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.830
there's got to be a bathroom I don't

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:32.620
know that's true actually there's like

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:33.940
pop-up falafel carts and stuff like that

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:35.560
in Vancouver and they don't have

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:39.610
bathrooms at least not for public use

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:40.720
which is fair but I will take you to as

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:42.400
far as I'm concerned ship the route

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.170
Cheers you know six of one half a dozen

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.940
of the other both very useful we're

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:47.410
probably not gonna fight hush on this

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:50.200
one and the reason for that is very

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:53.050
simple I fought hush on the last run no

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:55.870
let's go shears is more fun we fought a

00:24:53.050 --> 00:25:00.070
hush on the last one and it was fine but

00:24:55.870 --> 00:25:01.120
I have an excuse so we've done our hush

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:03.880
quota I haven't been doing as many

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:05.320
dailies lately um because I don't know

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:10.300
if I'm kind of phasing out dailies like

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:14.669
I like dailies but I think that they are

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:19.200
less well-liked than

00:25:14.669 --> 00:25:23.609
then nan Daly's not by a ton necessarily

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:24.779
but but by the majority I believe so if

00:25:23.609 --> 00:25:26.340
we're only going to be doing one Isaac

00:25:24.779 --> 00:25:27.840
episode a day you know from from some

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.559
point onwards in the in the not so

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.929
distant future

00:25:28.559 --> 00:25:32.940
oh yeah used to not doing dailies and

00:25:30.929 --> 00:25:34.619
you know it does it atrophies your

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:36.710
competitive skill and Isaac a little bit

00:25:34.619 --> 00:25:39.330
but you know that's fine

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:41.879
I'm not Jaromir Jagr not going to be

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:43.619
playing you know speedrunning Isaac when

00:25:41.879 --> 00:25:44.999
I'm 50 probably although I've said

00:25:43.619 --> 00:25:46.440
expressions like that before and then

00:25:44.999 --> 00:25:47.850
the time has come and gone I'm still

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.139
playing this game so it's possible

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:55.129
that'll bite me in the butt at some

00:25:49.139 --> 00:25:57.629
point in the future we'll see I

00:25:55.129 --> 00:26:02.369
understand it as well by the way I'm not

00:25:57.629 --> 00:26:04.169
an eSports athlete on quote so I'm I'm

00:26:02.369 --> 00:26:05.759
you're here for the commentary for the

00:26:04.169 --> 00:26:08.909
most part I think is what I'm trying to

00:26:05.759 --> 00:26:10.139
suggest so I think the commentary tends

00:26:08.909 --> 00:26:11.249
to be better in these episodes you get a

00:26:10.139 --> 00:26:18.480
little glimpse through the slicin

00:26:11.249 --> 00:26:21.119
northern lions life that's okay it's

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:22.950
it's a good thing to reveal my psychosis

00:26:21.119 --> 00:26:25.919
we should have taken this in here just

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:28.590
in case it's perthro but assuming you

00:26:25.919 --> 00:26:30.179
know what actually buy them both be be

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:31.789
risky we're going to find a use for Plan

00:26:30.179 --> 00:26:38.730
C

00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:40.769
giving us +1 damage he's done it that's

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:45.809
how you do it boys and girls

00:26:40.769 --> 00:26:47.429
+1 damage for free nice new character

00:26:45.809 --> 00:26:53.039
I'm trying out he's called the world's

00:26:47.429 --> 00:26:58.409
most annoying dude you'd be stupid not

00:26:53.039 --> 00:26:59.879
to buy a car it's free money anyway so I

00:26:58.409 --> 00:27:02.480
guess it's just just guy who's wrong

00:26:59.879 --> 00:27:02.480
about things

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.740
even you're more annoying than that I

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:10.520
don't know where I'm taking this

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:12.620
character that's the thing the character

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:14.300
we did done the NL SS on Thursday was

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:16.550
probably like maybe two Thursday's ago

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:21.800
now this you know back login situation

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:24.470
but like I I see who's really like no

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:26.030
longer counterculture especially good

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:28.490
because I don't really know how to do an

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:32.930
iced tea impression but everyone in chat

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:36.980
told me it wasn't that bad at least hits

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:38.960
the notes you know I see but instead of

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:41.030
you know being a cop killer

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:43.730
he's like Millennials have to pull

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:48.620
themselves up by the bootstraps that's

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:50.180
what I did they could buy a house if

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:52.160
they stopped buying so much avocado

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:54.170
toast and going a little hard on the

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:56.030
ice-t Lisp I know that's part of the

00:27:54.170 --> 00:28:01.190
that's part of the character but it's

00:27:56.030 --> 00:28:02.690
going too far maybe you could afford a

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:09.770
house as you stopped buying so many

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:11.690
frappuccinos and said I'm working on it

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:13.970
at least it needs it needs a straight

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:15.440
man for that for that bit to work I

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:17.900
think because otherwise it just becomes

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:22.310
like almost like a little too real

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:25.130
there's no there's no like it doesn't

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:28.160
get bounced into absurdity it just

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:30.320
becomes the ramblings of of a crazy

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:32.600
person effectively dude come on though

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:35.720
no no deal with the devil I was ready to

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:39.580
go over the top here like Sylvester yeah

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:41.450
like Sylvester Stallone in their movie

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:43.780
we're both part of the greatest

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:45.830
generation I see you're not part of the

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:47.240
characterized version of ice-t you're

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:49.160
not part of the greatest generation

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:52.160
that's the people who fought in the

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:53.390
Second World War yeah I did that see now

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:56.240
I'm starting to just wonder if this

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:58.070
guy's okay yeah well you've gone a

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.540
little too far now Northern Line is kind

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:01.340
of like we had Jeff Dunham bit but

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:03.680
without the puppet and also this is now

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:08.960
a Mike Tyson impression but not a very

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:09.680
good one kind of lost the plot there but

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.090
that's okay

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.950
you know it's the second video of the

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:15.640
day so you should swear things start to

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:15.640
deteriorate

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:23.260
hey what's poppin on suits room doesn't

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:26.320
bother me in the least I mean we're

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:27.669
pretty much meld very good to go as long

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:34.240
as we get enough red hearts to keep

00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:35.770
ourselves stocked on dark bum pickups an

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:41.890
expression that doesn't really make that

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:45.309
much sense but it's getting this job

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:46.630
done are we looking for any we don't

00:29:45.309 --> 00:29:49.020
watch you do because we've already had

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:51.730
sugar Lupin we rebuked it to stick with

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:53.260
the shears which actually I think it's

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:55.000
working out just fine as you would might

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:56.200
as you would expect and we should have

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.059
taken this year's like I think we made

00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:01.630
the right decision there if only because

00:29:58.059 --> 00:30:03.460
the shears is probably roughly as great

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:05.500
but much rarer like shoopdawhoop

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:08.289
probably shows up like once every four

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:12.730
runs the shears by virtue of the fact

00:30:08.289 --> 00:30:14.470
that it is not an item or a drop that

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:16.990
you can get from a boss is a little bit

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:21.480
on the rarer side although not like

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:23.860
unseen of course thank you thank you

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:25.809
three of the same pill now that's where

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:28.690
things start to interest me they're all

00:30:25.809 --> 00:30:29.950
speed downs oh wow that was a sign well

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:31.059
you know what thanks a lot

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:32.919
you've helped me appreciate what I got

00:30:31.059 --> 00:30:39.309
the paved paradise and put up a parking

00:30:32.919 --> 00:30:43.870
lot I'm a sound bite Edmund and then put

00:30:39.309 --> 00:30:52.169
away the - speed I don't care about that

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:58.149
song my pace leave me the mmm

00:30:52.169 --> 00:31:00.669
DPS play he saw that's a big way okay

00:30:58.149 --> 00:31:02.830
that was almost a catastrophe people

00:31:00.669 --> 00:31:06.279
were almost entertained by me dying on

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:08.260
the void which I do not accept curse of

00:31:06.279 --> 00:31:12.120
the blind huh so this means for sure

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:15.549
cursed I closed curse of the tower

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:19.210
actually we got like four amazing items

00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:21.450
sad bombs mightor Tech X and Deadshot we

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:21.450
Deadeye

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:26.680
I'm not exaggerating I think that's

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:31.250
pretty close to a 10 out of 10 as far as

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:34.280
as far as chest items can go every

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:35.900
single one of them has like merit sad

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:39.340
bombs is kind of not as good because of

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:46.160
tech X but apart from that like this is

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:47.390
kind of ridiculously amazing a black

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:50.650
rune I don't know hey we should pick it

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:50.650
all up is they could be luck upgrades

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:57.290
no luck upgrades whatsoever

00:31:54.040 --> 00:32:02.600
I'm not mad just uh just disappointed of

00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:06.130
course two more spirit ups okay we're

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.130
officially in like can't lose territory

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:17.490
I wouldn't mind like homing tears would

00:32:15.809 --> 00:32:19.350
did infamy just protect us or something

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:21.659
there wouldn't mind like homing tears

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:22.980
but we're going to win regardless also

00:32:21.659 --> 00:32:24.330
like an increased rate of fire could be

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.350
cool but we're almost at like tap

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:28.529
shooting coin anyway

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:30.120
Bob's curse is fine Yara we should use

00:32:28.529 --> 00:32:32.610
to like double our next chest and then

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:34.110
we're hoping these are both actives how

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:36.029
she's not an active but we do have a

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:37.980
good reason to use black rune although

00:32:36.029 --> 00:32:41.970
it screwed our Yara up and gave us a

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:45.240
range upgrade look who we got our range

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:46.679
on now more like a range upgrade because

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:51.110
I just traded a year of room for

00:32:46.679 --> 00:32:51.110
something completely worthless to me

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:55.020
but dude the gods of Isaac have been

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:57.809
very kind

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:59.760
today I've done two runs and the first

00:32:57.809 --> 00:33:03.620
run was brimstone mom's knife on like a

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:06.960
super stack Maggie run and then this one

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:08.970
kinda lost a plot a little bit around

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:12.390
like the depths but still went extremely

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:14.760
fast and also gave me a good chance to

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:16.980
make a second life as dark Judas which

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:18.690
you know you don't always get second

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:22.940
chances in life so I really respect and

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:22.940
appreciate that they hooked me up here

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:31.919
hey wise cannot do anything for us so

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:36.179
yeah you know what's your comment of the

00:33:31.919 --> 00:33:38.220
day for this episode is very easy what

00:33:36.179 --> 00:33:39.539
is and isn't okay on a pizza if you

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:40.890
answer this question honestly you're

00:33:39.539 --> 00:33:42.840
banned for my comment section forever

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:46.289
let people enjoy pizza it's like one of

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:49.740
the few beautiful things left on this

00:33:46.289 --> 00:33:54.029
planet its customizable its pizzas like

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:57.240
culinary jazz man however you like it

00:33:54.029 --> 00:33:59.789
that's the best way oh I'm with you

00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:02.340
whenever people go you know I I love

00:33:59.789 --> 00:34:03.840
steak I eat a lot of rib eyes you know

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:06.510
they're $15 each and then I cook them

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:07.770
until there is no light can escape from

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:09.510
them because they become a black hole

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:11.490
you know I'm not into that I think

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:13.619
you're wasting a good cut of meat but it

00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:16.500
is you're right but Pete signs of tax

00:34:13.619 --> 00:34:18.419
treat should feel like I put poop on my

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:19.870
pizza that's obviously illogical extreme

00:34:18.419 --> 00:34:21.230
but anyway Oh

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:23.149
