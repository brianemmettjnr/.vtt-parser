00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.810
hey everybody welcome back to northern

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.940
line redeems himself for the yesterday's

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.069
terrible daily it's a daily binding of

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.170
issac afterbirth plus today we're Judas

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.519
we go I don't even want to look at my

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.330
yesterday score but we go all the way

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.029
except you ignore mega Satan actually

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.960
yesterday we were 3088 that's actually

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.720
not as bad as the daily from the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.250
thirteenth of May where we just didn't

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.750
find a seam that apparently everybody

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.449
else on planet earth found anyway

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.450
obviously yesterday's not my finest

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.100
moment but it was one of the funniest

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.200
failures I've ever had this is a

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.120
forty-eight thousand point

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.469
Judas daily as the top score and all the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.719
scores are actually very tightly

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.370
clustered like within the top 10 and

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.170
only ranges from forty three thousand

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.579
and forty eight which I mean might seem

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.050
like a pretty large gulf but that's

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.140
pretty low relative to how it normally

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.910
is usually you know between number one

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.969
or at least the scores near the top and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.710
then like the the scores that are a tear

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.979
below that but still better than I have

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.250
ever done there's usually a slightly

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.530
wider gulf so seems like you know if you

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.340
make it you've got a pretty good chance

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.720
to be in that vicinity or maybe I'm

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.600
mister reading it but we'll find out

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.409
soon the big thing is we just have to

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.060
like be better and it does I'm not

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.280
putting too much pressure on myself you

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.320
know I know the good dailies will return

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.970
I've been sort of wildly inconsistent

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.549
lately and by sort of I mean like

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.840
extremely wildly inconsistent lately and

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:39.869
Isaac and I do feel the pressure to be a

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.360
lot better but we got time you know as

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.740
long as we're entertaining people we'll

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.829
have patience so I think we're going to

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.689
go check this out because a single

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.990
spirit heart is way more valuable as

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.530
Judas than a blood bank chance on the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.060
next floor and really the first floor is

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.070
pretty much as textbook as I can get for

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.780
Judas here don't take damage get a

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.790
spirit heart by basically whatever means

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.469
necessary and then you know fight a boss

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.659
that's not that tanky Bob's your uncle

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:11.129
we're leaving after a minute and 22

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.480
seconds and we got the blue cap which

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.340
makes me think it would be nice to have

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.739
an arcade on this

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.319
lor but also fairly relevant you know it

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.450
would be nice to have the access to the

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.739
chance to get blood bag but it doesn't

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.349
really matter too much not yet anyway

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.970
having the spirit heart is nice it's a

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.680
fail-safe and I think the more

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.319
fail-safes I can get the better you know

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.410
it says it's a young person's attitude

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:39.049
to not respect fail-safes you know oh I

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.310
mean actually now that I think about it

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.650
it's not really a young person's

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.120
attitude I think it's an attitude

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.250
emblematic of a certain generation and

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.840
that's probably older than my generation

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.269
you know I don't need to see if I'll

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.040
ever get into a car crash I Drive better

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.190
when I'm drunk you know stupid things

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.630
like that not of course not

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.459
blaspheming an entire generation here

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.260
I'm just saying you know my impression

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.780
of kids these days is entirely based

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.760
around the high school scenes from 21

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.180
Jump Street starring Channing Tatum and

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.410
Jonah Hill admittedly that movies like 5

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.910
years old now so if you were in like

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.959
sixth grade when it came out you're

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.640
probably about to graduate high school

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.930
and you're like what are you talking

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.660
about such an old movie but they seemed

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.880
environmentally conscious tolerant and

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.730
perhaps concerned with safety and you

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.109
know what Safety's hip Safety's hit

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.819
there ain't nothing wrong with safety

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.290
you want to work on the construction

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.510
site sorry buddy you've got to wear a

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.239
hard hat that's just the way it is who

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.940
don't stop I'm almost there okay

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.349
okay we can look for a second secret

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.299
room right here that seems like the most

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:46.329
likely scenario for it to be

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.560
we haven't wasted it oh that's not true

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:54.109
what the heck happened to my voice there

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.459
on the copy bubble or something we we

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:57.200
did ways to keep you into the shop

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.329
hopefully getting that spirit art

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.290
doesn't prove to be a big mistake I

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.290
don't think it will

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.030
seems unlikely would make that much of a

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.880
difference we will take black powder

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.230
even having like low-speed black powder

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.480
could be useful in the future so we got

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.459
to check it here I think we do look for

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.540
a second secret room over a secret room

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:25.310
we found it we got 3 red hearts sadly no

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:27.320
item room some modest bummer because we

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.270
this is a situation in which we could

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.530
have found an item room the only reason

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.780
we didn't is because we bought a spirit

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.820
art and then we ended up not needing the

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.620
spirit heart does that mean it was a bad

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.630
decision it's hard to say you know

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.890
Ashton Kutcher's butterfly effect I hate

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:46.330
that argument first off because I don't

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:49.190
respect the butterfly effect is a movie

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.840
HG Welles fan fiction look if you like

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.450
that's a movie that a lot of people like

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:57.200
and I'm ok with that you know I've come

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.580
to terms of the fact that I'm glad not

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.650
everybody has the opinions I have

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.100
because on some issues I'm insufferable

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.600
however in the directions cut of the

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.950
butterfly effect I'm gonna spoil it came

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.900
out like 10 years ago the director's cut

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.940
of the butterfly effect the whole movie

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.410
is about like a you know go back in time

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.320
try to fix things every time you fix

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.850
things you know some unforeseen

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.410
consequence happens that makes things

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.030
actually worse and you're like maybe we

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.560
should just accept the situation as it

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.150
is right maybe we should be content with

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.100
the way things have played out because

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.470
it's made us who we are and also because

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.990
you know everybody's relatively happy

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:33.320
and healthy anyway the point is the end

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.910
of that movie Ashton Kutcher goes oh man

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.070
that was really bad

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.660
I wish I had also a really bad Ashley

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.070
Kutcher impression but it is internal

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.240
monologue it was all I've really messed

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.150
things up you know what I'm going to do

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.070
he goes back in time to when he's in his

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.570
mother's womb and then he strangles

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.770
himself with his own umbilical cord

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:54.080
that's stupid

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:56.900
it's so stupid I hated I watched that

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:02.510
movie at a time it came out when I was

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:03.740
16 believe it or not I had friends they

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.440
watched that movie they were all that

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.300
endings pretty deep I'm they're laughing

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.590
along at the cafeteria too yeah it's

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.540
pretty deep man I never would have

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.540
thought of that maybe cuz it's stupid

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:19.710
overdramatic nonsense what do you just

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.090
I don't know why you just go back in

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.950
time to when you discovered that you got

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.270
time-travel powers and hit yourself over

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.500
the head with a brick or something so

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.710
you don't have time travel towers

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.390
anymore it's been a while since I've

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.980
seen the movie they might have done the

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.820
brick hitting strategy and rather you

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.810
know I don't get it

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:38.220
the point is I don't like the argument

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.640
that like well if you didn't buy the

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:43.620
spirit heart maybe you know the magnetic

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.240
spin on some atoms would be different

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.330
and the whole causality chain would be

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:52.260
messed up but I will accept that it's

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:55.380
not invalid as far as argumentation goes

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:59.010
but I think the more obvious effect of

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.900
having a spirit heart come on just let

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.300
us finish a black-powder circle of some

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:05.360
magnitude here the more obvious effect

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:09.420
of having the spirit heart is confidence

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:12.540
you know you you know that you're not

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:14.250
going to do we want to open anything you

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.780
know you're not going to die and as a

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.030
result weirdly enough I think that

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.040
sometimes makes you play better like if

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.150
you have too much security I think you

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.430
play worse you know you get a little

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:31.350
complacent I was just you know that's

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:33.900
miscellaneous damage that happens we get

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.040
here speedball actually really good for

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.900
what we've got going on I think we just

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:41.730
head down to the next floor to be honest

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:43.410
with you but yeah if you're close to

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:44.940
death I think that's when you you either

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.760
play the best you ever play or the worst

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:49.710
you ever play and honestly I don't want

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.030
to play the worst I've ever played so

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.650
let's just eliminate that from our

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.940
situations I don't think I need to play

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:56.520
the best I've ever played

00:07:53.940 --> 00:08:00.330
so consider today's daily a success you

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:03.660
know I'm not shooting for an A+ here if

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:05.400
I could get like a see a strong see that

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.750
actually passes the game please do not

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:11.610
respond to that by saying you'll give me

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:15.950
a strong C I understand your lingo I am

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:15.950
a millennial like you I'm you but older

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:25.480
get this Skype message out of my face

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:27.280
you big disgrace waving that push link

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:30.940
all over the place of course I'll look

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:33.820
at it and see what has been sent 1.45

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:39.039
speed is enough to use black powder

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:44.500
pretty aggressively so I'm gonna when I

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:46.180
get a chance but I also you know use

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.740
boxing me out pretty nicely here I mean

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:52.210
we're doing a bunch of free damage to

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:53.890
him I think I'm finally like five years

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.960
after encountering people for the first

00:08:53.890 --> 00:09:00.130
time I have a viable peep strategy and

00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:03.010
it's whenever he shoots just get as far

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:04.690
away as you can never mind just

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:06.250
disregard me I was going to talk about

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:08.200
how to dodge that exact shot right there

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:12.880
so all right let's see what this guy

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:17.440
message is it's a push link it's just a

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:20.140
link to a picture of Papa John and his

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:22.839
son Bo both putting their fists up in

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:26.710
the air because they're stoked about a

00:09:22.839 --> 00:09:28.540
Papa John sale so there you go important

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:32.260
piece of the discourse for you if you

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:33.940
ever wondered why my brain seems a

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.560
little you know fever addled when i do

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.210
these episodes keep in mind i immerse

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:43.870
myself every morning in that Skype

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:46.060
conversation tomo if you want to enter

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:47.770
the room you got a knock on the door you

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:49.480
can lead a tomo to water but you can't

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:51.280
make him drink you don't have to make

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.890
him drink he's the thirstiest cat of all

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.510
time he loves water it's like you might

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:59.560
drink more water a day than Kate does

00:09:55.510 --> 00:10:03.070
not more than I do I'm a thirsty boy oh

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:06.339
this is a good gravy right here bookworm

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:07.780
and we will take Satanic Bible to be

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:10.180
honest with you we are a little light on

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:12.640
damage but we're still pretty early in

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:16.540
the game it's easy to forget but

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:19.210
especially I'm actually very resentful

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:21.010
of the knock back that we got going on

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:25.089
as well because I guess maybe it's a

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:27.550
product of our shot speed but it's hard

00:10:25.089 --> 00:10:30.050
to catch enemies in a combo

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:32.240
okay so we got shop money we made money

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:33.769
by going here at least we do well

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.720
actually we're way ahead of schedule now

00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:37.160
that I actually look at it I thought we

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.730
were one floor earlier than we actually

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:41.000
are

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:42.980
I know I harp on this all the time and

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.070
it's actually my fault because you know

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:47.839
I should just get a new computer like

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:50.000
that's pretty much indisputable but I

00:10:47.839 --> 00:10:51.500
really only get any time you see the

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.680
framerate dip that's like a Skype

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:58.250
message these fuckers only talking Skype

00:10:54.680 --> 00:11:02.170
when I'm doing a frickin Isaac video

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:05.540
it's like the DOE dad's away post means

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:09.110
it's a maybe it started as a coincidence

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:12.440
and I'm genuinely considering it might

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:14.329
be like a conspiracy now that's how you

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.610
want to spend your workday don't let me

00:11:14.329 --> 00:11:19.730
stop you just cause of my framerate to

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:24.350
dip from 60 to like 42 but you know what

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:27.019
I shall perservere that sounds like

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:29.060
paranoid delusion this is where I point

00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:33.399
out that it's ironic paranoid delusion

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:33.399
not get me committed paranoid delusion

00:11:34.209 --> 00:11:40.970
what is this the coupon is the coupon so

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:44.690
every time you use the coupon it makes

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:46.399
one thing in the shop free one thing in

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:48.110
whatever room you're in free including

00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:51.380
deals with Devils and Victor told me

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:55.370
even though this is a new item I think

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:58.339
it's worse than Satanic Bible so we're

00:11:55.370 --> 00:12:01.190
going to ignore it for now but it's it's

00:11:58.339 --> 00:12:02.870
with great hesitancy because I do

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:04.399
believe you know getting free deals of

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:06.140
the devil on occasion sounds like a

00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:08.089
pretty sweet okay now this is just

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:10.690
getting ridiculous sounds like a pretty

00:12:08.089 --> 00:12:10.690
sweet deal

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.150
that is bad damage but you know what

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:22.080
we're doing fine just hold it together

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:24.810
dude you're doing completely okay grab

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:28.830
your deal with the devil here swing your

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:30.330
partner round and round this is the

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.890
tanky as Gertie I've ever seen in my

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:35.400
life thank God for the speed up graves

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:38.340
Oh No Deal

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:40.620
I like the tiers upgrade don't get me

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:46.430
wrong we need some more hurtin power as

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:51.890
they said in the 2006 film Rocky Balboa

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:51.890
you got calcium deposits on your joints

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:57.720
forget the rest of the was gonna call it

00:12:55.470 --> 00:13:01.920
a lyric but really that that that

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:03.960
movie's very musical so you know it it

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:12.090
opens with Sylvester Stallone being like

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:15.840
a recce but um ode again punch dead

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:18.960
whale in the new ado I get cold

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:23.660
that's what is this video let's check

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:26.190
into the skype corner some picture

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:29.370
Austin's an Australian dude holding a

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:31.250
gun caption says weird Australian Josh

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:36.980
alright

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:36.980
bevy of greatest tips

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:45.790
keep it going here occasional spider my

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:48.460
favorite kind of spider I not happy by

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:50.560
the damage I took be honest with you how

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.270
much damage that I've taken in this

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:54.430
video has come from enemies that shoot

00:13:52.270 --> 00:14:00.610
shots radially I don't know if that's a

00:13:54.430 --> 00:14:03.250
fair thing to complain about like it's

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:06.400
it I only am getting hit by enemies that

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:07.750
do a stupid circular attack we have

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:12.460
Chris Lee unknown we should be

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:16.120
completely okay stop taking damage

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:19.840
anyway as long as we just hold this run

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:22.360
together we got confidence you know this

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:25.390
one is the first daily in like five days

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:28.690
that doesn't end until the final floor

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:30.040
which is extremely good news because it

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:32.470
means that I can't accidentally walk

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:34.630
into a trophy which would be incredibly

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:36.280
you know I would destroy my self-esteem

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:42.010
for a you know a matter of minutes

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:44.950
without a doubt a little bit unhappy

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:46.990
with the deals with devil thus far black

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:48.340
powder is a decent deal with the devil

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:51.240
it was one point four or five speed we

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:53.860
can certainly make it work however

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:55.210
whipped on our thirty whatever percent

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:57.160
chance with on our sixty whatever

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:59.080
percent chance and now we're sitting

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.600
here with a hundred percent chance to HP

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.800
to the best of my memory of course what

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.630
I would describe is essentially

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.910
unlimited black cards thanks to Satanic

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:09.220
Bible unless we really start to mess it

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:10.960
up like as of right now we've taken some

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:13.390
pretty dumb damage but it hasn't been

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:20.920
dumb enough to compromise the whole run

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:23.350
it's just just not good damage we got

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:26.200
great rate of fire four point seven two

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:28.570
is our damage stat which is subpar but

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.950
you know considering our rate of fire in

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:32.680
book form we're still doing pretty well

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:34.270
and against certain kinds of bosses we

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:37.980
got the right you know we got the

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:37.980
knowledge to get us into college here

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:42.880
black powder can you know basically crap

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:45.170
on some enemies is what I'm saying and

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:53.149
no uncertain terms

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:54.709
there was a tinted rock back there we

00:15:53.149 --> 00:15:56.300
got to be out of here by 16 minutes we

00:15:54.709 --> 00:15:58.670
got plenty of time I think you go back

00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:03.250
you know there's you've done you've done

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:05.990
well on this floor relatively after that

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:07.399
capitulation earlier we go back we go to

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:14.959
the curse room because we can afford to

00:16:07.399 --> 00:16:16.160
we look for guppy stuff didn't get guppy

00:16:14.959 --> 00:16:18.529
stuff but we did get an exploration

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:21.860
bonus we might as well go to the right

00:16:18.529 --> 00:16:23.630
well we're here this could be the right

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:25.040
way to go to begin with but you know we

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:26.810
want to get the exploration bonus if you

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:33.199
got time you want to get the exploration

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:36.380
bonus yeah it's another demon arm once

00:16:33.199 --> 00:16:38.660
we finish this one for whatever reason

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:41.570
like over the past week or so these have

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:45.230
been the hardest enemies to dodge any

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:46.880
enemy has like a very small animation

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:48.290
the Telegraph's they're about to shoot

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.449
and then they shoot in a somewhat

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:52.459
unpredictable fashion apparently like

00:16:50.449 --> 00:16:55.370
whatever portion of my brain and I use

00:16:52.459 --> 00:16:57.380
to you know code the dodge module for

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:59.680
those guys that know people say module

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:04.100
it sounded weird

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:05.720
say module or module Tomo you don't get

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:08.390
to answer buddy you don't have like the

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:10.669
same kind of pharynx that we do you

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:11.750
can't make the sounds but you know what

00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:14.419
if you want to come into the room

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:16.010
welcome Tomo welcome where do you go

00:17:14.419 --> 00:17:17.780
you're going penthouse you go on

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:20.540
basement what do you feeling today

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:23.419
sleep till noon or high-powered job as

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:26.929
an advertising executive Oh advertising

00:17:23.419 --> 00:17:28.400
executive good choice buddy let me get

00:17:26.929 --> 00:17:29.330
this teacup out of your way all right

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.740
let's go

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:33.350
it's like though daily with the most

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:36.110
positives in it because I'm turning on

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:38.150
sheet engines to give me a Stephen when

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:39.590
I finish this room one of these days I'm

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:42.020
going to be right with that prophecy and

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:44.440
it's going to backfire but for now it's

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.440
just funny

00:17:44.679 --> 00:17:51.040
we should peep it like it could be a

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:51.040
special shop

00:17:53.220 --> 00:18:01.269
it is highly not a special shop Elmo I

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:04.330
see that you have your ears back that's

00:18:01.269 --> 00:18:06.850
like that's when it can't goes crazy you

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:09.610
know what buddy you may exit the room if

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:11.499
I miss this daily by 4 seconds I'm going

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:13.509
to find you and I'm going to grab you

00:18:11.499 --> 00:18:14.980
with both hands I know turn you over and

00:18:13.509 --> 00:18:16.690
I'm going to pet you vigorously on your

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:20.169
belly because you're you're cute and

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:22.269
good boy all right and I will take

00:18:20.169 --> 00:18:24.999
personal responsibility for not locking

00:18:22.269 --> 00:18:27.970
my office during the recording session

00:18:24.999 --> 00:18:30.399
let's go we're still going to be on

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:32.559
schedule weirdly enough well close to on

00:18:30.399 --> 00:18:34.450
schedule weirdly enough sometimes in

00:18:32.559 --> 00:18:36.940
daily is when you fight dish you don't

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:39.249
actually get little dish which is kind

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:41.049
of what I'm hoping for now that plus a

00:18:39.249 --> 00:18:44.679
deal with the devil has not Krampus

00:18:41.049 --> 00:18:47.379
please because as much as lump of coal

00:18:44.679 --> 00:18:49.480
could be solid for us I really really

00:18:47.379 --> 00:18:51.940
really want more damage so that we can

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:55.450
get through boss Russian you know less

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:57.460
than 10 minutes what just god I'd get

00:18:55.450 --> 00:19:01.090
the fundamentals going again dude I'm

00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:03.879
kicking like laces in Jason Elam would

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:06.460
never kick laces in so we did get a

00:19:03.879 --> 00:19:06.759
little dish and then we got ceremonial

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:09.129
robes

00:19:06.759 --> 00:19:11.109
it's a damage upgrade actually 2.28 is a

00:19:09.129 --> 00:19:12.609
pretty sizable damage upgrade as far as

00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:18.669
I'm concerned we should be on full HP

00:19:12.609 --> 00:19:20.499
and we are we don't have any bombs

00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:23.470
otherwise I would blow up the mirror I

00:19:20.499 --> 00:19:26.580
do think we want that you know to speed

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:31.359
with blood bag you really can't complain

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:33.999
so of course we're able to get a bomb

00:19:31.359 --> 00:19:35.230
might like to use it on the mirror or we

00:19:33.999 --> 00:19:36.820
might like to use it to get golden bombs

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:39.249
then use the golden bombs on the mirror

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:41.850
that seems like a better option right

00:19:39.249 --> 00:19:44.700
now this is good we do have to be

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:46.960
concerned about the pace of this run

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:48.100
like the Backstreet Boys were concerned

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.720
about the shape of their heart in that

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:54.090
song when they tried to come back in

00:19:49.720 --> 00:20:00.040
like 2004 Thank You P please

00:19:54.090 --> 00:20:02.980
should we have fairly debatable just

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.390
trying to complete black-powder circle

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:05.590
he's done it he's done it you got hit in

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:12.610
the process but I could have been hit by

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:16.000
that one anyway so I think two speed

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:17.410
plus black powder is enough if we're

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.790
fighting you know I don't know what

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:20.380
percentage of enemies can fly versus

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:22.930
those that camp but we should have a

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:24.550
decent chance to get through boss rush

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:29.110
relatively quickly keep in mind we do

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:30.430
want to fight hush so it's like it's a

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:32.830
bit of a crapshoot

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:34.600
I haven't fought hush in a while

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:37.270
actually mostly because I keep dying on

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:39.010
non daily runs before the freaking womb

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:45.610
which is embarrassing enough I assure

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:47.020
you but this would be a really good

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:50.920
floor to beat the odds and get a deal

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:54.550
with the devil and have it not be

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:56.890
Krampus there's a lot of ifs in there

00:20:54.550 --> 00:21:00.550
okay I mean this is sweet because like

00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:02.410
black candles awesome stopwatch might be

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:05.260
better I'm going to start with black

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:09.520
candle and then hope that we can get

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:14.530
curses later okay we did find our boss

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:16.600
fight which is exciting we have not

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:18.610
found our item room how quickly can we

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.640
beat mom not as quickly as you might

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.640
think

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:33.389
because we don't have an orbital and

00:21:27.679 --> 00:21:35.070
black powder is great but might find it

00:21:33.389 --> 00:21:37.649
a little tough to make it happen

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:39.360
consistently on the foot I guess we

00:21:37.649 --> 00:21:41.639
could black powder like one of the walls

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:43.559
and then try to you know get mom's hand

00:21:41.639 --> 00:21:45.690
to come out or something we also have no

00:21:43.559 --> 00:21:51.960
problem sacrificing like black hearts to

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:54.059
make it happen but I mean them kind of

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:59.610
not really stoked about doing this I'm

00:21:54.059 --> 00:22:00.990
going to do it anyway don't do me dirty

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:04.260
you know you want to give me this item

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:06.299
room I think it helps to realize that

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:08.039
we're not actually at 1906 right now

00:22:06.299 --> 00:22:09.809
we're actually at like you know nineteen

00:22:08.039 --> 00:22:13.110
thirty because we've got to get into the

00:22:09.809 --> 00:22:16.440
bathroom fine hurt me more I don't care

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:20.580
a body don't want it let's go don't need

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:22.049
it don't need it I want to be on half of

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:24.360
a black heart so that if I get hit the

00:22:22.049 --> 00:22:28.380
black heart does damage I still have the

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:30.330
ability to use our Satanic Bible for a

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:33.889
few I mean we're like a thousand points

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:33.889
below where I'd like to be

00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:55.580
I think you can see my methodology here

00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:57.830
I hate you why are you so mean I swear

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:59.450
to God like the mom fight exclusively

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:02.749
exists to annoy the shit out of people

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:07.999
doing dailies at this point like I spent

00:23:02.749 --> 00:23:10.249
so long trying to get this stupid thing

00:23:07.999 --> 00:23:12.469
set up so that she would step in the

00:23:10.249 --> 00:23:14.299
black powder and then she just goes um

00:23:12.469 --> 00:23:17.210
no you know what I'm feeling like I'm

00:23:14.299 --> 00:23:23.119
not gonna spawn a foot today any other

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:24.950
run 900 feet and when I spawn in early

00:23:23.119 --> 00:23:27.649
as you know I'm gonna be I'm gonna be

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:31.159
the mom who spawns 900 feet heaps and

00:23:27.649 --> 00:23:33.619
when I screw you on your daily you will

00:23:31.159 --> 00:23:34.969
know that it will be the mom who spawns

00:23:33.619 --> 00:23:40.519
no people you

00:23:34.969 --> 00:23:42.139
I hate spikes I'm not talking about the

00:23:40.519 --> 00:23:43.429
magic the gathering player archetype I'm

00:23:42.139 --> 00:23:45.349
talking about these spikes here that

00:23:43.429 --> 00:23:48.769
make it very difficult for me to justify

00:23:45.349 --> 00:23:51.950
the use of black powder there's going to

00:23:48.769 --> 00:23:55.129
be a slow ish boss rush this guy's going

00:23:51.950 --> 00:24:00.669
down you know early round so if we can

00:23:55.129 --> 00:24:00.669
get him good stuff

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:07.530
got to get the third Ling's go into the

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:12.540
black powder circle whenever possible

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:14.490
keep in mind yes yes Lincoln Park here

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:16.500
but also keep in mind we got to do the

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:25.950
hush fight on today's run as well

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:31.670
I dare not chance it with this guy he's

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:34.050
not afraid any longer I was bad

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:42.630
admittedly you know what we need next is

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:44.250
the ability to fly first off it puts us

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:46.860
on par with the bosses in the game of

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:49.490
which apparently a nine million percent

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.490
of them can fly

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:05.250
and then beyond that it allows us to

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:08.580
ignore the spikes but I mean fairly

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:10.440
unlikely to happen on boss rush I mean

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:11.910
get a golden chest as a reward the

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:16.310
golden chest could give us the ability

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:20.640
to fly in the form of fate I suppose but

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:25.790
describe that as extremely unlikely why

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:25.790
do I even bother using black powder man

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:31.200
you might be saying I don't know at this

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:34.320
point you might be saying you don't know

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:40.500
I think that would be a fair assessment

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:43.380
of things to be honest with you and then

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:45.870
of course this guy decides spawn in he

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:47.780
doesn't know how to fly widow just fell

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:50.400
on the spikes that's a dream come true

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:55.020
there we go finally we made that one

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:56.730
work at least you know like I'm taking

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:58.620
some pretty horrible damage that's

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:59.930
apparent to everybody in the room right

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:05.490
now

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:11.010
skip on creeper but you know we we are

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:13.670
getting black heart damage done has some

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:13.670
importance

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:20.360
you can finish boss rush relatively

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:20.360
quickly and move along here

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:32.580
take your time hurry up the choice is

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:34.890
yours don't be late I maybe shouldn't

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:37.350
have used that not the lyric the lyric

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:44.960
is fine you know who doesn't you know

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:47.640
respect nirvana in this day and age Hey

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:49.080
I don't know what sound that was that

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:52.080
came out of my body was a little

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:53.820
horrifying gotta be honest like

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.250
gastro-intestinal II I'm not feeling

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:58.260
that great today I can't necessarily

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.860
blame it on what I ate for dinner last

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:02.450
night

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:05.760
but I did have a vegetarian poutine and

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:08.760
a beer that tasted like malt vinegar so

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:13.049
it would not necessarily be the biggest

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:14.600
surprise to me if I if I'd eaten

00:27:13.049 --> 00:27:16.950
something that disagrees with my system

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.940
people get they are weirdly offended

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:20.309
when they find out you've eaten a

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:22.500
vegetarian meal by choice we went to a

00:27:20.309 --> 00:27:24.870
vegetarian restaurant slash bar because

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:27.030
we live in you know probably the hipster

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:28.890
capital of Canada and I'm cool with that

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:31.740
dude give me a masala dosa any day of

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:34.830
the frickin week you know give me a doll

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:36.750
I'm into it lentil soups as the day is

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:40.559
long but I decided to get the poutine

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:42.720
and I don't know man something in my my

00:27:40.559 --> 00:27:45.720
stomach is not loving the decision but

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:47.400
it could have also been the beer you

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:50.400
know there's this a beer trend right now

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:56.220
these sour beers actually quite like

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:59.130
them you know I like a vinegar taste but

00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:00.659
perhaps something in that and the

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:06.270
ingredient list doesn't agree with my

00:28:00.659 --> 00:28:09.559
system anyway now that we're talking

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:11.820
about my gastrointestinal woes I've

00:28:09.559 --> 00:28:14.640
officially ascended to the level of

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:18.630
being a 900 year old person and beyond

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:20.429
that we need to freaking go faster

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:25.140
because this hush fight is going to

00:28:20.429 --> 00:28:27.720
screw us man well if the scores are in

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:30.530
the 40,000 it probably does have a hush

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:35.110
fight on it so

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:37.730
where are you oh my okay so that is I

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:39.320
wish that I could complain about that

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:43.600
one I guess is what I mean to say there

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:49.960
I just walked directly on to the spikes

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:51.710
please I am begging you for mercy finish

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:55.760
boss rush

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:58.490
I love boss rush it's one of my favorite

00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:04.040
mechanics in the Isaac series of

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:06.190
roguelike video games being forth being

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:10.550
functionally forced in the boss rush

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:12.050
with slightly subpar damage it's like my

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:14.890
second least favorite thing on planet

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:18.140
Earth after I don't know

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:18.880
vegetarian poutine that's right I said

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:22.730
it

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:27.160
vegetarian poutine worse than pollution

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:29.540
no that's obviously there's worse things

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:31.850
like a vegan poutine and I'm not even

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:34.060
like if you would if you're vegan that's

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:36.410
fine dude I got nothing against that

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:38.960
whatsoever like I said mouth and I we

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:42.350
were vegetarian for a while but you got

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:45.530
to admit it can't possibly be as good as

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:49.030
the regular variety otherwise the

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:54.970
regular variety would already be vegan

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:59.540
okay spoon bender you know what I'm out

00:29:54.970 --> 00:30:01.400
spoon bender spoon bender will you'll be

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:02.660
mine by the way I didn't go to the deal

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:04.070
with the devil there which could cost us

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:05.900
but I didn't go with to the deal with

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:08.510
the devil because you know we didn't

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:10.010
have time we could have missed our

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:12.230
chance to do boss rush because of that

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:15.740
so Greene's gullet

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:17.720
but we have to fly to get it so no such

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:19.730
luck we basically have to go extremely

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:23.870
quickly and I'm hoping we're able to get

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:26.060
a boss rush here boss what am I talking

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:29.690
about movin we're able to get the hush

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:31.580
fight here but I'm also hoping we're

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:33.230
able to again we need this we're hoping

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.600
we're able to beat the odds and get a

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:39.290
freaking deal with the devil because

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:41.810
like life is pain right now seven

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:43.340
damages find it you might wonder why

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:44.029
like if I started around with seven

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:46.460
damage

00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:48.889
I'd be soaked but now you know I'm on

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:50.119
the eighth floor and I got seven damaged

00:30:48.889 --> 00:30:52.460
and I'm complaining about it was because

00:30:50.119 --> 00:30:56.599
we're on the eighth floor enemies have

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:58.249
15 times the HP they used to have we're

00:30:56.599 --> 00:31:01.460
not killing them fast enough to make the

00:30:58.249 --> 00:31:03.399
to make the dream work you know say

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:13.419
teamwork makes the dream work

00:31:03.399 --> 00:31:13.419
well this room is take us 45 minutes

00:31:14.859 --> 00:31:20.599
let's do it

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:25.669
let's go it was the boss fight though

00:31:20.599 --> 00:31:27.649
all is forgiven you spawned a troll bomb

00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:36.229
and killed yourself that's the the only

00:31:27.649 --> 00:31:40.969
chance we have smart black-powder plays

00:31:36.229 --> 00:31:43.279
deal with the devil he's done it he has

00:31:40.969 --> 00:31:46.729
not really done it but we will take sack

00:31:43.279 --> 00:31:49.820
dagger okay we got to go like extremely

00:31:46.729 --> 00:31:55.969
fast here I'm actually worried that we

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:57.529
may die on the hush fight I know we have

00:31:55.969 --> 00:32:00.109
a ton of HP right now so that seems

00:31:57.529 --> 00:32:02.210
patently ridiculous but I'm being

00:32:00.109 --> 00:32:05.839
straight up with you I'm a little

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:09.529
concerned I would take shoopdawhoop I

00:32:05.839 --> 00:32:11.779
know I'm a menace to society because

00:32:09.529 --> 00:32:14.299
girls in biker shorts look so fly to me

00:32:11.779 --> 00:32:15.710
that's nwa can't remember the name of

00:32:14.299 --> 00:32:16.399
that song that I'm pretty sure it's

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:19.269
offensive

00:32:16.399 --> 00:32:23.029
I mean they've only got a couple about

00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:25.190
you know their relationships with women

00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:27.379
and the titles trying to think you know

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:29.749
there's like a bitch is a bitch I'm not

00:32:27.379 --> 00:32:33.710
saying that that represents how I

00:32:29.749 --> 00:32:37.190
believe but at the same time you do have

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:38.719
to recognize it sounds like I'm about to

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:40.190
say you do have to recognize they got

00:32:38.719 --> 00:32:43.309
some good points but no you got to

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:45.499
recognize you know the artistic value of

00:32:43.309 --> 00:32:47.989
Straight Outta Compton is a landmark in

00:32:45.499 --> 00:32:50.989
the gangster rap genre without

00:32:47.989 --> 00:32:54.519
necessarily you know believing a hundred

00:32:50.989 --> 00:32:57.379
percent of what they say I mean again in

00:32:54.519 --> 00:32:58.010
the opening verse of Straight Outta

00:32:57.379 --> 00:33:00.710
Compton

00:32:58.010 --> 00:33:02.960
titular track on the album Ice Cube does

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:05.660
threaten the cook and eat Los Angeles

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:07.310
police officers so you know I think it's

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:09.320
fair to say that you probably don't

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:12.200
assume that I want to eat police

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:13.910
officers unless you know we tune in this

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:20.930
channel for the wrong reasons let's just

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:22.240
leave it at that because I don't eat

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:27.320
pork

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:30.710
no that's surprisingly vegetarian

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:32.720
episode of Isaac today we're probably

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:39.350
not going to make the hush fight which

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:43.670
which hurts me deep in my loins if we

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:45.890
like stuff if we really haul it we might

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:50.960
be able to make it happen now we are not

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:53.960
going to make it happen the superest of

00:33:50.960 --> 00:34:00.530
super bombers okay the guys haggle eyes

00:33:53.960 --> 00:34:05.390
and black room I mean that obviously is

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:07.130
terrible damage but in my defense the

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:09.440
slowest boss rush in Earth's history

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:11.720
maybe it's good you know we don't have

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:13.669
the same amount of pressure if we're

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:15.470
just going to do like a regular old

00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:17.030
daily that doesn't go to hush we're

00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:18.950
going to miss out on some points that's

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:20.649
going to keep us out of the top 100 but

00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:24.169
you know maybe we'll be loved in life

00:34:20.649 --> 00:34:26.899
it's like a weird daily it's very solid

00:34:24.169 --> 00:34:28.970
but certainly not exceptional we

00:34:26.899 --> 00:34:29.960
definitely like whiffed on several of

00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:31.370
the deals of the devil

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.659
my damage penalty is going to be through

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:34.790
the roof but I think we've had a fun

00:34:32.659 --> 00:34:37.429
time together here considering my

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:40.190
gastrointestinal distress I think I've

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:43.760
played okay worse than I would like but

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:44.960
okay at least a man like the deals of

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.280
the devil have been super whips let's

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:49.100
see what we're playing on the alan cess

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:53.260
today dead cells quake champions quick

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:56.510
lash that sounds perfect to me

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:58.940
wonderful great show today all right

00:34:56.510 --> 00:35:00.680
come watch it get a time machine go back

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:02.450
do not strangle yourself in the woman's

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:05.140
drone bellick accord you bring value to

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:05.140
this existence

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:15.869
crank on that okay we finally well I

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:18.390
shouldn't say we finally got a damage

00:35:15.869 --> 00:35:19.980
upgrade the thing is we have gotten good

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:26.579
damage upgrades over the course of this

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:31.890
run just far too few of them like sin

00:35:26.579 --> 00:35:33.420
robes was a two point something damage

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:34.470
up that's high I mean part of that is

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:36.559
because we have the Judas damage

00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:42.930
multiplier but it's like a really nice

00:35:36.559 --> 00:35:46.859
damage modifier or damage up I should

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:48.990
say and you know we just got curb porn

00:35:46.859 --> 00:35:52.020
that's like another 1.8 or something

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:57.839
that just came up for us and we have no

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:59.849
bombs so then on top of that we had book

00:35:57.839 --> 00:36:01.349
of Belial for a long time I'm kind of

00:35:59.849 --> 00:36:03.210
just going to mainline this one because

00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:04.500
I'm worried more about our damage

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:05.789
penalty than anything else at this point

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:11.609
I don't think exploration is going to

00:36:05.789 --> 00:36:13.319
save us too much so use sac dagger get

00:36:11.609 --> 00:36:15.210
through this phase now play a little bit

00:36:13.319 --> 00:36:22.589
more passively because you just crushed

00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:24.079
him right there um good work the problem

00:36:22.589 --> 00:36:26.250
is we just didn't really like

00:36:24.079 --> 00:36:27.779
consistently ball out of control here I

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:29.849
think I might have missed something on

00:36:27.779 --> 00:36:31.470
today's daily because I did I got tweets

00:36:29.849 --> 00:36:32.880
from people and like people in quiz chat

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:34.950
when I was hanging out in my own chat to

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:36.119
give them you know the lowdown on when

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:38.819
the show is going to be today they were

00:36:36.119 --> 00:36:41.309
like enjoy today's daily I'm not saying

00:36:38.819 --> 00:36:47.640
that okay this is obviously hot-ass

00:36:41.309 --> 00:36:50.099
garbage but you know what give me v4 and

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:52.109
suck everything else up look at that

00:36:50.099 --> 00:36:56.299
then reroll my whole run this was a

00:36:52.109 --> 00:36:56.299
reroll what in the world have you done

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:14.460
you had the treem but it wasn't enough

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:18.490
for you was it so I this is the worst

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:23.559
we have Tech X and we have dogs or fetus

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:26.770
and yet the run is bad like all we need

00:37:23.559 --> 00:37:28.630
to do oh my lord

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:30.849
and we have - touch - it all I need to

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:33.220
do is get in there and hit him but I

00:37:30.849 --> 00:37:36.819
can't hit him that was maybe a little

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:38.680
bit reckless admittedly I can't hit him

00:37:36.819 --> 00:37:40.660
because the stupid tiny planet shots man

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:42.039
but this is not a squandered daily it

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:45.010
was squandered when we couldn't make it

00:37:42.039 --> 00:37:46.359
to the hush my it's just a fun run which

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:49.950
maybe is the philosophy I should take

00:37:46.359 --> 00:37:57.760
more often regardless we're just trying

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:59.109
perhaps in vain to get a reroll here and

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:01.119
at this point you know I can't

00:37:59.109 --> 00:38:03.039
distinguish myself by coming for

00:38:01.119 --> 00:38:09.220
hundreds on a daily the best thing we

00:38:03.039 --> 00:38:10.930
can do is at least do something unique

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:13.210
at the end of the day Lee and I think we

00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:14.230
certainly fit that bill ah I don't know

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:16.630
if you want to do the big room

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:18.190
necessarily you might want to start by

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:19.900
doing some small rows until you get a

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:24.250
reroll here we also don't know what our

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:27.400
reroll is going to be I got to be honest

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:30.539
when the bookworm dr. fetus shots land

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:35.200
with tech X attached to them they crush

00:38:30.539 --> 00:38:38.740
they're actually amazing however there's

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:42.700
a little bit of risk inherent namely

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:44.200
that you know the bombs explode into us

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:46.150
and also they don't even go anywhere

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:48.670
close to where we aim the majority of

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:50.589
the time okay I'll tell you what let's

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:52.720
do one more let's do the big room get

00:38:50.589 --> 00:38:58.850
our reroll and get your beer oh I'm

00:38:52.720 --> 00:39:02.960
du-deta du-deta did it great song dude

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:05.870
oh you know Missy Elliott get your freak

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:08.630
on little known indie classic that went

00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:11.540
number one in about 45 countries no but

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:15.200
that's a misnomer first off there aren't

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:17.420
even 45 countries secondly just because

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:20.510
it's popular don't mean it's a bad song

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:22.550
baby we actually played really well in

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:26.630
that room I think you're reroll your

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:27.980
whole run this seems pretty dope now and

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:30.470
we also have the miters so now we should

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:33.290
live as far as I'm concerned if you ever

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:37.700
use the d4 or D 100 you should get a one

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:39.380
time balls bonus of like 3500 points so

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:43.090
I mean this is why I don't design this

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:47.950
game because I my ideas are too powerful

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:47.950
my ideas are too strong for you gamer

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:57.040
even the most powerful eSports athletes

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:57.040
can handle my design documents traveller

00:39:57.910 --> 00:40:02.270
who needs a spirit heart at this point

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:04.520
your life its 2017 if you still need a

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:06.080
spirit heart to win an Isaac run you

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:07.700
should just start a YouTube channel and

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:09.830
played two runs of Isaac a day plus

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:11.770
other miscellaneous indie games and you

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:14.930
know uploads of your twitch vods

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:17.770
somewhere between 24 and 96 hours after

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:17.770
they originally aired

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:28.160
let's go am I going to reroll my whole

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:30.770
run I mean the D infinity is pretty cool

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:32.180
is it the D 100 no it's a beep thing I

00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:33.980
think I'm going to reroll my whole run

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:36.020
but I kind of want to like see if the

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:38.450
boss is here first because this runs

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:40.819
pretty good and we could squander it

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:44.000
really easily let's do it

00:40:40.819 --> 00:40:49.490
got Beelzebub this epic foetus are

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:59.240
marked is epic foetus so I mean it's

00:40:49.490 --> 00:41:01.460
like absurdly strong we might actually

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:03.730
rank better than expected on today's

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:07.400
daily we're not going to be top you know

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:09.770
anything where is it marked it is marked

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:13.309
+ epic fetuses I'm like my crosshair is

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:15.140
not resetting in between shots it is

00:41:13.309 --> 00:41:16.160
actually nice to not have to move it if

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:19.960
we have an enemy that's largely

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:22.010
stationary like a blue baby for example

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:27.339
but I got to get out of the habit of

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:31.000
moving it - alright let's go I'm ready

00:41:27.339 --> 00:41:31.000
not sad bombs

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:43.170
okay walked into him didn't take damage

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:45.500
Thank You host cat Thank You host man

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:48.089
head and your black and white cat

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:49.740
where's my Commonwealth country that

00:41:48.089 --> 00:41:52.230
okay grab it we're going to be in like

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:53.609
the low 30s it's not a good score but

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:55.940
considering the reroll we got in the

00:41:53.609 --> 00:41:58.589
chest I'm going to live with it 360 dude

00:41:55.940 --> 00:42:00.540
you know why they call this the 360 rank

00:41:58.589 --> 00:42:04.349
because when you see it you turn 360

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:05.160
