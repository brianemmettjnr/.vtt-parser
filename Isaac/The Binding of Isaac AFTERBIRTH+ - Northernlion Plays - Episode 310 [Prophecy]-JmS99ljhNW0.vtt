##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.410
everybody welcome back in land please

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.339
the binding of issac a different plus

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.309
this is a big one

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.809
sorry root I didn't mean to yell so

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.130
loudly wake you up for me nice little

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.440
nap this is ten wins in a row

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.080
potentially great damage good rate of

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.210
fire speeds fine Lux over zero space bar

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.289
items pretty much trash but whatever V

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.990
989

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.269
a j4 feel free to disagree with me by

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.240
the way that the pure detonator is trash

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.340
but there have been like maybe three

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.969
situations and pulling a number be

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:37.320
honest kind of out of my butt here but

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:38.730
maybe a couple of times I've used blue

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.559
detonator and I've been like you know

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.500
what this is a good item I'm usually

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.629
happy to have it simply because it's a

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.219
little unusual but the big like the the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.680
crown jewel in this run right here is

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.840
definitely 4.3 for damage and a rate of

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.640
fires that's that are like almost as

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:02.489
good as as the stamps we finished our

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.049
last run with the last run was is never

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.600
great but it was never really that

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.220
dangerous I guess the the real dream

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.970
here like the teamwork that makes the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.680
dream work is if we can get why not

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.780
you know maybe we can use cracked ice to

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.030
break the game a little bit here but if

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.220
we can get a really really good rate of

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.020
fire and then tears that also do a lot

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.220
of damage well in that case you know we

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.970
got the keys to the kingdom and we don't

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.409
necessarily need to make blue detonator

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.549
work but it might turn blue detonator

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.920
into like a possibly almost as good

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.390
Tammy's head fire mine probably makes

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.680
that substantially less likely but I

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.509
feel an obligation to pick it up

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.920
regardless mostly because I'm a moron

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.990
who doesn't know it's good for him who

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.759
did you see you can see that tinted rock

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.930
it was obscured very slightly by the map

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.930
of repeating of course

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:59.050
help hit the fire he's done it and the

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.210
fire does not hurt me thankfully um yeah

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.970
so I mean obviously fire mind carries

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.310
some negatives along with it but also if

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.619
we use it properly and we're aware of

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.610
the potential consequences of it it

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.020
could be pretty decent for us there are

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.320
some situations in which you will

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.610
probably like irrevocably deal damage to

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.630
us and there's nothing we can do about

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.430
that

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.330
but I'm hopeful that we'll have the HP

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.160
to tolerate that for example that right

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.570
there we like not being able to shoot

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.850
enemies they get close to us puts us in

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.920
a really awkward position sometimes and

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.060
the path of damage out of it is okay all

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.810
we need is you know some kind of

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:41.740
explosion immunity I went through a

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.480
period of not taking fire mines probably

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.990
at this point we're talking like years

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.950
ago means now I haven't playing this

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.360
game for twenty years even though

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.760
sometimes it does feel like it but I

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.290
take it now because it's it's like life

00:02:51.760 --> 00:03:00.930
you know chill out what she yep yelling

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.980
for lay back it's all been done before

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.160
so we screwed our deal with the devil

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.040
chances I was like I fell victim to a

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.230
statistical fallacy and that statistical

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.959
fallacy was obviously it's not going to

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.560
explode on the first shot like are you

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.780
kidding me it's not a that's not the

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.660
proper attitude though we can't take

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.330
that because a a bad trip puts us in a

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.080
really really bad spot so just ignore it

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.700
for now

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.020
save your bomb because you might find a

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.820
spirit heart of me we need that for

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.220
survivability sake to be honest with you

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.320
no chances is a secret room but two

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.160
bombs here is quite nice and we're

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:42.400
fighting a boss who who loves clothes

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:47.560
should not be that tough just make sure

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:49.810
you take out the desert is first aka

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.350
take out the trash we have taken out the

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.870
trash now we just need him to explode

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.329
and then we stand in the fire and then

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.810
we get him to jump into the fire and the

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.810
world's our oyster

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.379
or you can just explode and be on fire

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:12.019
that also works out pretty well come on

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:15.950
36 percent let's go range upgrade luck

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:17.780
upgrade oh I mean this is like use a

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.940
bombs to keep them at bay here a little

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.600
bit but this is obvious right you take

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.720
this and then you take this you respawn

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.580
as dark Judas with piercing shots would

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.169
that do a lot of damage you take your

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.330
pale it's friends to the end and then

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.310
you just you know pray to the Lord above

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:38.510
that you never ever take damage again

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.729
because as good as the damage is find

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.460
ourselves in a slightly risky situation

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:46.160
here but this is basically like what we

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.590
asked for as far as making to your

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:54.139
detonator work better we need the spirit

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:55.880
hearts like above all else it's tough

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.370
because mom's bottle of pills could give

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.120
us some half these and stuff but I think

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.500
we need to try to roll with your

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.910
detonator mostly because it's fun and

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.169
the damage output seems like it could

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.580
get pretty insane you've got to be very

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.070
very cautious come on just give me a

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.810
bomb just give me a bomb

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.090
give me a bomb give me a bomb gives me

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:20.599
give me a bomb we have 1.92 lots of give

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:23.840
me something give me something chosen

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:26.900
not to give me anything that I can't get

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.090
no bums think about do you blue kings

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.970
okay we need bombs

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.740
give me a bomb shouldn't use the bombs

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.870
as willy-nilly as I use the bombs I

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.760
don't want to be here anymore but dude

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.349
look at the damage output this guy's

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.700
going to give us bombs I forgot to focus

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:45.979
on the positive there he didn't give us

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:49.430
bombs to give us mr. boom but honestly

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.930
that's just as good maybe even a little

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.330
bit better here so you blow that up to

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.250
spirit are it's a key a death card a

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.530
gyro rune which you probably want to

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.910
hold and then two more spirit hearts in

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.620
here it's getting a little silly but I

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:04.580
like it open the chest more bombs Oh

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.530
what do you get for the man who has

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.800
everything we're going to stick with

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:13.010
Tier detonator because I believe that it

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.969
has the power to to move us like the

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:20.749
history of one

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:22.459
boy and young nasty man no consumable

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:24.319
drop oh okay

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:25.399
one of these we have three keys we

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:27.499
should check both but one of these is a

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:27.889
library if it's a library with a good

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:31.519
book

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:33.079
we win and we I mean we just won as far

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:37.099
as I'm concerned we also got bookworm I

00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:40.189
am going to be a silly boy and a very

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:42.469
good bad boy show me the second secret

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:43.819
room did not show me the second secret

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:45.919
room and I'm going to keep tear

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:48.409
detonator the reason I'm going to keep

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:50.779
tear detonator is because I believe in

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:52.909
its ability to work well with our

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:55.129
existing run I don't think it's

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:58.610
guaranteed to do so but I think it's got

00:06:55.129 --> 00:07:00.709
a chance and how many times have we done

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.869
a run with your detonator right like not

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:09.169
that many as compared to Satanic Bible

00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:10.789
of all things I don't know what we're

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:15.049
going to do here we'll see I guess is

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:21.769
the the complicated answer I think what

00:07:15.049 --> 00:07:23.360
we should try to do is so you might not

00:07:21.769 --> 00:07:27.649
be a huge fan of this but hear me out

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:30.019
start by blowing this guy up nothing huh

00:07:27.649 --> 00:07:36.259
then blow that guy up use all of your

00:07:30.019 --> 00:07:39.649
bombs yera the money and also I guess

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:42.409
all the consumables why is this

00:07:39.649 --> 00:07:46.339
important well mostly because I'm going

00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:47.779
to try to get an HP upgrade out of this

00:07:46.339 --> 00:07:49.610
guy and let me get one item for free

00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:51.409
which at this point I'd probably take

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:53.239
black candle it's a great item of the

00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:54.379
couple of these are worthwhile but of

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:56.119
course now you want to play this guy a

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:57.559
little bit as well and I'm going to give

00:07:56.119 --> 00:08:01.610
him some spirit heart action Oh curse

00:07:57.559 --> 00:08:03.139
eyes just rear old everything let's keep

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:07.999
it up see what's going on here man

00:08:03.139 --> 00:08:09.799
I don't know it's a little weird tell

00:08:07.999 --> 00:08:13.599
you what take PhD take a lark on this

00:08:09.799 --> 00:08:15.529
PhD gave us a luck upgrade and gulp

00:08:13.599 --> 00:08:18.459
smelt the trinket things are going to

00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:18.459
get very strange here

00:08:21.979 --> 00:08:27.270
got succubus out of it as well I'd say

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:32.820
it's worth it and you know what we're

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:33.870
dark Judas dude let's go to town you

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.669
remember that's the dark Judas

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:38.490
catchphrase we're dark judas let's go to

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:40.050
town but now we got succubus there's

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:41.579
options is good because it allows us to

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:42.899
pick up what we want more frequently

00:08:41.579 --> 00:08:46.980
from boss rooms which in this case is

00:08:42.899 --> 00:08:49.920
definitely going to be HP and then on

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:51.720
top of all this succubus a great damage

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.089
bonus we're doing 20 damage when we're

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.540
standing inside of the succubus

00:08:53.089 --> 00:08:56.250
area-of-effect

00:08:54.540 --> 00:09:01.110
and then we got this guy in here okay

00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:02.370
well give me some HP please I would very

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.260
much like something I know I traded a

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:07.620
little bit away that was that was hasty

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:11.190
of me please show me the error of my

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:13.950
ways by making it conceivable for me to

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:15.660
do something positive here he's done it

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:22.940
he's got it one makes you larger that's

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:25.440
not a good pill you've lied to me BOM

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:30.449
regular penny nothing all right well

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:32.670
we're out of here we got no money what

00:09:30.449 --> 00:09:38.160
I'm going to do is blow this up slow

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:39.930
this up good dividends there and then

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.310
there's no spirit hard for sale in here

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.260
are you kidding me so we're gonna blow

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:45.089
these up and we're going for enough

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:48.899
money to buy black candle which is not

00:09:45.089 --> 00:09:51.540
going to happen now but now we buy the

00:09:48.899 --> 00:09:53.790
card we get Shariat it's not quite HP

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:55.529
but it's sorta is we could have used

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:57.180
this to play a blood bank and maybe get

00:09:55.529 --> 00:09:59.640
something out of it but so be it

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.860
honestly we've done some interesting

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.750
things on this floor we're leaving in 9

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:05.970
minutes but with such better damage than

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:07.410
we had recently and the run again with

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:09.570
Satanic Bible it could have popped off

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:12.510
so quickly instead we chose to get a

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:15.570
little funky with it and I'm happy to do

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:18.540
so unless we die in which case I'll feel

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:22.130
like a real idiot but you've got a

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:25.559
little tolerance before that happens and

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:29.249
I do mean like a little

00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:30.629
we're not we're not outrageously safe

00:10:29.249 --> 00:10:34.019
here the only thing that makes you feel

00:10:30.629 --> 00:10:36.209
good is that to the best of my knowledge

00:10:34.019 --> 00:10:39.059
fire mine can't just explode when it

00:10:36.209 --> 00:10:44.009
hits a wall and see any tinted rocks

00:10:39.059 --> 00:10:45.989
there so I'm pretty sure that using the

00:10:44.009 --> 00:10:47.819
tear detonator shouldn't be able to just

00:10:45.989 --> 00:10:53.790
blow me up unless there's an enemy close

00:10:47.819 --> 00:10:55.139
by which is still annoying but we're

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.809
able to clear the rooms pretty quickly

00:10:55.139 --> 00:11:00.449
here to very be careful what you wish

00:10:57.809 --> 00:11:02.730
for sort of situation because the

00:11:00.449 --> 00:11:07.589
succubus is so good we definitely want

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:09.119
the gift and I'm just going to use it

00:11:07.589 --> 00:11:11.730
here because I want something fast and

00:11:09.119 --> 00:11:14.100
that could pay dividends but it's not

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:17.069
what we needed immediately so always a

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:23.389
little scary there we'll go back to the

00:11:17.069 --> 00:11:26.040
penny succubus is doing such good work

00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:27.869
the real problem in the danger with this

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.699
run is that we can't shoot at enemies

00:11:27.869 --> 00:11:33.029
that are close to us without risking a

00:11:29.699 --> 00:11:36.059
lot I think this could be a second

00:11:33.029 --> 00:11:38.549
secret room let's go and the spirit

00:11:36.059 --> 00:11:39.929
heart that was actually like incredible

00:11:38.549 --> 00:11:42.439
so let's squander it by fighting this

00:11:39.929 --> 00:11:42.439
angel statue

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:48.959
[Music]

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:58.649
all right we can shoot through the fire

00:11:48.959 --> 00:12:01.939
because we have the lyall tears yeah

00:11:58.649 --> 00:12:01.939
this is actually pretty good now

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:08.470
we can't shoot at enemies that rush us

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:11.200
down without incurring like a chance of

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:13.000
pretty like enormous risk so we're going

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.530
to have to be way way way more cautious

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.730
than we oftentimes have been which is

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:18.040
why I'm not really going to concern

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:19.690
myself with going to the curse room you

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.160
know that strikes me as like a little

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:23.470
too dangerous for my taste

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:27.250
plus this run is actually great so it

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:33.900
seems to me like it would be nice dude

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:36.340
what you okay hear me out here

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:38.200
death touches amazing but we already

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:40.330
have piercing shots I think we should

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.640
take Abaddon for the raw damage increase

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:45.010
and if we're going to take Abaddon we

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:47.250
should really take both of these as

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:49.960
risky as it looks

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:52.720
grab this head down to the next floor

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.340
with like unbelievably ridiculous stats

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.170
except there 18 is going to be a little

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:59.290
dicey we're at six and a half because

00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:01.030
Abaddon gives you 6 that's one of those

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:04.120
examples of situations where like rules

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:06.010
are made to be broken I think most of

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.510
the time if you saw strange if not

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:12.040
strange attractor good lord if you saw

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:13.510
deaths touch on a on a deal or as a free

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.730
item from the boss especially you would

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:17.530
be like dude I'm in but in this case

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.970
because we already have piercing shots

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:21.730
something that doesn't happen all that

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:24.880
often a redundant piercing shot I think

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:28.510
it really was like by far the correct

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:30.400
option for us to to basically go for the

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:33.660
HP and keep in keeping in mind the HP

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.860
also allowed us to very freely take a

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.360
damage increase and then also a same

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:40.600
which could give us even more HP in the

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:45.430
future so I mean we have 23 base damage

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:48.330
right now so I'm feeling like our

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:51.220
decision-making process is pretty good

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:54.100
being able to muster 30 damage by the

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:55.510
third floor seems fairly amazing so I'm

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.490
quite happy with that and we're just

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:59.380
going to look for blood bag because our

00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:01.120
speed is still a little subpar and we

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.470
could always use the money and just nice

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.200
to get a chance of some luck upgrades

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:06.880
and maybe some more purchasing power in

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.350
the future here let's move on I like

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:12.370
this because this floor looks super

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:14.410
linear and that is you know for my

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:15.820
cerebral cortex just about the perfect

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:19.180
thing here dude

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:20.950
it took a while but PhD eventually gave

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.780
us exactly what we wanted you know I

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:25.210
wanted us to get that HP upgrade earlier

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:27.370
so we can make the blood bank pop and

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.900
this is like a really dynamic run we got

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:30.190
two HP upgrade later which is what I was

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.140
going to finish that anecdote with but

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:33.640
we're on the fourth floor we've had a

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.470
lot of interesting stuff happen on this

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.150
run we went from being like we're

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:40.840
probably never going to be able to get

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:42.610
good stuff out of a tear detonator to

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.410
being like wait a minute we've gotten an

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:46.660
amazing tear detonator run we also got a

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:48.220
black market we got PhD and there's

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:52.750
options we fought the Fallen he gave us

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:53.680
two good choices of items straight up I

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:59.650
think we're happier with the speed

00:14:53.680 --> 00:15:02.830
upgrade here hello Ruka you're awake the

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:04.630
cats were like crazy today man not that

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:06.190
you're necessarily that enamored with

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:07.870
the day-to-day life of my cats but I

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:09.670
feel like you know I'm at the point I

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:12.040
never leave my house except to go to

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:14.530
class buy cat food and buy groceries so

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:16.570
like one Kate had a concert yesterday

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:18.400
that she was playing so we left

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:21.160
yesterday for a little bit admittedly

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:22.750
but but they didn't have any dry food

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.460
and they eat dry food every day so we

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:26.110
were like all right well we got wet food

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:28.000
let's give them wet food instead when we

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:32.890
woke up this morning the cats were like

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:36.160
biting my hands they're like we need dry

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:37.930
food they were freaking out catacombs to

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.190
which I mean in the end of course

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.960
they're freaking out they're hungry and

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:43.360
there's no food but at the same time I'm

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:46.570
like what kind of delinquent pet owner

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:49.710
do you think I am so I believe car

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:53.230
batteries your detonator doesn't double

00:15:49.710 --> 00:16:00.400
the tiers detonated and taro cloth is

00:15:53.230 --> 00:16:02.020
amazing but I really want to try and we

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.610
can get to 15 cents anyway if we're

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:06.130
willing to sacrifice some spirit arts we

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:08.260
can get to 15 cents oh it totally does

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:10.360
double it so I was just wrong but I was

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.770
wrong in like the best way because we

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.640
still are going to get the benefit out

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:17.770
of it regardless

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:19.690
so that's absurdly good the car down the

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:21.490
errant cam remember does a massive

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:26.920
sacrifice a little bit

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:32.080
oh it's the the effect of the b1 okay

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:33.790
now we'll go through with this to more

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:39.310
sense not the do you want sorry the

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:41.200
cursed dice area 16 cents we are all we

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:44.470
must have D Aidid because we're like

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:47.080
much weaker now and our rate of fire is

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:53.230
way worse but we're also many many times

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:54.970
faster so that's actually pretty bad but

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:56.350
you know it gives us a good excuse to go

00:16:54.970 --> 00:17:00.060
back and play that blood bank some more

00:16:56.350 --> 00:17:00.060
because I just bought a bomb by accident

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:04.300
all right come on re roll my stance back

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:07.329
to something good we might miss boss

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:13.420
rush now but I don't want to but we may

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:16.480
regardless there is a nickel under there

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:19.270
so now we're very slow but our damage is

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:21.100
much better like much much better and

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.929
our rate of fire is drastically

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:24.850
increased dude I don't know this is a

00:17:22.929 --> 00:17:26.860
strange situation we're doing this all

00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:29.470
for taro cloth because taro cloth is

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:32.230
lovely and I'm thinking like car battery

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:35.140
tear detonator parasitoid tears is going

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:36.790
to be a combination for the ages like we

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:41.880
get a card for just for holding this as

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:46.059
well ace of clubs it's not quite as

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:47.440
bombastic as I thought it would be it's

00:17:46.059 --> 00:17:49.300
kind of open it would turn into like 20

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.010
bombs instead we just lost our devil

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:52.510
card which could have been nice but we

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:53.650
got a great combination going here as

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:59.380
long as we don't accidentally end their

00:17:53.650 --> 00:18:01.570
own lives anyway like I'm expecting to

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:03.250
get a lot of flies and spiders I know

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:05.500
I'm leaving consumables behind this is

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:08.230
all in the interest of getting to boss

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:13.030
rush which might strike you is not being

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:15.090
worth much but look at this run this

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:17.950
might be and I don't use this lightly

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:20.280
this might be almost as good as being

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:20.280
guppy

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:26.220
our Paris like this effect by itself

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:28.050
might be almost as good as being gubby

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:30.330
our parasitoid tears are crushing it

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:33.660
obviously we want our luck upgrades and

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:38.280
I would love to be able to get chaos as

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:40.380
well this is why by the way this doesn't

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:42.210
happen that often so you get a run that

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:44.660
just pops like this but this is why I

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:47.760
always love to go for these weird combos

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:51.080
because in a situation like this they're

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.080
working out so well for us

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:58.200
you got a try truth be told they could

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.520
probably try both I'm going to abandon

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.410
our item room to try to get the boss

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:05.330
rush where we're definitely if we make

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:08.220
it going to do boss rush because we have

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:14.430
the ability to do so like extremely

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:17.520
easily I don't even need to see the

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:19.230
enemies to destroy them this might be I

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.730
didn't think it would happen at the

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:22.380
start of this run but this might be one

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:24.600
of the most powerful runs we've ever had

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:25.970
we totally left chaos behind on the last

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:28.320
floor as well but you know what

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:30.810
controlled chaos is what we already have

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:32.970
I said remember that let's donate all of

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:37.620
our money here unless a double two of

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:39.990
clubs it's not bad I mean that would

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:42.150
give us 12 right now so it's not a ton

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:43.590
but it's you know I keep in mind every

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:45.830
bomb you pick up is essentially four

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:50.090
bombs that you've picked up so we can

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:50.090
see how that would scale pretty quickly

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:58.080
can't quite kill every enemy that we see

00:19:53.820 --> 00:20:00.030
apparently would so there's effectively

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:03.390
no point to skipping the item room on

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:05.090
this floor which we've already gone to

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:08.180
the item room on this floor disregard

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:10.650
we've also already gone to the shop so I

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:12.690
guess we're just good to go 48 hour

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:16.560
energy is irrelevant now we're getting

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:18.420
up to 16 bombs I guess we'll just look

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.010
it like I'm not trying to speed through

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:21.390
this run as if I don't like it it's

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:23.730
quite the opposite like I love it so

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:26.060
much every time we press the spacebar

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:28.260
you know an angel gets its wings and

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:29.550
polaroid invincibility very useful

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:32.000
you're out you got to go for the raw

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:32.000
damage

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:47.910
we must have got I would also probably

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:54.540
say this is like the strongest

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:58.680
parasitoids here we've ever had I think

00:20:54.540 --> 00:21:01.440
if we play our cards right like we can

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:05.550
actually still have parasitoid tears on

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:09.690
the screen or not pears but like a tear

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:12.230
detonator tears on the screen when the

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:14.550
second wave spawns at least if they

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:20.880
don't have death animations that makes

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:22.440
that unlikely I suppose we almost didn't

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:28.950
kill the gate right away and I was

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:30.830
losing my mind all right that was like

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:33.360
the fastest run of all time

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:34.620
the fastest boss rush of all time it

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:38.070
took less than a minute to get through

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:41.460
15 waves less than 2 minutes at least uh

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:43.770
and now like if there's one thing I want

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:46.260
to be cautious about it's creating an

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:49.500
enduring legacy for tear detonator this

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:51.360
is an item that all about how my life

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:55.350
got no this is an item that is not

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:57.630
actually like nearly as good as it

00:21:55.350 --> 00:22:00.210
appears right now and that's not me

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:03.510
being bitter it's just me being

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:05.130
realistic like most of the time it's not

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:07.710
even close to performing at this level

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:11.670
but for now it's crushing it so hard

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:14.750
that I the lead chunk and that was a

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:18.020
surprise what happens if you kill the

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:20.010
little guy laughs sometimes I guess but

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:22.170
just trying to temper your expectations

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:24.510
because you might watch this video and

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:28.560
be like tear detonators one of the best

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:30.600
items in the game well yes and no in

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.520
this situation I would rather have this

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.990
over like anything else I don't think

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:38.400
anything else we could conceive of even

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:39.630
comes close but you know there are space

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.610
bar items that are better than this it's

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:43.770
mostly honestly because our stats are

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.770
just so good and to that we oh you know

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:47.110
a sense of

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:48.550
intrepid miss and then also that

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.200
second-floor deal with the devil and

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:52.540
then also you know getting sucky buffs

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:54.600
from a blood bank seemingly basically

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:57.510
out of nowhere and our stats have been

00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:03.130
compromised again now that we have

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:06.070
cracked dice unfortunately got it by a

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:08.380
couple bombs in there as well but we're

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:11.309
still not we shouldn't be in a dire

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:13.929
position are we going to fight hush I

00:23:11.309 --> 00:23:17.980
mean the double strength guard makes it

00:23:13.929 --> 00:23:21.670
fairly sensible to fight hush our range

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:24.940
is the ridiculous stat now I mean even

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:29.590
though our damage is not as good it's

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:30.970
still like really really good the only

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:32.890
thing really missing right now is the

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:34.900
ability to fly we could get the L we got

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:37.630
pH D so should check if we can get that

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:39.840
to pop off we're like sitting extremely

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:39.840
pretty

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:48.130
I mean I'm a little spoiled on this run

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:52.120
I'm walking into every room pressing the

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:56.110
spacebar and everything's dying it's

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:58.179
like our dad works at Nikolas

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:59.559
entertainment he told me a seed where

00:23:58.179 --> 00:24:01.000
you can just get like the greatest run

00:23:59.559 --> 00:24:02.679
of all time he press space and all the

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.799
enemies die yeah whatever

00:24:02.679 --> 00:24:07.500
except it's actually true my uncle does

00:24:05.799 --> 00:24:13.210
work in Nintendo

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:16.390
his name is Shigeru Shigeru name is

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:22.929
Shigeru Miyamoto maybe you've heard of

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:24.490
him he's from Timmins Ontario I'm not

00:24:22.929 --> 00:24:26.049
from Timmins but you know who says an

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:30.730
uncle has to be from the same place as

00:24:26.049 --> 00:24:34.779
his nephew you know it's an insulting

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:36.070
attitude we've got a deal the deal is

00:24:34.779 --> 00:24:39.820
not nine lives

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:42.309
we're far enough away from Guffey that I

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:43.510
don't okay what I mean to say is we're

00:24:42.309 --> 00:24:46.960
definitely going to take Gabby's head

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:50.500
just to try to become Guffey but that

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:52.360
means we are not going to go oh we

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:53.409
should just yeah yeah you're right we

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.880
should have popped the strength cards

00:24:53.409 --> 00:24:56.320
then we could have gotten both of them

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:59.820
for free we can still get a little brim

00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:01.600
for free but take Pierre detonator dude

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:05.020
but we're definitely not going to go

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:07.000
fight hush now because I'm a moron

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:13.740
however at least we made it through this

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:16.480
part relatively unscathed just watch out

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:18.130
you know any objects in the environment

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:21.399
can still cause you a little little

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:23.409
trouble here you're still alive so we

00:25:21.399 --> 00:25:25.539
desperately need some spirit arts it's

00:25:23.409 --> 00:25:30.970
still lose Abul should not be lose Abul

00:25:25.539 --> 00:25:33.789
but it is still losing don't need any of

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:35.559
that I was like actually going to do the

00:25:33.789 --> 00:25:37.529
hush fight I would rather do the hush

00:25:35.559 --> 00:25:40.000
fight and have three extra spirit hearts

00:25:37.529 --> 00:25:41.559
then do what we did and have Guppies

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.059
head with almost no chances to get a

00:25:41.559 --> 00:25:45.279
guppy transformation I mean we did

00:25:43.059 --> 00:25:47.200
turndown couple use of hair ball earlier

00:25:45.279 --> 00:25:48.549
that's how you can be relatively sure

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:51.539
that what I did there was actually a

00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:51.539
genuine accident

00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:05.660
however I mean there's no denying it's a

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:07.310
mistake men at work that being said for

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:09.470
all the problems that we've maybe

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:12.140
incurred upon ourselves as a result of

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:13.700
our relative inability to do one full

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:21.140
run without making an enormous mistake

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:21.910
at the same time I don't know about that

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:25.940
one

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:28.190
thank you PhD by the way for the

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:30.890
inevitable yes health upgrade that we're

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:32.540
going to get here which we shouldn't

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:34.100
probably can pop and don't you can't

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:37.360
fill it up yet anyway so don't sweat it

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:40.690
I'm just worried yes about a hot bombs

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.690
bomber boy

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:50.490
but it doesn't look like they're

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:50.490
actually exploding like bomber boy

00:26:54.420 --> 00:27:00.250
by the way if we end up losing on this

00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:02.110
run because we got a little too silly

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:05.470
I'm still going to be happy with it just

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:08.170
because the run is ridiculous but I'm

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:10.290
surely thinking a loss would be a major

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:12.520
problem here the major mistake

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:14.740
indicative of a great degree of idiocy

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:16.660
does that make you feel better it makes

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:21.550
me feel a lot worse so it should make

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:25.120
you feel better yeah I think it gives us

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:27.550
a spare hit Oh killing last get a spirit

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:32.020
art that's all we need by the way

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:34.180
intending to fight to fight mega satan

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:35.860
here i just want to maybe stack up HP

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.700
before we do and you know we've got 9

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:40.030
lux so

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:46.600
oh the conjoined transformation seems

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:50.530
like it should be amazingly good but who

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:51.550
knows wait what a little too late not

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:55.660
that we would have taken it in a run

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:57.430
like this anyway but it's fine give me a

00:27:55.660 --> 00:28:02.350
de gAHS room so I at least know where I

00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:04.750
stand we did get a black heart there I

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:09.880
want to open it but we can't open it you

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:11.310
never get anything out of you got to be

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:13.630
kidding me you never get anything out of

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:18.310
the boss fight so I don't think that's

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:20.790
sensible we could beat the boss in two

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:20.790
seconds

00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:31.399
top because that's going to be a speed

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:33.320
downgrade the mega Satan's gonna be

00:28:31.399 --> 00:28:36.799
slightly tougher but you know at the

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:39.080
same time I like believe that's the

00:28:36.799 --> 00:28:41.659
right way to prove that we've gotten

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:44.090
over our previous streak or slump Redis

00:28:41.659 --> 00:28:46.130
leaks leaks and strums that's what I've

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:46.700
always said that's what the game is all

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:50.480
about

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:52.370
no spun but the speed up is nice but not

00:28:50.480 --> 00:29:05.049
doing anything for us fine let's take on

00:28:52.370 --> 00:29:07.850
mushroom NoHo well we need the red hard

00:29:05.049 --> 00:29:11.389
blank card actually could be incredible

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:11.960
for us we just need something to go

00:29:11.389 --> 00:29:13.730
along with it

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.860
I don't know less tears that do twice as

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:22.090
much damage actually seems good when

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:24.529
each tier has a chance to murder us and

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:31.399
that's it basically so I guess we'll

00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:33.549
we'll go get our HP so at least we can

00:29:31.399 --> 00:29:40.700
get hit once on the boss fight

00:29:33.549 --> 00:29:44.419
maybe maybe secret room this is a very

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:45.980
good time to be smart okay I didn't

00:29:44.419 --> 00:29:48.470
realize we had enough carryover momentum

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:53.210
it's a very good time to be smart look

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:59.019
for your secret room incur an advantage

00:29:53.210 --> 00:30:01.700
that way it doesn't exist apparently and

00:29:59.019 --> 00:30:05.649
then look for your second secret room

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:09.769
there's our secret room to forget me now

00:30:05.649 --> 00:30:13.850
we can't fly so we actually cannot get

00:30:09.769 --> 00:30:18.320
there which is a serious bummer because

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:19.909
I would like to get there and get four

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.379
more items and actually be able to see

00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:22.970
our HP we would be able to fight mega

00:30:21.379 --> 00:30:26.350
Satan but it's probably a good move for

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:26.350
like survival sake

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:34.340
just don't accidentally push the the

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:37.220
chest into you because it is a mimic

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:43.030
pala tute it was all worth it it was all

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:45.770
worth it now remember we can only use

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:46.940
you know what don't hate me I can't I

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:49.340
can't fight mega Satan I'm just

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:50.750
realizing now if we can only use two

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:53.630
your detonator once we can't buy mega

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:57.710
Satan I am gonna I'm going to bow out of

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:59.120
the mega Satan sweepstakes here if we

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:00.650
fight mega satan then we can only use

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.540
two your detonator once will probably

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:05.060
die killing enemies that are going to

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:07.940
rush us down i had the bank it i'm sorry

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:09.560
and whatever her name was from the

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:12.680
weakest link give me a moment here

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:20.360
spacebar 10 wins in a row and weakest

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:22.280
link and robinson a show aired for 13

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:24.830
freaking years good lord anyway

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.940
