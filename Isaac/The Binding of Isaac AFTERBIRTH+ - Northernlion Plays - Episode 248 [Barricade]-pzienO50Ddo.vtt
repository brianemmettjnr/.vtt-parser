00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.120
hey everybody welcome back to nor the

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.830
lion please the Bunning of Isaac after

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.710
birth plus were doing daily challenges

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.769
yesterday we died what wait today is

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:17.369
International what day it's not Mother's

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:25.470
that how could you do I got a hunch it's

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:32.489
Monday May 8 May 8 2016 May 8 2016 was

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:35.070
it Mother's Day give me you got to give

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.200
me a moment here events I mean probably

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.050
there's a lot of them is my guess

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.680
holidays and observations that's okay

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.399
you know what Mother's Day 2016 give me

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.879
a sec here Sunday May 8 yeah so here's

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.120
what happened look I know the algorithm

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.210
for Mother's Day is a little silly it's

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.480
like the first second Sunday in May

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.100
unless the first Sunday is you know it

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.080
isn't feeling that good and it sees its

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.790
own shadow and then it goes back to its

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.880
hole and you get six more months of

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.210
fathers days but they have obviously

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.490
last year hard-coded that the daily for

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.909
Mother's Day was to be on May 8th and

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.549
then here we are doing that daily right

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.049
and a whole scheme of things it's a

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.090
pretty minor thing it's a themes daily

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.340
that starts like pretty okay but it is

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.900
really funny what I think the others

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.369
will know you know now we're getting a

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.259
little heavy to call it an algorithm I

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:39.360
think the rule for Mother's Day is just

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.799
that it's a the second Sunday in May is

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.060
that the case but hey you know what

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.380
maybe it's good guy Tyrone and Nicholas

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.840
that are like hey why would we give you

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.670
the Mother's Day daily on Mother's Day

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.229
that's too late to make a difference

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.770
instead we'll give it to you 6 days in

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.180
advance and then as a result you still

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.950
have time to go down to the Hallmark

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.119
store buy your mom a nice card or

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.469
something like that put it in the mail

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.149
you know okay I'll get the mouse pointer

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.500
off the screen she did give birth to you

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.479
so you know I'm not trying to tell you

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.710
how to live your life but you know maybe

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.819
you have a terrible relationship with

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.590
your mom maybe she's not a good person

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.120
maybe she never really tried to raise

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.489
you but

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.890
same time I you know for those of us out

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:21.470
there who were relatively lucky you know

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.709
you got a show where you care just call

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.200
her every once in a while mister okay

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.390
but anyway now that we know what's going

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.780
on and we have an interesting anecdote

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.480
about today's daily we can start to move

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.150
along and hopefully rank well the scores

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.280
today are not great from what I saw on

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.739
on greed but occasionally you're going

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.260
to hear like a little motor sound that's

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.379
um the Roomba is presently running and

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.200
banging into my office door I like to

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:54.859
think that it's doing an impression of

00:02:51.200 --> 00:03:00.230
Billy Corgan from trak-1 off of Siamese

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:02.930
Dream he led me out well did he actually

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.970
he wants to be let in okay now I'm not

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.150
salty cuz again it's daily the mom

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.980
transformation is meaningless but

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.049
everything else is okay you shouldn't

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.519
give no item rooms because of the

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.720
quality of items that you've given me

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:20.959
it's not sensible no item is because I

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:27.079
have what mom's pad I don't think so

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:29.750
he's done it that's pretty great I don't

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:32.989
want to spend moaning I think what I

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.609
want to do is get 15 cents if possible

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.440
Kay so I didn't want to spend any money

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.120
there to go to the shop I don't really

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.709
want to spend a key either because I

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.120
want there to be an arcade on the next

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.949
floor we got four HP we can make that

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.370
work for us but at a top score today is

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:47.660
something like forty nine thousand forty

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.609
nine thousand on the run that goes to

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.959
mom's heart indicates that there is a

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:56.599
seam somewhere there's no hush fight so

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.980
probably a self sacrifice room on the

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.930
womb would be my guess

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.209
it might not mean that it's a bad daily

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.569
just that there's no conceivable way to

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.489
get a seam without doing the self

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.669
sacrifice room which often times you

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.319
know comes with its own damage penalty

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:15.980
anyway this run is actually fine so far

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.030
moldy bread is okay couldn't have even

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.889
started if you're going to give me no

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.070
item rooms start me with mom's perfume

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.540
buddy at least that gives us a tears up

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.580
it's something

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.270
it justifies the loss of a single item

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:33.380
room Roomba get out I swear to god the

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.910
Roomba pathfinding functionality I don't

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.290
know how they did it at iRobot

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.240
industries but they programmed it

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:42.820
specifically to seek out whatever room

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:45.230
I'm in and then bang on the flippin door

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.420
why do I have the Roomba on during

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:51.020
recording hours we'll you know very

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.940
simple actually we wake up pretty late

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.550
and then we record until it's too late

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.080
to run the Roomba because it would be

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.750
too loud for the people that live

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.950
adjacent and underneath us mostly

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.330
underneath you know and nobody ever

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.620
thinks about the noise that goes from

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.830
your apartment to the people underneath

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.830
you walking around you a little loop so

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.990
one I am time for my wooden clogging

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.050
practice ticka ticka ticka - why are

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.870
they doing why are they doing clogging

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.490
practice to a song that sounds like it's

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.080
from a Tostitos commercial is I don't

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.380
know dude you ever live in an apartment

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:27.290
these people they got wild wild

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.710
lifestyles you never realized I thought

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.240
people were like normal I'm not saying

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.190
I'm a normal person any other you know

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:39.980
obviously there are parts of my life

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:41.900
that are abnormal mainly my job well you

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.420
never realized we've had like the

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.190
quietest neighbors and then just at 5:00

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.600
a.m.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.390
super loud techno music and I'm like did

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:54.140
you move here from Europe and then just

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:55.940
never adjusted I don't understand I'm

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.890
not saying never adjusted culturally I'm

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.070
saying literally does your brain think

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.330
it's like 9 p.m. right now and I know

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.500
some of you are going to be pretending

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.910
you're going to run the map well

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.940
actually with that would mean that they

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:10.100
live in Dubrovnik Croatia and that seems

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:13.330
unlikely given that they prefer a house

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:16.160
music to electro ok sure you got me

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:19.460
don't take that pill yet I'm taking the

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.680
pill let's go to the shop there's no

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:25.210
arcade we could use the spirit are just

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.210
to protect our self-interest here

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:35.910
I think this is worth using a bomb me

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.590
sack boys lovely obviously as tough call

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:44.370
isn't it because you know for a reroll

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:46.919
we could probably get a spirit heart

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:51.270
which could protect us however if we can

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:55.830
get three more sense instead via many

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:58.830
different avenues maybe not that would

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:01.500
be much better for us because sack boy

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:07.050
is like an incredibly good item I don't

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:09.540
like small room pin that's really our

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:13.800
moment right there I'm actually avoiding

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:15.840
the use of Mom's pad by the way because

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.720
I don't like the way fear shot BIG's

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.030
enemies behave unpredictably sometimes

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.600
[Music]

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.510
he's done it

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.220
counter ninetails is lovely you got to

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.570
go MA the void here and you know what

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:32.900
let's hangman just to make sure we're

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:35.039
safe I think I'm just gonna leave I

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:38.330
would love to get sacked I guess we

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:40.800
could look for a second secret room

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.750
that's fine let's get the heck out of

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.490
here it's still a good situation I got

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.200
lucky probably to not take any damage

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:48.180
there I think that that could slow

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:51.750
people down I didn't I did go to the

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:53.700
cursor moves adjacent to the adjacent to

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:55.590
the secret room okay I think we're doing

00:07:53.700 --> 00:08:01.169
fine on today's daily I like dailies

00:07:55.590 --> 00:08:03.090
that have late seams or no seams no seam

00:08:01.169 --> 00:08:06.690
is actually my ideal daily despite how

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:08.700
much I love saying the word seam because

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:10.229
I think that you know my track record on

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.840
those basically speaks for itself not

00:08:10.229 --> 00:08:14.720
that I'm like the master of unseen

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:17.729
dailies

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:22.669
however I'd tend to rank best on those

00:08:17.729 --> 00:08:22.669
oh we got a check

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.850
that was actually terrible I tracked

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.240
that shot the whole way and still got

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:31.150
hit

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:33.190
okay that was substantial okay now we're

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.600
getting a little silly here now I start

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:37.030
to look for a scapegoat and I say Oh

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.190
one-speed what is this a Maggie run

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:40.840
there we go now we got our black hearts

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:42.070
that's fine

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.600
you know we screwed up our deal with the

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:48.310
devil chance but it was pretty low to

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:56.680
begin with it's probably our secret room

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:59.200
Oh interesting mildly interesting so

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:01.360
what's the what's the path to getting

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.880
the highest score on today's daily oh I

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:06.220
did I'm well sackboy would have been

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:09.820
part of the pack to be fair we didn't

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:13.510
get that unfortunately lock up to a spay

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:15.790
the spine let's take the pill range down

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:17.290
is irrelevant and 15 cents you get

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.270
humbling bundle humbling bundles a

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.500
wonderful item lucky pennies don't get

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:22.660
doubled so I don't think we whipped on

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:31.200
that one too hard we have seen some good

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:33.250
pills so I'm content to take safety cap

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:38.560
you know what

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:41.230
slow your roll mob the void is wonderful

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:44.230
it's actually a glorious item there's no

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:45.910
reason for me to be taking this much

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:49.780
dumb damage just as a result of having

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:52.060
it that's that's a bad excuse so I'm

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:53.320
going to go to the curse room it looks

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.580
through the extra room first maybe we

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.090
can generate a black heart or something

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.090
outfit

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:05.170
admittedly we could be like we could

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:09.089
have screwed up our chances already and

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:11.380
the way we would have done that is by

00:10:09.089 --> 00:10:15.790
losing that 33 percent deal with the

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:16.870
devil chance most of the time that deal

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.520
with the devil chance is not going to

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:22.029
pan out and as a result we'll have no

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:24.330
lasting effects from it but if it would

00:10:22.029 --> 00:10:26.560
have panned out

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:28.720
then we've upset that you know the

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:32.170
causality of the whole run so two of

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:35.800
diamonds is probably our best call here

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:38.560
to a spades gives us five extra keys in

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:41.440
five extra keys now you guys like that

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:44.920
song by Peter Molyneux Peter Gabriel

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:46.450
whatever steam stopped steam what's your

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:50.170
problem why are you constantly popping

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:52.600
up an alert like dangling sending me a

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:56.589
message telling me to play something

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:59.260
okay let's get the heck out of here find

00:10:56.589 --> 00:11:01.240
Daly so far mistakes on this floor life

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.320
goes on you get the idea we got two

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.460
cents right now so I'm not going to

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.290
double anything we're going to try to

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:07.540
use that to I mean hopefully get a big

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:10.660
point boost for us now a lot of the void

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:11.980
on boss rush is awesome but I would like

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:13.959
to get something that raises our base

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.070
damage so we don't feel like we have to

00:11:13.959 --> 00:11:18.040
use mob to void

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:20.589
notice I said feel like I have to use

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:24.120
mob the void because I don't think I

00:11:20.589 --> 00:11:29.680
actually have to use mob the void I

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:34.029
think it is tempting but risky it's kind

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:35.650
of like using an orbital but I am using

00:11:34.029 --> 00:11:38.110
it nonetheless because you know to thine

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:42.730
own self be true right so I'm also like

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:46.680
barely using mom's pad and again that

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:49.510
basically comes down to I don't trust

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:52.870
the way enemies move when they're

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:58.120
affected by fear but when they are

00:11:52.870 --> 00:12:00.690
affected by fear they do not shoot now

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:04.740
my finest damage there

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:08.650
damage seller I need your finest damage

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:13.330
I'm headed into a daily you can't handle

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:16.540
my finest damage my finest damage would

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:17.830
put you in the quadruple digits did we

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:24.070
come down here with enough money to get

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:27.370
a an arcade could buy a spirit heart if

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:31.540
necessary but I would like in arcade so

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:33.220
we can access that room right there dude

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.870
we need well actually I didn't even

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:37.480
realize we had to luck that's pretty

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:39.580
solid but kind of feel like we're whiff

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:42.220
and in that department right now in

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:46.060
terms of like generating Blackhearts we

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:51.940
have no bombs okay that's the secret

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:55.140
room probably this is a big deal with

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.140
the devil opportunity

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:02.970
that was actually very close no deal

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.290
with the devil but a deer's upgrade is

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.000
nice and it's actually fairly

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:07.470
substantial tears upgrade as well and

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.410
you know we're doing so much damage

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:14.220
we've got plenty of time to get back to

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:17.430
we once belongs I'm bound get to get

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:20.100
back to where the item room would be if

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:24.810
it weren't Mother's Day except it's not

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:28.740
get back Loretta I said that's still

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:31.110
just funny like it's I know like I'm not

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:34.590
gonna rake another company over the

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:36.180
coals for like a small mistake because I

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:39.120
get the same things sometimes sometimes

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:42.030
like I I label an episode with the wrong

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:45.950
number you got to see my video manager

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.950
sometimes YouTube doesn't give you great

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:50.190
organizational abilities in the video

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:52.620
manager it's basically just it's pretty

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:55.140
great a list of the videos that you've

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:57.510
created in chronological order from the

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:58.380
time that they're uploaded and you're

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.110
going to say well why don't other

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:04.700
youtubers mess it up

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:07.050
not trying to shame other youtubers

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:09.120
uploading like four to six videos a day

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:10.350
here did you know if you're doing three

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.240
videos a week and you can't get the

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:14.460
title for you know the four types of

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.840
girls you meet in New York City right

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.980
you got a problem you know that videos

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.440
gonna have a hard time making it onto

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:21.780
the trending list the videos are like

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:26.270
let's play The Binding of Isaac after

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:28.950
birth Plus somewhere between 200 and 250

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:30.780
you know it just there's a lot more

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:32.400
uniformity there I'm not even saying

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:36.810
that's a good thing I'm just saying it's

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:38.250
a thing thing but yeah then somebody in

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:40.050
the comments will be like C and L

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:42.420
doesn't even care about Isaac anymore

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:45.450
you can't even bother you get the number

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:47.340
right just a simple human mistake and

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.930
you're looking too deep into it which is

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:55.490
exactly what I'm doing about this

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:59.029
challenge right here um look

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:59.749
I want the damage upgrade I don't care

00:14:59.029 --> 00:15:01.970
about the range

00:14:59.749 --> 00:15:03.649
Leflore beyond catacombs - I'm going to

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.360
buy the spirit art then as well I know

00:15:03.649 --> 00:15:06.529
we could have used our money to double

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.689
it but I think we'll have a chance to

00:15:06.529 --> 00:15:10.490
get more money later cuz of contract

00:15:08.689 --> 00:15:11.839
from below we probably should have

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:12.889
bought one bomb while we were in there

00:15:11.839 --> 00:15:14.869
now that I think about it that could

00:15:12.889 --> 00:15:16.369
have paid dividends but still we did

00:15:14.869 --> 00:15:18.170
this basically very couple of reasons

00:15:16.369 --> 00:15:21.619
one is I like having an orbital the

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:25.339
other is it gives us a statistical bonus

00:15:21.619 --> 00:15:27.050
albeit not an enormous one like gives us

00:15:25.339 --> 00:15:32.179
damage upgrade the range is less

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:33.829
relevant but I do like a damage upgrade

00:15:32.179 --> 00:15:38.720
and we actually now that I think about

00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:40.579
it probably could have stuck with Cuba

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:43.610
meets or sorry a potato peeler long-term

00:15:40.579 --> 00:15:51.499
but I'm sort of glad we didn't and the

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:55.910
reason is I HP to possibly play a self

00:15:51.499 --> 00:15:58.999
sacrifice room IV bag IV bag with

00:15:55.910 --> 00:16:01.429
contract from below is so much better

00:15:58.999 --> 00:16:03.350
than anything else you guys I apologize

00:16:01.429 --> 00:16:06.980
sincerely for this frame rate I don't

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:10.329
know what is causing it is it this

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:16.040
message from mouth that says this guy

00:16:10.329 --> 00:16:18.049
let's see um Ace of Hearts I mean get

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:20.209
that mouse pointer off the screen Ace of

00:16:18.049 --> 00:16:25.730
Hearts is clever but not very smart

00:16:20.209 --> 00:16:27.949
right now so what is the right play here

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:30.860
it's very very simple

00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:32.269
I don't think we need to stack up many

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:34.730
more red hearts but it would be nice to

00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:36.170
have one more HP I know that's rich

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:38.779
considering I just got rid of some but

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:43.369
the idea is I want to still be able to

00:16:38.779 --> 00:16:44.990
use IV bag on the womb to generate some

00:16:43.369 --> 00:16:46.490
more money if necessary it's like the

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:50.569
first black card we've gotten in a long

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:53.119
time - of diamonds thanks for that as

00:16:50.569 --> 00:16:55.490
stars card they're two of diamonds does

00:16:53.119 --> 00:16:57.230
some great stuff for us we'll go back

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:58.939
for it assuming that we're not way

00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:04.760
behind schedule it early in the next

00:16:58.939 --> 00:17:07.730
room so we will go back for it but yeah

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:09.370
now especially with humbling bundle we

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:11.500
can get $2.99

00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:13.390
easily moreover we can buy whatever we

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:16.150
want to buy from the shops which is

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:18.459
important as well we've been I wouldn't

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:23.829
say tight on money but a little bit we

00:17:18.459 --> 00:17:25.569
haven't had unlimited funds you know now

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:27.610
we will get closer to having unlimited

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:30.460
funds if every time we press the

00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:35.320
spacebar we lose effectively nothing in

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:37.750
gain for cents that's pretty good so

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:41.679
there's a 15 a couple of 15 cent items

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:45.190
in there we might hold off on my master

00:17:41.679 --> 00:17:49.150
plan to buy everything for one more

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:52.150
floor just to generate more money to

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:55.240
begin with remember there's no item room

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:56.740
to worry about so they were pretty much

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:59.010
good to go as soon as you find our boss

00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:02.440
room here which presumably will be

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:05.530
basically right now ma the voids doing

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:06.850
good work oh maybe not right now but ma

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:08.650
the void is doing good work and we

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:09.790
should have what we do have a 100

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:13.059
percent chance of getting a deal with

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:14.980
the bevel here so grab this and give

00:18:13.059 --> 00:18:19.660
yourself a little bit more time sure we

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:22.540
could look for we could look for a

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:24.250
secret room a second secret room etc etc

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:25.300
we could look for the songs that remind

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:27.460
us of the good times you could look for

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:30.580
the songs ever - are the best times but

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:32.410
the big deal is making sure we can get

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:35.080
the boss rush so let's not you know miss

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:35.790
out on catching that big slice of ahi

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:41.760
tuna

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:44.200
we lost our orbital terrible decision

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.660
let's not miss out on that big slice of

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:49.630
ahi tuna just because we were you know

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:51.429
getting a new Led Zeppelin album cover

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:53.110
airbrushed onto our boat you know that

00:18:51.429 --> 00:18:55.410
would be we'd be missing the forest

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:55.410
through the trees

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:04.020
so what are we looking for here

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:11.350
generating as many spirit hearts as

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:16.300
possible I also recognize that for all

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:18.880
everything I said it was so that is fine

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:20.980
it was so the wrong decision to take a

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:23.980
deal with the devil but I can't say no

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:27.190
to a deal with the devil you know curse

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:29.200
with a blind deal with the devil we got

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:31.000
to curse the blind boss rush right here

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:33.310
we got to do it might as well get

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.160
ourselves in practice you know oh I

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:40.180
really thought we had moved enough out

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:41.740
of the way I do find myself slightly

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.700
perturbed not because of boss rush

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.380
although that could be a little

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:46.120
cumbersome I expected you know if we

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.760
fight the hollow and destroy him with

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:53.470
mobs avoid you should be fine but a

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:58.530
non-hp survival at least however I'm

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:58.530
perturbed by my damage penalty so far

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:05.140
and I'm perturbed by our lack of red

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:07.810
hearts IV bag really I mean it's not

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:09.130
like mom's pad was really crushing it

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:11.050
for us in this department to begin with

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:16.330
but terms of space bar items we would

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:17.680
really really like to get HP so we can

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:21.160
use the one we already have

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:22.690
crickets head would be nice too keys is

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:26.530
largely irrelevant I mean a third-level

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:29.890
Meat Boy is also sort of like not that

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:32.080
good but at the same time we have mob

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:35.140
devoid and mob the void is sort of like

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:38.170
an orbital of itself you know might

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:39.490
sound ridiculous but it only does damage

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:41.680
if you're close to an enemy

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:45.040
it carries a certain amount of risk with

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:47.170
it as a result of that but it also does

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:50.470
a lot of damage that most of the time

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:52.620
tends to justify that risk in my opinion

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:52.620
at least

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:57.380
but it's Norbit Allah that comes with

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:59.390
the added benefit of you know possibly

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:01.070
generating some demon hearts for me

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:04.970
which in this case is like the world's

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:07.940
easiest no-brainer so for looking at

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:12.070
getting into the 40s on this run like a

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:17.030
Judd Apatow film that nobody asked for

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:18.860
what should we do well we should stop

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:20.330
taking damage you've actually to some

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:26.300
extent we've recovered from a point

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:28.700
standpoint I think being at 13,500 while

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:30.410
going into boss rush is usually roughly

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:33.559
around the right amount and tend to

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:35.030
think 13,000 is right amount there we

00:21:33.559 --> 00:21:38.270
should pop to a diamonds then go to town

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:41.600
deep pockets is fine got to be a little

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:45.710
fast but don't sweat it too much mom's

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:47.210
purse is okay chaos okay that raises all

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:52.160
sorts of questions that I'm completely

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:54.170
okay with mom's eyeshadow and little

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:56.300
horn and then I guess we'll just blow it

00:21:54.170 --> 00:22:02.510
up I just want a five cent item at this

00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:04.309
point I suppose and secret room common

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:07.970
secret room location I don't know how

00:22:04.309 --> 00:22:10.850
much we won there but ASA spades fairly

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:12.170
irrelevant to a clubs and I'm just going

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:14.690
to pop to a clubs give me the points

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:17.000
right now ASA spades if we need it we

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:20.690
can use it and then we still have enough

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:26.480
time to beat mom I would say yes not a

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:27.770
secret room we're looking to hit with

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.309
everything you know we want to hit with

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.309
mom's knife

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:36.289
we want to hit with mob d'void we want

00:22:35.119 --> 00:22:43.519
to hate with Cuban meat we're totally

00:22:36.289 --> 00:22:46.489
going to make it can we fight Krampus we

00:22:43.519 --> 00:22:48.200
don't need to okay so take Polaroid what

00:22:46.489 --> 00:22:49.519
are we going to take here what does it

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:53.029
matter right dinner

00:22:49.519 --> 00:22:54.619
HP upgrade actually good for the first

00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:58.669
time in a long time

00:22:54.619 --> 00:23:01.429
a curse of the blind breakfast more or

00:22:58.669 --> 00:23:03.259
less as soon as you couldn't even bother

00:23:01.429 --> 00:23:05.960
to call the HP upgrade buy the right

00:23:03.259 --> 00:23:07.489
name no but this is actually sweet

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.169
because when we get red hearts we can

00:23:07.489 --> 00:23:11.090
create permanent polaroid invincibility

00:23:09.169 --> 00:23:12.529
which allows us to get in there with mom

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:14.299
the void and hopefully generate more

00:23:12.529 --> 00:23:15.919
black hearts out of the situation you

00:23:14.299 --> 00:23:18.549
know I've thought this one through to

00:23:15.919 --> 00:23:18.549
some extent

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:36.830
where you going right there I think

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:36.830
there's another turtling left maybe yeah

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:46.899
red hearts please okay so be timing is

00:23:44.169 --> 00:23:49.499
not everything in this situation that's

00:23:46.899 --> 00:23:49.499
really good as well

00:23:49.739 --> 00:23:54.940
in fact in this situation timing is

00:23:52.720 --> 00:24:02.710
almost nothing but the faster we go the

00:23:54.940 --> 00:24:04.960
more points we are going to get we want

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:06.729
that do we yeah we do want that so we

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:11.279
can play The Ivy Vegas at this point

00:24:06.729 --> 00:24:14.200
getting to 99 cents might be one of the

00:24:11.279 --> 00:24:15.609
best ways for us to get more points than

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.979
some other people might have gotten if

00:24:15.609 --> 00:24:21.519
they sort of like absent-mindedly chose

00:24:17.979 --> 00:24:22.960
not to take the IV bag which honestly

00:24:21.519 --> 00:24:25.509
would have looked like the right

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:29.340
decision many times over the course of

00:24:25.509 --> 00:24:29.340
this good good good good good

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:41.190
I'm only going to use IV bag more

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:47.760
fighting the more difficult of the

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:49.260
enemies dude keep dropping red hearts

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:52.500
you are a beautiful creature

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:55.410
now there's also like this is a perfect

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:56.850
time to use IV bag for permanent

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:58.140
polaroid invincibility against blast

00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:59.730
this is because we'd be expecting to

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:01.710
generate some black hearts now of course

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:03.420
we would be completely incorrect in that

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:09.690
assessment because we're naive

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:12.500
apparently gotta admit though boss rush

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:12.500
is going great so far

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:18.270
we could I be back there but I don't

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:19.830
know if the rules for losing a spirit

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:22.530
heart and then immediately regenerating

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:23.790
it point wise are the same as the rules

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:25.260
for losing a red heart and then

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:26.820
immediately regenerating it point wise

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:29.340
which as you can probably guess from our

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:37.950
score total seems to functionally have

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:40.910
no penalty at all the real question here

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:43.440
is who is the other enemy oh nice

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:47.700
permanent polaroid invincibility pop

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:51.120
it's war no that's low key you're silly

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:54.470
they do kind of look similar at the risk

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.470
of sounding insensitive

00:25:56.380 --> 00:26:00.250
so watch out for enemies that shoot

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:05.980
beams this guy shoots a beam you got to

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:08.169
get over there nice no more beams

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:11.460
no more beams this guy's got to go first

00:26:08.169 --> 00:26:16.419
little horn is irrelevant

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:19.270
he's dusted he should continue to be

00:26:16.419 --> 00:26:20.740
dust I think mom's I killed in there

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:28.210
which is actually hilarious

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:31.179
I got to be honest with you six point

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:37.409
eight five damage we're making that work

00:26:31.179 --> 00:26:39.850
I don't know what we've done to deserve

00:26:37.409 --> 00:26:42.850
the amount of red hearts we've gotten

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:45.669
like we're actually almost getting a red

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:48.549
heart per room or so I per wave reliably

00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:50.169
here which is not something I would have

00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:56.770
expected in advance what do you think in

00:26:50.169 --> 00:27:01.929
there buddy like come on but we are

00:26:56.770 --> 00:27:04.600
making that work for us somehow now I do

00:27:01.929 --> 00:27:06.610
wish you'd drop instead of dropping two

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.380
red hearts if it could drop for half red

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:10.900
hearts that would be more appropriate

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:18.130
for my situation that was also very bad

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:21.130
play on my part right there mmm

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:24.460
Donna damn we're fighting Dark One see I

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:28.200
know I know popular music was wild won

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:28.200
by that Kesha I don't know

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:37.220
case is not obvious thank God we do not

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:45.810
have to fight hush on this run because

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:48.030
unlikely to happen given the timing of

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:51.330
this run right now but up until I've

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:52.920
recently started playing really badly on

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:54.180
his boss rush we were crushing it for a

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:59.880
little while there and I was feeling

00:27:54.180 --> 00:28:08.340
very good about our our world so I am

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:12.300
going to take the eternal hard book of

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:16.730
secrets it's not horrible but IV bag I

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:16.730
think really raises our point potential

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:24.570
okay okay okay what is our game plan now

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:27.660
well we've basically done what we needed

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:32.100
to do to give ourselves a ticket in the

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:34.040
lottery now ma it's not really a lottery

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:41.760
you know we we want an amateur

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:43.440
Invitational to participate in the

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.930
Masters or something like that or no I'm

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.770
making a golf analogy I got no

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:48.240
familiarity with golf though so it

00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:54.780
presents a problem as I'm sure you can

00:28:48.240 --> 00:29:00.240
imagine what we need to do now minimize

00:28:54.780 --> 00:29:03.000
our damage penalty try to find a self

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:05.940
sacrifice room and then do every single

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.500
room so wait where did my I already used

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:09.120
two of diamonds I did use two diamonds I

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:13.190
was going to say my two of diamonds is

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:15.540
gone but actually it's a good thing that

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:17.760
well I mean it's not a good thing that

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:20.280
we don't have two of diamonds but it's

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:22.950
largely not relevant that we don't have

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:25.140
two of diamonds right now because we're

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:26.730
going to hit $0.99 regardless like

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:29.120
that's just a thing that is going to

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:29.120
happen

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:34.840
so we don't need it to have diamonds

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:41.679
what we would love is the two of like

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:42.250
literally everything else that was so

00:29:41.679 --> 00:29:43.900
stupid

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:46.809
I could have just used the IV bag but

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:49.390
instead I didn't so the game plan here

00:29:46.809 --> 00:29:52.809
you like bangle extent get invincibility

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:54.429
okay we don't know what the pill does it

00:29:52.809 --> 00:29:56.320
might be perks now that I think about it

00:29:54.429 --> 00:29:58.270
one bomb for two keys is the kind of

00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:00.840
trade that we want to do down here even

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:04.299
though it might seem a little bit on the

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:06.760
irrelevant side I you know you never

00:30:04.299 --> 00:30:08.409
know sometimes you're the high scorers

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:11.529
you're still separated by only a little

00:30:08.409 --> 00:30:14.230
bit at the top there so we want to grab

00:30:11.529 --> 00:30:16.890
this and we want to come here and grab

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:16.890
this as well

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:27.370
dopes smelted safety cap

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:33.940
sounds like a Magic the Gathering card

00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:42.520
nothing bums me out more than using IV

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:44.409
bag getting permanent polaroid

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:48.490
invincibility to get aggressive and then

00:30:44.409 --> 00:30:52.480
get null freaking black cards from our

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:56.260
mob the void plays so we next read hard

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:59.110
I mean ideally next couple of red hearts

00:30:56.260 --> 00:31:00.669
we are going to go to this cursed room

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:03.870
and probably will up our damage penalty

00:31:00.669 --> 00:31:09.039
but you know sometimes the breaks kid

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:11.140
sure I think we effectively lost very

00:31:09.039 --> 00:31:16.690
little and we gained the slightest bit

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:21.659
of money out of it have I mentioned yet

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:21.659
how happy I am that we don't have to do

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:30.330
the well I might as well how happy I am

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:30.330
that we don't have to do the hush fight

00:31:30.419 --> 00:31:38.710
we might have been able to force it just

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:39.820
by going very very fast but we would

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:41.919
have taken a lot of damage in the

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:44.830
process and honestly six point eight

00:31:41.919 --> 00:31:47.770
five damage even with math avoid not

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:49.630
really the most compelling case to be

00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:50.710
excited to fight hush but we are going

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:52.419
to look for a deal with the devil and

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:57.640
then we're going to go on our merry way

00:31:52.419 --> 00:32:01.149
here we are able if we so chose to get

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:03.580
rid of the IV bag at this point but it

00:32:01.149 --> 00:32:06.820
would have to be for a good cause and to

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:10.149
be honest with you the pony is a good

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:11.710
cause as much as it's not really an

00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:14.200
amazing item

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:16.809
it makes us faster it has a useful

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:19.929
active effect and will cause us to get

00:32:16.809 --> 00:32:21.340
hit less often so plus it might amp up

00:32:19.929 --> 00:32:24.909
our ability to use mob the void

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:27.399
the other thing is IV bag is not going

00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:29.500
to give us I mean that was so dumb of me

00:32:27.399 --> 00:32:31.870
but IV bag is not going to give us much

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:33.970
in the way of other benefits we're

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:35.440
already at $0.99 we could probably

00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:38.440
continue to get some bonuses out of it

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:39.940
in a way I think I am opting out of

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:41.140
getting a high score on today's daily

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:44.370
because I'm sure the IV bag has

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:44.370
something to do with that but

00:32:46.779 --> 00:32:50.559
check for secret rooms

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:58.750
so is there a self-sacrifice rules is

00:32:56.890 --> 00:33:01.870
there a self-sacrifice room on this

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:03.820
floor no so we really really want there

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:14.470
to be a self-sacrifice room on the next

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:17.740
floor think what you do drop these do

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:20.020
this play it once we do on studfinder

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:23.320
but then come back use ace of spades

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:25.540
have six keys hey dude that was like 70

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:28.870
points I'm not too mad about it all

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:30.220
right but the problem is if there's no

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:31.720
self-sacrificing run this floor we've

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:35.200
already missed our window without even

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:37.900
knowing that our window existed ever

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:39.760
since that one fateful episode where I

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:42.010
said there's no self-sacrifice room well

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:45.250
standing like next to the self sacrifice

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:51.160
room I prefer to double check which I

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:53.980
did not really do just then but got a

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:55.260
peep it another good argument for the

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:56.680
[Music]

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:59.680
that's fine

00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:07.270
another good argument for IV bags that

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:11.860
we could open these mimics but I will

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:13.419
say don't pick that up yet the more red

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:16.950
hearts we have the better it is for

00:34:13.419 --> 00:34:16.950
self-sacrifice rooms

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:24.530
if that's HP that can be replenished so

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:27.220
we're not going to be a bookworm but

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:27.220
we're going to be close

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:31.460
not that with the limited amount of time

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.750
on the remainder of the run there's a

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:35.360
great chance that that comes to fruition

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:37.040
but still really just stop taking damage

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:39.320
you're taking like 30 hits we have no

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:41.210
reason to take certainly we want Satanic

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:45.530
Bible but I'd rather stick with a pony

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:48.590
for now and then in terms of in terms of

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:52.600
the mom's coin purse actually sort of

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:52.600
feel like why bother

00:34:53.560 --> 00:35:00.320
needless points sure there's a gulp pill

00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:02.090
I don't think we've had any other pills

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:09.380
that I was I mean I guess HP upgrade is

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:11.630
a good pill don't need that yet anyway

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:14.510
stop taking damage this is what the

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:16.630
reason I'm taking damage now more so is

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:18.970
because they just and it's a very

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:21.250
immature thing for me to point this out

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:24.140
having full knowledge of the fact that

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:26.300
you know I know what my my flaws are in

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:27.290
Isaac but not taking any effort to fix

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:29.990
them because that would actually require

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:32.690
work so Kirk's is so good for a self

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:35.000
sacrifice room though so what my problem

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:37.190
is is that when you're early on a run if

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.540
you got 6.5 damaged who cares you're

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:40.700
crushing enemies left right and center

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:42.980
right later you get into a run you got

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:45.340
6.85 damage you're expecting enemies to

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:47.240
die more quickly than they actually do

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:49.400
you're trying to make up the difference

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:51.380
with these mods avoid plays but it's not

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:54.500
always about science just crush that

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:56.540
enemy twice it's not always working out

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:59.150
as quickly as you'd like and you know

00:35:56.540 --> 00:36:02.990
all of a sudden you're kind of eaten

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:04.730
crap as a result that was close there

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:05.960
you might as well we shouldn't have

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:08.660
taken that yet but with perks it

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:11.240
shouldn't matter is the thing if there's

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:14.900
a self-sacrifice room via perks we can

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:17.590
get great value out of it so start with

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:17.590
the mom fight

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:26.670
Mobb the void being used mid-white Pony

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:37.800
is actually excellent that's not a

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:40.080
surprise to me I don't know do we really

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:42.930
we want lump of coal because there's a

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:44.850
self-sacrifice room we want ok this

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:48.920
regard but we would have wanted that

00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:48.920
because it would have given us more

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:53.370
damage for the land floor and we should

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:58.170
be fine on the land floor but you know

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:59.880
things things change dude didn't think

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:01.290
I'd lose yesterday's run either although

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:03.270
it's a little bit of a different story

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:05.910
because the opportunity to lose

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:10.430
yesterday's run always existed who's

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:10.430
never particularly out of control strong

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:21.450
shoopdawhoop I would probably take in a

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:22.950
heartbeat but it doesn't exist man I'm a

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:29.520
little nervous because we're running out

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:31.830
of self sacrificing potential addicted

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:43.920
the opposite there's no self sacrifice

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:48.840
room what's a boy to do I guess perks on

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:50.820
the way out then yeah so that's like a

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:52.320
super bummer we're gonna have no chance

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:53.850
of ranking in the high 40s I thought

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:55.200
when I saw the score sheet I was like

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:56.880
there's no doubt there will be a

00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:00.800
self-sacrifice room somewhere along the

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:02.430
along the path here that is a bummer uh

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:04.080
well crap

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:06.090
there wasn't one on the last floor right

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:07.440
maybe I maybe I brain farted I would

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:11.580
have come down one more floor anyway

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:12.810
though I like to try to push for the the

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:14.940
highest score possible in those

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:17.970
situations self set good place you will

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:22.580
know but you could give bookworm but

00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:25.740
bookworm is irrelevant at this point uh

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:28.740
sweets I guess we're done happy Mother's

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:30.480
Day mom 2:36 it's not bad I guess a lot

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:31.620
of people fell into the same trap I did

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.610
for now though thanks for watching hope
