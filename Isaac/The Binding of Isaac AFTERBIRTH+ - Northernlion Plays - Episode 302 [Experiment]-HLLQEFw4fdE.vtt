00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.510
everybody welcome back northernlion

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.549
can't be stopped

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.720
binding of issac an through the +5 wins

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.280
in a row that's probably the largest

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.530
streak that's ever been recorded in this

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.660
video game and we're about to extend it

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.740
look at that seven rate of fire four

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.199
point one three damage e to seven yeh DV

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.630
more like at the bottom there it's easy

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.359
which is how in Canada we say easy

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.710
because we don't say C we say said just

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:33.809
like that faith no more song it's easy

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:36.360
I'd like a Sunday Mon and I and I dare

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.730
not the Smerch the good name of Mike

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.340
Patton by trying to hit those high notes

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.469
because lord knows his four and a half

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.860
octave range has got me beaten by a

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.390
little bit this is an upper quartered a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.969
bunch this is maybe like by sixth or

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.949
seventh Isaac episode today I'm not

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.280
ashamed of that that's a good day as far

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.579
as I'm concerned this is the best of all

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.980
starts I think it's up there at the very

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.690
least I mean okay we can use poop here

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.939
to get us out of this look at that

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.640
farted them away a little bit bought

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.869
ourselves some time Smart Play but only

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.640
able to be smart because of the

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.140
incredible stats that we're starting

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.479
with you're great damage great rate of

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.830
fire eggheads a good item gives us a

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.270
spirit heart as well as you may have

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.020
noticed up there at the top sometimes I

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.049
forget about that but it's uh it's worth

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.479
mentioning egghead is like infamy the

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.000
better because it dodges some of the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.579
other damage or some of the conceivable

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.189
damage sources that infamy can't protect

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.479
you against like beams and explosions

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.130
maybe not beams I don't know because I

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.610
still don't have any idea how beam

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.159
damage is calculated but this is like a

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.229
very very very good start

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.320
I believe wishbone I mean you know what

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.460
I strive to learn something and and

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.549
added every available opportunity

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.280
because I'm unashamed of the fact that

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.750
you know life is never about thinking

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.430
you've got everything figured out it's

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.020
always about growing in whatever way you

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.030
can grow or using your laziness in a way

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.200
that is productive you know like hey

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.370
sometimes you don't want to learn

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.000
sometimes you just want to sit on the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.860
couch and play Mario Kart 8 the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.920
everything in moderation including

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.410
moderation right take our HP here so

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.420
what the whole preface that was their

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.530
premise of that I should say is that I'm

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.940
going to go look up what the wishbone

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.220
does I believe it gives you a payout

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:33.160
after you get hits a certain number of

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:34.510
times so to ship own Isaac taking damage

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.670
has a small chance to destroy the

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.860
trinket and spawn a random item pool

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.100
using the item pool of the current room

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.860
now that's interesting I was unfamiliar

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:50.160
with the specifics so the reason that

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.160
that gets my gears turning is because

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:58.750
hold on here your boys got a genius plan

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.630
first off the d1 is better than the poop

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:06.459
to begin with but your boy has a genius

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:10.930
plan drop this pick this up create

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:13.110
multiple wishbones he's a god there's a

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.850
God in our midst

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.830
what's the point of creating multiple

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:23.290
wishbones well hell I don't really know

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:27.400
except that now I could use these

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:30.730
multiple wishbones if I get hit enough

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.230
to create multiple items even though

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.540
it's only I don't know what what chance

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.660
of small chances but if we could get

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.730
like an IV bag or something like that

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.810
this could be sweet man I didn't even

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.580
think would work I thought it would just

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.519
create a random trinket which also could

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.440
have been fine but I almost feel like

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.019
I've got to follow this down the rabbit

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.910
hole of absurdity so we really want that

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.640
card to be temperance if that card is

00:03:51.910 --> 00:04:01.600
temperance then everything we've ever

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:03.770
wanted can come true on this floor it's

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:09.040
like the inverse

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:09.040
I'd be honest we don't need anymore

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.700
anymore wishbones if we were able to get

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.000
three to payout that would be like a

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.770
dream come true and one of these is

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.450
going to be a library because we have

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:24.050
another room that's a key base room

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.760
that's probably our shop let's take them

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.130
both who cares means that this is

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:32.140
probably our library over here I'm

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:34.430
trying to think like what can we get out

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.800
desperately seeking that temperance card

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.150
man you can't get anything to the best

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.490
of my knowledge out of the library

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:44.480
especially now that actually gives us

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.980
wellnot book of sin could have given us

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.000
a temperance card that's one way that we

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.320
could have made that happen

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.320
because what I need to do is find a

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.090
productive way to take damage and

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.790
preferably do so in an item room so like

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.500
an IV bag would do it the razor blade

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.120
would do it so maybe there's still an

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.830
off chance we could get that from our

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.660
deal with the devil and then we want to

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.850
at least get one wishbone to pay out and

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.170
take one with us even if we're leaving

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.390
one on the ground that's fine because we

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.730
get infinitely oh never mind I should

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.080
not be afraid at all we have no reason

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.550
to be afraid we can still infinitely

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.550
create wishbones for the rest of the

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:22.160
game yeah we're a god we can create

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:23.960
unlimited items I think and this is

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.510
going to be this is like some you know

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.030
dr. heckle and doesn't mr. jives sort of

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:32.420
situations going on here to quote the

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:38.600
men at work oh I should have dodged on

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:44.270
that one but we are a mad scientist of

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:46.400
trinket related proportions here all the

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.740
pieces have fit together right now

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.440
don't fire again don't fire again let's

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.770
go take it way too much damage on this

00:05:51.440 --> 00:06:00.410
fight but we got enough HP to persevere

00:05:53.770 --> 00:06:02.210
yes we Z's good and we should take that

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:07.160
I mean there's nothing wrong with i abou

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:08.840
Lyle here piercing shots in general very

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.440
good this might be the best piercing

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.440
shot as well

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:18.900
it incurs no like downgrades it's like

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.170
exclusively good stuff okay

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:26.280
keep this basically we have to decide

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:28.680
and I think let's try to get wishbone to

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.070
work dude I'm willing to give it a shot

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:36.300
in the name of science

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:38.510
okay so there's continuum grab another

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.920
wishbone what's the story wishbone

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.840
we should have rewrote the poop as well

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:46.830
that would have been exactly like the

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:51.060
same value as this but this is more

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.510
exciting you got to admit okay that's

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.310
enough

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.960
we take continuum I think we should feel

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.520
pretty good about it oh you know what

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:01.950
though there's another lovers card back

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:07.080
here great for our range you got to

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:12.210
admit I know you're saying this guy's

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:14.880
going to die you may well be correct but

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.470
I had to try can you blame me can you

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.870
really blame me for the attempt there I

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:21.870
don't think you can we had a chance to

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:24.570
make wishbone pop we still have that

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:26.250
chance as well we just need to I mean we

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.020
sacrifice a lot of spirit arts to get

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:32.880
continuum and I would argue that that's

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:36.450
probably not worth it but we still have

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:42.810
the chance because we have might as well

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:44.270
shoot them dude we have arcades in the

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:46.590
future I think the world's our oyster

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.990
wishbone combined with the d1 is a

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:50.460
combination that realistically we may

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:52.770
never see again or it might be quite

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:55.440
some time so I think we should be stoked

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:57.420
at the fact that we are coming up with

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.340
like a creative possibility here now

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.960
mind you we could get killed on the next

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:02.910
floor you know walk on some spikes get

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:08.190
hit by some enemies you're dead but

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:09.630
assuming we don't die well you know a

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:10.980
better way to phrase this what I was

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:14.880
going to phrase is you can't make an

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:17.190
omelet without breaking a few eggs which

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:22.070
is not necessarily true because you can

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:22.070
buy you know like egg whites

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:29.810
in a container already like pre-pre

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.880
broken for you and you might say well

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:34.040
that means you know somebody broke the

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.170
eggs you're not wrong but the expression

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:38.750
isn't you can't make an omelet without a

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:40.040
few bad eggs being broken it's you can't

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:43.010
make an omelet without breaking a few

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.980
anyway disregard I'm getting the point

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:47.630
is not to be pedantic here the point is

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:51.800
you got to take risks to get rewards

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:53.060
sometimes often times so I don't feel

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.100
bad about this at all

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.360
now maybe we should be doubling which

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.790
bone but I'm really thinking that the

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:03.700
opportune or the most opportune wishbone

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:05.960
moment for doubling is an arcade

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.670
especially if we can get all the dude if

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:11.060
we can get like something that gives us

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:12.200
red hearts more frequently I'm trying to

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.460
think what that would be maybe gimpy is

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.330
a good option here cuz it can't be a

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.580
trinket because it would replace

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:18.650
wishbone unless we had mom's purse or

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.750
you know belly button and now you're

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:24.560
seeing why I'm avoiding going down the

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:26.210
rabbit hole too much yet but that will

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:30.320
listen pick them both up we're ready to

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:32.030
move on from that and then like nun's

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:36.050
habit we could get like unlimited

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:38.710
wishbones and then the wishbones payout

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:41.960
assuming they will pay out on occasional

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:43.760
blood bank plays like I really I see the

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.370
world unfolding now there's a few

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:50.110
different ways in Isaac to get unlimited

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:50.110
items over the course of a single run

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:58.580
like restock double Steam sale is one of

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:02.590
the most common I'd say or one of the

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:02.590
easiest to conceive of at the very least

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:08.150
extra deal with the devil chance at

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:09.620
least but this might be a sort of novel

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.850
and unique one and ensure it's going to

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.880
it seems like it's going to be a little

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:15.380
bit more finicky than then restocked

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.540
double Steam sale but it also doesn't

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:20.990
require you know restock and double

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:24.140
Steam sale to exist so there's a pretty

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:26.660
big advantage on that front

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.070
I mean you could double battery charges

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.960
endlessly here and make a bunch of

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.490
wishbones but that is fairly unlikely to

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.950
be relevant I'd rather just pop that and

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:35.390
see if we get value which we did not I'm

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:37.160
going to do the big room here and it

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:39.230
scares me because we get hit by two

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:43.520
champions or one particular champion we

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:45.080
could die and we could above all else

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.970
maybe just compromise our deal with the

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:51.230
devil chance which would be of course

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:53.000
very suboptimal but I want to get one

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.290
more penny we had four cents when we

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.030
came down to this floor we got four

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:58.520
cents now what's wrong with this picture

00:10:56.030 --> 00:11:04.100
one cent short of being able to make the

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:05.510
the dream work on our arcade on the next

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.040
floor and we're one cent short of being

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:09.050
able to make an arcade on the next floor

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.860
so you know I don't want to rely on a

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:15.230
temperance card that's low percentage I

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:17.990
want to rely on human ingenuity which is

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:20.840
what we're doing right now and it's

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:24.550
worked out okay thus far I mean we got

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:26.890
continuum out of it not a bad item but

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:32.750
trying to get a little bit more

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:36.500
bombastic with it nothing do that's what

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:37.730
have a negative luck will do for you we

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:43.120
should have blown up our donation

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:43.120
machine with our one bomb sad but true

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:49.100
okay well fight the boss hope that it's

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:50.210
not a nasty boss but honestly damage and

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:53.620
tears are in a pretty good spot

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.620
that's a nasty boss dude

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:08.210
good job so far good job so far how do

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:11.810
you make this work no when the when the

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:15.680
Saints are coming marching in buddy if

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:16.910
you can be standing nicely it doesn't

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:20.170
matter forget to deal with the devil you

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:24.080
live that's him you still got the deal

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:28.790
my god the absolute madman I never would

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:31.730
have expected that not the best deal in

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:33.649
my life but still can't double up on

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:38.540
keys dudes come on one penny one penny

00:12:33.649 --> 00:12:41.899
you got me you got me they've done it

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:43.339
this is our dream please God give me an

00:12:41.899 --> 00:12:45.440
arcade on the next floor I'm telling you

00:12:43.339 --> 00:12:46.910
we can actually make it work here let's

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.649
go to our curse room first there another

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:50.300
red hard as another red hard chill in

00:12:48.649 --> 00:12:51.740
here I'm not worried about boss rush I'm

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:55.100
worried about making this wishbone d1

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:56.839
combo work and I believe the power is

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.610
within us I'm young in a while that I

00:12:56.839 --> 00:13:01.130
want to be free I've got the magic power

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:02.810
the music in me let's do this black

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:08.150
candle great item gives us some deal

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:09.650
with the devil protection and go back

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:11.300
and pick up this red heart plus I mean

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:12.800
immunity to curses and we don't who

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.890
cares about that red heart we'll figure

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:21.290
it out on the next floor that's our

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:25.400
secret room in all likelihood okay

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:26.930
five cents great time to get a blood

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:30.260
bank well it's not like I like you or

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:35.870
anything and we can use double keys here

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:37.339
and we will use that it's you know it's

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:39.770
going to suck up charges that we would

00:13:37.339 --> 00:13:41.900
want to use for our wishbone but if

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:43.640
every four rooms were getting 10 cents I

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:46.990
mean that could buy us a lot of battery

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:51.680
charges as well so I don't think we're

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:55.990
missing out too heavily here no consumer

00:13:51.680 --> 00:14:01.640
will drop and it's an extremely fast

00:13:55.990 --> 00:14:02.779
boss fight here which we really to be

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.670
honest with you have crushed here

00:14:02.779 --> 00:14:07.610
largely as a result of SAC dagger but

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:10.399
like man that was it's a record time

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:12.350
no deal with the devil but an HP upgrade

00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:17.000
very valuable in case we end up coming

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:21.769
across a blood bank just gives us that

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:24.470
much more tolerance we'll continue to

00:14:21.769 --> 00:14:26.260
create new dimes could conceivably leave

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:28.730
this floor with 60 or 70 cents I think

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:31.870
more money than you typically need over

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:31.870
the course of an entire run

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:45.170
but this floor is not about getting 60

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:46.040
or 70 cents this floor is about sending

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:49.100
a message

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:54.920
no it's about not being Heath Ledger's

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:56.720
Joker but rather being a different Heath

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.990
Ledger character like maybe Heath Ledger

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:02.240
in Brokeback Mountain be maybe being a

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:03.920
grown man exploring some unfamiliar

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.990
feelings for the first time like for

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:09.260
example what does it feel like to make

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:11.029
v1 wishbone give you unlimited items we

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.620
actually know that think about it we

00:15:11.029 --> 00:15:16.190
have to be more careful than I expected

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:17.779
because if we lose wishbone like if it

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.010
just pops we never get a chance to

00:15:17.779 --> 00:15:22.600
double it so you know what would be

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:25.209
sensible is to drop the wishbone and

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:28.779
then double it up just so we have one

00:15:25.209 --> 00:15:28.779
just so we got one

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:36.240
[Music]

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.860
that turned out amazingly we egghead

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.240
caused us to not get hit when we left

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:41.040
that curse room which is incredible and

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:45.690
then I squandered in mere seconds later

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:47.520
but that's all right the wishbone

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.750
doubling even if it doesn't work out on

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.720
this floor it's just a nice like

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:54.000
precautionary measure

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.770
there's our shop we can see it might be

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.620
a good floor to fight greed honestly

00:15:55.770 --> 00:16:02.340
just so we have more opportunity to get

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:04.110
money grab the stopwatch which is good

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:05.880
it's also a speed upgrade which I had no

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:09.810
idea about

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:13.140
we should buy humbling bundles

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:16.040
it won't double bombs or sorry won't

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:19.110
double dime this is what I meant to say

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:22.830
it will double bombs we should like

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:25.740
leave all consumables on the ground once

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:29.370
we get to that point at least all

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:31.560
consumables that well our money for the

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:35.820
lack of a better term here we're still

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:40.220
holding out hope boss rush say goodbye I

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:45.360
don't care however what does matter is a

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:47.460
blood bank although we've got limited

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.130
chance to double-wishbone more times I

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:51.090
suppose we at least have one spare one

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:52.320
stored up here of course you've still

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:53.940
got our item room as well

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.640
I haven't even been paying attention how

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:59.460
does this run look I'm so I'm singularly

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:03.020
like dr. Frankenstein in on this dream

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:06.000
of making this stupid combination work

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:09.030
but I know in my heart it can be done I

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.089
don't this is film director who are the

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:15.800
hearts ugh I'll do that's a nice damage

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:15.800
increase don't get me wrong

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:24.600
three spirit hearts instead of two let's

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:28.230
just go see if we got the dream here if

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:30.380
we do we do if we don't we don't life's

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:35.960
going to go on either way yeah

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:37.430
exactly all right so what comes next we

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.020
pick up all the money I maybe we could

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.590
double it maybe get some 99 cents I

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.240
don't care

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.770
46 cents is enough for the rest of the

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:44.330
run I'm not worried about our donation

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:46.790
machine I'm not worried about anything

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:48.650
with respect to that just making this

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:52.600
floor pop is fine and yeah I said we

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:54.650
shouldn't pick up anything until the

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:56.840
until we pick up humbling bundle it

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:58.580
doesn't matter we're we're going to have

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.860
enough money regardless because of this

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:02.900
don't lose sight of the fact the goal is

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:05.810
not to get as much money as possible the

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:12.650
goal is to get enough money to do

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:13.520
whatever you want to do chaos there we

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:19.670
go now we're getting into some

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:21.680
interesting stuff I use that pill I hit

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:25.910
the Q key lockdown he tried to save me

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:27.530
and I didn't let it Empress at the car

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:31.550
the counter just blow it up see what you

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:37.000
get PhD I don't really care what do we

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:39.590
get here Pandora's box on the caves - I

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.150
guess well it will get 15 cents right

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:42.560
cos there's a penny back here oh we

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:45.440
don't have any bombs which to access the

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:46.130
penny so now nevermind we're good unless

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:49.910
wait a minute

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:52.760
let me try I thought maybe you would

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:54.050
overfill an area and then give us it

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.250
would put it in an area we didn't have

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.760
to use a bomb to get to but anyway I

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:58.220
digress

00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:03.050
the dream remains although it's is

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:07.310
taking a sweet time getting there we're

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:11.290
still in a wonderful spot right now and

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:15.380
we got lots of lots of future potential

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:17.690
but admittedly are we go to I might be

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:19.190
losing like actually losing my mind from

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:22.160
an Isaac related sense here just from

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:24.530
playing a lot today it looked to me like

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:26.750
we went from 17 to 25 cents in a single

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:29.960
pickup but that might be like a ghost

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:32.680
memory or something like that I almost

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:35.390
had that one I believe

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.650
nice double puberty pill dude nothing

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:38.750
wrong with that we could have actually

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:40.130
with a little bit more foresight created

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:41.630
an HP upgrade out of nothing at all

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:45.040
there but it's we'll just rely on

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:45.040
another one showing up in the future

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:51.560
all right careful with the damage taken

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:53.600
because we're still waiting I know we

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:55.520
haven't seen wishbone pay out twice yet

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:58.330
you know it's kind of seems like we

00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:00.320
broke wishbone with our actions but I

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:05.890
don't believe that's the case

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:05.890
we got to create our our copy wishbone

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:10.540
just in case things go terribly wrong

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:16.040
the gods just pop it nothing wrong with

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.020
that

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:25.280
dice shard great the hold for re-roll

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:29.900
potential I'm telling you enough HP plus

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:30.680
blood bank plus wishbone plus d1 as all

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:33.410
we need

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:35.000
I'm not saying unlimited items we've got

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:37.910
chaos to go along with it that's like a

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.190
sink I personally guarantee guppy I'll

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:42.710
call it right now if elected I

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:44.300
personally guarantee duck but we need to

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:45.830
get a blood bank and we need to work

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:50.330
together to do that I don't know what

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:52.640
I'm talking about anymore it's a fun run

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:56.450
regardless and getting continuum for

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:59.840
free is an aberration that we should be

00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:01.880
happy with but technically we could

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.020
double the dice shard right now and if

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.880
we're not doing anything else with it

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:09.040
seems like a fairly appropriate use of

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:13.420
our resources to be honest with you

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.420
nothing wrong with the second dice shard

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:18.700
especially when we got more than enough

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:20.870
pretty much every other resource for now

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:22.100
it's one of those rare situations in

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:23.600
which I'm very happy we weren't doing

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:27.950
more damage because I definitely would

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:29.060
have exploded that bomb in my face you

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:30.290
know what leave it leave it for now

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:31.970
because you could double dice shard

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.570
again and maybe get one extra reroll on

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:34.130
this floor

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:36.230
or one for the next floor for that

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:39.440
matter if you end up needing it shop

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:40.970
should be up here feels like a secret

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:44.860
room like that's a common secret room

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:44.860
location but not this time

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:52.500
Jerez also grab we could yera the dice

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:57.030
chard oh that was just terrible damage

00:21:52.500 --> 00:22:02.490
on my part for now let's create a double

00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:03.450
D era room you can use the d1 on Europe

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:05.460
it makes sense

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:08.340
you can't yell Yara I'm a little

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:12.809
surprised you can't be one a year as oh

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:14.490
that's less abusable I think and even if

00:22:12.809 --> 00:22:16.380
it is abusable there's so many ways to

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:24.390
get unlimited consumables like who cares

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:28.470
dude but by the spirit heart be smart

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:35.419
grab this flow this guy up thank you for

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:35.419
the money we're not gonna

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:41.889
it really comes down to do we prefer to

00:22:40.179 --> 00:22:44.200
have dice charta to be preferred a viera

00:22:41.889 --> 00:22:46.389
I think I prefer to have Viera it's more

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.559
comfortable it's like a snug hoodie or

00:22:46.389 --> 00:22:49.019
something like that you know we're not

00:22:47.559 --> 00:22:52.720
trying to impress anybody with

00:22:49.019 --> 00:22:58.389
magnanimous plays I'll take a look

00:22:52.720 --> 00:23:00.129
upgrade back up over zero now and the

00:22:58.389 --> 00:23:02.259
arrow rune allows us to get that sword

00:23:00.129 --> 00:23:03.940
value later for doubling and I don't

00:23:02.259 --> 00:23:05.499
know maybe there will come a time when

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:07.539
we want to use it to double the wishbone

00:23:05.499 --> 00:23:08.919
maybe we've almost popped wishbone

00:23:07.539 --> 00:23:13.599
potentially I don't know there's no way

00:23:08.919 --> 00:23:14.859
for us to know that but and we want to

00:23:13.599 --> 00:23:16.479
double it but we don't have a charge or

00:23:14.859 --> 00:23:17.710
something that could come in handy but

00:23:16.479 --> 00:23:19.239
probably we'll just save it for the

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:24.070
chest and you know probably that's

00:23:19.239 --> 00:23:26.979
completely fine okay this is very very

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:27.999
good goat heads awesome and so is Tami's

00:23:26.979 --> 00:23:29.409
head but we're not going to take it

00:23:27.999 --> 00:23:35.289
because we need to be one to make the

00:23:29.409 --> 00:23:36.580
dream work here left some money behind

00:23:35.289 --> 00:23:37.539
which was very silly but we're heading

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:38.649
down to the next floor I should have

00:23:37.539 --> 00:23:40.269
taken the compass so I would have known

00:23:38.649 --> 00:23:42.129
if we had an arcade but we already have

00:23:40.269 --> 00:23:43.989
an arcade so here's how you do this I

00:23:42.129 --> 00:23:46.210
this is what I've been waiting for it's

00:23:43.989 --> 00:23:47.979
time for this moment to shine through so

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:51.129
you drop everything

00:23:47.979 --> 00:23:54.869
pick up Yara double-wishbone grab

00:23:51.129 --> 00:23:58.919
wishbone come in here now give me IV bag

00:23:54.869 --> 00:24:00.909
hopefully IV bag can pop wishbone

00:23:58.919 --> 00:24:02.320
hopefully the blood bank and pop

00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:05.049
wishbone because if not we're going to

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:08.080
be here for quite some time dude egghead

00:24:05.049 --> 00:24:12.549
has given us so many free plays thanks

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:14.590
for your help okay we got IV bag that's

00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:16.779
what we asked for it we do still want

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:20.590
the d1 for more doublings but this is

00:24:16.779 --> 00:24:22.419
fine for now we got in theory we have

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:27.399
the tools that's also a puberty pickup

00:24:22.419 --> 00:24:30.369
right there and it really is just in

00:24:27.399 --> 00:24:33.509
theory because I don't know if itself if

00:24:30.369 --> 00:24:35.889
productive damage can actually give you

00:24:33.509 --> 00:24:38.700
the wishbone pop because how did we get

00:24:35.889 --> 00:24:41.619
the wishbone to pop before it was on

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:43.029
also walking into fires we haven't added

00:24:41.619 --> 00:24:45.489
pop since it's almost like there's a

00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:46.330
flag in the game like has wishbone paid

00:24:45.489 --> 00:24:48.429
out true-false

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:51.419
and we've flipped it to true and it is

00:24:48.429 --> 00:24:51.419
not paid out cents

00:24:52.760 --> 00:25:01.710
there's our HP to the adult

00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:06.080
transformation just looking to get as

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:09.740
many wishbones as possible

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:12.720
it really can only work on this floor

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:15.480
because we can't take the d1 and the IV

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:17.250
bag down with us so like if this plan is

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:19.460
actually going to work we got to do it

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:19.460
right now

00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:26.490
so we're going to oh wait we need to do

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:29.780
one charge first so you grab the d1 come

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:31.980
back here what's the story wishbone

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:32.909
crank on that wouldn't be the worst

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:36.480
thing in the world if we got like

00:25:32.909 --> 00:25:38.400
battery charges there as well and then

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:41.789
just go about your business on this

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:44.370
floor for a second oh we didn't get hurt

00:25:41.789 --> 00:25:47.309
thanks to IV bag so instead we got hurt

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:54.030
when we walk into the room guess it

00:25:47.309 --> 00:25:57.240
could be worse but okay still you got to

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:59.880
admit it's looking unlikely that this

00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:04.140
plan is going to be as excellent as I

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:06.480
hoped it would but there is a chance

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:09.570
that it all works out and if it does

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:10.919
we're going to be laughing not

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:13.650
necessarily because it's going to make

00:26:10.919 --> 00:26:16.080
the run that good but because it's going

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:20.090
to be just ridiculous what a roundabout

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:20.090
way to create like a few extra items

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:27.570
right I'm starting to feel more like the

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:29.940
mad portion of mad scientist's right now

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:32.460
in all likelihood we probably are not

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:37.140
going to need this many wishbones back

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:38.760
here just give me some red hearts

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:40.200
student got point zero six lock don't

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.620
patronize me I know we got red hearts

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:45.990
coming that's slightly above zero luck

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:47.610
full help we've already seen full health

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:49.919
so I don't think that could have been in

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:53.090
unless it was bad trip but then it would

00:26:49.919 --> 00:26:53.090
have taken a spirit heart anyway so

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:59.220
alright no no this is like the run is

00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:01.830
good it's slow but it's slow by my own

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:03.930
doing and that's fine I would say now

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:06.390
don't worry about doubling wishbone

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:08.580
if anything for creating new wishbones

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:14.240
if anything worried about creating more

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:16.860
red hearts which actually I mean free

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:18.540
it's not impossible that we die we got a

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:31.530
lot of HP but like none of it is filled

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:35.160
right now so temperance has value vocal

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:38.970
bombs does nothing you can't get over to

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:42.690
that tinted rocks sadly I don't know

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:47.010
dude I'm feeling bitter like my dream

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:49.560
has come apart here in my hands ooh what

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:54.960
about a second secret room that's chock

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:56.310
full of red hearts or a single black

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.530
heart for that matter which we probably

00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:59.850
should have doubled just wanted to see I

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:00.840
mean I was looking for a secret room

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:07.020
there but that could have also been a

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:10.430
card so I worked oh I didn't work I

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:13.620
hoped so hard that we would make this

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:15.480
very strange permutation come to

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:17.720
fruition here and it it did but it

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:20.760
didn't do so in a way that I was hoping

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:22.740
so your old red hearts man it's like the

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:25.410
most common consumable by a factor of

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:28.230
10,000 and they just didn't show up at

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:29.940
all on this floor we got three wishbones

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:32.910
just sitting there with their thumbs up

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:34.490
their butts waiting for waiting for

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:37.800
something

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:42.330
not a bad bomb necessarily but not a

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:44.010
good one either not expecting huge

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:46.310
payouts here but dude that's a good

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:46.310
start

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:54.250
come on just full help that's all I ask

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.990
we do too pretty fly also great

00:28:54.250 --> 00:29:00.880
especially because our HP is like

00:28:55.990 --> 00:29:05.530
somewhat in question more keys not

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:09.430
useless probably there we go full red

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:16.270
hearts I'm saving my charges for now we

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:19.030
should I mean we really have to give

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:21.220
this the old college try so you know

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:24.010
what we're actually going to do because

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:25.420
I am the world's dumbest genius is we're

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:27.790
going to come back here we're going to

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:29.670
posit the era room because we're going

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:32.290
to use it to double our temperance card

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:34.750
so we better not make ourselves

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:36.880
backtrack too often I will fully admit

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:39.390
there's almost no chance that this ends

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:43.540
up giving me what I want it to give me

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:47.670
which is unlimited power although it

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:52.080
will be pretty swell so with this pill

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:54.460
for friends till the end could be better

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:57.930
let's donate a little bit cuz that we

00:29:54.460 --> 00:30:00.520
might be able to crank up our luck stat

00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:01.930
which would be useful for the gambling

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.340
purposes here we might need some clutch

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:06.580
blood bags or something just to keep the

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:08.080
game going but in case you're like

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:10.120
completely in the dark about what I'm

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:14.470
trying to do here that's fair because

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:19.990
it's a stupid idea what I am trying to

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:23.530
do is use IV bag and temperance cards to

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:26.500
give me enough damage to use these

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:30.100
wishbones to pop to give me a random

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:31.930
item to help me steamroll the game but

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:33.160
mostly it's just like a pride thing at

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:36.340
this point that I've come up with this

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:38.620
bizarre science experiment so it's going

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:46.150
to Yara the the wishbones of a dozen

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:47.470
actually yeah the purpose was to get

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:49.510
these to pop and we're picking all the

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:51.750
stuff up cause we need luck wherever

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:56.850
possible

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:58.769
if we don't have lucky pennies will not

00:30:56.850 --> 00:31:01.169
be full so we'll know what they are

00:30:58.769 --> 00:31:02.549
oh that's bad play well it doesn't

00:31:01.169 --> 00:31:05.309
really matter I was gonna say like

00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:08.309
egghead will occasionally cause us not

00:31:05.309 --> 00:31:10.830
to take damage when we use IV bag but

00:31:08.309 --> 00:31:14.309
it's not really worth being finicky with

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:20.759
I think it's a great time for blood bag

00:31:14.309 --> 00:31:24.919
to show up dang I'm starting to come to

00:31:20.759 --> 00:31:28.649
the conclusion it just might not work

00:31:24.919 --> 00:31:33.019
like we're in just idiotic min/max

00:31:28.649 --> 00:31:35.639
territory now but I think that maybe

00:31:33.019 --> 00:31:38.899
considering the amount of self damage

00:31:35.639 --> 00:31:44.669
we've taken it's just not conceivable

00:31:38.899 --> 00:31:47.399
that you can get that you can get

00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:50.129
wishbone to pop on IV bag damage it

00:31:47.399 --> 00:31:51.809
seems like that does not work and we're

00:31:50.129 --> 00:31:54.419
building a large sample size that would

00:31:51.809 --> 00:31:57.379
seem to predict it so I'm about ready to

00:31:54.419 --> 00:31:59.669
give up on this experiment unfortunately

00:31:57.379 --> 00:32:01.710
three of the same pill and their luck

00:31:59.669 --> 00:32:03.179
downs and then a1 makes you larger so

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:07.350
wasn't really what we were looking for

00:32:03.179 --> 00:32:09.149
from being honest with you uh we don't

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:10.919
really want to take IV bag with us if it

00:32:09.149 --> 00:32:14.399
doesn't work so with like the plan is

00:32:10.919 --> 00:32:17.570
starting to unravel here the final step

00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:20.009
of it is really I mean we could play the

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:23.909
fortune teller while there the slot

00:32:20.009 --> 00:32:27.360
machine in the the three skull mathy a

00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:28.679
little bit more but kind of starting to

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.960
approach the point in which I don't

00:32:28.679 --> 00:32:33.600
think that that's necessarily a huge get

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:36.120
because the thing is we're working a lot

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:39.330
for a run that with full HP is probably

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:41.009
a win we're going to get you know we got

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:43.289
a lot of HP and we've got deals with a

00:32:41.009 --> 00:32:47.309
devil guaranteed that's usually a smart

00:32:43.289 --> 00:32:53.009
enough combo to get fairly easy wins you

00:32:47.309 --> 00:32:54.779
know you just get damage from from those

00:32:53.009 --> 00:32:58.679
guaranteed deals with devil in it solves

00:32:54.779 --> 00:33:00.509
all your problems I guess I owe it one

00:32:58.679 --> 00:33:05.779
more chance plus the odds of getting

00:33:00.509 --> 00:33:05.779
blood bag are like high there we go

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:21.040
worst-case scenario we got a chance to

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:28.740
get luck upgrades but I think we got to

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:35.170
call it like like now since kitten

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:37.600
wishbone why will you pop whatever I

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:40.210
came up with what I thought was a great

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:43.510
strategy instead I look like a freaking

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:45.850
idiot but you know what that's science

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:47.170
baby we tried we got two blood bags out

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:49.540
of that there's nothing to sneeze that

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:51.280
there and now we can just you know that

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:52.990
was like our holiday before we start

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:55.390
freshman year at college or something we

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:58.390
got all the senioritis out time to get

00:33:55.390 --> 00:34:00.190
back to work let's go

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:04.810
because everyone knows freshman year at

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:07.180
college is when you do a lot of work the

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:11.920
busiest of all college use dude Thank

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:12.970
You ed head take the polaroid in here

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:17.830
yeah let's go

00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:20.230
I forgot actually that we have what do

00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:23.140
we care about spirit hearts here I

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:27.730
forgot that we have chaos which means

00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:28.990
that we're not going to necessarily love

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:34.300
our deals with the devil

00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:37.300
I do love my vocal sample whenever I get

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:40.540
hit though it's an excel floor so a lot

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:42.870
of big rooms for not being an excel

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:42.870
floor

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:49.549
just one needs to die there we go

00:34:50.779 --> 00:35:00.599
tough room

00:34:52.200 --> 00:35:02.700
tough room difficult audience I am a

00:35:00.599 --> 00:35:04.349
little I wouldn't say bummed like I feel

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:08.190
no emotion about the fact that this

00:35:04.349 --> 00:35:11.010
didn't work out I'm happy we we saw a

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:15.539
plan and I still feel like the logic of

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:21.000
the plan is not necessarily flawed that

00:35:15.539 --> 00:35:23.190
was the same pill unfortunately the

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.109
execution is not possible or not doable

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:26.700
and I think there's two conceivable

00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:29.039
explanations that I can bring up for

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:30.750
when I get published by you know nature

00:35:29.039 --> 00:35:32.010
in the scientific journal for why this

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:34.529
experiment didn't work the way we

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:37.230
expected the first one would be that

00:35:34.529 --> 00:35:39.390
only one wishbone per run possibly is

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:41.579
able to be popped and it seems like that

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:43.079
sow things are working right now I'm

00:35:41.579 --> 00:35:44.250
willing to give it a try for the

00:35:43.079 --> 00:35:46.230
remainder of the run which is why I'm

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:49.410
not going to take the locus trinket

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:53.039
despite it being superior nice good good

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:54.869
damage but it's possible that maybe you

00:35:53.039 --> 00:35:56.460
can only have one wishbone pop per run

00:35:54.869 --> 00:35:58.529
it triggers a flag in the game and then

00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:02.160
says all right whether intentionally or

00:35:58.529 --> 00:36:04.559
you know erroneously they have created

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:07.079
an internal rule that prevents wishbone

00:36:04.559 --> 00:36:08.759
from being popped more than once maybe

00:36:07.079 --> 00:36:12.289
maybe not that's just one potential

00:36:08.759 --> 00:36:14.519
hypothesis another one is that wishbone

00:36:12.289 --> 00:36:16.019
fly if there's three wishbone gets a

00:36:14.519 --> 00:36:19.200
lower chance to pop for each subsequent

00:36:16.019 --> 00:36:21.000
one maybe so maybe we're dealing with

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:24.119
like a 1% chance every time we get hit

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.950
and then maybe it just refuses to pop on

00:36:24.119 --> 00:36:29.180
self damage so for all the damage we've

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:31.829
taken much of it was self-inflicted

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:35.369
perhaps self-inflicted damage gives no

00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:36.900
percent chance to have wishbone pop at

00:36:35.369 --> 00:36:40.289
least self-inflicted damage from things

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:41.670
like IV bag and blood bag because we did

00:36:40.289 --> 00:36:43.799
obviously damage that we've taken

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:47.839
ourselves did get wishbone to pop on

00:36:43.799 --> 00:36:47.839
those fires on the second floor

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:54.380
so now that I've discussed that

00:36:52.119 --> 00:36:58.400
analytical approach in the most boring

00:36:54.380 --> 00:37:01.310
manner conceivable on youtube.com let's

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:03.800
proceed with our run to a heuristic

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:11.600
analysis of where we stand in the run is

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:13.400
is probably about average right now but

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:15.650
it stands a chance to get weirder than

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:16.940
average thanks to chaos like I don't

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:18.800
remember where we are from spun

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:20.869
perspective I have basically no concept

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:22.250
of what our items are like except for

00:37:20.869 --> 00:37:23.690
the fact we have continuum and piercing

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:25.130
shots and eight inch nails like those

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:27.530
are the big ones and go ahead and of

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:29.720
course chaos which is the oh I forgot

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:33.050
that it makes a spread when it lands

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:34.670
chaos which is the the weird one keeping

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:38.660
things in a very strange position right

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:42.170
now it feels that we fight mr. Fred

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:48.320
almost never now so we're hoping for

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:49.730
something good here and I would say both

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:52.220
of them are worth taking

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:56.020
honestly sack of sacks and The MITRE and

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:59.540
I sort of feel like should use the nail

00:37:56.020 --> 00:38:01.130
at least like this battery charges back

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:07.580
here that we can pick up and take

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:10.760
advantage of the d1 is good on the chest

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:11.990
though so let's roll with that we're

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:14.270
going to make it to the chest I mean

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:15.590
it's it's very conceivable that we'll

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:16.970
have a pretty easy time winning this

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:19.880
round as we coming closer into the end

00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:24.859
here but as far as I'm concerned the

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:26.840
game owes us like maybe five items I'm

00:38:24.859 --> 00:38:30.700
not saying they have to be greatest

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:33.800
items of all time but for all that we

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:35.859
sacrifice mostly you know my life force

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:38.000
by putting an extra 15 minutes into the

00:38:35.859 --> 00:38:41.630
Necropolis - that didn't have to exist

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:44.600
they always a little bit will we get any

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:46.490
of that in return is possible it's

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:49.040
possible to tell me to eff off you know

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:52.119
one of the two conceivably is probably

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:54.650
the most likely of all possible outcomes

00:38:52.119 --> 00:38:57.650
happy got these collars a good item and

00:38:54.650 --> 00:39:00.560
we'll probably just at this point will

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:02.240
abstain from demon judgment because you

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:04.550
take it enough

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:08.300
read hard damaged for one lifetime I

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:09.950
think possibly a secret room a little

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:12.410
bit of a low percentage chance

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:14.300
guppies collar is really at this point

00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:15.980
the gappi dream could happen anywhere

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:18.200
and that would be nice but I'm more

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:22.130
thinking about the possibility that will

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:23.540
die and require a respawn so I'm quite

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:25.130
content to pick that up honestly

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:31.760
especially considering that it costs us

00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:33.830
effectively zero and trading our very

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:36.200
hard-earned keys for resources that

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:39.050
provide us with almost no value you know

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:42.050
what we could use like full stop not

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:48.260
that special but important the ability

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:52.400
to fly I'm feeling like fast but not

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:54.140
that wheel be like I'm unknowable to a

00:39:52.400 --> 00:40:00.280
mild extent that feels like a secret

00:39:54.140 --> 00:40:07.700
room and more money none of which is a

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:09.440
Lucky Penny sadly in a way I guess I'm

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:11.390
glad that it didn't make breaking the

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:12.680
game possible with this because it means

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:14.330
that if I ever get saddled with this

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:15.619
combination on it while saddled sounds

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:18.590
like a bad thing it actually is a good

00:40:15.619 --> 00:40:21.940
combination but if I ever get this combo

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:27.700
on a daily I'm under like no obligation

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:30.380
to to try to make that ridiculously

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:34.310
roundabout like dupe item duplication

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:36.170
thing actually works so in a way it's

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:42.619
kind of you know short-term pain

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:44.330
long-term little less suffering I can't

00:40:42.619 --> 00:40:47.960
even I'm looking for like something to a

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:51.040
double high well we get that we could if

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.040
we wanted to double keys

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:57.370
we don't have got these tails so it's

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:58.870
unlikely we'll ever need 21 keys but I

00:40:57.370 --> 00:41:06.700
suppose it's better than you you know

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:09.040
doing nothing with our charge it really

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:11.860
feels like we're doing more than 7.5

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:13.840
damage like our tears if you would you'd

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:15.700
show me this without a stat screen I'd

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:18.430
be like oh dude you're doing like 12

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:21.720
damage easy and I guess our shots that

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:25.300
travel through mom actually are but

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:27.220
they're doing like 15 when they land it

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:29.110
could use a little more though so you

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:34.120
can get unlimited bombs I guess they're

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:41.530
I don't care about like bookworm just

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:46.840
work with me all right you know what we

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:49.510
out I'm worried that the catastrophic

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:51.550
loss of morale here is going to going to

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:53.350
cause me to lose focus and possibly even

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:56.610
lose the run it hasn't been a very

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:59.680
successful chaos if I'm being honest

00:41:56.610 --> 00:42:02.440
chaos goat head has resulted in us not

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:04.630
really getting incredible items and I'm

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:07.180
kind of waiting on you know The MITRE

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:09.040
and sack of sacks to give us more value

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:12.610
as well but it has not happened as of

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:17.350
yet I mean you probably want to do that

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:19.270
room but I sort of like find out hard to

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:21.580
get excited about fighting a lot of

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:24.690
enemies for potentially minimal gain

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:26.710
this was extremely lucky by the way

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:29.110
finding the boss room this quickly

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:30.670
especially after choosing not to go to

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:36.700
one of these rooms is a bit of a

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:38.770
surprise double two of clubs but also

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:41.050
strikes me as a fairly who-cares sort of

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:44.350
moment you know who cares we have 82

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:47.070
bombs versus 99 functionally pretty much

00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:47.070
exactly the same

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:59.869
tell you what throw this bomb down here

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:01.730
if nothing else it looks like we're

00:42:59.869 --> 00:43:03.770
going to leave this floor having a good

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:06.819
track record out on the Cathedral never

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:11.000
took damage knock on wood

00:43:06.819 --> 00:43:14.210
Isaac's like 95% dead and you know so is

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.710
my childlike wonder after my amazing

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:17.660
probably the smartest plan that's ever

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:19.130
existed in video game history failed I

00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:20.329
mean I'm not bitter or anything it's

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:21.710
like you can do it you can design your

00:43:20.329 --> 00:43:24.289
game ever you want to it's not like I'm

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:26.049
insulted or anything like that about the

00:43:24.289 --> 00:43:32.270
outcome of things it's just so you know

00:43:26.049 --> 00:43:34.880
not petty we should just first up if

00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:39.099
it's a bad pill you got to take it which

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:43.460
was kind of stupid of me like

00:43:39.099 --> 00:43:45.349
hematemesis in particular okay here's

00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:47.480
what you do you hematemesis and then you

00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:49.460
verb and you Hume it to me just again

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:51.049
that way you got more than enough HP and

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:52.670
then you pick up all but then we could

00:43:51.049 --> 00:43:59.960
double the red hearts accidentally a

00:43:52.670 --> 00:44:01.880
dummy that's what we wanted this is

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:05.329
super weird because I want to create as

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:07.369
many golden chests as possible so what I

00:44:05.329 --> 00:44:07.789
actually need to happen is for you to

00:44:07.369 --> 00:44:12.829
hurt me

00:44:07.789 --> 00:44:16.099
and then I go back okay here's what we

00:44:12.829 --> 00:44:21.859
do this is so stupid but it's sadly the

00:44:16.099 --> 00:44:25.730
right play dude wishbone pops and it

00:44:21.859 --> 00:44:27.710
gave us the mind the dream is real still

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:30.289
though okay and we didn't need to do

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:34.880
with that last time now we can open all

00:44:30.289 --> 00:44:36.529
of them but one and wow what an

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:37.730
incredible selection so we did give

00:44:36.529 --> 00:44:38.960
bookworm so be sure to picked up

00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:42.349
Anarchist Cookbook on the last floor

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:44.270
swarm protector sure and then kidney

00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:46.039
stone of course is a speed downgrade but

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:52.059
there's some cool stuff that results as

00:44:46.039 --> 00:44:52.059
well I'm sure and then we can

00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:58.600
every time we get a charge we can use it

00:44:56.140 --> 00:45:00.160
to double these or copy the other chest

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.840
so we can always every time we get in

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:05.050
charge we get one item which is a nice

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:06.550
little value add considering our

00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:08.640
position right now and what I mean by

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:12.160
that is basically that our luck stat is

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:13.720
pretty much zero so we wouldn't be

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:23.350
expecting too many items down here on

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:25.480
the chest to clubs again as like a

00:45:23.350 --> 00:45:27.340
needless pickup but at the same time I'm

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:28.750
ready to move on from this run there's

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:31.870
been there's been positives and

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:33.840
negatives mystery gift gave us add bombs

00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:35.950
there is a God

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:39.610
especially with weird continuum

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:44.680
mailshots that's like pretty solid I

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:47.050
think and we can do some damage when we

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:51.580
get the output from kidneys down here

00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:54.550
technically I'm just look if you have a

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:57.160
kidney stone it lowers your speed after

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:59.320
your kidney stone is freed shouldn't

00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:01.050
your speed go back to normal as long as

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:03.640
we're playing the absolute horse hockey

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:04.300
devil's advocate here I'm just throwing

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.430
it out there

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:08.770
once you free yourself from the trials

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:10.780
of the kidney stone you know you should

00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:15.160
be good to have normal speed again or in

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:18.100
my writer in my realm you want to play

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:23.010
the realism argument well guess what

00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:25.480
here we are that's when I start to get

00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:31.030
embattled about the minutia and Isaac

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:32.800
that's probably time for us to to make

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:35.140
this our last Isaac runt of the day and

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:37.330
dude it's all wins as far as the eye can

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:39.280
see so I'm a happy camper we never

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:41.650
should take nine lives in that situation

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:46.090
it only stands right now to compromise

00:46:41.650 --> 00:46:49.300
things but does not what I meant to do I

00:46:46.090 --> 00:46:51.340
thought I was one room over well we're

00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:53.910
going to do this room regardless so get

00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:53.910
yourself set up

00:46:54.769 --> 00:47:01.339
I'll be afraid to throw down

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:01.339
you know mad sad bombs here

00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:08.950
where I'm ready to say goodbye to Isaac

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:10.930
today it's been like a nice honestly

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:16.300
like five or six hours of vibes of

00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:18.580
recording pretty solid gets you ahead of

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:20.260
schedule for a few days you know what

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:21.820
that means is that tomorrow if I don't

00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:23.200
want to play Isaac I don't have to and

00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:25.060
maybe that's good for maintaining a

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:26.770
streak you know bulk recording sessions

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:28.090
I'm not going to go back and double

00:47:26.770 --> 00:47:31.210
anymore if you want to give me items

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:35.410
game not up and and come down here and

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:41.530
give me some items via chess 0.6 luck

00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:43.480
we've earned it it's a little dog

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:45.640
related panic outside of my apartment

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:47.820
door not inside of our apartment itself

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:53.980
don't never fear

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:59.830
all right let's do with easy wins damage

00:47:53.980 --> 00:48:02.770
approaching double digits here sac

00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:08.020
dagger will get the job done never fear

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:09.910
no void no void no void I'm a happy

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:12.580
camper and we can do this for like the

00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:14.560
next hundred years so a very strange run

00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:16.780
but hopefully you got some appreciation

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:18.520
out of me trying to finagle a little bit

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:19.540
of creativity but either way if you

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.680
enjoyed the episode click the like

00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:21.490

subscribe you wanna see more in the

00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:25.300
future I'm going to call it a productive

day of Isaac here with six wins in a row

00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:30.240
thanks for watching and I'll see you
