00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.049
everybody a welcome Agner on the lane

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.090
places the ability of Isaac after birth

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.590
plus beautiful Kane run last time we're

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.880
gonna do agree to your run I'll spoil

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.059
that for you right off the bat

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.139
let's do Aiden greedy you're greedy near

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.350
as I call it

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.590
we got the D for a great rate of fire

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.189
and good damage to it the Tingo turn

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.150
before r RW it's not C so that's why I

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.750
don't make jokes

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:35.489
cuz I'm not good at them speed is slow

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.670
but not overtly horrible the d4 on a

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.129
normal run is borderline a guarantee

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.170
that you you're gonna win cuz you just

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.030
roll until you get something good which

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.800
is pretty much the same logic I'm gonna

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.390
apply here I just don't know how well

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.010
it's gonna work I have no reason to

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.510
believe it won't work well let me put it

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.730
that way I'm trying to set the stage

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.170
that I'm unaware of the consequences but

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.600
that doesn't necessarily mean that we're

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.250
we're screwed you know I can't believe

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.750
how lucky we've gotten with our payouts

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.300
from this guy to continue to get items

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.920
and we want to continue to get items

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.979
because you know that gives us more

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.570
tickets in the d4 lottery come on come

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.430
on Doh okay also still like completely

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.759
fine in fact why don't we save half a

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.979
spirit heart and go in here right away

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:24.860
ended up not being too positive for us I

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.240
think here's how we're gonna do it I

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.970
think we're gonna pop the Empress and

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.130
say that you know we're actually in a

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.170
good spot right now I think we have an

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.030
above-average start so let's take out

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.560
all of our you know starting waves with

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.240
the Empress actually working out for us

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:45.420
and then we'll probably start using the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.250
the d4 because we're not looking for an

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.560
above average run the d4 gives you the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.970
luxury as long as you can survive of

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.770
looking for a run that's well above

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.950
average and in fact beyond being well

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.329
above average could could be stellar or

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.610
it could be garbage but in an

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.500
interesting way so that's where we're

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.579
gunning for here

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.710
it's our aim

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.240
and then once we finish every single

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.709
wave including you know having picked

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.910
whatever the deal with the devil item is

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.580
or ignoring it because it's probably

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.959
gonna be a red chest full of troll bombs

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.319
then we'll buy our key we'll go to the

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.970
shop we might buy the seven cent item

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.489
which i think is spelunkers had right

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.299
now and and just bank that for future

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.349
rerolls but we'll see for now let's take

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.650
advantage of the fact that we got the

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.879
Empress which is fantastic for us we

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.459
still want that demon judgment to pay

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.319
out usually if you reroll into HP

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.799
upgrades of any sort you get all your HP

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:42.400
bags so or you get that level of HP back

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.840
I should say we're not gonna kill this

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:51.010
guy in nine seconds I'll tell you that

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:52.900
much like eight damage sorry eight rate

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.459
of fire with five damage still not

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.150
really anything to write home about it's

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:01.420
pretty good for the first floor but you

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.739
know long term not gonna do it for us

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.160
especially because it's a trap because

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.139
we don't actually have five damage or

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:13.560
1.3 speed for that matter

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:17.650
I don't like 1.3 speed sounds like a

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.359
like a Chinese action movie translated

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.250
into North American which is the

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.049
apparently language as far as I'm

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.620
concerned you know the language of North

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.620
American

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:37.940
or as you Brits call it for some reason

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:42.800
in English simultaneously manage you've

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:45.940
managed to offend Chinese English French

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.930
and Spanish speakers right off the bat

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.640
good start to this episode

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:55.040
whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa good sir i mean

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.750
i don't want to say i told us so but i

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:04.519
did i freakin a toda so stats are hot

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:06.080
trash now if we buy this I think we buy

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:09.290
that that's actually pretty good and we

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.769
get to keep the card which is it's fine

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.360
let's leave it at that

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:17.870
hopefully we get something of value here

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.450
and it is a tiered delay reducer which

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.220
is positive then we're gonna oh we got

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.750
HP back from the room as well so let's

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.060
finally get this guy to pay out

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.870
hopefully paid out with mom's bottle of

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.520
pills which I don't think is

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.050
particularly strong accepting gave us a

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.630
card which is actually very good

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.760
then we're gonna reroll our whole run we

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.590
got varicose veins champion belt rate of

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.430
fires worst speed is way worse shot

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:42.169
speed is way worse oh my god we got

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.720
undefined as well so we're gonna reroll

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.370
our whole run when we come down here and

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.750
we didn't lose the d4 thankfully I got

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.310
to just be honestly I don't know why the

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.900
door is open we got the mom

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.910
transformation I don't know where we

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.039
stand on this run at this point I also

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:59.020
don't know if the d4 actually allows us

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:05.419
to get out of the missingno conundrum

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:07.100
the lovers the dreamers and me blow this

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:10.760
up

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.690
I don't dislike that we're gonna we

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.860
shouldn't have taken it yet but I'm

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.910
gonna strength card right off the bat

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.400
we're gonna do the same thing we did

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.470
last floor effectively we're gonna try

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.780
to kill every wave and then we'll we'll

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.660
tackle the run as we see fit although I

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.010
may admittedly go for a faster reroll

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.780
just because now I'm starting to

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.510
appreciate the value of the mass effect

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:33.380
you know the larger number of rerolls we

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:38.600
can make and take more chances we have

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:40.880
to get something truly special modest

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.100
damage downgrade we have not lost

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:47.030
undefined so I guess what I would say is

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:51.560
don't get too attached to to any of the

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:53.450
runs that we roll here because if we're

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.190
stuck with undefined every single floor

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.500
we're gonna have something new which is

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:03.290
nice actually from a viewer standpoint

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:10.370
cuz it means we're never gonna know what

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:11.900
the what the actual like quality of this

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.050
run is gonna be that might seem stupid

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.250
but we do jumper cables so good we're

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.340
never gonna know what the quality of the

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.690
run is gonna be which means that even up

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.980
until that ultra greed fight and

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.360
probably up to the point where we're

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.280
during the ultra greed fight we're gonna

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.930
be you know shaking our head going is

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:31.990
this gonna win or isn't it we don't know

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:36.430
I mean as of right now I got every

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.430
belief that this run is okay

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:49.660
oh that was close we've lost our eternal

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:51.670
heart but we did gain HP from the reroll

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.220
I'm not saying that that justifies it

00:06:51.670 --> 00:07:01.690
just saying functionally we're in a very

00:06:54.220 --> 00:07:03.670
similar spot to where we just were six

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.280
rate of fire six damage good but not

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:13.740
good enough not long-term anyway so

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:13.740
Guardian spear is borderline not good I

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:20.200
always like it's one of those rare items

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:22.780
where the hitbox on it is about you know

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:26.260
1/8 of what the actual like sprite size

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:27.960
is always makes you think you can you

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.310
know be Heath Ledger in a Knight's Tale

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:33.370
instead you end up looking like Rufus

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:34.930
Sewell in a knight's tale that's right I

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.040
know the name of the character actor who

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.920
played the villain in the Knight's Tale

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.360
what's it to you

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:43.060
we only had one extra HP because of

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:47.350
strength that is true ok lucky power

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:51.450
pill I kind of want to take both of

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:54.280
these items we shouldn't we really

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:56.230
really really should so I'm just gonna

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.930
forget little harbingers even though

00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:00.460
it's pretty good and we're just out

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.960
we're done we don't need anything else

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.400
on this floor we're gonna lose mob the

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:07.120
void but again it's another item in the

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:09.430
pool I guess try to get at least one

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.230
spirit heart no such luck

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:19.710
all right well reroll into something

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:19.710
good please this seems very bad

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:27.719
PhD maybe okay smelt mom's pearl they

00:08:24.729 --> 00:08:27.719
can't take that away from us

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:36.870
shard of glass and pageant boy you can

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:43.620
do worse than pageant boy lock up please

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:46.930
HP is in a real nasty spot um we should

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:47.649
go for items that give us persistent

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:50.709
benefits

00:08:47.649 --> 00:08:53.110
sadly HP is one of them Jesus juice

00:08:50.709 --> 00:08:57.190
isn't necessarily but we'll go for it

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:59.110
anyway and it's actually pretty good

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:00.519
because we still have that black heart

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.810
available I mean it was a neutral payout

00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:03.730
in the end except we know what was in

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:05.740
the room now okay well that was just a

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:08.500
wonderful turn of events keep in mind we

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:10.089
got 4.3 for damage here so we're

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.800
actually like this is the weakest run

00:09:10.089 --> 00:09:13.540
we've had in a while

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:17.079
we've rear old damages gotten stronger

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:19.060
but DPS has gotten way worse I also just

00:09:17.079 --> 00:09:23.949
have a guardian spirit of sitting out

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:25.890
there one day we're gonna it doesn't

00:09:23.949 --> 00:09:29.410
matter really because of the fact that

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:33.360
we have undefined really we're not doing

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:37.510
a run anymore every floor is its own run

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.980
that was not smart every floor has

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:43.360
become its own run so we're just trying

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:45.610
to roll into something that's good on a

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:49.300
floor-by-floor basis I think we have

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:51.390
gimpy kind of thinking it might not be

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:53.079
the right play to take a bunch of damage

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:55.089
beelzebub okay they can't thank

00:09:53.079 --> 00:09:59.399
Beelzebub away that's the that's the

00:09:55.089 --> 00:09:59.399
other thing no matter what

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:08.250
don't blow this boy out please

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:10.830
sad bones Wow like really really

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:12.690
powerful sad bombs but no matter what

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:14.130
we're gonna be able to keep the ability

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:18.600
to fly that's worth something

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:20.070
today's modern world pinky

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.510
spirit hearts stick with us I wouldn't

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:23.459
mind getting that it works towards the

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:27.959
spun transformation one of the ways that

00:10:23.459 --> 00:10:29.370
we can win this run is by getting it's

00:10:27.959 --> 00:10:31.830
by getting an aggregate of good

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.310
transformations this run is is amazing

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.600
by the way

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.950
it sucks that we can't keep this one

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.589
because if we could just get a bunch of

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:43.589
bombs essentially every enemy is dying

00:10:37.589 --> 00:10:47.399
to one sad bomb so this could be a

00:10:43.589 --> 00:10:49.589
really really good run Abaddon I'm gonna

00:10:47.399 --> 00:10:51.360
take probably shouldn't but it is

00:10:49.589 --> 00:10:53.399
another transformation even though it's

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:57.209
very similar possibly like the same as

00:10:53.399 --> 00:10:58.980
Beelzebub but okay so the whole thing's

00:10:57.209 --> 00:11:00.450
getting rear old next floor I have no

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:02.580
idea where we stand but you know what

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:04.320
I'm counting my lucky stars for a couple

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:09.810
of transformations and I'm counting my

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:11.610
lucky stars that not a great use of the

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:18.839
world card I'm counting my lucky stars

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:21.660
that we have no obligation to donate how

00:11:18.839 --> 00:11:24.000
do our bombs look just regular regular

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:27.630
bombs what a slap in the face I don't

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.529
even get out of bed for less than you

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.529
know homing bombs

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:41.390
I think the the other end game for us is

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:46.040
no do not oh my god the author the other

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:48.110
end game for us is copy

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.550
I know we've that's probably lumped in

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:54.050
with transformations but I just to make

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:59.810
it explicitly clear copy is the dream

00:11:54.050 --> 00:12:02.180
transformation and almost any run can

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:03.380
work with Guffey even this run is like I

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.510
mean I shouldn't be dodging into the

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:07.360
enemy even this runs not that bad it's

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:10.910
not that good

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.950
it's not that bad but again like my

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:14.510
agency is taken away with the d4 because

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:16.220
we don't actually have a choice in the

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:18.529
matter anymore in fact you might want to

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:19.790
give up the d4 for a more reliable space

00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:24.800
bar item at this point another

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:29.930
transformation okay it's it's chocolate

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:31.730
milk if we're gonna re-roll anyway we'd

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:33.500
lose the the function of being able to

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:37.160
reroll a garbage run before the floor is

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:42.589
over and that actually does carry a

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:45.410
certain penalty to it I suppose I don't

00:12:42.589 --> 00:12:47.000
know man I'm kind of this is another one

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:49.070
that Oh kid nice tone as well it's

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.770
another one that's like a little it's so

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:57.589
zany I can't even follow it anymore like

00:12:51.770 --> 00:13:00.310
the Seine is taken over some shielded

00:12:57.589 --> 00:13:00.310
tears action

00:13:02.899 --> 00:13:09.559
a weird spawning point for to mr. Fred's

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:12.220
Oh garbage can kick in my sphere of

00:13:09.559 --> 00:13:12.220
influence again

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:18.680
I can't help but notice these are not

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:21.620
copy aisle can I mean the nail you got

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:25.780
to look at it right we can

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:25.780
we're already re rolling once per floor

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:31.190
you can use the Nellis fund we already

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:36.470
had spun that was not necessarily a good

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:38.960
pickup but you can look to the nail as a

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:40.340
little bit of extra HP instability in a

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.670
situation where that might be something

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:46.580
that's kind of important not to me cuz

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:51.800
I'm not a baby but now that's that's

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:55.610
needlessly dismissive now we really

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:58.070
really eat it if we get a bad bone know

00:13:55.610 --> 00:14:03.680
it's soy milk soy milk with three damage

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:06.250
is pretty good and 20/20 I think but her

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:10.730
rate of fire is gonna be even better

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:14.360
we really really eat it if we get a bad

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:17.510
roll on ultra green like that's that's

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:19.580
our most awful conceivable outcome at

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:21.530
this point I know we have number two but

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:25.460
let's just blow these guys out the

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:26.900
old-fashioned way I don't know a lot of

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:29.320
this run I think comes down to deals

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.320
with the devil

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:43.440
we get a plus 0.2 damage upgrade huge

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:44.820
huge your the relic we do have the relic

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:49.769
I mean I apologize it's sitting right

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:51.420
there but it's uh it's hard to look at

00:14:49.769 --> 00:14:52.620
that every single time you go down to

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:54.269
another floor you know you learn your

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:57.720
run just in time to never see it again

00:14:54.269 --> 00:15:00.600
this is actually not good it turns out

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:04.290
2.55 damage with a one rate of fire

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:08.490
still relatively not good who would have

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:14.269
thought so we had to take a little time

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:14.269
to get ourselves we orientated there

00:15:18.019 --> 00:15:23.190
we need a a reroll though unfortunately

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:25.529
it only comes in the next floor but dude

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:28.860
thank god this is not our ultra greed

00:15:25.529 --> 00:15:30.450
run now I'm kind of hoping the game

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.920
gives us the chance to take the D 100

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.570
because I've seen the error of my ways I

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.790
was like we got a passive d4

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:40.410
turns out a passive d4 is kind of not

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:42.930
great well I mean actually I love

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:45.510
missingno but there's no denying it does

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:48.110
hanging out to dry in a lot of

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:48.110
circumstances

00:15:52.829 --> 00:16:03.570
it's like the knock back here is proven

00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:03.570
to be a little bit cumbersome stop this

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:10.420
this isn't even our deal with the devil

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:11.890
wave so we got Elm Lord that's my

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:13.779
favorite genre of music by the way deal

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:16.050
with the devil wave that in Simpsons

00:16:13.779 --> 00:16:16.050
Korn

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:20.760
let's do it get me out of here

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:33.300
I'm using like all of my bombs like that

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:40.230
Led Zeppelin song you know the one I

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:44.100
love my bombs oh I love my bombs Porou

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:45.270
whoo very great great track I really

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.860
thought that those guys were ahead of

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:50.250
their time is specifically related to

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:52.430
the binding of issac it's like they saw

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:52.430
it coming

00:16:53.270 --> 00:17:01.080
Led Zeppelin more like Ed Zeppelin I

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:05.480
don't even know what I'm taking at this

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:08.819
point I'm just like just spare me the

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:11.640
the indignity here so just a good run

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:15.720
here would be fun oh that seems horrible

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:17.370
the sound is nice though yeah I don't

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.630
know what's making that sound it kind of

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:21.410
makes me feel like there's bones in my

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:24.689
head rattling around or something but

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:26.730
we'll take piercing shots plus speed we

00:17:24.689 --> 00:17:31.679
have Steam sale on this one nothing

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:35.240
wrong with that we should take the gift

00:17:31.679 --> 00:17:35.240
into the deal with the devil

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:43.510
[Music]

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:44.500
I mean it's not bad actually but yeah

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:49.420
yeah yeah

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:51.220
so let's buy the gifts to get it out

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:52.480
there cuz we want to use that to get a

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:55.330
free deal with the devil

00:17:52.480 --> 00:18:02.200
maybe I don't know at this point I'm

00:17:55.330 --> 00:18:03.520
just trying to spare myself here oh yeah

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.590
don't get too attached to the items

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.660
apparently sure

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:15.460
booger tears even though we don't get to

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:17.380
keep them please sure again we could use

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:20.470
a better trinket in fact let's wonder if

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:22.390
we have evil upgrades we have one maybe

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:24.730
so I'm gonna gulp it not worth too much

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:32.950
but and then locus of conquests are

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:34.300
decent now this scares me this is very

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:37.000
strange it's like we're using the old

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:39.450
Chicago typewriter you know algae's on

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.450
soos

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:45.159
we have cursed the tower you know what

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:48.279
we do have is a Samson's

00:18:45.159 --> 00:18:48.940
headband my favorite item Samson's

00:18:48.279 --> 00:18:53.860
headband

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:56.649
looks like we shouldn't like off-brand

00:18:53.860 --> 00:19:01.149
orange juice of these enemies another on

00:18:56.649 --> 00:19:07.179
Zeus come on take it and take another

00:19:01.149 --> 00:19:10.470
room that is an soos baby get another

00:19:07.179 --> 00:19:12.960
comprehensive look at the whole floor

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:21.700
you know you got it

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:24.340
Shen if it makes you see rules it's our

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:26.350
final wave now I mean that was this is

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:28.990
an okay run it stinks that we're gonna

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:33.220
lose it but you didn't take the gift my

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:34.720
dude you didn't take the gifts well

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:36.269
we're not gonna get a charge probably so

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:39.779
ahead of Krampus I mean it's not great

00:19:36.269 --> 00:19:39.779
it's okay

00:19:43.289 --> 00:19:46.210
might have been able to yeah we would

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:47.110
have been able to take a battery charge

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:50.830
so it probably would've been better to

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:54.399
not do that gift us giving us I mean

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:57.279
blank card two hearts you're sore to

00:19:54.399 --> 00:19:58.419
speak in my language we don't I mean we

00:19:57.279 --> 00:20:01.299
could actually benefit from the HP

00:19:58.419 --> 00:20:04.059
rather than spending on re-roll yeah

00:20:01.299 --> 00:20:10.509
okay cuz blank card two of Hearts allows

00:20:04.059 --> 00:20:14.619
us to double our HP multiple times but

00:20:10.509 --> 00:20:16.860
what is the run we got Bob that seems

00:20:14.619 --> 00:20:16.860
good

00:20:18.059 --> 00:20:24.159
yes this seems okay we do have conjoined

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:32.440
in here somewhere we have the Mulligan

00:20:24.159 --> 00:20:33.730
as well this is going to work it's gonna

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.139
be a little on the shorter side to be

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:38.950
honest with you I actually thought we

00:20:35.139 --> 00:20:40.419
were gonna die it basically came down to

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:43.960
whether or not we got a good reroll on

00:20:40.419 --> 00:20:46.889
the final floor and I'm very happy to

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:48.880
say that we pretty much absolutely did

00:20:46.889 --> 00:20:50.559
it's still gonna be a little bit of a

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.470
slog because the super armor but what

00:20:50.559 --> 00:20:54.850
else is new like Mulligan tech X good

00:20:53.470 --> 00:21:01.269
damage I mean look at that we got a pack

00:20:54.850 --> 00:21:02.740
AK in there it's pretty much not quite

00:21:01.269 --> 00:21:04.840
as good as it gets but you know there's

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.889
a people used to make fun of me cuz

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.360
they're like when you get the D for the

00:21:05.889 --> 00:21:10.049
D 100 you always just roll till you get

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:12.519
tech X how ironic that in this situation

00:21:10.049 --> 00:21:15.850
undefined gave us no choice but to take

00:21:12.519 --> 00:21:24.779
tech X which believe you me I'm very

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:24.779
happy about because he is eating it

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:29.510
we have poison shots as well I mean it

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:32.900
must be epic AG poisoning every shot I

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:34.970
thought maybe we were just getting lucky

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:36.290
with the Serpent's kiss but I don't even

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:37.850
know if we have serpents kiss on lock's

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:39.800
I thought we did but maybe it was bloody

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:42.920
lust that we unlocked recently they sort

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:47.180
of have a similar they don't I really

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:49.400
have a similar at all all right so we

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:54.170
got through phase one getting hit

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:56.630
exactly one time phase 2 is a way to be

00:21:54.170 --> 00:22:01.370
evening it hit I don't know phase 2 is

00:21:56.630 --> 00:22:05.990
harder we're immune to explosions phase

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:06.470
2 might not be that much harder we need

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:09.730
the money

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:12.860
come on my honey this is a really

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:15.290
dynamic run to have made it this far

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.820
with because to be honest with you there

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:19.370
were some times on this one where I was

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:25.400
like whether or not we win here is not

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:30.470
up to us it's pretty much up to a roll

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:34.850
of the cosmic bones and now we never

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:37.940
have to do even greed again even though

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:40.880
even greed is one of the more fun greed

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:46.520
archetypes like get down the one step

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:47.600
closer to doing even streaks metronome

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.580
has appeared in the basement another

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:52.250
item I very rarely use but that might be

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:57.740
my own nub my own fault we might as well

00:22:52.250 --> 00:23:02.620
donate for raisins I suppose that was

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:05.120
just a nice like copacetic dynamic run

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:07.880
with a lot of uncertainty associated

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:09.020
with it but I'm certain - one thing we

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:10.280
don't have to do that ever again

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.390
