##

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.050
you

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:23.730
because of because of circumstance

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.710
now we are roughly on pace to be honest

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.960
with you if we're off taste at all

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.289
it's because I spent so much time

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.490
shooting poop on the last floor so other

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.370
we just sweat it too much it's a good

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.139
opportunity for a bomb we do have

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.780
something dropped I think it was oh just

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.250
a straight-up spirit out even better

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.490
although to be honest with you I would

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:52.060
still like a bomb so yeah I mean it's

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.310
kind of like if it works out it'll be a

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.380
good daily if it doesn't work out I

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.150
guess I'll be thinking into daily with a

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.819
little bit of a whiff but basically it

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.520
comes down to can we take as little

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:06.550
damage as possible and maybe find a seam

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.849
because like I don't I don't like my

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:14.470
odds of getting to 26,000 points or

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:18.130
somewhere in that region without getting

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:22.419
past the moms foot floor bosphorus gives

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:24.849
you 4,000 you never have 22,000 points

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.530
when you walk into boss rush so there's

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:29.169
got to be some way through unless

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.409
there's like 99 Keys 99 pennies and 99

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.280
bombs in which case well that would make

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:36.520
divided by 11 it would make a really

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:40.860
good Nintendo DF game my wife plays the

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:43.960
mud okay so we want this that's a given

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.490
Judas the shadow is a lovely item we may

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.440
not get to take advantage of it any time

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.199
soon but still that's not me saying by

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.770
the way that you know boys can't play 9

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:56.289
9 9 it's actually me reducing my own

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.940
street cred because I know that 999 is a

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:00.009
well-respected game but I have not

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.889
played it myself so I dare not take

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:05.229
credit although I like the concept of a

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:10.650
room escape game you know I've done

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:10.650
escape rooms in real life a few times I

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.479
think in a video game concept that could

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.190
be cool especially if there's more

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:19.900
interesting puzzles than like hey find a

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.240
four-digit code stone somewhere about

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.620
this room not that I'm insulting you

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.819
small business owners at all I

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.680
understand you know you're kind of

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:28.930
hamstrung by the constraints of the

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:33.190
media to begin with the medium to begin

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:36.370
with so as we found out recently maybe

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.660
like three weeks ago it doesn't seem

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.990
like

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:43.540
your spike room play your self-sacrifice

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.750
room play is cumulative which means that

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.790
first off what if we're to pronounce

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:53.440
cumulative secondly it seems like you

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:56.890
don't get credit oh this is what we need

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.940
you've got to go Satanic Bible and

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.790
that's it

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.220
there's no flying items in here so yeah

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.450
yeah this is good

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.190
that means we get no benefit out of

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.680
playing the self sacrifice room right

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.630
now unless we're gonna play it all the

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.520
way through to fruition which you know

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.410
Haddon fresh out the kitchen mama rollin

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:18.940
that big word got every man in here

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:21.820
wishing building your lexicon Webster

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:24.250
and Mary um it's the freaking English

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:28.420
class baby mother have made some

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:29.710
enjoyment okay I think we should um oh

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.290
let's blow this up small all could be

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.760
very nice spirit arts are also good why

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.410
do we need spirit out so we need spirit

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.240
out so we need them early because I

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:39.100
really think the self-sacrifice room if

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:42.190
one exists later is going to be the

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:45.160
difference-maker so if everything goes

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:47.260
right this could be the rare short ghoul

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.890
that was bad this could be the rare

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:52.030
short daily for the right reasons what I

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:53.470
mean by that is usually when I have a

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.780
short day leaves because I messed it up

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:58.420
somewhere like the lost daily yesterday

00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:02.280
for example today's short daily could be

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:06.700
a teleportation it was kind of close

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:10.780
mentally the never is teleportation Dan

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:13.840
would like that one but you know what

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:15.460
Danny doesn't know won't hurt him we to

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.010
be look at this room we did not we

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:20.530
should open those if we get a chance we

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.820
we want to teleport ASAP is basically

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:26.080
the thing and we could do it this floor

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:29.020
we managed to get a full-hp the question

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:32.110
is do we want to teleport with a

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:34.300
relatively poor series of you know

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:35.680
upgrades here that could be the kiss of

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:38.890
death in and of itself but we do have

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.690
the dark Judas respawn so knowing that

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:42.969
I'm not really confident that we could

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:47.500
beat the lamb with our relatively meager

00:08:42.969 --> 00:08:50.380
run nice at the present moment but I

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:52.540
don't know how far off we are

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:57.100
assuming we die and come back as our

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:59.200
Judas on the on the lam floor you might

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:01.150
be saying why why f with it why not just

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.070
do the daily the way you know you you

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.720
would do all that was so bad the way you

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:08.620
would do a daily for this normally and I

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:10.390
understand your concern but this based

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.800
on the scores on the leaderboard it does

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:15.460
kind of seem like exceptional

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:17.200
circumstances you know I watched

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:20.130
Prometheus on TV last night while I was

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:22.690
doing a little bit of programming

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.800
Michael Fassbender famously says in that

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:27.850
movie big things have small beginnings

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:31.180
the movie out also I know prometheus is

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:33.130
like a weirdly hot-button issue among

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.480
sci-fi fans especially I guess is alien

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.080
covenant having just recently come out

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.150
as well

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.790
we want this and then we'll go back and

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:42.100
do the the special room back here the

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:46.990
boss Trap room or just a mob trap room

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:48.850
but anyway um the point is I I think

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:50.380
prometheus I'm willing to give it some

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:52.510
credit I saw it in theaters and I hated

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:54.460
it and I've seen it probably like three

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:57.180
times since then and I still think it's

00:09:54.460 --> 00:10:00.340
bad I think it's maybe horrible however

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:04.900
it's an extremely watchable bad movie

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:06.670
and I will acquiesce all day that the

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.320
movie has a lot of interesting ideas I

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:10.150
just think it executes the fundamentals

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.500
really poorly like I know it's been hard

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:13.330
on all the time I know that's why

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.320
there's the not controversy but I know

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.900
that's why it's a hot button issue

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.940
online is because you know it gets

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:21.150
Circle Jerks like old da II hate this

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:26.080
movie don't stop till I'd you know nut

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:28.060
but the thing is it is pretty bad like I

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.410
was thinking back I made a tweet about

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.300
it but like every time I watch that

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:33.790
movie there's something new that blows

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:36.400
my mind that made it into the movie I'm

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:37.540
a mild spoilers for prometheus here if

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:41.680
you've avoided it up to this point

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:44.230
you're a better man than I am but you

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:46.110
know they stood archaeologist sir I

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:50.050
don't know with the anthropologist maybe

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:52.050
we really care about that I'm going to

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:54.880
do it because I want magic mushroom

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:57.100
nothing worst case scenario we basically

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.050
broke even but anyway they find evidence

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.430
that human beings may have been created

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:02.290
by an alien race so they're like sweet

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.170
let's take these coordinates and go to

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:05.839
that planet

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:07.730
the plant they go all boohoo all aliens

00:11:05.839 --> 00:11:09.410
who appear to have created us have died

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:11.089
that sucks

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:13.639
still the biggest discovery in human

00:11:11.089 --> 00:11:16.700
history but you know the the male lead

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:18.410
in the movie except for Michael

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.690
Fassbender the guy who plays Holloway is

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:22.250
like you know I want to meet my Creator

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:24.010
and you're like well it's kind of a

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:26.630
silly idea you know you're a scientist

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:28.550
you think a paleontologist is like I

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.500
won't be satisfied with my job until I

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:32.630
meet a t-rex you send yourself up for

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:35.079
disappointment but anyway they still get

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:40.480
a pretty sweet score they bring back an

00:11:35.079 --> 00:11:43.070
alien's head inside of a helmet and then

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.079
he's still disappointed I guess you know

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:47.209
to some extent I can accept that but he

00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:51.040
still disappointed but while his

00:11:47.209 --> 00:11:53.540
girlfriend dr. Shaw played you know the

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:57.139
Titanic on a sinking ship by the lovely

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:59.870
new mera Paz she's dissecting this

00:11:57.139 --> 00:12:03.740
freaking aliens head in full lab gear in

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:06.170
in like the medical Bay Holloway who is

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:08.720
also her boyfriend is just sitting there

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:11.779
in plain clothes oh we definitely want

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:14.510
this he's sitting there in plain clothes

00:12:11.779 --> 00:12:16.850
like a hoodie and jeans watching her

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:18.470
dissect this alien head and drinking

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:23.029
champagne out of the bottle because he

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:25.940
said you're in a laboratory next to the

00:12:23.029 --> 00:12:28.190
greatest like most amazing discovery in

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:30.290
human history yet nobody's there going

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:32.810
Holloway look I know you're a little

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:34.519
cheesed right now because you fart off

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:36.470
and you're gonna say that this is like

00:12:34.519 --> 00:12:38.449
oh you're you're cherry-picking you know

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:40.220
only only people who were being pedantic

00:12:38.449 --> 00:12:42.380
would care about that it's actually

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:44.089
nonsensical imagine you watch the movie

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:47.240
and like you know someone's doing

00:12:44.089 --> 00:12:49.160
surgery and then in the corner just a

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.990
dude drinking a Bud Light in like a

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:55.149
t-shirt and shorts or something like

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:57.560
that just the scene is nonsensical

00:12:55.149 --> 00:12:58.490
nobody tells at no point does anybody

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.139
say Holloway

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:03.110
what are you doing this is the greatest

00:13:00.139 --> 00:13:06.040
discovery of mankind you know blink of

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:09.199
an existence on this mortal coil

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:14.250
everybody just like Holloway sad I get

00:13:09.199 --> 00:13:16.839
it man sort of get it not really though

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:18.550
there is no self-sacrifice room on this

00:13:16.839 --> 00:13:20.470
floor so I'm going to try to book it a

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:24.010
little bit this could be a big floor for

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:29.350
us because we've got to deal with the

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:32.500
devil potential and the idea behind deal

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:34.899
with devil potential is that perhaps you

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:39.130
get something that makes us strong

00:13:34.899 --> 00:13:41.800
enough to live through the the lam floor

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:43.180
although I'm not convinced to be honest

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:46.180
with you I'm also not convinced we're

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:47.560
going to get a shot at the lam floor we

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.510
might have missed the only self

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.890
sacrifice room available so the last

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:52.779
thing I mean we should still look for

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:58.839
teleporters of some sort we should still

00:13:52.779 --> 00:14:03.339
look for an eihwaz room that was like

00:13:58.839 --> 00:14:05.410
the worst place to stand but highly

00:14:03.339 --> 00:14:06.790
debatable whether we should even be here

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:08.740
but we're going to check it regardless

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:11.620
and if we if we have the time we should

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:13.630
go back but it is theoretically possible

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.250
that in a weird way boss rush is like

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.480
our get-out-of-jail-free card here it's

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:22.170
our back-up plan maybe that's a better

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:25.600
way to describe it I don't actually want

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:27.490
to go too boss rush unless we have a way

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:31.690
out of boss rush at some point down the

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:33.430
line as well but it could be if you're

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:35.350
closed off to all other paths we should

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:37.570
take it ok ok you really got to stop

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:41.410
taking damage this is poor damage for a

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:44.890
run of this scope ie it's freaking short

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:46.600
ok and if you like Prometheus by the way

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.980
don't take this as an insult rying to

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.540
install your taste just cuz I hate the

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:52.209
movie I don't think anybody likes the

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:53.529
movies necessarily you know an idiot or

00:14:52.209 --> 00:14:57.399
something like that there's a lot to

00:14:53.529 --> 00:14:58.990
like I like to score Prometheus a lot

00:14:57.399 --> 00:15:02.589
that's not a backhanded compliment it's

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:04.329
got good I like it and it's very strange

00:15:02.589 --> 00:15:06.790
because it has this weird like a hopeful

00:15:04.329 --> 00:15:08.380
overture that he's playing while

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:11.410
people's faces are getting melted off

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:13.209
freaking you know alien pregnancies and

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:15.339
stuff like that bananas from from some

00:15:13.209 --> 00:15:18.329
phones and some then you're like load

00:15:15.339 --> 00:15:22.570
the universe is a magical place

00:15:18.329 --> 00:15:26.470
thanks nightmare Carl Sagan

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:28.330
okay need Rawdon baby do not need that

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:31.420
so we're just going to bounce because we

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:33.340
got to stay on pace unfortunately I also

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:37.600
think I mean everyone says this is a

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:39.640
cinematography in prometheus is amazing

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.540
like most people who say cinematography

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.610
I don't actually know what the word

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:46.300
cinematography means I mean that it

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:47.980
looks beautiful on video Michael

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:51.520
Fassbender's performance is great and

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:54.520
again I think it has and against sounds

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:58.570
backhanded don't mean it that way has a

00:15:54.520 --> 00:16:01.420
lot of cool ideas I don't know why it

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:03.460
chose to do with those ideas some of the

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:06.070
things that it did but I can't tonight

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:07.750
and also like okay as long as we got

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:10.390
bones to pick here this is an actual

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:13.540
prometheus spoiler so if you care first

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:17.410
off why respect yourself more than that

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:20.860
but secondly I guess avert your ears for

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:23.320
the next like 90 seconds guy Pierce is

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:26.200
in prometheus they've got him dressed up

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:28.990
in the goofiest 120 year old man makeup

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:31.170
I've ever seen I get it you want a great

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:33.010
actor to play the role that he was

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:34.540
contracted to play in that movie which

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:37.540
has had some importance to it of course

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:40.690
because you not have cast like an 80

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:42.310
year old because you know the standard

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:44.080
objection there's going to be a but he

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:47.050
needed to look like a hundred and

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:49.830
seventy okay the problem is he doesn't

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:52.990
look 170 he looks like Emperor Palpatine

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:56.050
he doesn't look old he looks like you

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:58.710
know he's got a skull infection and

00:16:56.050 --> 00:17:05.170
turned them into a anthropomorphic

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:09.640
scrotum like it's not it doesn't look

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:12.660
right plus you got Guy Pearce he's an

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:16.470
amazing actor LA Confidential memento

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:18.959
even just that they did like a dead

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:21.550
advertisement like a sponsored thing

00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:25.810
with Guy Pearce before the release of

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:28.870
Prometheus the premiere earliest ignore

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:30.820
that and he was great in that and then

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:36.460
you hide him you just hide him under

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:39.340
like sheets of latex okay mamma Megha

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:40.470
is not what we need wow what the hell

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.760
dude

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:50.250
probably should not just walk directly

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:52.120
into the fires so like you see the

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.590
problem that I don't need to buy it you

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:56.950
see the problem in the solution here I'm

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:59.380
sure mama mega guarantees us access to

00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:01.000
boss rush as a result I'm going to

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:04.200
compromise my ideals and take it

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:08.740
but unfortunately oh that's really good

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:10.780
unfortunately the loss of that could be

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:13.270
really good too unfortunately the loss

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:19.180
of our Satanic Bible also puts us in a

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:21.070
very bad spot in many ways as well but

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:23.470
with Mama mega we don't need to go fast

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:28.990
anymore but we will destroy the next

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:30.670
floor very very quickly so I will this

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:33.070
is consider this your advance notice to

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:34.720
Don your blast shield of course because

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:37.060
we don't have to worry about our timing

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.860
I think we should explore pretty

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:40.720
prodigiously on this floor to try to

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:43.210
find a self-sacrifice room because if

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:46.270
there is a self-sacrifice room on this

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:50.470
floor I think doubtlessly we should take

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:52.840
it remember we have dark Judas not a

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:56.620
self sacrifice room just a very very

00:18:52.840 --> 00:19:01.540
small room we have dark Judas so we can

00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:07.510
come back from the dead we know this is

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:11.530
the gulp again it's 48 hour energy 2020

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:15.220
some lovely items but the real you know

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:18.370
rub right now my favorite alpaca Patrol

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:21.910
team TV show on trutv real rub that's a

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:23.410
joke about Rob Schneider's Netflix or

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:25.950
Hulu show what was I don't know you got

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:30.280
to ask Michael al Fox about that one

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:34.150
real rub we'll find you somewhere with

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:36.370
you back to its beach house anybody

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:38.650
beach shop still popular they were

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:39.820
killed in 2009 whatever that album is

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:43.170
called it might actually be called real

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:43.170
love came out

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:48.950
great album dude maybe want to go to

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.450
Norway you show up at the border hey

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:52.400
what brings you normal you'll be like

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:58.700
that beach house son where she goes no

00:19:52.400 --> 00:20:00.470
way no way no way and I thought she was

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:06.110
putting down some pretty good ideas

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:08.270
there it's also the reason I went to

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:10.280
Panama and let me tell you one of the

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:12.260
rare cases where I think the country

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:15.140
beats the song I've never been to Panama

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:19.700
great song though ten ten ten ten ten

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:21.080
ten ten ten ten alright so we've

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.540
explored this floor we could look for

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:29.630
secret rooms add relevance of which is

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:30.170
probably nearly zero that's okay save

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:32.750
our bombs

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:35.120
we might need tinted rocks if there's a

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:36.130
self-sacrifice room my expectation is

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.940
that there is probably not a

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:39.320
self-sacrifice room on the next floor

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:42.470
which means we're going to need in a waz

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:47.810
room which actually unintended

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:49.790
consequence of of having mama mega it

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:52.730
probably does increase our odds of

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:54.590
getting an a waz room via blowing up

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:56.740
every single skull on the floor so

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:59.690
that's not that bad I can live with that

00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:02.770
we got a speed upgrade from little Gish

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:09.350
which is I think politely to say

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:11.600
uncommon but better probably so again

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:19.580
down your blast shields put on your work

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:22.400
boots and your respirator we're like on

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:26.780
the border of having an amazing run

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:28.460
right now Deadshot Plus 2020 is pretty

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:30.020
good I'm trying this is like my Isaac

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:32.450
experiment I've been experimenting with

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:36.320
Isaac because it's realizing just you

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:38.870
know I can't even bring myself to

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.670
completion unless I've got a

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:42.380
metaphorical finger in my metaphorical

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:46.610
butthole in this game at this point but

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:48.350
I I did a run today before I had my

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:52.670
coffee and I was like maybe maybe the

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:55.179
coffee makes me unsharp maybe it muddies

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:57.590
my senses

00:21:55.179 --> 00:21:59.989
don't think that's the case actually

00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:01.369
largely it's I added errands to run this

00:21:59.989 --> 00:22:04.909
afternoon and I was like I don't have

00:22:01.369 --> 00:22:08.179
time to have a coffee before my videos

00:22:04.909 --> 00:22:11.179
so it's either coffee or video Thank You

00:22:08.179 --> 00:22:12.230
dark bomb and I chose video oftentimes I

00:22:11.179 --> 00:22:14.389
would have chose coffee in that

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:16.580
situation but you know fight back

00:22:14.389 --> 00:22:18.950
against the caffeine influence

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:20.179
temporarily normally the situation

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:23.090
doesn't present itself because I've

00:22:20.179 --> 00:22:27.279
managed my time better but slept in a

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:27.279
little later than even usual today I

00:22:27.429 --> 00:22:35.840
believe who must agree let's grab that

00:22:32.929 --> 00:22:37.700
so again actually we should keep two

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:43.850
things in mind right now one is the dry

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:45.980
my designed to explain in due time the

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:49.820
other one is we could use a teleport

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:51.739
card just as well well we could use a

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:55.879
teleport card as well as in a waz is

00:22:51.739 --> 00:22:57.139
what I mean to suggest I'm going to use

00:22:55.879 --> 00:23:00.259
the bombs I don't really care about our

00:22:57.139 --> 00:23:02.210
you know the minutiae of our bonus here

00:23:00.259 --> 00:23:04.909
like our damage bonus I just want to

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:09.499
make sure I'm getting everything - luck

00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:11.869
upgrades and a blood bag so the blood

00:23:09.499 --> 00:23:15.679
bag we probably want but we might be

00:23:11.869 --> 00:23:17.600
able to get it on our dark Judas respawn

00:23:15.679 --> 00:23:21.679
I think it's low percentage I mean

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:26.379
obviously we want that trinket if we're

00:23:21.679 --> 00:23:29.749
a if we're able to hold it we don't need

00:23:26.379 --> 00:23:31.399
the mom's locket that's one thing worth

00:23:29.749 --> 00:23:32.600
noting here but anyway we could still

00:23:31.399 --> 00:23:34.070
use a teleport card because we are going

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.269
to get access to bobster I keep in mind

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:36.289
we can't go into our deal with the devil

00:23:35.269 --> 00:23:37.759
because if we go into our deal with the

00:23:36.289 --> 00:23:42.710
devil we will lose access to boss rush

00:23:37.759 --> 00:23:44.029
but we want a teleport cards I've been

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:49.220
trying to explain for the last little

00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:50.779
bit because a teleport card allows us to

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:52.249
get out of the boss rush once you've

00:23:50.779 --> 00:23:54.109
gotten into the boss rush and that's

00:23:52.249 --> 00:23:55.609
important for us because if there is a

00:23:54.109 --> 00:23:58.570
self-sacrifice room we need to get the

00:23:55.609 --> 00:23:58.570
heck out of there so

00:23:59.419 --> 00:24:07.879
Thank You rod and baby for the kill

00:24:01.249 --> 00:24:11.450
there I think we could finesse a victory

00:24:07.879 --> 00:24:13.820
on on the land floor if we had to at

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:15.649
this point I don't really need to do any

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:18.440
extra work by the way to figure out

00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:19.339
where the heck the teleport card is

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:22.609
going to be because we're already

00:24:19.339 --> 00:24:29.239
blowing up pretty much everything so if

00:24:22.609 --> 00:24:31.639
we're unable to get a kill them all

00:24:29.239 --> 00:24:33.409
right if we're unable to get a teleport

00:24:31.639 --> 00:24:37.519
card I mean I don't know where else you

00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:38.959
would have looked is the thing there you

00:24:37.519 --> 00:24:40.609
go so there's the Stars card

00:24:38.959 --> 00:24:45.229
unfortunately the Stars card comes with

00:24:40.609 --> 00:24:47.329
the admission that we have no boss rush

00:24:45.229 --> 00:24:47.869
on this floor so what do you do about

00:24:47.329 --> 00:24:50.179
that

00:24:47.869 --> 00:24:51.379
I mean I guess you just accept that this

00:24:50.179 --> 00:24:56.450
is probably going to be the end of the

00:24:51.379 --> 00:25:00.409
run unless you get an a woz room was it

00:24:56.450 --> 00:25:01.929
really the second floor or the third it

00:25:00.409 --> 00:25:06.159
was the second floor wasn't it

00:25:01.929 --> 00:25:09.289
self sacrifice room that is madness I

00:25:06.159 --> 00:25:10.579
still I'm looking at our score and I'm

00:25:09.289 --> 00:25:13.909
like I think we're going to rank pretty

00:25:10.579 --> 00:25:18.739
well today I think we're going to do

00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:21.469
okay quite clearly we're not going to be

00:25:18.739 --> 00:25:24.049
top ten got to be in the 20s for that

00:25:21.469 --> 00:25:27.289
we'll probably be you know we might be

00:25:24.049 --> 00:25:29.419
around 20,000 maybe we've got a chance

00:25:27.289 --> 00:25:33.979
at it so we'll take this we can't go to

00:25:29.419 --> 00:25:35.179
the the we've got to taking the station

00:25:33.979 --> 00:25:38.659
so we can't go to the devil room if you

00:25:35.179 --> 00:25:41.329
go to the devil room you lose access to

00:25:38.659 --> 00:25:43.190
this room I know that seems ridiculous

00:25:41.329 --> 00:25:45.950
but them's the rules you know it's like

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:49.989
no hats in school doesn't really make

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:49.989
any sense you just kind of go with it

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:56.980
so the last thing to really amp up our

00:25:53.179 --> 00:25:59.480
pointage here is well don't get hit

00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:01.120
finish as quickly as you can as safely

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:05.450
as you can

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:11.980
where's our Empress card and then that

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:14.179
sucked use the use the two of clubs card

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:15.649
when you've gotten as many bombs you're

00:26:14.179 --> 00:26:17.389
going to get by the way I should never

00:26:15.649 --> 00:26:18.710
have used the Empress against mom that

00:26:17.389 --> 00:26:27.980
was my bad I should have used it right

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:30.159
here we do have black hearts well we

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:32.720
have all black heart available and

00:26:30.159 --> 00:26:35.649
anytime we're able to get like sustains

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:38.299
Deadshot damage that's going to crush

00:26:35.649 --> 00:26:43.990
not as quickly as I was hoping I suppose

00:26:38.299 --> 00:26:43.990
but you know it's not insignificant I

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:56.590
like this I like this both of them have

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:56.590
got to go fast is the problem here the

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:07.159
great dark bum play and our damage

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:08.720
output is like this happens a lot on

00:27:07.159 --> 00:27:10.549
dailies where I'm like this runs pretty

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.529
good and then I get on to boss rush and

00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:16.490
I'm like actually it might be sort of

00:27:12.529 --> 00:27:19.009
bad 20 20 Deadshot is is good it just

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:27.049
might not be that good for handling our

00:27:19.009 --> 00:27:28.730
present situation I suppose but hey you

00:27:27.049 --> 00:27:30.289
know let's focus on the positive of this

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:35.119
run I think we're in a fairly

00:27:30.289 --> 00:27:38.749
competitive situation and I've indicated

00:27:35.119 --> 00:27:43.940
myself like the song that plays over the

00:27:38.749 --> 00:27:47.360
closing credits of Spider Man 2 the mama

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:48.889
mega pickup was the right call and it

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.950
was debatable in the moment because I

00:27:48.889 --> 00:27:52.669
really I was going for that

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:54.710
self-sacrifice room play and it was

00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:59.990
fairly plausible that I could have heard

00:27:54.710 --> 00:28:01.980
myself pretty badly by taking the by

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:04.169
taking the

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:05.880
well taking the ability to generate

00:28:04.169 --> 00:28:07.529
demon arts away from me would have been

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:10.559
the easiest way to explain it I guess

00:28:07.529 --> 00:28:13.380
because if I took a sizable amount of

00:28:10.559 --> 00:28:16.889
damage all of a sudden it becomes kind

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:21.090
of if they're not teleporting enemy no

00:28:16.889 --> 00:28:22.710
he's just a stationary enemy obviously

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:30.090
great shot I can't really be mad at you

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:34.080
for that I still am of course but angels

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:37.169
got to go first starting to come to the

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:39.659
slow realization we are unlikely to get

00:28:37.169 --> 00:28:42.179
any extra bombs so I've just doubled my

00:28:39.659 --> 00:28:45.120
own bombs as they stand right now

00:28:42.179 --> 00:28:50.250
knowing that I may well want to use them

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:56.970
for actual combat pretty low on the

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:58.679
consumable front here normally you know

00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:59.880
my favorite boss rush archetype is when

00:28:58.679 --> 00:29:01.380
you just you don't even need to think

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:03.450
about boss rush strategy because your

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:05.549
run is so strong it is not where we're

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:14.149
at though this is just like it's a

00:29:05.549 --> 00:29:14.149
slightly below average boss rush not bad

00:29:14.809 --> 00:29:22.860
but also not particularly strong so I'm

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:24.570
thinking the smart play you kill the

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:27.120
enemies that are most likely to kill you

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:28.320
first so in that case that means taking

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:30.269
care of blighted ovum and then these

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:31.649
guys for once the knock-back might

00:29:30.269 --> 00:29:35.600
actually work out in our favor we can

00:29:31.649 --> 00:29:39.600
keep them like 300 years away from us

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:42.590
any enemy that is a beam is you know

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:48.049
it's made the list of things to do today

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:51.659
any enemy that goes underground or jumps

00:29:48.049 --> 00:29:52.769
you guys are both super easy so yeah I'm

00:29:51.659 --> 00:29:57.539
looking at a score I'm think we're going

00:29:52.769 --> 00:30:00.000
to be the 20s it's plausible that maybe

00:29:57.539 --> 00:30:02.940
we've got a little bit of a stronger run

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.480
than average I don't know I to Monday

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:08.750
somebody could have a case thereof

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.750
that's fine

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:18.350
so I'm thinking like among the people

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:21.230
who made exactly the same decisions I

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:23.300
made in terms of where to go how am I

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:25.610
sitting and I got to imagine probably

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:29.930
like 95% of people made the same

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:33.350
decisions I made on this run I didn't

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:35.420
mean to pick up prayer card sadly but so

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:36.050
we might be we might be fine I don't

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:39.500
know we'll see

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:41.180
you got 21,000 we're 96 what I'm

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:42.320
strangely underwhelming daily but hey
