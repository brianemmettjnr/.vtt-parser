00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.689
everybody welcome back to normal and

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.640
play Binding of Isaac after birth plus

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.259
where we again can't lose the spite the

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.650
fact that we probably should have on

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.929
many occasions and this seems like a

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.540
Veysel again

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:18.779
Lazarus you know what Lazarus not a

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.109
great character but a cool mechanic so

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.400
I'm into it and NL c to t ql thank god

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.580
there's a number in there we all know

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.260
the letters give the seeds of their bad

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.910
properties and the numbers give their

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.460
seeds or give the seeds their good

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.739
properties so we're very very lucky that

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.980
we did get a number in here otherwise we

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.079
might have been in some serious trouble

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:45.770
honestly it feels like obviously you

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.770
take Guppies tail I think we maybe just

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:55.829
just want to do this in a way that we

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.600
die in appropriate fashion like for

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.219
example you do that and I'm happy with

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.449
this I'm just scared even though I know

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.330
if we go into the curse room we're going

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.790
to get our lunch money back there we go

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.490
and feels like I'm walking on sunshine

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.380
okay good to know so we we immediately

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.360
basically took advantage of the extra

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.500
bonus you get as Lazarus for responding

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.830
because there were spirit hearts to

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.939
guide us and it's certainly not like

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.640
we're out of the woods yet but we also

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.080
got Guppies tail witches I mean getting

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.479
the guppy item not from a deal with the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.400
devil and especially early on gives us a

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.920
really really high chance I think of

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.720
relative to the average of making the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.150
guppy transformation happen and then

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.430
Deadshot is actually an item that we

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.930
showed up like three times as often as

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.909
it does because it's so excellent but

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.750
it's a really really nice damage bonus

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.790
that allows us to fairly easily you know

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.000
get up to ridiculous amounts of damage

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.790
here one bag is also lovely this one is

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.930
almost like this safest Lazarus run you

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.369
could imagine at this point we've

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.719
already used our respawn we've gotten an

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.329
HP upgrade and a bunch of like

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.460
contingency HP to roll with not to

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.259
mention a pretty solid damage upgrading

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.369
the other thing about Deadshot is that

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:10.619
it lasts room to room apparently so okay

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.620
right I did just have our damage there

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.790
but

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.110
that's fine Zuka flies it builds up

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.940
really quickly - it's like five

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.769
consecutive shots and we get the maximum

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.280
damage bonus which is like double our

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:26.319
existing damage so I think we're in a

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.180
great spot it's like a perfect tears

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.220
upgrading lots of HP backing us up as

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.459
well this is the kind of run that makes

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:37.120
people mad not that mad because it's not

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:40.480
just brimstone but pretty mad because

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:48.730
it's so ridiculously strong right off

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:51.579
the bat no extra guppy items speed up is

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.769
lovely tears down is not but it's a

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.810
pretty small tears downgrade in

00:02:53.769 --> 00:03:01.590
comparison and it tears upgrade that we

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:05.220
got so virus which is also excellent

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.989
sadly we did use our key to grab those

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.640
to grab the the golden chest but I

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.870
thought it was worth it the way our luck

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.030
had been going this looks like it's

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.639
going to be pretty much smooth sailing

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.370
here sure I'll take karma until you've

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:21.010
got a daughter that's what I call karma

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.880
and you pray to God she ain't Roe breast

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.530
too soon that's Kanye West thought on on

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.220
what it's like to have a daughter from

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.829
before he had a daughter but still words

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.540
two words to live by

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.220
it sounds weirder than it is I assure

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.639
you probably I don't know what's going

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.290
on I would never deign to suggest that I

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.000
know what's going on in the Beautiful

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.889
Dark Twisted Fantasy of Kanye West I

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.919
just I listen to the lyrics I interpret

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:51.489
John Bryan on the keys right now excuse

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:54.930
me sir

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.930
thank you okay thank you

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.000
pretty bad situation there but let's be

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.620
honest I mean I'm taking some damage

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.810
that I'm not at all proud of right now

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.459
and we've squandered more HP than you

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.840
know normally you have a chance to even

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.010
squander at this point of the game you

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.930
know things usually start a little

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:14.270
fragile here in the in our embryonic

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.560
state but we're really just kind of

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.669
riding it out on till we get our deal

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.750
with the devil here it's also the first

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.489
Isaac run of the day

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.260
cut me some slack normally I start with

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.740
the daily but good today we'll just

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:27.020
start with a little old you know

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.030
pseudo-random streak run I was actually

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.310
thinking you know Isaac I think it's

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.740
fair to say is crested Isaac's on the

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.870
way it's on the day new month of its

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.660
popularity so we're probably getting

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:42.919
past the days of two a day Isaac's

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:44.780
pretty soon so I mean honestly since you

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.889
guys are watching it I'm interested to

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.870
get your feedback I already tweeted

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.729
about it probably like a week week and a

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.950
half ago at this point and I was like

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.240
you know if two a day Isaac stopped what

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.889
do you want to see in its place and

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.440
there's a lot of good suggestions you

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:00.620
know one of the things that came up more

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.390
than once was another rimworld campaign

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.250
and I like the idea of that I think rim

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.570
world's a fantastic game I haven't

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.380
played it in a while it's been like two

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:12.530
big updates so that's good some people

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:16.130
suggest a return to like a rotating sort

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:18.020
of rogue light not not specifically

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.229
tumble feed which is a rotating rogue

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.330
light I guess in a literal sense but I

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:24.800
like to bring you know once a week or

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.090
not once a week sorry but every week you

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.500
know this week's going to be spelunky

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.910
this week's going to be FTL this week's

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.080
going to be tumble TVs who's going to be

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.240
plaintiff get cetera et cetera this

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.530
one's going to be rogue legacy maybe and

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.870
then that's a cool idea as well and then

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.289
something that came up a lot was you

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.550
know doing more let's look at those are

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:43.970
tougher to swing then

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.200
a 45 minute episode of a rogue light

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.150
admittedly because that requires a

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.700
little bit more prep time upfront but

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:53.900
certainly you know you could replace

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:55.630
some Isaac's with a lesser quantity but

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.500
maybe higher quality of let's look at

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.360
but yeah I'm interested in what people

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.950
think and I got a two more things to

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.020
bring up one of them is if we start

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:06.349
doing one Isaac episode a day what do

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.270
you want to see randoms or you know

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:09.320
quote-unquote streak runs or day leaves

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.540
I think I know the answer

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:15.620
but I'd be eager to have you all way in

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:17.090
regardless and then I was thinking like

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.560
one of the things we could do to freshen

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:24.200
it up here obviously I'm stoked that

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:26.030
there's a I'm launching I'm stoked that

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.950
there's a booster packs coming out at

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.690
least every now and then because that

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.310
adds fresh content but I was also

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.710
thinking one thing I've never done in

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:36.140
Isaac is build up a save file from zero

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.000
except when rebirth first came out so we

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.390
could actually take a super trip down

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:45.050
memory lane and do like a quest to get

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:48.200
real real real platinum god again but I

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:53.510
don't know because I I see them I see

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:54.410
the value of both I see the value of and

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.240
I know people are going to say I'm not

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:59.750
here for the gameplay anyway obviously

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.920
after like five years but you know it

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.240
would be nice to take a trip down memory

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.390
lane but we'd be missing out on all

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.710
these cool sort of items at least from

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.270
the get-go that provide these weird

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.650
synergies that sometimes can make a

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.710
break in episode in terms of its quality

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.720
but anyway I digress let me know what

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.010
you think about that so you know go into

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.540
one Isaac episode a day with the

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.160
knowledge that the Isaac episode will be

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.790
replaced by something else that would

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:25.970
probably come out on a daily basis it

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:29.060
does open up time for me to do different

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:31.550
videos admittedly and then you know

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:36.230
dailies are non dailies have your say

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:38.900
comments or tweets and then new save

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:40.610
file yay or nay just whatever you

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.210
doesn't have to be a well-reasoned

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:46.100
opinion just whatever you think you're a

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.900
your two cents would be I'd like to hear

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.040
it you know it's in the end this is not

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:52.460
a democracy

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.510
and it sounds rude but you know I want

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.890
to do what the people want but I also

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.540
want to do what entertains myself

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:59.210
because I think that actually makes for

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:02.120
the better content as well so well we'll

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:04.070
put it all in a little in a little you

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.450
know crock pot and slow cook it and see

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:08.450
how the opinions feel after like a week

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.600
or so and see what the world holds for

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.940
us

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.020
but for okay yeah we already went in

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:15.890
there we didn't need to use a bomb but

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:19.820
that's okay how's this run going well it

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:22.009
got not that much better for a little

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:26.419
while but now

00:08:22.009 --> 00:08:28.240
is in like a real nice spot our damage

00:08:26.419 --> 00:08:30.499
is decent and then Book of Shadows

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:33.110
combined with the virus is like an

00:08:30.499 --> 00:08:35.479
engine I wouldn't say it's going to like

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:37.940
easily generate a bunch of demon hearts

00:08:35.479 --> 00:08:40.519
for us but on occasion it should

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:42.050
generate demon hearts for us I mean let

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:44.120
me put it this way if once every two

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:46.610
times you use Book of Shadows you get a

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.920
demon heart its Satanic Bible quality

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:51.230
plus you get the invincibility out of it

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:58.069
which is also it is more than Satanic

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:59.510
Bible quality but anyway I digress

00:08:58.069 --> 00:09:02.360
actually having Book of Shadows with an

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:03.889
orbital is lovely as well so I'm not

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.529
sweating it at all we really we got

00:09:03.889 --> 00:09:09.920
ballin out of control in a huge way very

00:09:06.529 --> 00:09:14.449
early on on this run so both of these

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:17.690
are pretty not great but I will take

00:09:14.449 --> 00:09:19.160
dark Prince's crown over contract for a

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:22.940
nut contract from below what is that one

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:25.130
missing page two the reason for this is

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:27.470
basically just because I don't need the

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:29.319
read hard I mean I wish there was

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:32.180
something more to it than that but

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:33.829
there's a chance we can get some benefit

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.510
out of dark Prince's crown we're not

00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:42.319
going to get like any benefit I think at

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:43.940
a missing page to rather use the Sun on

00:09:42.319 --> 00:09:49.010
the next floor let's be honest we don't

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:51.199
need the we don't need the the nickel

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:52.850
there so I think we'll just use our Sun

00:09:51.199 --> 00:09:55.100
card on the next floor and probably be

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:55.940
be set up for a good situation here

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.649
let's head downwards

00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:00.350
I mean we're obviously in a good spot

00:09:57.649 --> 00:10:01.579
but yeah I mean it's it's kind of what I

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.230
tweeted about it people were like oh is

00:10:01.579 --> 00:10:05.269
this the end of an era I don't really

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:07.339
think it's like the end of an era

00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:10.850
there's always going to be an audience

00:10:07.339 --> 00:10:12.980
for for Isaac for me at least because

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:15.110
it's the if the game I can play

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:18.050
mindlessly which normally is an insult

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:19.370
but it'll it lends itself to good

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:22.670
commentary I guess is what I'm getting

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:25.490
it and you know we have gone down to one

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:28.430
Isaac per day in the past not since like

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:30.800
the release of rebirth I think but you

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:32.480
know this the games got a it seems like

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.640
the right time I guess for the game to

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.530
pull back from being like a 100

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:41.360
main focus of my channels been like five

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:42.560
years so that's absurd for one and then

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.290
it will actually have been more than

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.210
five years been like six years and then

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:48.200
beyond that like Edie is working on new

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.790
stuff you've got that new game that

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.980
looks like Super Meat Boy - the end is

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.870
nigh which is coming out in very early

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:56.660
July which I'm definitely going to check

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:58.940
out and I'm excited that he's not just

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:01.610
in the Isaac cave anymore you know I

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:03.730
think obviously he gets all of the

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:06.170
credit but we both kind of been in this

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:08.170
nut shoehorned but we've been in his

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:10.970
Isaac bubble for like five years where

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:13.460
you know you said when we've talked to

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:15.700
him on like round tables like you don't

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:17.570
he didn't expect that

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:19.280
Isaac would be the key was going to be

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:22.160
like a little almost pseudo game jam

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.540
thing made in a few months that you know

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.490
just come out be inspired by the

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:28.180
original Zelda and be kind of like a

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:31.010
cool thing for people to appreciate a

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:33.110
formula of game that has not been around

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:34.820
for that long or it had not been around

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:36.560
for a while at the very least and then

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:39.320
of course it ends up you know sort of

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:41.300
like reigniting the the roguelike or

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:43.670
roguelike genre at the very least and

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:45.260
you know three expansions or four

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:48.080
expansions deep at this point and

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:50.000
there's mods and it's become its own

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.620
beast basically so I'm excited that he's

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.300
working on new stuff and I can't wait to

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:55.310
check it out I know finger it exists as

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:59.600
well but it feels like the end is nigh

00:11:55.310 --> 00:12:01.760
is like a big project I guess not that

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.950
fingered is you know a trash fire it

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.900
actually just never worked for me so I

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:09.830
can't say whether or not that that game

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:12.050
is any good but I do own it but yeah it

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:13.610
seems like like the time is time is

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:16.550
right then maybe step back just a little

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:18.230
bit have this as like you know there's

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:20.380
always going to be on Isaac episode but

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:23.210
you know maybe my time is better served

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.380
coming out with new content as well it

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.750
kind of things it out a little bit on

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:28.640
the show as well you know there's stuff

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.810
that we can fit in the opening segments

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.970
that sometimes is a little bit more

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:34.070
conducive to banter and I'm in love with

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:36.470
Isaac but not all my co-hosts they all

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:38.210
like it but nobody else is really like

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:41.060
this is the greatest game ever made I

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:43.310
really do think that that rebirth plus

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:44.930
expansions I know people have an issue

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:46.550
with some of them but I think that

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.600
rebirth plus its expansions might be one

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:50.269
of the best design

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:52.790
nine games ever made emotionally did it

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:55.759
transform my life you know was it was it

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:57.860
a deep story that I you know never

00:12:55.759 --> 00:13:00.139
thought I'd experience no absolutely not

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:03.290
but mechanically I just think that this

00:13:00.139 --> 00:13:05.089
is like Isaac is like a language or a

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:07.130
sport or something like this game

00:13:05.089 --> 00:13:09.589
codified the rules of Isaac and then you

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:10.790
could play it infinity times and not

00:13:09.589 --> 00:13:15.319
every run is going to be you know

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:16.850
lights-out 10 out of 10 amazing but most

00:13:15.319 --> 00:13:19.420
of them are going to have some element

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:21.800
of uniqueness and entertainment data

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:24.290
that's cool anyway I'm getting a little

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:27.980
sappy here but again still going down to

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:30.050
one Isaac episode of days 365 episodes a

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:33.889
year that's more than a lot of youtubers

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:35.899
put out of you know anything and I'm

00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:38.750
talking about a oh is it the end of an

00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:40.699
era you know a little overly sentimental

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:42.170
but anyway again this is largely a segue

00:13:40.699 --> 00:13:45.230
for me to be like let me know what you

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:49.220
think because my livelihood essentially

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:51.769
depends on your your feelings about

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:53.120
things so you know it's very helpful and

00:13:51.769 --> 00:13:58.370
reassuring for me to know your

00:13:53.120 --> 00:14:01.069
perspective this guide you know the

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:02.810
business aspect of producing what I hope

00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:05.449
is entertainment anyway

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:08.089
or at least background noise like I'm

00:14:05.449 --> 00:14:09.920
completely okay being professional

00:14:08.089 --> 00:14:13.670
background noise I've actually started

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:15.709
using twitch as background noise which

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:18.259
previously you know any any time we've

00:14:15.709 --> 00:14:19.850
had this conversation really so we get

00:14:18.259 --> 00:14:22.069
keys out of it but I'm not really mad

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:22.939
because it's also still good I've been

00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:25.399
like you know I don't really watch

00:14:22.939 --> 00:14:26.660
YouTube and twitch and it's true it's

00:14:25.399 --> 00:14:29.149
not because I think like it's beneath me

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:31.250
but it's just I don't have a lot of time

00:14:29.149 --> 00:14:33.319
like when people tell me I watch you

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:34.699
when I'm working I'm like I get that you

00:14:33.319 --> 00:14:37.459
can just put it on in the background and

00:14:34.699 --> 00:14:40.220
you know I'm kind of like a slightly

00:14:37.459 --> 00:14:41.870
variable pattern of audio signals that

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.310
you can listen to and it keeps you in

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:44.930
the zone maybe and every once in a while

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:47.509
you listen intently maybe you have a gig

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:48.860
look - that's fine but obviously like I

00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:51.880
can't listen to other stuff while I'm

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:54.380
working here and be a little weird and

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.910
probably the commentary would suffer and

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.949
the audio quality of the episode would

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.300
suffer because the idea but yeah so most

00:14:57.949 --> 00:15:03.500
of the time that I'm actually busy I've

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:05.689
been I've been recording so I can't

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:07.730
listen to stuff as background noise but

00:15:05.689 --> 00:15:09.949
you know as I've been doing more and

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:11.600
more programming I knew who has

00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:13.220
programming on the NL bingo card make

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.420
sure to mark that off but as I've been

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:16.189
doing more more programming I've had

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:18.889
more and more time where you know I'm

00:15:16.189 --> 00:15:21.439
not totally compromised and you know put

00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:25.069
on like Rob or Nick or Austin stream or

00:15:21.439 --> 00:15:26.959
somebody else's in the crew and you know

00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:28.939
just kind of hang out don't don't say

00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:33.319
anything just sort of lurk they're

00:15:28.939 --> 00:15:34.519
always watching did you deliberately

00:15:33.319 --> 00:15:38.510
phrase that in the creepiest way

00:15:34.519 --> 00:15:43.400
possible yes yes I did

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:47.540
I really wanted that deal I gotta be

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:49.280
real with you I you know this is a

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:51.200
perfect run to rush through and I'm not

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:55.540
saying I'm rushing to be careless but

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:58.610
I'm rushing because there's really no

00:15:55.540 --> 00:16:01.250
reason not to we don't have enough money

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:04.250
to justify going back to the shop we

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:07.600
have unlimited HP so I'm effectively

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:10.160
like I could not be safer on the run and

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:12.470
I also have almost no benefit to

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.480
continually going back for more for more

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:16.190
stuff so I'm still cracking these I'm

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.990
hoping to get more keys out of it and

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:21.410
then did indeed work thankfully a little

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:22.850
bit of a gamble that one did not give me

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:25.670
a key but it gave me a sun card which is

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:27.260
also good so come in here oh we got here

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:29.240
we got another key okay so we will open

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:31.940
that last chest and then the room that

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:34.310
has value for us so this could be closer

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:38.270
to bookworm it isn't but it could have

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:39.380
been and we want to keep our want to

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:41.840
keep our hermit card we're not even

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.850
close to making equality pop so I don't

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.940
sweat that I mean as a society as well

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:49.280
but in this game of quality's got no

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.570
chance right now lovers card okay you

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.220
can grab that if you want but I don't

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:55.940
even care about the spirit arts at the

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:57.950
present moment I will say we're slightly

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:59.630
behind the curve and damage and Deadshot

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:01.070
completely makes up for it especially

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:04.490
with our rate of fire being as good as

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:05.839
it is but it'd be a good time to get

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:07.190
some deals with the devil that improved

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:08.690
our damage but honestly if we have

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:10.430
duality we're going deal with the angel

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:11.900
deal with the angel is always going to

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:15.140
be the preferred choice when we have a

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:17.959
choice unless it's like our performance

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:20.300
is strongly encouraged to be like like

00:17:17.959 --> 00:17:22.070
we need to do extremely well on this run

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:24.320
specifically like on a daily for example

00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:26.329
devil deals are usually preferable but

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:28.390
on a run where the consequences are a

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:30.320
little lighter or the stakes are lower

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:32.480
of course I'm going to go deals with the

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:36.910
angel because they're they're rarer you

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:36.910
know so it's more interesting that way

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:44.170
we got like the perfect

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:47.110
good defensive run right now we're like

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:48.790
the 2003 Tampa Bay Buccaneers you know

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:50.560
there's a quarterback on the team that

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:51.730
won the Super Bowl I don't know it's

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.760
Brad Johnson

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:57.310
you know the Brad Johnson but you know

00:17:54.760 --> 00:18:00.340
you look back and say why do those guys

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:07.750
be rich Ganon's led Oakland Raiders very

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:10.450
simple defense fort five sacks a little

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:12.250
crazy emperor card we will take the

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:14.470
emperor card from this point onwards but

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:16.470
from from the teleportation onwards

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:18.910
first we're going to go and grab

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:21.360
whatever is in boss rush we actually do

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:24.520
have deal with the devil chances here

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:26.770
and we actually have the money for the

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.820
shop as well we'll deal with the devil /

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:30.360
deal with the angel chain you get the

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:33.100
idea all right

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.930
dusted well and truly Scorpio is a

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:42.790
pickup that is like the definition of

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:45.610
it's fine you know it's some poison

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:50.050
damage it's not like dead cells where

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:51.430
we're stacking up poison stacks and

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:55.270
enemies are melting in front of our face

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:58.030
it's just like a little d-o-t pretty

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:59.590
young thing Michael Jackson can't do a

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:01.420
Michael Jackson impression can't even be

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:03.520
evocative of the Michael Jackson

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:04.600
impression I can just go like shamone

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.780
there you go

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.980
there's my Michael Jackson impression

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:13.120
there's a web series in there somewhere

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:14.410
bad impressions not for me but for

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.090
someone else I've got some bad

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:17.440
impressions even my good impressions are

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:20.050
bad but my bad impressions are

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:23.800
spectacular if that's what you're going

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:27.880
for like I can - will Christopher Walken

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:30.280
impression I just I hear him speak and

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:34.210
it's idiosyncratic but I just don't

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:36.070
understand that's genuinely me trying

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:39.280
there obviously we're going to Mulligan

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:40.900
permit out grab this and you know what

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:44.390
you've been good to me lately donation

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:47.150
machine let me pay it back

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:49.520
it's a lot of luck upgrade is it a

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:52.340
random chance to get a luck upgrade from

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:53.540
your donation machine you know I'm

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:57.740
actually going to take the world card

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:59.179
because it's closer is it a random

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:00.140
chance to get a luck upgrade from the

00:19:59.179 --> 00:20:01.490
donation machine because I always

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:02.240
thought it was like pre-programmed at

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:04.970
certain intervals

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.350
either way this floor is nice and we're

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:09.500
considering we haven't gotten like

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:13.450
almost any damage upgrades we're

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:16.460
actually in a fantastic position and

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:21.040
that's it it takes a unique run to make

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:23.929
that happen we've got almost like

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:28.010
infinite spirit arts and even hearts you

00:20:23.929 --> 00:20:30.760
know if that's our desire what the

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:33.049
camera was freaking me out there dude

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.820
scrolling camera knives ago still felt

00:20:33.049 --> 00:20:36.919
that I all think I've actually gotten

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:38.600
used to here um we have a secret room

00:20:36.919 --> 00:20:40.760
access to the curse room back there

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:43.309
because I would still like to you know

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:46.610
have a chance to become guffy I mean you

00:20:43.309 --> 00:20:47.480
have like infinite HP okay because I

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:51.770
love you

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:54.590
and this is my job I'll go back and go

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:59.030
to the curse room that was pretty poor

00:20:54.590 --> 00:21:00.860
damage but I'll level with you that this

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:02.870
were off-camera I ain't going back to

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:04.870
this cursed room because I've already

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:07.280
committed to getting deals with the

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:11.120
deals with the devil sorry deals with

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:13.309
the Angel of this show up don't find it

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:14.630
that likely the gup-e dream is going to

00:21:13.309 --> 00:21:17.419
come to fruition and I know I said

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:19.450
earlier that it was like relatively

00:21:17.419 --> 00:21:22.400
likely that we would get a guppy deal

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:24.919
basically that has just changed because

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.179
of the fact that we haven't gotten any

00:21:24.919 --> 00:21:28.669
deals with the devil like we struck out

00:21:26.179 --> 00:21:31.250
on some we got gutter we got the Krampus

00:21:28.669 --> 00:21:32.900
once we struck out on the 30% deal and

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:37.640
then we strike out on the 60% deal as

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:42.350
well so just you know not in a bad spot

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:46.820
obviously but could be better so we're

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:50.049
hoping for a merciful stars

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:50.049
teleportation here

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:59.870
not a great curse room but not bad and I

00:21:55.070 --> 00:22:02.480
would say this this is not unmerciful we

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:05.240
have the best Pokemon as well so I am

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:07.220
not sweating anything in that department

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.690
it's really just I'm glad I had some

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:10.040
administrative stuff to talk about on

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:11.750
this run because apart from the

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:15.500
administrative stuff the run is just so

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:17.990
lights out but it's not lights out like

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:19.970
we shoot a bomb that is a sad bomb that

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:21.770
you know shoots 12 applica if Paquette

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:24.410
bombs out of it this is presently tough

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:27.500
sentence to say believe it or not it's

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:30.080
really just like a good run it's great

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:31.640
in almost every conceivable category I

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:34.070
mean we're at 20 minutes we're about to

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:37.370
be on the cathedral so you can't have a

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:39.320
bad run like that but statistically you

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:42.410
know particularly our damage is just not

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:44.450
really doing much and then beyond that

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:46.040
we don't have a you know like a blank

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:48.620
card year a setup or anything like that

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:51.770
it's just just like a really really good

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:56.030
run take the tiers upgrade because we

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:57.230
might be about to lose well I mean again

00:22:56.030 --> 00:23:00.410
we're taking the deal with the angel but

00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:02.270
if we get HP and we forget not to take

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:04.340
it we might lose the dark Prince's crown

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:06.320
effect forever which is basically like

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:10.760
you know don't cry about it it's not

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:12.410
worth very much but so this is actually

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:14.210
it might seem like I should be stoked to

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:16.580
take go ahead but it gives us nothing we

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:19.990
had 100% chance for a deal anyway and if

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:23.560
we ruined that 100% chance for the deal

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:27.550
we would be dead quite literally so

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:32.120
we're not going to take moldy bread

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:34.930
because again we want to preserve our we

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:38.740
want to preserve our rate of fire bonus

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:38.740
through dark Prince's crown

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:44.370
Dark Prince is grounded actually like

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:46.620
was very amenable on this run just a

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:56.280
nice little upgrade that I can't really

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:58.260
complain about yeah I mean why not now

00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:00.150
what do we want as far as items go here

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:01.740
can we get two key pieces here and just

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:06.650
get the mega satan fight like right off

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:06.650
the bed for two in one go I should say

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:14.820
we didn't get hit at least have not

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:18.680
gotten hit it's kind of a surprise now

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:21.720
one key piece we'll take a Eucharist

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:22.950
which I mean we didn't really matter

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:25.440
which one we took I guess is what I'm

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:29.090
getting at to be honest with you I don't

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:31.530
really want to fight rush on this run

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:33.150
it's a weird situation of being like

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:35.790
really good but also sort of

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:37.290
unremarkable that I just I don't see the

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:38.910
value in the hush fight except for like

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:40.980
artificially extending the episode by

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:48.540
making me mad at the boss that I'm

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:50.550
fighting two hearts I mean two of Hearts

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:52.590
Ace of Diamonds neither of them have

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:57.960
essentially any benefit for us right now

00:24:52.590 --> 00:25:02.790
but still like just this is like a

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:05.430
really good introduction to Isaac so

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:07.350
weird cuz like nobody is being

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:09.180
introduced to Isaac probably at this

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:11.730
point or very few people but you know

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:13.200
you don't want to show somebody yeah you

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:14.820
should play this game check it out and

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.260
you know you you shoot your tier once

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:18.900
then it covers the screen and like

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:20.760
flying sites that are intimidating you

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:23.880
know you show miss run and go like oh

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:25.230
you know the game looks easy one day one

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.930
day they'll learn and they'll have

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:31.290
respect but for now let them believe

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:32.520
that I guess it is a little easy most of

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:35.190
the time okay what do you got for me

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:38.880
spirit thank you turn these all into

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:41.820
keys we do have Guppies tail so we would

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:46.530
like to be ashen to take an area we

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:48.190
would like to be able to open all of

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:50.660
these

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:56.720
chess that will inevitably come across

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:59.870
here as you can see like we really we

00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:02.990
can't lose HP as fast as we gain it for

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:04.670
many reasons but the big one the big

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:07.930
ones are dark bomb and the virus and

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:10.880
then you know sackboy plus sack of sacks

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:12.410
generating a lot of spirit arts directly

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.580
but then also consumables and they have

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:15.440
a chance to be red hearts and then the

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:17.750
red hearts get turned into spirit odds

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:19.730
by a dark bomb like we have the engine

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:23.420
we have like the most sustainable run in

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:30.280
human history you know we're like we're

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:32.840
an environmental leader right now okay

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:35.300
just I want that Joker card I'm just

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:37.850
going to be honest with you I want to

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:39.410
get teleported to a deal with the devil

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:41.360
and have no choice in the matter and

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:44.870
then be like okay fine I guess we'll

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:46.220
take copy you have my word I'm not going

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:47.450
to use this emperor card the runs

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.140
already going to be a little on the

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:50.900
short side

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:52.790
I'm already exposing myself to those you

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:54.590
know must be a speedrun comments and the

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:56.120
YouTube videos you frickin I'll

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:57.830
everybody's a comedian

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.390
you know now it's happening in

00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:01.820
battleground so it's like a win length

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:06.620
episode and then they put lull at the

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:10.760
end and I say you know what thank you

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:13.210
thank you for your engagement that was

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.210
bad damage

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:20.740
I think couldn't be less relevant right

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:23.050
now I would love to use this emperor

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:26.560
card if we got stacked on this floor if

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:29.320
we could use the emperor card on void I

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:32.380
might consider it but okay how do I feel

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:34.780
about this like number one despite the

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:37.000
range compromise range is feel pretty

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:40.810
good although it doesn't actually affect

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.250
our rate of fire now we've raised our

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:47.410
tier cap a little bit which is nice or

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:50.850
lower depending on your perspective so I

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:50.850
have no idea where we are now

00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:00.370
I don't know is weird because the Pisces

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:03.070
pickup is good in the sense that it

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:05.590
obviously made our rate of fire better

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:08.170
it's kind of bad in the sense that it

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:09.850
gives us knock back so like our tears

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:12.040
are slightly less effective I really do

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:15.040
think that knock back is mostly like a

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:17.710
negative stead it's a situational stat

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:19.840
at the very least and the chest is

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:22.180
really like exemplifying the way I've

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:26.620
felt about this run which is that it's

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:29.010
fine and it's I'm just surprised that

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:31.930
we're down here as quickly as we are

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:35.200
because we're not really you know

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:36.400
sticking it to the bosses here but it

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.630
certainly don't think this is me

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.580
complaining I actually had a really good

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:40.780
time on its run and you know if we're if

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:43.810
we're going to have a run that's only

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:46.360
like probably a little bit below average

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:48.880
it's nice that it started by being

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:54.310
massively above average so that I got to

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:56.500
ride that momentum for a long time now

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:58.450
give me Deadshot on the first floor any

00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:00.430
day of the week then you know a below

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:01.810
average run for a long time and then you

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:03.400
know on the chest they're like okay

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:05.470
here's Polyphemus brimstone proptosis

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:09.010
and like you know the full copy

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:11.710
transformation it's not a below average

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:13.120
run either like we've got a decent setup

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:16.210
and then combine that with the Mulligan

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:21.240
we're basically like we're like pseudo

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:25.540
guppy there's a good event on my mind

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:28.300
all the time suit suit suit agathi

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:29.320
doesn't one too many syllables I didn't

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:31.510
think it would happen considering

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:35.140
Sussudio is about a million syllables

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:38.260
long itself but chubby like these are

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:41.680
these are like slightly above average

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:44.350
items this whole run is slightly above

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:49.150
average it's like a Wes Anderson

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:52.080
character ampler

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:55.989
permit justice justice

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:57.820
he's my blade here's how we're gonna do

00:29:55.989 --> 00:30:03.190
this we're gonna like walk into this guy

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:05.799
and like roastin he stands no chance

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:09.299
your ashes will scatter to the earth you

00:30:05.799 --> 00:30:11.499
will be no more and then I'm going to

00:30:09.299 --> 00:30:22.509
teleport out and I'm going to fight them

00:30:11.499 --> 00:30:25.149
again because we can case to be made for

00:30:22.509 --> 00:30:27.479
me being an idiot to doing this it did

00:30:25.149 --> 00:30:31.419
introduce a nonzero chance of death but

00:30:27.479 --> 00:30:33.369
also my favorites Chemical Brothers

00:30:31.419 --> 00:30:34.929

00:30:33.369 --> 00:30:37.509
