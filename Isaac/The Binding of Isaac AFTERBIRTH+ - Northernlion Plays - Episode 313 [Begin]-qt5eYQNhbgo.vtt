##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.449
hey everybody welcome back to the line

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.480
please abiding by Stanford Plus where

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.080
we've lost the last run we're creating

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.570
like a bad spot and then it got rear old

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.349
into the worst spot that you could ever

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.410
imagine

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.869
m'kay mm and kdh with a strange seat

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.199
here you play as Maggie well with 2020

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.460
so already life is great but basically

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.560
we're gonna start doing some random runs

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.050
again I like to you know I do Eton runs

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.560
and then I die I do random runs and I

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.880
Diana Eaton runs when I die I take a

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.899
whiskey drink and take a lager drink

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.079
take a schnapps drink I take a cider

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.309
drink I don't remember there's only four

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.780
different kinds of drinks and they're

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.239
all talked about in tub-thumping by

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.370
Chumbawamba so I can't believe I've

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.570
forgotten some here definitely you sing

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.860
the songs that remind you of the good

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.870
times and then you sing the songs that

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.840
remind us of the best times I got

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.579
trapped on a rock there but yeah like

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.280
the last run I do take some

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.699
responsibility but no matter what we

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.140
were always going to reroll that run as

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.549
long as there was a reroll machine at

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.950
the end we're going to re-roll because

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.560
it's a non daily run on non daily runs

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.060
unless there's like some mitigating

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.460
circumstances you reroll because if you

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.670
don't reroll your little baby okay let's

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.369
just what it comes down to and this is

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.799
not an l2 character this is NL the real

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.600
voting citizen if you don't play the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.500
video game the way I play this video

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.630
game you're a little baby okay obviously

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.009
I'm being a little facetious here but

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.590
we're going to hope that we get an

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.689
arcade on the next floor it's like the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.880
perfect combination right now easy boss

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.259
plus we already have seven cents means

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.610
we get an arcade on the next floor

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.689
probably because we don't they use our

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.920
bomb right now we can use that to get a

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.630
spirit heart perhaps on the next floor

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.720
and then deal with the devil comes easy

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.000
as well so I'm thinking that you know

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.890
conservative estimate definitely we're

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.090
getting a blood bag next floor probably

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.320
getting the deal with the devil which

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.350
means we're going to get brimstone so

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.880
brimstone plus a blood bag and then you

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.969
know why not just throw on like the pact

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.020
for good measure as well we're going to

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.250
head down to the next floor right off

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.500
the bat and make that dream come true I

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.060
think it could happen you always want

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.930
there's two different ways that runs go

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.040
after a loss

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.560
I mean there's probably more than two

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.150
different ways but there's two ways that

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.709
seem to happen frequently either you

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.769
steamroll and it feels like the game is

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.180
giving you like a little bit of an easy

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.969
time as a result of the fact that you

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.319
lost recently or they really start

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:30.629
throwing the heat at you and then go oh

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.280
you lost well get ready because now

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.379
here's a run that has like literally no

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.090
benefits and obviously this run is

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.670
disqualified from having no benefits

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.549
because 2020 is a probably a top ten

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.590
item in the game sometimes I say that

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.569
and people go you know top ten like it's

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.189
better than top ten I don't know man top

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:51.419
ten is really really good it's just like

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.650
it seems like it should be better than

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:54.060
the top ten because there's also a lot

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.060
of items and Isaac that do absolutely

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.969
nothing or they actively hurt you for

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:04.139
that matter but to be in the top ten is

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:08.269
a huge admission of an item being

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:12.810
amazing like 2020 effectively

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:14.040
productively doubles your DPS which is

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.479
something that doesn't happen all that

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.799
much like you almost never hit with one

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:21.180
tear and miss with the other one just by

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.519
virtue of how close together they are

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.590
like a matchbook for an evil upgrade and

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.329
then it's not really what I was looking

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.699
for but at the same time if we can get

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.049
like IV bag we can productively stay in

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:33.750
the Whore of Babylon State and that's

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:38.609
good this is obviously small rock I mean

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:41.329
there's just no G's well will loot

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:43.620
perchance to get a key and hopefully

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.329
that will come to fruition we need a key

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.040
to get into our shop anyway to begin

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.780
with but when you key to get into our

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.159
item room to begin with even before

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.060
beginning with that other category I

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.500
suppose so

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.229
throw this down here and see how life

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.879
works two more spirit arts skin a little

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:59.699
ridiculous at this point definitely

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:03.599
should have used a bomb to get two bombs

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:05.250
first but still sitting pretty and we do

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:09.209
get an arcade so the blood bag

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.750
you know prophecy oh no all of my

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.790
prophecies are coming false right now I

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.130
would spend all of our money here so

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.380
hopefully get a key so let's see what we

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.749
can do is you know pretty fly I think

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.310
that's not unacceptable

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:30.020
we did get a key as far as I'm concerned

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.979
10 cents for a pretty fly and the key is

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.710
not that bad

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.389
I can live with it at least that's not

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.069
our secret room which is kind of blowing

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.509
me away so I mean we don't have any

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:40.180
bombs so we actually have to use a key

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:46.189
here even if the secret room is adjacent

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:51.439
first things sack not really worth maybe

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:53.060
anything but in fact I'm like does this

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:55.490
contribute to any kinds there a spider

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.400
transformation no II don't believe so so

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.969
we're kind of just out here this would

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:05.569
be a great time to get Guppies head

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:07.779
still conceivable could have easily been

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:15.439
tagged there to be honest with you and

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:20.360
not conceivable any longer out here in

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:22.279
the fields I conceived of my deals I'm

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.659
like I just can't hit that note I'm

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:25.400
trying you might be saying oh you're

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:26.930
singing wrong no you're the throat

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.750
doesn't constrict enough to make that

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:33.139
note hittable my throat at least face

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.449
reward I put my back into my lemon thank

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.229
you I appreciate it very much

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:37.759
appreciated faith reward hey is

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:40.399
something I mean we got more than enough

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:41.889
HP to feel completely safe about doing

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:45.110
this wouldn't be a bad time to get a

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:47.240
joker card lovers is not worth much

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.639
considering our present situation chaos

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.860
okay now you can start to think about it

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.080
you know what I like to call the chaos

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.740
card because I'm doing my impression of

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:01.610
petyr baelish from Game of Thrones the

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:04.099
cod looks like a lad well I mean is

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.860
still given us something here so keep

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:09.649
going for it I mean I was actually like

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:14.050
relatively worth it we got something out

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:17.899
of these three keys of catacombs one

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:19.399
what we need I mean now we need more to

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:21.199
use hilariously enough we basically put

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:22.699
our keys in a key bagger but it's a key

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:27.199
bagger that always paid out until the

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:29.240
one time it didn't which strikes me as a

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:30.860
better opportunity to use your keys than

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.899
trying to get like you know a humbling

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.529
bundle after 30 keys donated or an

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:37.069
attack

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:39.319
after 30 Keys donated the Kaos card now

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:42.169
brings to mind you know we should

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:43.579
consider fighting hush if there's a

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:46.039
reason to fight hush we should consider

00:06:43.579 --> 00:06:49.399
fighting hush because the chaos card

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:50.929
makes that fight a very very small price

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:52.459
to pay for getting too doubled item

00:06:50.929 --> 00:06:53.659
rooms and you know right now it doesn't

00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:56.059
look like a shop is going to be worth

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:58.129
much for us but that can change over the

00:06:56.059 --> 00:07:01.909
course of a whole run I mean it's very

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:04.519
much in its infancy here early on come

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:05.059
on with the you know I mean I'm good

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:07.189
thank you

00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:11.089
we got another key that key should go to

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:13.809
the item room don't let the siren song

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:16.729
of the golden chest trick you too much

00:07:13.809 --> 00:07:17.959
to be honest with you there probably is

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:19.429
a case well you know there's an

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:20.719
empirical analysis to be done to

00:07:19.429 --> 00:07:25.179
determine whether or not this is the

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:27.889
case but it's possible that getting a

00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:29.929
heareth on card for a key like we did

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:31.609
out of the angelic chest is actually a

00:07:29.929 --> 00:07:34.429
better expected value than the average

00:07:31.609 --> 00:07:36.469
item room for a key but obviously the

00:07:34.429 --> 00:07:39.769
variance is a little lower as well which

00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:41.449
is unfortunate because we would love to

00:07:39.769 --> 00:07:43.479
get like a you know God ed or something

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:45.860
out of it if possible it is pretty good

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:47.689
speed upgrade that means we can absorb

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.969
that's how I think about speed upgrades

00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:52.639
now it's first off if our speed is bad

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:54.649
then obviously it's nice but even if our

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:56.689
speed is good this means that we can now

00:07:54.649 --> 00:07:59.089
absorb a speed downgrade without being

00:07:56.689 --> 00:08:01.009
too cheesed about it so we can get like

00:07:59.089 --> 00:08:02.899
small rock now we can get kidney stone

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:03.919
not that that's something we'd aspire to

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:06.409
but we can get kidney stone without

00:08:03.919 --> 00:08:09.019
thinking it's too rough that was a bad

00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:11.959
kick but it still worked and I mean at

00:08:09.019 --> 00:08:15.799
this point why not just see what you got

00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:16.940
could have been a good shop was not but

00:08:15.799 --> 00:08:22.940
that's okay

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:26.900
I think it's very short-sighted it is

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:28.820
lacking vision to use the chaos card to

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:31.430
kill Gertie junior Gertie juniors

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:33.500
already half dead have you seen how long

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:35.030
it takes to kill hush I have if you

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.190
don't watch the dailies you should first

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:40.880
off because you know my livelihood

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:42.800
secondly though because you'll get a

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.780
really appreciation for how long those

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.670
hush fights can be in certain situations

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.230
so we get a range upgrade and a lock

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:56.630
upgrade along with the penny and then

00:08:48.230 --> 00:09:00.200
five five table d5 demon chest for chole

00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:06.740
bombs three blue flies two spirit hearts

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:09.740
and til that has given health up you

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:11.480
gotta admit considering that song was

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:15.260
written at runtime

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:16.910
it was appropriate at least so that also

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:20.780
we beat the odds to get to deal with the

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:22.010
devil and then sadly the payoff from the

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.410
deal with the devil is kind of garbage

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:30.470
but it's the way the cookie crumbles

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:30.860
sometimes it's not like actually never

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.750
mind

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:35.300
it is like it hurts our chances because

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:37.100
it does compromise our deal with the

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.570
devil chances on his floor or as I call

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:41.030
them our deal with the chapel's

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:42.290
apparently it compromises our deal with

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.610
the devil chances on this floor to have

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.170
gotten a bad deal with the devil lasts

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.490
for it's going to compromise it whether

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.140
it's good or bad but the fact that it

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:50.180
was bad means it's compromising it for

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.880
effectively nothing but hey all we got

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:55.730
to do is beat the odds again and then

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:57.400
then we're through the woods okay I mean

00:09:55.730 --> 00:10:00.260
it's great I'll break is an awesome item

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.940
I'm extremely pleased to have it we're

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:07.670
continually getting like just enough

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:10.339
keys to be happy but you could get too

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:12.650
few keys to be happy so just enough as

00:10:10.339 --> 00:10:14.270
far as I'm concerned is completely fine

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:17.540
now we're looking for things that

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:19.820
synergize with this so honestly number

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:22.400
two seem any anything that does damage

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:24.680
over the scope of the room I think is

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:27.740
valuable enough to consider as useful

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:29.450
here like do they nerf chariot cards

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.630
because like I swear used to be able to

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:34.680
run into any not

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:36.030
boss enemy and kill him anyway so toxic

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.980
shock would also be awesome if we could

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:39.960
if we could get the teamwork to make the

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:42.330
dream work there and you know the

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:45.150
outbreaks gonna spread here so these

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:47.880
guys are totally dusted you don't have

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:51.240
to pay attention to the outbreak to make

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:53.250
it work but you know I we're still got

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.860
we've still got three point five damage

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:57.960
here so we're kind of bringing up the

00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:01.500
rear when it comes to that all we need

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:03.450
to do is hopefully survive long enough

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.130
to get a good payout there I mean

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.690
outbreak again it helps we're getting

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.370
some things that make it easier for us

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:10.830
to deal damage or you either to kill

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:14.520
enemies with low damage like 2020s

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:16.290
another great example but there's no

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.120
substitute most of the time for just

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:19.650
getting some raw damage there's like one

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.780
substitute in the substitute is mom's

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:25.550
knife even Brynn stone usually requires

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:28.500
a little bit of damage leverage but I

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:30.510
will say you know outbreaks got a chance

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:33.060
it's helping us out I mean the runs good

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:35.550
look at our HP we're completely we also

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:40.260
what we got a damage upgrade from being

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:42.300
on this room but but how I'm looking at

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:49.230
our items and I'm like no seriously but

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:51.450
how we got like it's like the longer you

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:55.280
survive on a room without break the more

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:58.490
damage you get oh no it's you you idiot

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.490
Samson's lock

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.660
it's not grade but hey you know I'm not

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:05.370
going to turn up my nose of some damage

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:08.760
upgrades at this point I'm not going to

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:10.350
turn up my nose like the skater girl

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:12.450
wait now she wasn't a skater girl that's

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:16.590
the problem like the girl in skater boy

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:19.230
by Avril Lavigne all of her friends

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:21.360
turned up their nose because they had a

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:25.070
problem with his baggy clothes you know

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:28.140
what you judgemental teams you deserve

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:29.970
to be pooped on by him when he makes it

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:33.540
big on the X Games I think sure that's a

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:35.220
career that lasts for about you know 14

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:38.040
minutes of TV time give or take but you

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:41.430
turned up your noses at his baggy

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:45.870
clothes this you judgmental so-and-so's

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:49.380
I mean sure Avril Lavigne wrote a song

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:52.680
of value and then forever you are

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:55.380
enshrined as a jerk because of the

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:59.300
things you did is a 16 year old but

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:59.300
you're the dick in this situation

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:06.210
doesn't mean the song was probably not

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.880
actually written about any real-world

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:10.890
situation it's not controversial to say

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:14.400
let me choose she probably just made

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:16.350
skater boy up you think this was the

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.360
most likely outcome I'd say she tried me

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:20.040
the skater boy and that's not bad it's

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:23.460
not only it makes a song any worse I'm

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:27.780
just trying to keep it you know on the

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:29.220
level here oh my Lanta so we picked up

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:33.630
my shadow from the deal with the devil

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:35.340
which is like fair to say it's not

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:38.670
something to get too excited about

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:40.050
however if we can get like IV bag which

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:44.010
we can't get here but if we can somehow

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:45.780
get IV bag you know on the next floor we

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:48.450
can start to make a lot of shadows and

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:52.460
then you know maybe one day that somehow

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.460
correlates with us crushing it

00:13:55.130 --> 00:14:00.000
but for now we're kind of in like the

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:03.990
world's longest holding pattern here

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.130
well we try to come up with with

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:06.690
something that makes us a little bit

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:09.750
more excited about this run like it

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:13.920
would go a long way for my enjoyment if

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:16.980
we could if we can get a great item room

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:19.740
here runs not terrible again like 2020

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:21.240
is 2020 and outbreak are doing all the

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:22.980
heavy lifting but we are starting to

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.110
approach the point where I think even

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:27.210
despite getting 2020 I'm literally the

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:30.390
first room we walked into we didn't

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:34.110
spawn into I can start to be like we are

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:35.730
and geez kind of dried up on this one we

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:37.500
we've gotten or Babylon but there's been

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:39.930
no way to make Whore of Babylon work and

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:41.400
then you know we've got to deal with the

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:42.840
devil that ended up being garbage we

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.610
keep stalking ourselves well with spirit

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.710
arts we're like no risk of imminent

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:49.800
death but you know life can come at you

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:51.600
pretty fast later on that's what has me

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.950
worried a little bit I think we got

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:57.420
lucky that guy was moving at the end

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:59.900
there there's a lot of items that can

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:02.750
bridge the gap for us right now though

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:05.310
like just off the top of my head pyro

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:07.830
obviously dr. fetus epic fetus but even

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:10.530
just getting pyro would be like enough

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:15.950
99 bombs we could use two bombs per room

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:18.540
and almost certainly by the end of our

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:20.070
by the end of our bombs we would have

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:23.280
gotten an item that would make life a

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:24.960
little bit more survivable for us here

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:29.850
at least you know enemy life a little

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:31.350
bit less survivable that I mean the sad

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:34.920
thing is we can't afford to take that

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:39.780
damage but we shouldn't that's just as

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:42.750
lazy damage right there I'm not trying

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:45.330
to mimics outbreak too much but if we

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:47.280
can get the first enemy to die near a

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:50.190
lot of other enemies this guy is having

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:56.340
some trouble that's the dream sissy

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:58.260
longlegs is very very good as like it's

00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:01.230
a kind of item you're always going to be

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:03.510
a little happy to have so I'm certainly

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:05.330
not anti sissy longlegs but it's not

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:08.890
quite the

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.890
the cool we were hoping for I think

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:16.010
that's okay you know more the more

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:18.470
spiders the merrier

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:23.930
I mean they are going to do double 3.50

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:29.030
damage which is not a ton but certainly

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:30.260
not nothing plus F can you hate sissy

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:32.270
long oh just kind of walking around

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.680
there being like hey mind if I make your

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:36.140
run slightly better and you're like no

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:38.510
sissy long legs thanks for donating your

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:41.900
time to make my run slightly better that

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:43.100
was there is so no reason for us to take

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:55.970
damage I'm not even going to talk about

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:58.670
the second hit but that's bad yeah yeah

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:59.870
somehow open I thought we were

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:04.940
completely out of the hip box I got

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:06.589
overly cocky so there is a tinted rock I

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:09.860
get you to shoot over here because I've

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:10.940
used all my bombs I guess he has no eyes

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:17.270
so he doesn't really know where we are

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:19.250
so we still got to deal with the devil

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:22.130
and the deal with the devil of course

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:24.380
was my shadow I'm thinking about my

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:25.390
shadow when you gonna bring it pointing

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:30.340
it'll bring it

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:32.330
we are just like being starved here

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:33.950
again this kind of run is hard to

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:35.840
complain about you at 20/20 right off

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:37.370
the bat and then complain people think

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:41.060
you're being very ungrateful and does

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:44.300
some extent they're not wrong but you're

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:47.120
on floor six all your stats but speed

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:51.400
and and luck are basically at the

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:55.640
default level leaves you in a an

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:58.400
enviable spot the run as so much leeway

00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:00.590
when it comes to surviving like that's

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.510
if we were on like two HP we'd probably

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:03.740
be dead and you know the amount of

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:06.980
spirit hearts we got on this run was

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:08.090
ridiculous but if we were on to HP we

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:11.030
probably wouldn't have made it but we're

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:13.220
on five plus infinity apparently so

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:14.900
that's I mean more options I think is

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:16.580
fine then we'll donate as much money as

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.690
we can here to try to you know amp up

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.730
our luck facts or at least

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:22.039
a little bit we got a two-cent key that

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:24.289
doesn't happen all that often we did get

00:18:22.039 --> 00:18:29.059
a luck upgrade so it ended up working

00:18:24.289 --> 00:18:30.799
out but we we need more and I'm not

00:18:29.059 --> 00:18:33.200
ashamed to say it at this point maybe

00:18:30.799 --> 00:18:35.269
you know 10 minutes ago that it sends

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:39.049
the wrong message but right now this run

00:18:35.269 --> 00:18:40.879
is real bad from a stat standpoint it's

00:18:39.049 --> 00:18:42.470
got some good utility it's in a

00:18:40.879 --> 00:18:45.679
comfortable place but that's going to

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:48.139
change you know it's like we're in an

00:18:45.679 --> 00:18:51.169
armchair that has a time bomb strapped

00:18:48.139 --> 00:18:52.549
to it sure may is a lazy boy but that

00:18:51.169 --> 00:18:55.600
doesn't mean you want to sit in it until

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:55.600
it literally blows up

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:10.730
so we're just going to keep you know

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:12.020
doing that we're leaving consumables

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:13.250
behind because I'm kind of trying to go

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.570
a little bit faster I'm willing to

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:17.390
sacrifice spirit hours to get into this

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:22.700
curse room and hopefully pop but we need

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:24.020
to get something a teleport card gear

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.840
would allow me to get into boss rush and

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:28.700
get out so I would be into it we want to

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.140
come back for chaos luckily we don't to

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.120
worry about it because we've cards look

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:34.000
kind of garbage

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:41.000
this item room is of the like

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:42.860
unbelievable utmost importance no you

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.970
don't get a chance to you don't get a

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:48.500
chance to go as close as we probably are

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:51.380
to the boss room I don't think we're

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:52.850
gonna I mean even this is not that good

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:55.540
but I don't think we're going to be able

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:58.460
to make boss rush honestly hey once

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:59.960
algae's also good but you got to keep

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.460
the chaos card at this point even if we

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.010
only use it for one boss like at the

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:05.930
very end

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:08.360
juicy sack is just okay it's not bad

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:09.980
it's just okay and then you know

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:14.150
honestly that describes a lot of the

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:16.190
items we picked up on this run you know

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:19.300
we're trying to build a good University

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:23.860
transcript here out of just see pluses

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:25.640
again you know C's get degrees man but

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:29.890
trying to be a little bit more

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:29.890
entertaining and impressive here and

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:34.990
really starting to get to the point

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:37.730
where I'm not sure it's going to happen

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:40.310
like I'm tempted to open that golden

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:41.810
chest despite the fact that it'll

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:42.920
definitely cost me a spirit all right

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:46.610
now I'm not going to do it because it's

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:53.390
just actually stupid but the temptation

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:54.950
is genuinely there all we can really do

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:58.340
I think is have hope that it's going to

00:20:54.950 --> 00:21:00.140
come together here that was by the way

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:03.710
our last opportunity for there's options

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:07.190
or more options as well so what's going

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:09.860
on here many bombs many keys and and

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:11.070
battery charges that we're never going

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:14.580
to be able to use

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:16.409
I don't think we're gonna make boss rush

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:18.230
regardless so I straight out I think

00:21:16.409 --> 00:21:22.970
you'd take the time to open that and

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:25.470
then you bet me we'll try to get to it

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:31.440
but I don't think we're I don't think

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:33.450
it's likely leave it at that and I don't

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.559
think we should like overextend

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:36.690
ourselves but I don't even think we

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:38.009
should use bombs to try that I just

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:41.340
don't think it's likely at this point

00:21:38.009 --> 00:21:44.039
plus we'd have to fight boss rush so

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:47.070
you're watching like the rare willing

00:21:44.039 --> 00:21:49.049
opt-out of boss rush it's just not it's

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:57.240
not right for this run takes a lot for

00:21:49.049 --> 00:21:59.690
me to say that trying to keep my APM

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:01.919
upset that that that that doesn't it I

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:03.179
see people doing that in battleground so

00:22:01.919 --> 00:22:05.970
that's how I know that games starting to

00:22:03.179 --> 00:22:12.750
pass me by on the community side let's

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:15.629
go okay here we go we got all good item

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:17.429
and to be honest with you I think I

00:22:15.629 --> 00:22:20.009
might just take sister Maggie for extra

00:22:17.429 --> 00:22:22.529
damage but succubus is not good because

00:22:20.009 --> 00:22:24.659
of the damage buff but that's okay you

00:22:22.529 --> 00:22:26.490
know it's helpful it's good because of

00:22:24.659 --> 00:22:29.399
the damage it'll do without us having to

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:33.889
be right next to an enemy so that's

00:22:29.399 --> 00:22:33.889
really the be-all end-all of this item

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:38.070
then II bloody Penny's got something

00:22:36.509 --> 00:22:44.309
going for it here I think we could we

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:46.230
could definitely consider that it is

00:22:44.309 --> 00:22:47.970
fair to suggest that we need more damage

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:51.629
so maybe Samson's Locke isn't that bad

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:54.629
but and it isn't that bad but it's not

00:22:51.629 --> 00:22:57.110
what we need it doesn't have enough of

00:22:54.629 --> 00:22:57.110
what we need

00:23:02.139 --> 00:23:07.999
if I'm being 100% clear neither its

00:23:05.299 --> 00:23:09.529
succubus we need some day succubus is

00:23:07.999 --> 00:23:11.179
it's an Ouroboros you know it's a

00:23:09.529 --> 00:23:12.830
two-way street that's not what an

00:23:11.179 --> 00:23:15.859
Ouroboros is but you get the idea

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:17.450
it's um this is a situation where we

00:23:15.859 --> 00:23:18.590
need more damage to make succubus do

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:20.149
more damage so that we don't need to

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:23.509
have as much damage as we already have

00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:25.700
like succubus does damage proportional

00:23:23.509 --> 00:23:31.269
to our existing damage stat so it's kind

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:34.210
of bad right now to be honest with you

00:23:31.269 --> 00:23:37.369
we know this bombs are key right yeah

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:39.109
alrighty I think we take this because I

00:23:37.369 --> 00:23:39.830
do think that survival is going to be

00:23:39.109 --> 00:23:45.710
dangerous

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:47.840
starting pretty soon would you say that

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:51.619
your safety is not guaranteed sure you

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:52.580
know why not it's an internet meme we

00:23:51.619 --> 00:23:59.479
got him boys

00:23:52.580 --> 00:24:03.590
I think bloody penny demons tail is

00:23:59.479 --> 00:24:04.849
better if you know or you're confident

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:07.789
at least that you're not going to have

00:24:04.849 --> 00:24:08.749
to use red hearts I'm not that confident

00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:11.749
we're not going to have to use red

00:24:08.749 --> 00:24:14.539
hearts anymore by the way straight up I

00:24:11.749 --> 00:24:19.159
think we're going to probably not make

00:24:14.539 --> 00:24:21.229
the hush fight I would be content to

00:24:19.159 --> 00:24:23.149
make it because as long as we don't whip

00:24:21.229 --> 00:24:25.700
with the chaos guard begin to item rooms

00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:27.379
for golden chests or maybe red chests

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:31.220
depending on how things go but for

00:24:27.379 --> 00:24:33.409
golden chests and a shop and we can

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:36.619
afford the shop so like there's a lot of

00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:40.249
good stuff that we could get as a result

00:24:36.619 --> 00:24:44.840
of being there and we really can use

00:24:40.249 --> 00:24:46.909
anything so I'm not in a position to be

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:48.529
making you know I will only go down so

00:24:46.909 --> 00:24:50.690
if we get something great really like

00:24:48.529 --> 00:24:55.909
anything that improves our damage is

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:57.229
great but I really literally think we

00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:58.639
will not make it I don't think we can

00:24:57.229 --> 00:24:59.509
get there in time I don't think we will

00:24:58.639 --> 00:25:03.590
get there in time

00:24:59.509 --> 00:25:07.440
rather should get the key

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:10.140
and bloody penny is really going to look

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:12.000
idiotic until it doesn't I think it's

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:15.030
the the best way I can describe it is

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.320
probably rated the outset it isn't it

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:18.179
would be great for me if this was never

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:23.880
useful for us on this run that would in

00:25:18.179 --> 00:25:27.330
most cases probably indicate that we we

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:32.780
won to be honest so I would be content

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:34.980
but this is a perfect outbreak room

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:36.990
we're just taking High Priestess for now

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:39.720
as well so we can hopefully you know

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:42.419
poop on the bus loses few spirit arts as

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:44.940
possible but I do expect that you know

00:25:42.419 --> 00:25:47.130
we'll probably end up making bloody

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:48.020
penny prove that it's it's got some

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:59.870
value to it

00:25:48.020 --> 00:26:02.880
sadly dude I don't know like this is

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:06.240
it's funny on the last run we had ninety

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:08.220
damage so we have ninety damage and we

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:10.770
complained we complained for great

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:12.210
reasons because ninety damage doesn't

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:14.040
mean anything if every time you tap the

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:15.870
button there's like a 70% chance to get

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:21.570
hit because you have seven range and nip

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:24.600
attack with mom's eye but the irony is

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:26.660
not lost on me I'll admit that now I'm

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:29.010
on this run and I'm like please God

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.490
provide for me like we're gonna get it

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:34.010
yeah

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:34.010
provide for me something here anything

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:41.940
it's not unreasonable to ask for one

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:44.280
damage upgrade 7 floors into the games

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:45.900
it's very reasons reasonable I would

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.260
like these guys to be on top of one

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:48.030
another

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:49.770
maybe I'm getting stuck in a value trap

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:51.950
though I want a high priestess to hit

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:51.950
both

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:58.930
he's basically a God

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:17.010
still one should be one should be very

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:17.010
close to death I think it's that one Wow

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:23.140
it's not conceivable that they're both

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:24.190
like alive we you know I'll just be

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:25.750
honest with you we earned a deal with

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:28.060
the devil there we didn't get one but we

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:29.250
earned one and I mean that we played

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:33.220
very well there

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:34.900
so now so the bloody penny sweepstakes

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:38.680
everybody the bloody penny sweepstakes

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:40.450
we have three HP and close to base stats

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.410
plus twenty twenty in succubus I know

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:43.330
you're not gonna let me forget about

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:46.930
that one you're right you shouldn't

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:49.240
forget about it but also I'm just it's

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:50.680
speed just like really good and it keeps

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.000
getting better it's not like I wanted to

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.470
tears upgrade or anything like that I

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.360
mean we'll go with here's upgrade beyond

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:57.100
the run like this and probably provide

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.240
us with any benefit whatsoever to do

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.740
more damage to enemies that otherwise

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:03.910
could hurt us I mean what's the point

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:05.980
huh but still dude so we get at least a

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:07.450
couple free plays on this I think we

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:10.300
should say I don't know maybe we

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:11.500
shouldn't I was thinking like nevermind

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:14.820
we don't to worry about a blood bank at

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.820
all why was I even concerned

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:27.220
yeah that's Epps pair that's damage I

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:29.170
deserved this through poor play it's

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:32.650
unfortunate that that lines up with us

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:34.900
you know really really wanting a deal

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:36.970
with devil on this floor we're in a

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:39.670
dangerous place the half spear at heart

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:41.200
helps we need to stay at a half heart

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:44.350
interval as much as possible we got to

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:51.040
play this guy basically what it all

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:55.930
comes down to and you know the standards

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:57.910
Eevee from this guy is one HP and I

00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:59.890
think that that would give us a much

00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:01.690
greater chance of winning although not

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:06.160
as much as like any damage improvement

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:08.550
would probably give us but still not in

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:11.790
a position to really be making demands

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:13.920
oh I thought I had that lined up

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:18.930
perfectly but we should have gone slower

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:22.190
there okay we're back to three and a

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:26.820
half and this is where bloody penny and

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:32.280
Yama hard both show like their chops to

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:34.590
items that have a tendency to get cramps

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:37.650
on a little bit not that commonly used

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:41.280
in this day and age but on this run they

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:43.230
could be the difference man this could

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.270
be a secret room and if it's a secret

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:48.150
room we should try to make a play like

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:51.240
we should try to go you use it as like a

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:54.000
launching point to get to a boss rush

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:55.290
potentially I mean that doesn't really

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.850
interest me bye boss rush i mean hush

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:58.590
fight because really like we can get

00:29:56.850 --> 00:30:00.150
through that hush fight we can get

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:03.350
through the first phase with base stats

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:06.000
that should be like almost no problem

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:07.680
just do not miss with the chaos car -

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.860
your life is over and then the hush

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:11.940
fight we're doing it for the item rooms

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:14.220
at this point and the golden chest

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:18.180
because the shop is maybe not as much of

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:19.350
a lock as it was before that judgement

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:21.480
but the judgment provided us with

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:23.190
something useful anyway you know all

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:25.050
these red hearts I'm looking at him and

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:27.140
I'm thinking one day one day you're

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:29.940
going to give me you're going to give me

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:31.980
something here unlimited bombs I don't

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:38.550
want the heart if possible unlimited

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:42.200
bombs is very good watch battery not as

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:42.200
relevant as we would need it to be here

00:30:43.299 --> 00:30:51.259
so it actually looks like we'll probably

00:30:47.019 --> 00:30:53.389
make the hush fight although I'm not

00:30:51.259 --> 00:30:54.470
sold that this mom's heart fight is

00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:57.129
going to finish that quickly I think

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:59.239
it's going to be a little rough but

00:30:57.129 --> 00:31:00.679
should look for a second secret room

00:30:59.239 --> 00:31:03.109
while we have unlimited bombs and well

00:31:00.679 --> 00:31:07.549
we're here yeah it was an unlikely

00:31:03.109 --> 00:31:12.710
situation to be fair this is a this is a

00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:17.419
tricky one man oh oh you would never

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:23.989
expect that to items from two adjacent

00:31:17.419 --> 00:31:27.859
nubs with a health upgrade the food so

00:31:23.989 --> 00:31:33.679
yeah I mean we want blood clot we want

00:31:27.859 --> 00:31:36.320
placenta why because I did okay but the

00:31:33.679 --> 00:31:38.090
damage upgrade from blood clot half of

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:41.749
our tears do double damage instance like

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:44.269
the 20/20 thing is good and I'm again in

00:31:41.749 --> 00:31:47.809
like actually no position to be mad

00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:52.820
about it at all but we would love some

00:31:47.809 --> 00:31:55.279
raw statistical improvement even 18%

00:31:52.820 --> 00:32:00.049
deal with the devil if possible I would

00:31:55.279 --> 00:32:01.909
prefer not to squander that I have I put

00:32:00.049 --> 00:32:04.609
us in a really really tough position on

00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:08.029
that dodge there was a much better way

00:32:04.609 --> 00:32:11.379
to approach that that probably leads to

00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:11.379
me being 20 times safer

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:25.290
we might not make the hush fight dude

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:31.500
succubus take out the nub please please

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:33.660
please now we kind of bricked it

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:36.360
honestly so we're going to miss the hush

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:38.910
fly but there is a bright side Isaac's

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:43.020
gonna eat this chaos card the dude is

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:44.580
done just might as well get to a half

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:47.040
heart as we head down on the next floor

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:48.960
or head up to the next floor rather they

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:51.030
are dead set on not improving our base

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:53.310
damage on this run and if you still

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:54.810
think like that's not something worth

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:58.020
complaining about giving the blood clot

00:32:54.810 --> 00:33:02.340
pick up on most runs and I'm not this is

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:04.050
just a study of you know society is not

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:05.910
like a mathematical analysis on most

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:07.980
runs you would pick up blood clot you'd

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:10.020
be like oh cool blood clot on this run

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:14.910
we're like blood clot has come to save

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:16.530
us so you know that perception should

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:19.770
tell you a little bit about the

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:24.120
statistical look of this run right now

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:26.310
ie is weird so we got tons of hearts

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:28.830
that means you should definitely go in

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:32.520
this room it's nothing but I mean the

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:34.740
flies not insignificant oh thank you

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:39.810
placenta or maybe I walked over a heart

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:42.930
I just didn't really see I think it was

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:44.610
placenta uh don't don't squander hearts

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:47.970
like don't take damage unnecessarily

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:50.460
these hearts may come in extreme handy

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:51.930
later the ideal situation here by the

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:54.930
way is to get a gyro rune the trout's

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:56.430
gyro rune drops we use our chaos card to

00:33:54.930 --> 00:34:00.810
kill eyes that go back to wherever the

00:33:56.430 --> 00:34:02.370
era rune is and take that down to the

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:04.980
next floor because I don't think four

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:07.020
items are going to do it if we're

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:09.270
talking about Turk this dis run it's

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:14.550
gotten almost no chance of being like a

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:16.950
great run it could be a fun run with a

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:19.790
good combination of four items a couple

00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:21.440
items we'll just do it by itself but

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:26.300
you know if we get a peek at we're

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:28.280
probably set for example so I just had

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:39.620
to rub my eye a little bit there I don't

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:46.429
like these enemies oh I thought we could

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:48.290
beat the system there three point five

00:34:46.429 --> 00:34:50.929
then when you're when your luck starts

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:54.610
to out crest you're damaged you know you

00:34:50.929 --> 00:34:54.610
know something's gotten terribly awry

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:11.340
I'm like I'm stun I'm lost for words I'm

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:15.030
at a loss for words that's probably the

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:16.740
expression like what do you say about

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:21.300
this run I haven't complained about

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:22.530
already did we get contract from below

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:25.410
or was that on our last row there might

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:27.600
have been on our last run I'd be happy

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:29.610
to have it if it showed up because you

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:32.610
know our luck stat is fine being able to

00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:39.990
double our our chests would be really

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:42.060
useful at the present moment we're

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:44.550
really we were lucky we got six HP

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:50.340
because we can have a little bit more

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:53.790
leeway to make the world work but I mean

00:35:50.340 --> 00:36:01.830
we are sincerely just sort of eating it

00:35:53.790 --> 00:36:03.930
right now it's just not good I'm not

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:05.790
taking it out on ten twenty twenty if I

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:07.260
did a Power Rankings twenty twenty still

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:10.350
up there do 20 20

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:12.119
you know what 20 20 20 20 I'd vote for

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:16.800
it see that's a joke about it running in

00:36:12.119 --> 00:36:18.630
an election you're probably saying why'd

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.730
you say on election instead of the

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:22.140
American presidential election other

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:25.710
countries are going to have elections in

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:29.310
2020 you jerk

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:32.820
it's very presumptuous of you okay no ha

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:34.350
ha ha yeah maybe you know your ask any

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:35.910
when they come over for a potluck then I

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:39.060
Drive all the way across the city and

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:40.500
you all did you sorry I forgot to get

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:42.330
any food I thought you were going to

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:43.640
bring it all that's I mean the metaphor

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:47.760
makes no sense to me

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:50.640
is this it is spun okay our first damage

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:52.410
upgrade and then our next damage upgrade

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:55.619
now we have ten damaged these are good

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:58.680
items good enough to make the run easy

00:36:55.619 --> 00:37:03.150
no but I think good enough to make the

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:06.090
run and win if we were in a dicey spot

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:08.160
to begin with so it is we still have the

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:11.780
base rate of fire and base rate of fire

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:14.430
ten point five damage is not even like

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:15.560
well you might be like seven and a half

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:21.660
out of ten

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:22.950
but it's definitely not nine but 2020

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.480
does pull it back in minute yeah we

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:27.780
might be in like the age range now with

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:29.220
2020 and you know outbreak is doing a

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:31.410
little bit less heavy lifting now that's

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:33.350
because it has to do less heavy lifting

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:36.470
now enemies are so much Tangier and

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:39.690
fewer and far between on most rooms

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:42.240
can't spread as easily but we got to

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:44.880
keep stay vigilant basically we're a

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:55.410
perfect match for rag man like rag man

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:57.240
is going to get pooped on luck

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:59.100
we need more drops I mean we have like

00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:01.500
more drops we're going to win at this

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:03.750
point I'd give us like a 95% chance to

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:05.550
win just not really cocky that's kind of

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:08.430
like the average wind chance I think on

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:11.700
most Isaac runs so I think we're up

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:13.230
there now but it was this was a slog

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:17.460
hopefully it was at least entertaining

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:20.880
at times because the quality of the run

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:24.600
is quite poor temperance is kind of an

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:25.560
interesting get right now you might be

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.700
saying well you should play it because

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.590
you have bloody penny and then you got

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:30.750
young hard you know in case the bloody

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:32.970
penny stuff doesn't work out that well

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:34.860
and you're not wrong but the problem is

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:37.340
that there's no reason like what are we

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:40.980
looking for blood bag we get the 7 HP

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:42.870
we're already had the speedcap like it

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:44.490
just it provides us with very little

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:50.910
benefit unless we get sacks instead of

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:52.500
pennies so if we were at like 2 HP I

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:54.000
think I'd have to start thinking about

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.800
it because getting that third level of

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.100
HP might be useful although it would be

00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:03.360
riskier to play in the first place but

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:04.650
at 6 HP we're we're doing fine and we're

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:08.040
probably going to we're probably going

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:09.330
to bring this one home it's just one of

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.320
those runs where you're like ok I mean

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:12.510
thanks for the help

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:16.050
could you spread out the damage upgrade

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:17.070
so I got one well you know we weren't on

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:19.290
the chest

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:22.830
it's just lifetime to experience doing

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:26.400
decent damage and also like man some of

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:28.480
these rooms were a rat all freaking

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:30.830
order

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:33.440
we made it thank you to succubus

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:36.350
outbreak in and 2024 really making the

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:38.780
dream work on that one finish this run

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:40.190
go get my blood pressure back to normal

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:41.920
and hopefully on the next round we're

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:49.430
not quite as doomed

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:53.480
why does do bombs I mean we should go

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:54.440
for the shoot well that's terrible

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:56.510
I'm going to say we should go for the

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:59.750
virus I was missing with some of these

00:39:56.510 --> 00:40:01.730
2020 shots and that was ill-advised luck

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:04.400
give me some luck you not giving me any

00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:05.900
lucky of me steam cell it's like a why

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:12.110
pick it up why not pick it up sort of

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:15.980
situation speed down I mean you can take

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:18.620
it as like a joke what we could do with

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:20.450
temperance is I mean if we have extra HP

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:24.320
there's sort of no reason not to do it

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:27.020
except for you know at some point you've

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:29.150
got to factor in the value that you'd

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:30.950
expect to get worth like versus the

00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:34.030
amount of your own life that you're

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:36.290
going to trade to it like I'm giving you

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:37.550
minutes out of my life to play this

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:41.240
blood bank that I will never get back

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:43.490
unless we invent a you know immortal

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:49.340
life or something like that I'm Odin Joe

00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:50.840
in mouths words but we could we could

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:54.560
eat it on this room to be honest you

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:56.590
have a lot of eyes there's eyes

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.590
everywhere

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.580
like so we have a resource to play it

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:06.080
but like what's the point I'll dude

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:08.150
please I'm begging you

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:12.830
young hard you've been so good but to

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:16.820
get a great outbreak play by the way but

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:18.680
to get shoopdawhoop here I'd be the

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:21.140
happiest of all campers all right well

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:22.550
you know I wasn't like I was invested in

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:23.540
the chance of getting that item or

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:25.760
anything like that I mean I was just

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:28.190
hoping that I could kill enemies without

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:30.800
it taking a hundred years but I guess

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:32.060
you know we should all be so lucky who

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:34.610
wants to live forever

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:37.510
that's not how Freddie Mercury sounds

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:39.680
this is an old-timey radio announcer

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:43.580
perilous news the Endon burg have gone

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:45.680
down do a whole episode in that voice I

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:47.780
will have no throat left by the end of

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:55.460
that but I appreciate your desire for

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:57.140
fresh content don't get me wrong okay we

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:59.360
should open that because every item is

00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:02.780
it is a blind bag chance at happiness

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:06.200
and that's not going to do it might be a

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:08.750
passive but at this point I want to win

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:10.220
with as little as possible or get an

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:11.660
amazing item because if we win with as

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:12.200
little as possible I can take more

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:19.780
credit

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:19.780
oh you are going to get so highly dusted

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:28.010
blue baby highly dusted doo doo doo doo

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:33.430
doo and that's what you get for giving

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:38.000
me no damage can't the tears upset we're

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:40.300
giving it's easy to do because there's

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.300
none

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:48.200
don't even you know what give me the

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:50.180
void floor so I can deny you the same

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:52.220
way you denied me happiness here okay

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:54.650
well anyway that's a win and as always

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:55.700
