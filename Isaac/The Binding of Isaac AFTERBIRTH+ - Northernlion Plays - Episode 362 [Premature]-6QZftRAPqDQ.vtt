00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.540
everybody welcome Xing on the line

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.740
please the binding of issac a truth plus

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.500
we're just gonna do an even run today

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.010
because we can I'm going to keep it on

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.230
hardmode

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.290
because we can and this might actually

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.199
be a candidate for our first loss on

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:22.590
this save file 8 PP 0

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:24.539
yo serve so here we sit on the room

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.990
awaiting something how does this even

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:34.399
start look a bad is the easy answer we

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:38.790
have good rate of fire

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:41.700
babish damage horrible HP that's the the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.500
crux of it speeds fine battery baby is

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.850
irrelevant with our existing spacebar

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.570
item but could in the future do

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.700
something for us 2 of hearts is actually

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.070
not bad it's like a saving grace of

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.730
things go terribly wrong so we need HP

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.469
on this floor or you know more excellent

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.180
would be to get like nine lives but the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.140
odds of that are pretty low I don't even

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.549
know if we have wait what unlocks so I

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.840
mean this is butter bean but I don't

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.770
know if there was ever the ability for

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.030
it to be anything but butter bean so

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.350
we're just going to fart and try to keep

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.229
enemies at bay and who knows maybe this

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.549
will be one of those runs in which we

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.290
get a little bit of fondness for an item

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.390
that we really don't like altogether

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:28.320
that much I've never loved this item

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.030
butter bean butter bing bada boom this

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.490
is a weird reference I mean I think

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.860
that's something that you say like if

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.140
you're playing a stereotypical like

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.030
Italian like cosa nostra sort of mafia

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.400
guy in a movie but also there's a

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.890
restaurant in Canada called Eastside

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.810
Mario's which is why I say Mario instead

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.700
of Mario because they're some reason

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.200
they say East Side Mario's and in the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.030
commercial there's an Italian guy who

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.860
goes East Side Mario's these son Mario's

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.549
how about a little bada-bing and you

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.590
know yeah your name is like Joe Johnson

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.619
I don't know if you should be doing that

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.649
ad but I'll run it by Robert and we'll

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.329
figure out if it's okay or not okay we

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.729
got to go back for the item room as much

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.769
as I wish we did not

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.870
as a kid Eastside Mario's was like my

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:16.140
favorite restaurant to go to bottomless

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.370
bread bottomless salad bottomless soup

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.780
at least at the time you know the

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.000
economy's changed a little bit since

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.920
then I haven't been to an Eastside

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.370
Mario's and forever it's one of those

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.140
restaurants Vancouver is rebukes it was

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.340
like it dis will blow your mind if

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.150
you're from Canada but you've never been

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.269
to Vancouver

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.519
we have no Swiss chalets and I believe

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.849
we have no Eastside Mario's which are

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:41.430
actually Eastside Mario's Mario Mario

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.579
Luigi Mario this is Eastside Mario my

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.620
restaurant owning brother also a great

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.500
restaurant to take your kids to because

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.640
hey they had trivia on the screen that

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.379
you could play with these weird little

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.549
consoles you could rent for your table

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:58.079
and B they would give you peanuts in the

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.129
shell and then you can eat the peanuts

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.470
and then just throw the shells on the

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.790
ground this is a beautiful time to be

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.290
alive oh wow

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.730
good I'm excited except I'm not excited

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.489
because we just took I'm excited I

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.019
should have gone for the card in

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.450
hindsight definitely but even like in

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:20.069
foresight we probably should have gone

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:23.299
for the card so as long as I mean this

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:26.130
isn't the worst enemy to be excited

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.260
obviously is not the best enemy to be

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.900
excited the best enemy would be no enemy

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:36.209
ever maybe a kind of a trick question

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:39.470
but yeah he's excited now we mostly at

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:43.950
the present moment have to watch out for

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:51.450
the moving attack that could do one full

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:55.560
heart I'm not completely sure wow I hate

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:58.040
this god I'm excited to do it

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.040
why

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:12.030
it didn't have to be like this holy crap

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:16.230
we're gonna go back for that half part

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.610
that was a nightmare man we also are not

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.130
really much better off for the next

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.720
floor to be honest with you but uh you

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.640
know we did what we could

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.010
the I'm excited pill was the big mess up

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.960
here who knows what that card could have

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.900
been it might have been garbage but it

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.470
might have also not been garbage which

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.650
is what I was banking on ideally bomb

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.660
please okay well we might as well like

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.580
kick this over so that we can get both

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:47.650
of those when we get a chance at least

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:51.010
but yeah bomb please wow these guys

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.470
don't get affected by the knock back I'm

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.360
glad I didn't leave it till the last

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.340
minute to give it an attempt there if

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.390
butter bean just did like a little

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:04.810
damage I would be so much less on edge

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.250
right now it did save us I mean in a way

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.560
I wouldn't say I got a newfound

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.330
appreciation for butter bean but I sort

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.230
of I feel like I understand it more at

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:16.000
this point but it's like why would you

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.240
ever I mean has a kind of a false

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.700
dilemma here but you got butter bean you

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.500
got telepathy telepathy is just it's

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:28.600
actually better than butter bean in

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:30.370
literally every single way it recharges

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.220
so you all know butter bean recharges

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.780
too so they're equal on that but it

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:40.900
allows you to shoot the bullets back at

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:42.460
the other enemies do damage to them just

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.930
doesn't have enough going for it to be

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.310
excited about like it says like a panic

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.630
you know

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.880
save yourself sort of situation that

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.520
might be okay okay this this is no joke

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.460
this bomb could actually like change the

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.560
scope of the game right now and it's

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.630
been good we got a half or sorry we got

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.940
a full spirit heart the golden key is

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.310
nice but we've got another bomb that we

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.690
can use right here and that's also nice

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.460
although I'm a little surprised that

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.370
neither of them paid out to a greater

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.900
magnitude than that

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.060
to spirit arts is good though I'm not

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.669
going to turn on my nose because I've

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.440
got a problem with their baggy clothes

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:27.759
you know I'd be a hater boy see ya later

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:30.759
boy he wasn't good enough for her no

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:34.240
bombs nothing to worry about them I'll

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:35.500
bomb no bombs might get the 15 cents

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.940
which is kind of a surprise considering

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.810
we spent money on the last floor

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:44.259
although only three cents we do also

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:46.180
have that was actually idiotic of me but

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:49.320
we do have another Tintin Rock if we get

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.669
super lucky as well okay hey brain stop

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.440
doing that thing you do starring Tom

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:55.599
Hanks we don't need to be that

00:06:53.440 --> 00:07:00.280
aggressive about this situation right

00:06:55.599 --> 00:07:04.660
here you're making things more

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:06.130
cumbersome than they need to be you

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.220
still got the half spirit art that's

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:10.509
valuable there is no need for it to ever

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.550
get to that point please give me a

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:14.380
sphere on our back nothing another pill

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.120
to we don't know a moon card which is

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.919
actually valuable if this is Krampus we

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.050
could always get out of there you know

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:22.659
what it's our first third deal with the

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:24.400
angel attempt here then had to happen at

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:29.470
some point and I'm happy that it is

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:31.510
going to happen but obviously not really

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:33.070
a big get for us right now to get ghost

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:35.889
baby in there at some point we'll have

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.750
to buy ghost baby a run this fragile I

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:41.560
don't know if it's the right time that's

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:42.039
all I'll say about that kind of surprise

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.800
myself

00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:46.030
I thought these first few to be honest

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.550
too I thought there was a chance that

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:50.500
like the first 30 runs or something of

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:53.500
this new save file would be kind of

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:56.229
boring but it turns out that you know

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:59.830
the mechanics that make Isaac a fun game

00:07:56.229 --> 00:08:01.960
to begin with you absolutely still make

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:04.599
it fun even when not all the items exist

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.280
and it's forcing me to play on the back

00:08:04.599 --> 00:08:07.870
foot a little bit here which I quite

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:11.650
like as well so we're going to take

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:14.080
portable slot because we can oh there

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:15.909
was a tinted rock I'm a little obsessed

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.590
with trying to get the shop upgrades I

00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:20.949
don't think it's a bad idea but it's

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:22.449
unnecessary right now

00:08:20.949 --> 00:08:24.120
without a doubt because we could use a

00:08:22.449 --> 00:08:26.610
bomb there and get a lot of value but

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:29.199
anyway I digress

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:31.150
bad gas and I guess we might as well

00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:32.349
take Blitzer doesn't matter too much we

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.089
can use portable slop for some cool

00:08:32.349 --> 00:08:35.229
things but mostly yep ofor is a pretty

00:08:34.089 --> 00:08:36.310
good pickup there as long as they're

00:08:35.229 --> 00:08:38.979
paying attention to the way they were

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:40.180
shooting and yet I'm not going to say

00:08:38.979 --> 00:08:42.519
that this is like renewed my love of

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:46.089
Isaac because my love of Isaac has never

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:51.579
died I've always you know liked the game

00:08:46.089 --> 00:08:52.990
a lot mechanically speaking so even if

00:08:51.579 --> 00:08:55.750
the runs seemed like they were getting a

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:57.310
little tired from time to time I was

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.570
always the one having the most fun in

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.370
the room to be honest with you you know

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:05.709
what I just realized our range is not

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:07.449
actually that good I recognize I'm

00:09:05.709 --> 00:09:09.519
talking about a rate of fire well

00:09:07.449 --> 00:09:12.250
exclusively using our orbital to deal

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:14.920
damage but I'm trying to keep our rate

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:17.500
of fire at max while also feeling damage

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.050
with the orbital impossible anyway but

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:21.459
it's been nice to have kind of like a

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.839
opportunity to get more goal oriented in

00:09:21.459 --> 00:09:26.160
the game again which we haven't had that

00:09:22.839 --> 00:09:28.779
for you know at least 5 or 6 months now

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.769
it had become a little routine I guess

00:09:28.779 --> 00:09:31.839
what I'm trying to say

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:35.890
we've only mixed up the routine slightly

00:09:31.839 --> 00:09:39.940
but still the weird charm there that

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:42.279
actually works for us I don't think you

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:43.959
can lean on at before up forever but

00:09:42.279 --> 00:09:47.320
certainly for now it's working pretty

00:09:43.959 --> 00:09:51.540
well just keep firing in exactly the

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:54.130
same direction as long as is possible

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:59.019
we're basically having our rate of fire

00:09:54.130 --> 00:10:01.449
it's pretty good ok to a club's ace of

00:09:59.019 --> 00:10:02.800
clubs you know what hook it up well we

00:10:01.449 --> 00:10:05.560
can't we don't want to ace of clubs of

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.140
two of clubs there's a lot of things you

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:11.230
don't want it I got to think about this

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:17.470
wiliness two kings we really lean as two

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:18.670
King like we should probably I mean we

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:21.010
might want to take the second hand to

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:28.480
begin with but

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:30.160
dummy we should probably try to get like

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.110
ace of clubs to work on a room with a

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.420
lot of junk that we don't care about and

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:36.430
then double the bombs that we get from

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:38.890
it or at least use that as like a stake

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:41.680
to start doubling our bombs because this

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:43.510
say mean as compared to the last row the

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.960
last round was an actual like 11 out of

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.820
10

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.320
those happen now and then once a week or

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:49.510
so you get a run it's just like so

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:52.720
strong there's nothing you could say

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:54.910
that would or nothing you could do that

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:58.170
could really mess it up but in this

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:58.170
situation it's kind of more like

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:06.700
anything can happen might be in our best

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:11.980
interest to first off get rid of the

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:14.170
blister because it's the knock back from

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.460
blister is just terrible I don't know

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:17.110
what I was thinking there when I picked

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.490
it up maybe we have to pick it up maybe

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:21.100
we don't I can't remember if trinkets

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:22.480
are compulsory it's not like we should

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.160
be worried about real platinum god we're

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.230
not going to accidentally unlock it it's

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.270
like the bare minimum number of runs

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:33.340
unlock real platinum God is like you

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:34.420
know 200 but well we have 200 but you

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.400
know it's up there that's what I'm

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:40.060
trying to get in when you factor in

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:42.010
challenges and stuff like that I think

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:43.450
we should let off the gas with that

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:48.130
before I here for a second we know

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:52.210
that's I'm excited um I don't know if we

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:57.880
want to go to the cursory scares me ever

00:11:52.210 --> 00:12:01.410
so slightly so I think we should tell

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.410
you what drop to a clubs out here

00:12:03.339 --> 00:12:19.399
then use ace of clubs I've got a good

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:21.500
feeling about this it works I'm kind of

00:12:19.399 --> 00:12:23.449
surprised which we just get the coupon I

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.860
don't even know you could get that from

00:12:23.449 --> 00:12:25.519
one of these guys we're learning new

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.769
things

00:12:25.519 --> 00:12:29.480
it surprised me you know what let's

00:12:27.769 --> 00:12:31.430
celebrate by possibly calling the whole

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.529
run into question right here no you got

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:36.500
a black heart out of it so basically we

00:12:33.529 --> 00:12:38.529
broke even coupon is you know not a ten

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:41.000
out of ten item but it's pretty good and

00:12:38.529 --> 00:12:42.529
honestly it seems better when shops are

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.320
smaller because it gives us a better

00:12:42.529 --> 00:12:48.380
chance of actually getting the item we

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:52.699
want I think will by the spirit art

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:55.010
anyway but kind of interesting I'm going

00:12:52.699 --> 00:12:57.889
to keep donating to hopefully get us to

00:12:55.010 --> 00:13:01.279
like that extra shop upgrade as quickly

00:12:57.889 --> 00:13:03.320
as possible because three item shops

00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:07.399
unless you have the coupon not really a

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:10.040
ten out of ten actually like a pretty

00:13:07.399 --> 00:13:12.199
sizable detriment for the most part we

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.760
want a fully charged coupon because it

00:13:12.199 --> 00:13:17.570
does give us free deals with the devil

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:18.980
as well if we get a deal with the devil

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:20.329
which now makes it look like we should

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:25.970
have taken ghost baby but who could have

00:13:20.329 --> 00:13:27.290
known that in advance ghost baby is I'm

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:29.570
not going to say always the wrong

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:31.430
decision but certainly not always the

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:32.899
right decision okay dude my orbital game

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:35.240
has been way way way off

00:13:32.899 --> 00:13:37.670
my apologies it's beneath me as a player

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:43.610
even if I you know pride myself on being

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:45.050
veiny as opposed to good there's no

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.490
reason to take this much damage

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:51.440
well there's one reason and that's that

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:53.149
we're still rocking base stats with the

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.949
added value of that before I figure if

00:13:53.149 --> 00:13:58.339
we just take mystery candy or mysterious

00:13:54.949 --> 00:14:00.319
candy once knock it out of the equation

00:13:58.339 --> 00:14:02.329
if necessary might as well do anything

00:14:00.319 --> 00:14:06.019
we could possibly do to insulate

00:14:02.329 --> 00:14:07.940
ourselves from forgetting about it this

00:14:06.019 --> 00:14:10.699
is the floor I can already tell Sacred

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:12.589
Heart might be an on lock might be the

00:14:10.699 --> 00:14:14.829
name of the hospital from Scrubs I can't

00:14:12.589 --> 00:14:14.829
remember

00:14:19.019 --> 00:14:24.100
just kind of like a junkie run so far

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:26.709
but it's good it's good that it's a junk

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:29.860
run even though I'm spinning it a little

00:14:26.709 --> 00:14:31.839
bit because it means that these are not

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:34.120
all easy I was worried that the

00:14:31.839 --> 00:14:35.740
difficulty curve would be like the first

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.570
10 runs here would be the easiest runs

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.250
in the world now we got kind of a quest

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:43.779
going on like how long can we go before

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:45.519
we get a loss on our on our new save

00:14:43.779 --> 00:14:47.230
file what have you got a real platinum

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:48.820
God without getting a single loss is

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:51.490
that even possible don't you have to get

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:55.570
10 deaths to get like some items you

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:57.130
know let's worry about that as we get a

00:14:55.570 --> 00:15:05.769
little further in let's not worry about

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:11.910
that on run for of all places it's a

00:15:05.769 --> 00:15:15.870
little presumptuous perhaps dude I am

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:18.850
behind the 8-ball on this run right now

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:21.970
one spider might surprise you not going

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:24.640
to help that much though least we're

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:26.890
fighting non tanky enemies if we get

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:32.709
that first dodging on them we might be

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:33.550
okay try to keep our rate of fire up

00:15:32.709 --> 00:15:36.070
I'll take anything

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:42.399
DPS rate of fire tier effects brimstone

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:44.829
mom's knife anything you name it dude I

00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:46.660
just looked over at skype I've got two

00:15:44.829 --> 00:15:48.399
skype messages no slow down in the game

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:51.730
I think no slow down in the game at

00:15:48.399 --> 00:15:53.680
least if that's the case we're living in

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:55.720
the 21st century we may or may not be

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.399
doing this doing something mean to it

00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:04.060
doing it better than anybody ever seemed

00:15:57.399 --> 00:16:06.370
doing I knew it I was but I didn't want

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:07.870
to stop firing because I in my heart of

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:09.370
hearts I was like F before is more

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:14.190
valuable and then I ruined that again

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:14.190
okay poor poor poor poor poor plays

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:20.040
don't even try it buddy so I don't know

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.960
what we're going to do about that guy we

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.790
got to change directions to shoot at

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:27.470
that guy unless we can free him from

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:32.420
this nothing he's become there we go

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:35.460
this run cannot stand like this forever

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:38.370
using a single orbital to deal like

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:44.250
almost all of our damage is never gonna

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:45.270
last it can't be done I probably had two

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.620
minds about it I was going to say I

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:50.250
probably shouldn't have even taken the

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:51.600
HP because we might get rid of some of

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.040
it if we get to a deal with the devil

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.150
but we can always use the coupon and

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.740
keep our deal with the angel chance

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.960
alive instead while getting items for

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:59.430
free or at least get one copy for free

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.090
and then a lot of items are actually

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:05.550
pretty good

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:07.320
- all my lanta if I was less mad I would

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:09.810
have said a swear word but I was so mad

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:13.459
I've resorted to oh mylanta that's how

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:17.630
you know I'm I'm just just cheesed off

00:17:13.459 --> 00:17:20.100
so I'm actually really glad we took the

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:21.540
the extra hard because if we didn't take

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:23.640
the extra heart we'd be on half a heart

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:26.570
right now I mean we'd go back for it but

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:30.050
we'd be nervous in the interim period

00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:30.050
yeah we need that

00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:44.490
let's just do this please be smart pig

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:47.669
crickets head get that damage upgrade

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:51.409
it's a very very good one blow this up

00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:51.409
almost didn't get out of there in time

00:17:51.679 --> 00:17:56.850
sure we could have walked on the spikes

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.730
lived even gotten access to that boss

00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:01.320
Trap room but it's a more delicate

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:06.539
situation than you might be led to

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:12.029
believe at this point so now with with

00:18:06.539 --> 00:18:16.110
six damage much much better off

00:18:12.029 --> 00:18:20.159
especially with oh my god a potentially

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:23.070
increasing rate of fire although I'm

00:18:20.159 --> 00:18:29.850
mostly just shooting whenever possible

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:34.320
right now there we go

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:36.270
jeez Louise so no coupon for this shop

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.340
but that's fine we've had a run in which

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:39.990
we've had to focus on Isaac like almost

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:44.130
the entire time this is a tense

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:47.010
situation it's funny how much experience

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:48.330
plays a role because like well there are

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:50.820
different kinds of games as well like

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:53.070
this is versus the AI so it feels less

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:55.230
like when you lose somebody else's brain

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:57.090
just beat yours like on an evolutional

00:18:55.230 --> 00:19:00.240
or evolutionary level that makes me feel

00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:02.070
like I just like fell down the food

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.690
chain a little bit and what I'm going to

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:05.610
say is that in battlegrounds when it

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:09.720
comes to like being in the final five or

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:11.820
even the final 10 I get like my hands

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:16.440
start to sweat I get like a warble in my

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:18.360
voice because I'm nervous in Isaac you

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:21.750
know we're in this relatively stall I

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:27.960
blew it completely relatively scary

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:32.610
situation and yet I feel good pretty

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:38.279
good feel pretty good I knew that I

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:41.010
would now - I'm excited pills and a

00:19:38.279 --> 00:19:41.820
health downgrade to what do I owe the

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:44.410
pleasure this is

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:47.910
I mean it's we've gotten dps and I'm

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:52.360
extremely thankful for the DPS but dude

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:55.080
it's a little on the like go fudge

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:59.020
yourself side wouldn't you say one HP

00:19:55.080 --> 00:20:01.300
and I picked up an HP upgrade I've taken

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:03.880
zero deals with the devil and I have one

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:05.800
HP run that through your little number

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:11.110
crunchers get data miners and see where

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:13.000
you end up strikes me as a very very

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:19.660
unlikely situation

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:21.730
sure again our damage is okay in six

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:26.080
point four zero damage is not ten out of

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:31.960
ten it's just okay for this stage of the

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:33.910
game I'm dead dude I'm actually I'm mad

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:40.540
I'm a little mad

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:42.670
we died on our first season run and our

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:44.050
hurts me deep down in my soul we did

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:45.070
throw away a lot of black arts and

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:46.720
spirit outs we shouldn't have thrown

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.370
away but I don't want to put up a 20

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.020
minute loss episode so we're going to do

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:56.500
in as asel run just to finish this out

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:58.480
6 7 M 9 HS 2x I was a little mad at the

00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:02.290
end of that but you know what it's

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:05.080
alright the Isaac runs it's more

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:07.300
enjoyable when you've got a when you got

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:09.130
the plausibility of a loss and that's

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.780
one of those situations where you look

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.790
at it at the end and you go I never had

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:16.000
a chance but really there were multiple

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:18.100
times we really just should not have

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.050
used our orbital to deal so much damage

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:22.420
that's what cost us in the end there

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:24.160
will redeem ourselves someone get some

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:27.160
things ticked off the posted note here

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:28.750
and you know what I'll take any excuse

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:33.000
to do more even runs in the future that

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:33.000
bothers me like not at all

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:41.000
it's also extremely fitting that we lost

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:43.640
right after I went like oh it's funny

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:47.480
how experienced I'm like Cool Hand Luke

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:48.590
right now nothing could conceivably faze

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.300
me and all I'm dead

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:52.220
and I stood up out of my chair like a

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:55.700
four year old matted you know someone

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:56.270
beating him in a fighting game how dare

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:59.750
you

00:21:56.270 --> 00:22:02.170
in my own house beat me at a game that I

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:02.170
paid for

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:09.020
I'm not proud of it but when I was

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:12.350
younger I did used to be a sore loser I

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:16.250
think it's honestly like part and parcel

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:18.440
of being an only child to some extent so

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:20.240
when I grew up like I only played games

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.980
against the AI and then occasionally

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:24.140
like go over to my friends house and

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:27.350
play right it wasn't a very very common

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:29.210
experience you don't learn to lose so

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:33.559
good you don't learn to lose gracefully

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:37.490
in that situation is jarrah flies right

00:22:33.559 --> 00:22:39.080
just unfold right now still from time to

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:41.360
time I can see that tendency come out I

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:43.040
got to nip it in the bud because it's

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.350
very unbecoming of a man approaching his

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.700
30s although I think I've told this

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:50.330
story before but when I was younger I

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:52.880
used to play chess I wouldn't I don't

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:54.559
know if I'd say competitively but I also

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.970
don't want to say semi competitively

00:22:54.559 --> 00:22:58.040
because it was competitive as at the

00:22:55.970 --> 00:23:00.650
time it wasn't like I was about to go

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:02.390
pro but you know I played with people

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:04.670
that have become you know international

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:07.100
masters or I think I've played anybody

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:10.490
that's become a grandmaster

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:12.880
I played the there's an Ottawa

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:16.520
international master by the name of Tom

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:18.530
Wilson I think I played him at a

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:21.200
tournament once when I was like seven no

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:22.640
it's not grade seven and I mean what do

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.809
you think avid he destroyed me but he

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.530
was very nice about it which I

00:23:23.809 --> 00:23:27.370
appreciate

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:27.370
anyway

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:33.250
I was playing in a local tournament like

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.020
in my hometown and in the first round I

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.580
got matched up against this like forty

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.410
or fifty year old guy he's a little

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:40.750
weird little squirrely you know what I

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:43.630
mean just always kind of like moving

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:46.450
around a lot and the chess community I

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:49.450
don't know what it's like now I've been

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:52.540
out of it for a long long time but it it

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:54.940
attracts a lot of a lot of normal people

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:56.560
a lot of overachievers but also a lot of

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:58.990
misfits you think it would be like oh

00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:00.340
yeah I went to Oxford to study Chemical

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:02.860
Engineering but there's a lot of like

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:06.460
you know I run a newspaper out of my

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:07.510
basement and then you you know assume

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.250
that he's gonna be bad and he's actually

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:10.840
like a genius you know there's a lot of

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:11.980
that just goes to show you don't you

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.750
can't judge a book by looking at the

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:18.310
cover right but this guy was a little

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:22.990
squirrely and he made an error at one

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:25.240
point that was I mean clear to me at

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:27.700
least and I took one of his pieces and

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:29.950
at a certain level in chess if you make

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:31.720
an error like that somebody takes a

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:33.250
piece of yours uncontested you don't get

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.710
anything or it's like an absolutely

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:37.960
garbage trade you kind of just lose

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:39.670
you're just they'll just put the boa

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:44.590
constrictor around your neck until you

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:45.880
go down right so he went to forget what

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:47.380
he said but he was like I didn't have

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:50.590
even come tonight and he just stood up

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:51.850
and walked out and I just had to sit

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:53.830
there because we're on these clocks

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:55.090
right he hasn't resigned he just walked

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:56.620
out of the building he could have just

00:24:55.090 --> 00:25:03.820
gone for a smoke and come back I didn't

00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:05.560
know what was going to happen but he

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:07.360
never came back so I sat there watching

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:12.160
his like a hundred and twenty minutes

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:13.600
slowly dwindle Chris I mean it's a bad

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:19.200
look for an adult I'm just going to be

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:21.850
honest with you not that it's I guess

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.710
you know you work hard all day and then

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:25.630
you go to the Chess Club and you get

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:26.920
beaten by thirteen-year-old kid you're

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:29.560
like forty five years old

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:31.120
you know something like that but still

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:33.010
like you kind of got to accept that

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:34.900
chance is one of those things whereas

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:37.510
like the younger you are

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:39.370
if you're like 10 and you're competing

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:40.750
against adults I would rather match up

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:42.580
against the adults in the ten-year-old

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:45.030
because I might have a better chance

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:46.990
against the ten-year-old you never know

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:49.360
maybe they'll get distracted or

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:50.740
something but if they've got the skills

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.000
and they defeat me I'm also going to

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:54.450
suffer a great loss of my own

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:59.290
self-confidence in the interim period so

00:25:54.450 --> 00:26:02.680
you know it says it's a lower risk high

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:05.110
reward sort of situation to play things

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:09.010
the other way around my crowning

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:12.280
achievement is at a low another local

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:14.559
tournament I tied for I think 3rd in my

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:17.980
age group or maybe my rating group

00:26:14.559 --> 00:26:19.150
because they segregated sometimes you're

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:22.900
playing against people of roughly the

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:24.640
same skill level and I won maybe $50

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:27.340
somewhere around there and I bought Tony

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:32.830
Hawk's Pro Skater 4 and that probably

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:34.600
has had a larger influence on my on my

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:36.730
growth than anything else because to

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:39.790
this day dude Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:43.840
that's an all-time great Tony Hawk's Pro

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:46.600
Skater game I like it maybe more than 2

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:49.600
I like the lack of a time limit you know

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:53.679
I like the Alcatraz map I like the

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:57.880
shopping carts Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3

00:26:53.679 --> 00:27:01.330
was the only Tony Hawk game of like the

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:08.070
first 5 that I didn't own I own one 2

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:10.530
sug what is this mr. mee it's mr. mee 6

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:16.910
yeah ok

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:20.370
what keeps you stolen item for me okay I

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:26.090
don't understand what happens inside

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:29.480
tell you to grab this thing he okay yeah

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:31.530
I have no idea but we'll give it a try

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.390
it's not because I think Tony Hawk's Pro

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:37.050
Skater 3 is bad I've rented it many

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:39.150
times in fact I don't know why ever I

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:42.450
never bought it it's a it's haunted me

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:43.770
to this day especially because it's the

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:46.110
only Tony Hawk's Pro Skater that

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:51.480
GameSpot has given a ten point zero out

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:52.920
of ten oh you're a real fan of Tony

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.570
Hawk's Pro Skater three names some of

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:58.050
the maps then I don't remember there's

00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:59.160
one that's in like the suburbs but you

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:02.550
know the talking about Tony Hawk's Pro

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:03.300
Skater one oh dude you got warehouse you

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:06.720
got school

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:08.850
Oh G school you got Chicago the first

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:11.930
skatepark level you got Kona or wait is

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:11.930
it Portland I can't remember

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:20.100
you got Roswell you got mauled you got

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:22.020
that weird Phoenix level where you like

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:24.530
skate down the Grand Canyon and the

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:27.270
hidden tape was almost impossible to get

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:29.190
so I learned how to do it and then I did

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:32.640
it on all of my friends cartridges and

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:37.710
it was you know what let's test this it

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:40.500
made me feel like a god okay all right

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:47.400
so it's like it really bad at dealing

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:52.560
damage but it does deal some sure but

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:55.670
what does it do apart from that because

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:58.950
it seems like the extra draw is in the

00:28:55.670 --> 00:29:00.480
the ability of it to like help us out

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:04.350
when it comes to items I don't know

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:05.760
we'll find out I suppose did you know

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:10.290
that Tony Hawk Underground has a

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:12.030
Vancouver map I did it didn't dawn on me

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:14.100
but I looked at it recently and I was

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:15.540
like I mean there's a skateboarding

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:17.250
senior I'm not saying it's the biggest

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:20.730
one in the world but you know under the

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:22.830
Georgia viaduct you got all sorts of

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:25.050
skaters going on down there but then

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:26.880
also one time I drove by there and there

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:28.590
was like a whole watermelon with a bunch

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:30.180
of maggots crawling out of it and I was

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:32.430
like that's pretty metal but at the same

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:34.560
time and I'm going to take my kids is

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:36.030
the Rec Center if I'm giving them a

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:37.730
chance to like they learn how to

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:42.000
skateboard I'm not taking them to the

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:47.340
the maggot melon park as cool as that

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:49.110
might be I mean we should pick up the

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:53.480
cartridge maybe honor okay what are you

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:53.480
gonna do here mysterious go do something

00:29:54.429 --> 00:29:58.940
if nothing else we get the stad bonus

00:29:57.109 --> 00:30:04.489
out of dim bulb here and the charge rate

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:07.249
is much higher now but soon understand

00:30:04.489 --> 00:30:13.759
it I don't think it steals items I think

00:30:07.249 --> 00:30:16.279
it just brings you items because it

00:30:13.759 --> 00:30:17.869
grabbed jar of flies but jar of flies is

00:30:16.279 --> 00:30:23.690
an item we had already needs like owned

00:30:17.869 --> 00:30:26.389
so I don't know what it does we also

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:27.709
can't control it after it fires for the

00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:32.019
first time so you got a hope of the

00:30:27.709 --> 00:30:33.950
enemy is like somewhat stationary I

00:30:32.019 --> 00:30:36.200
always thought it'd be really cool to

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:38.359
have like my city in a video game and

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:43.009
then I looked at the Tony Hawk's Pro

00:30:38.359 --> 00:30:44.509
Skater or Tony Hawk underground version

00:30:43.009 --> 00:30:46.940
of Vancouver which I have not seen in

00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:51.079
like 20 years yy-you said come on buddy

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:52.969
and I said that doesn't really look like

00:30:51.079 --> 00:30:54.229
Vancouver at all I mean I sort of see it

00:30:52.969 --> 00:30:55.820
you got like the the Vancouver

00:30:54.229 --> 00:30:59.570
Observatory or whatever is the

00:30:55.820 --> 00:31:01.190
restaurant at the top of Vancouver we

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:03.200
don't know a ton of landmarks we got

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:04.239
science world science world's pretty

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:09.589
cool

00:31:04.239 --> 00:31:12.019
big old geodesic dome more of like a you

00:31:09.589 --> 00:31:14.899
know we got natural beauty here as they

00:31:12.019 --> 00:31:17.269
said in the song people from everywhere

00:31:14.899 --> 00:31:19.669
come to see you they've heard of your

00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:23.959
beauty they don't want to leave you

00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:27.349
again I forgot about that

00:31:23.959 --> 00:31:30.499
where auntie sign yeah so clean and the

00:31:27.349 --> 00:31:34.609
one is so cute anyway mess now can you

00:31:30.499 --> 00:31:37.459
choose the sea great song

00:31:34.609 --> 00:31:42.409
alright alright what do you doing oh it

00:31:37.459 --> 00:31:44.119
seeks out enemies maybe you don't need

00:31:42.409 --> 00:31:47.959
to position it on an enemy it'll just

00:31:44.119 --> 00:31:51.049
seek it out yeah I've been operating

00:31:47.959 --> 00:31:53.690
under a false pretense for too long here

00:31:51.049 --> 00:31:56.570
I don't know I'm glad I did another one

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:59.539
though I'm glad I didn't leave on the on

00:31:56.570 --> 00:32:02.929
the sore note of just like you know we

00:31:59.539 --> 00:32:06.350
lost that this is a sour note not a sore

00:32:02.929 --> 00:32:08.090
note of having lost that

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:10.160
last episode is Eden because this is

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:13.250
bringing me back even though of course

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:14.930
being Azazel is essentially you know

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:17.510
little baby mode in and of itself what

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:19.580
if I put you over here what you do you

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:22.880
blow it up that doesn't seem that good i

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:27.170
cuz the I guess here's what I'm thinking

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:30.290
it does based on what you send it

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:33.710
towards I'm guessing what we will floor

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:37.310
we on that's one of teleport to the

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:40.750
Emperor room here we want to do boss

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:45.290
rush impossible is the thing so I'm

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:47.770
guessing knock that out that was our

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:50.150
curse last time that it like

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:52.070
contextually tries to figure out what

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:54.740
you would I know this sounds ridiculous

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:56.180
but what you would wanted to do based on

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:58.160
what you fire it at like a

00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:00.080
pre-programmed is like oh you sent me

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:04.880
towards this thing I guess you want me

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:05.990
to blow this thing up but in this case

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.250
it's like oh you sent me towards an

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:08.840
enemy I guess you want me to deal damage

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:10.730
to the enemy I've seen the Rick and

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:12.230
Morty episode okay I don't know what

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:13.760
happened we should send it into like a

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:15.830
deal with the devil or so we should send

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:22.030
it into many different areas here and

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:25.130
see what happens I guess but for now I'm

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:28.640
trying to suss it out I just don't know

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:30.500
what the present moment it's like that

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.670
Norah Jones song I just don't know what

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:34.430
to do with the present moment oh you

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:38.990
don't know that one it's a classic it

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:46.280
was like waited till last thought I knew

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:47.780
I just don't know what it do you're not

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:50.120
going to give me a donation machine here

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:54.950
I'm a little insulted I'll take that

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:58.610
I might even rewind it back a dip low

00:33:54.950 --> 00:34:01.700
Pia let me try I got a try it's only got

00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:05.140
one mr. musics I've noticed oh no he did

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:05.140
steal the item okay

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:21.190
but I can't pick it up all righty

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:25.000
little weird I mean it's obviously this

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:28.260
is not bad it's actually very good if it

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:35.800
allows us to steal shop items like I'm

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:37.480
in dude plus that means every battery

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:41.080
charge is a free shop item it's like a

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:44.710
freaking super coupon speaking of which

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:46.810
there's the coupon which also gives us

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:48.730
an item for free we're they all right we

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:52.780
don't care about the moving box get out

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:55.320
of here might as well use the coupon

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:57.730
once when we have stuff that we like

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:59.170
yeah that'll do it and we had car

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:05.320
battery so it actually used it on two

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:08.320
things there this is a wild one moon

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:10.600
card fool card both teleporters to a

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:13.600
hearts not relevant okay what are we

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:15.730
doing here I don't know I'm confused the

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:20.530
whole thing is it's gone on too long now

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:21.880
we maybe should not steal sharp plug but

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:29.350
I'll steal it anyway

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:31.030
because we can so I guess I've come

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:34.420
around to this actually being like a

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:36.580
fantastic item even though I don't fully

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:38.290
understand what it does at all

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:40.570
it's done some positive stuff for us

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:44.170
right here I don't know what happened

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:46.420
there all right let's get the heck out

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:50.190
of here that was really good

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:50.190
mostly I think

00:35:50.390 --> 00:36:00.019
cool item dude booster packs great idea

00:35:53.839 --> 00:36:03.130
for Isaac keep up the good work probably

00:36:00.019 --> 00:36:06.529
really want dim bulb

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:09.049
it's useful for us so rarely as a result

00:36:06.529 --> 00:36:12.079
of you know the kind of space bar item

00:36:09.049 --> 00:36:16.069
that we have that if it makes a ton of

00:36:12.079 --> 00:36:17.329
sense we should have sent ghosts yeah we

00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:21.650
could have gotten ghosts maybe for free

00:36:17.329 --> 00:36:23.450
probably I don't know I don't know we've

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:25.339
got plenty of time to get ready for boss

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:30.529
rush here so let's just crack into this

00:36:25.339 --> 00:36:32.150
moon card out there are two battery

00:36:30.529 --> 00:36:33.890
charges so we might as well like blow up

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:42.859
this dude or whatever the heck he sees

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:46.779
fit to do we got free access here not

00:36:42.859 --> 00:36:49.970
like it's a huge get or anything but

00:36:46.779 --> 00:36:52.819
we're getting like endless nearly free

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:58.039
items especially with sackboy thank you

00:36:52.819 --> 00:36:59.480
longest sack boy ever sag blue okay I'm

00:36:58.039 --> 00:37:01.990
sorry I shouldn't try to keep up with

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:06.079
the the hip memes of the present era

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:10.250
Tukka Tukka Tukka Tukka now we don't

00:37:06.079 --> 00:37:13.640
care about any of that I don't care

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:18.319
about those period hearts anyway I don't

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:20.000
care about that I guess if we come to

00:37:18.319 --> 00:37:22.450
meet him it has no collision for a

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.450
second

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:29.410
well

00:37:30.819 --> 00:37:35.510
weird is basically I don't know what to

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:37.640
think about this item I can only think

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:39.950
that it's great because it's given us a

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:41.510
bunch of free shop stuff so I'm assuming

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:46.280
it also gives us free deal with the

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:47.750
devil stuff but it also can be a bomba

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:49.059
media I wonder if it could be a key when

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:52.220
we need it to be

00:37:49.059 --> 00:37:56.869
seems pretty you know like polymorphic

00:37:52.220 --> 00:38:02.630
in that sense but I basically just don't

00:37:56.869 --> 00:38:11.030
know we got enough time let's go back we

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:13.300
got 10 cents use bombs use bombs this

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:19.040
thing's probably going to break soon but

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:20.780
I'm gonna buy the spirit artists that

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:24.410
was like the worst bomb in the Earth's

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:31.400
history I'm sure I will I will take body

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:33.200
in a box nothing wrong with that in my

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:35.720
mind we could buy another spirit heart

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:39.109
I'd really rather just get something

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:41.290
much better but we can get one for free

00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:41.290
Oh

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:50.050
that's a bummer what he died doesn't

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:52.030
have enough range or some that whatever

00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:56.470
okay here's we will just buy this it's

00:38:52.030 --> 00:39:00.460
not like we needed a two of bombs which

00:38:56.470 --> 00:39:02.290
is not too a combo to get something done

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:07.900
here I'm just I'm a little surprised

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:09.100
that the the fact that we didn't get

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:14.770
what I thought we were going to get

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:18.490
there okay I don't care about a mimic

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:20.140
but I do like the fishtail we don't have

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:23.140
bombs that actually do anything for it

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:24.490
right now but I like it nonetheless if

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:26.620
we can get something that works for

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:28.300
that's fine sofe uric acid does nothing

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:30.880
for us but we're going to take it

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:32.200
regardless because we should take items

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:34.000
that we know we haven't seen before

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.980
unless we're in a position where we need

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.780
to get the reroll I'm not trying to be

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:42.160
like to progress oriented but why not

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:45.340
why not take items we know we haven't

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:47.830
seen before on this SAF file and try to

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:49.480
make something happen there okay big

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:51.460
mistake on the damage Department they're

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:58.110
a little nervous if we end up doing boss

00:39:51.460 --> 00:40:02.530
rush actually you're just like Midna

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:04.570
buddy in a box is so annoying we don't

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:07.150
need the golden key presumably we don't

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:08.980
need the golden key at least we should

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:10.510
go back and get it because I feel like

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:15.670
an idiot for not picking it up but we

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:17.380
probably won't need it the only reason

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:19.210
I'm worried about boss rush is like

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:21.490
damage is good but what is not good is

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:24.900
our range which is very common as a

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:24.900
faisal but either way

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:29.380
yeah maybe like stop walking into

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:31.360
enemies because that's kind of would

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:34.120
screwed you on the last run you can see

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:36.760
my people might be a little cheesed off

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:38.089
by that falling into some bad habits

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:47.430
here

00:40:38.089 --> 00:40:49.230
latchkey is fine what happens okay hear

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:52.260
me out here what's the most valuable

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:54.000
item probably eight and a half inch

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:57.020
nails here so here's what I'm going to

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.700
do is I'm going to send you down here

00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:02.730
and I'm going to pick up this item

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:06.720
I really thought we might be able to get

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:08.970
both items I thought but it's hard

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:11.160
because I can't see the other dude on

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:14.430
the screen but I thought we had a chance

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:18.650
at least if it worked it would have been

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:18.650
glorious you got to take the shot there

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:29.099
the real problem with this item is like

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:32.840
an offensive item so dumb is that I

00:41:29.099 --> 00:41:34.609
can't use it and shoot at the same time

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:37.560
[Music]

00:41:34.609 --> 00:41:39.030
so it's not really very efficient when

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.800
your damage is good I don't think you

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:42.330
should use it for anything but stealing

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:46.349
items from the from the applications

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:48.800
that I've seen so far doesn't seem to be

00:41:46.349 --> 00:41:48.800
much point

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:53.220
all right I mean is going to be a little

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:55.710
bit on the longer side as far as

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:57.800
episodes go but kind of comes with the

00:41:55.710 --> 00:42:02.940
territory

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:04.770
what uh I don't know what happened there

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:07.170
but I don't like this guy moving it like

00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:12.660
ten times the speed of his normal

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:15.119
existence this broken modem speed

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:17.880
enemies up if this is the eighth time

00:42:15.119 --> 00:42:23.540
I've had that revelation I can't

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:29.430
remember why is the door opens I'm

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:34.290
confused what happens that we turn mr.

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:42.690
musics on ourself hopefully not a Isaac

00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:45.230
- ng is stopped working alright so we're

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:48.290
gonna be done with boss rush here any

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:48.290
second now

00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:57.540
it's not about the items we get it's

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:59.250
about the progress that we make I'm

00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:00.660
going to try not to use it because I

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:02.700
just don't think there's a reason to

00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:06.660
right now beyond like occasionally we'll

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:08.430
have dim bulb but oh wait we're not even

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:11.580
using dim bulb anymore there's no point

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:12.960
to use it except to like very slightly

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:15.360
damage enemies that we could probably

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:20.940
kill faster than they'd get damaged in

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:23.790
the first place you know what though it

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:28.950
might actually be a good time to try it

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:31.500
against this guy nope he sought out an

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:32.790
enemy I wish he didn't but I thought

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:35.240
maybe like he could keep us out of

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:35.240
harm's way

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:43.440
yeah I mean I apologize I'm slumping a

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:45.750
little bit here I don't know why my

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:47.370
mechanical Isaac skills have dwindled

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:50.850
today does not seeing the board very

00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:54.600
well as we say the competitive chess

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:59.670
community uh-huh you a normal person

00:43:54.600 --> 00:44:02.850
hello me a chess player elo a jokes not

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:05.820
very good but it does actually they use

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:11.010
elo as a rating in the feed a rating

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:14.310
system extremely vis one Athan an on

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:19.320
voice and the chess champion of the

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:21.500
world from 2002 to 2005 now it's all

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:28.230
about all these hip chess players like

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:30.090
Magnus Carlsen back in my day the only

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:33.540
Swedish Carlsen I knew was a hockey

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:37.290
player for the Ottawa Senators not I'm

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:40.380
not using it just freaking try me okay

00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:42.330
come down here be mom's heart finish

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:46.770
this episode up and get a clean slate

00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:48.870
for the next one I don't want to make

00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:52.440
the whole episode chess topic because I

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:56.160
really like I was maximum like a 1600

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:57.690
player competitively when I played but

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:59.730
sometimes people ask me about chess I

00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:02.580
still have I still have opinions albeit

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:04.200
not necessarily strong ones either in

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:05.640
terms of their merit or their four

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:08.579
study I don't know how that hit by the

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:10.890
way but for example when they say what

00:45:08.579 --> 00:45:13.950
opening did you play as far as I'm

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:16.170
concerned if you don't play efore on

00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:19.050
your first move is wipe your little baby

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:20.579
any time I play someone who by the way

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:23.609
if you're playing black you match it

00:45:20.579 --> 00:45:26.609
with E 5 you don't play the Sicilian

00:45:23.609 --> 00:45:29.780
defense this is North America we play a

00:45:26.609 --> 00:45:32.430
wide open tactics driven style here ok

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:34.589
any time you open or you play against

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:36.630
somebody and they open with like Queen

00:45:34.589 --> 00:45:38.960
pawn up to you go okay we're playing it

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:43.280
some guy who thinks he's very clever

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:46.230
of course I'm mostly making a joke I

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:51.480
mean of course I'm mostly making a joke

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:53.880
but I'm an e4 or respond to e4 with e5

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:58.680
kind of guy just the kind of guy am keep

00:45:53.880 --> 00:46:00.089
it simple keep it uh you know wide open

00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:02.280
with the possibility for creative

00:46:00.089 --> 00:46:04.349
tactics you know I'm not the kind of guy

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:06.390
likes to look at a chessboard where

00:46:04.349 --> 00:46:10.500
nobody's lost a piece 45 minutes into

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:12.839
the game try to like move your pawn wall

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:16.170
like one space up to get more space on

00:46:12.839 --> 00:46:19.310
your opponent and you know slowly steal

00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:19.310
the life away from them

00:46:23.289 --> 00:46:29.930
come on there we go um yeah we'll finish

00:46:27.859 --> 00:46:31.940
up this floor pretty easily they will

00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:34.220
know they won't give us a chance to do

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:37.630
hush we have an unlock Tasha we figured

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:39.980
that out on our last episode take this

00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:42.859
fight cramping is the first time we

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:44.690
fought Krampus if the dream come true

00:46:42.859 --> 00:46:51.140
head of Krampus has appeared in the

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:53.119
basement that's not a lump of coal yeah

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:56.380
I mean I didn't want it anyway

00:46:53.119 --> 00:47:00.859
that's what I keep telling myself but

00:46:56.380 --> 00:47:02.329
it's not that good all we got to do is

00:47:00.859 --> 00:47:04.670
beat mom's heart and then we're free

00:47:02.329 --> 00:47:08.059
from this prison that I've created for

00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:09.769
myself here of just doing okay on this

00:47:08.059 --> 00:47:13.150
Azazel run but making mistakes we

00:47:09.769 --> 00:47:13.150
shouldn't be making without a doubt

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:21.380
who's your favorite chess player of all

00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:23.930
time I didn't have one but I read a lot

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:26.299
of books from American chess Pro yeah

00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:28.309
source irawan because they were cheap at

00:47:26.299 --> 00:47:30.859
the bookstore close to my house so you

00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:32.210
know what yes or Serie 1 you don't get

00:47:30.859 --> 00:47:36.039
enough respect buddy

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:38.509
everyone's always like daddy t-shirt nah

00:47:36.039 --> 00:47:40.009
you taught me everything I needed to

00:47:38.509 --> 00:47:43.849
know right that's not going to work

00:47:40.009 --> 00:47:47.210
about being an okay chess player that I

00:47:43.849 --> 00:47:50.359
never really had you know ascended past

00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:52.430
that point but that's okay I just kind

00:47:50.359 --> 00:47:54.289
of like bored of it dude I know chess

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:56.539
says like this there's a certain I

00:47:54.289 --> 00:47:58.640
wouldn't say glamour but you know the

00:47:56.539 --> 00:48:01.369
the idea that you have when you think of

00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:04.640
chess players my hole it's very smart

00:48:01.369 --> 00:48:07.700
and that's true but did well most of the

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:13.400
time but the downside is there's like so

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:14.749
much practice that as a like a 14 year

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:17.509
old when I when I basically quit

00:48:14.749 --> 00:48:19.940
competitive semi competitive chess I was

00:48:17.509 --> 00:48:23.420
like I want to spend like six hours a

00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:25.400
week reading and like 20 hours a week

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:27.619
playing chess anymore especially when

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:29.420
you talk to people and they're like you

00:48:27.619 --> 00:48:31.670
know probably your ceiling is like

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:34.280
International Master which is really

00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:36.200
good it's like that top point zero

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:37.580
one percentage of chess players but it's

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:40.100
not good enough to really be like

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:41.750
competitive outside of a local area so

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:44.060
you're like okay so I could spend like

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:46.790
unless you really hole is going to be

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:49.100
dicey dude unless you really love the

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:51.830
game it can be hard to justify that time

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:53.120
and I had I had fallen out of love with

00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:56.060
it probably by being too

00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:59.330
results-oriented not a sad thing really

00:48:56.060 --> 00:49:01.130
just just a thing so the ultimate irony

00:48:59.330 --> 00:49:06.110
of this run is that we might lose again

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:08.090
and if we do we do I'll survive but the

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:11.720
the second irony is that the clicker

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:17.050
might have been the right choice because

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:17.050
it would have given us okay come on okay

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:26.450
two strengths cards we could try to use

00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:28.040
those to get a an extra heart container

00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:31.070
out of the blood bank but I don't think

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:34.940
it's the right idea but the clicker

00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:36.650
could have given us a respawn and if we

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:39.920
became a different character we would

00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:41.930
start with more HP and probably have a

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:44.420
better chance to win infamy actually

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:47.420
just saved us from death pop one

00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:48.890
strength card here just be smart it

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:50.630
would be nice to pop two of them on the

00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:52.820
next on the next room against mom's

00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:56.240
heart but one here one on the next room

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:58.040
should be fine and let's pretend we're

00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:00.230
not good at Isaac well you've been doing

00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:00.710
a convincing job so far hey good one

00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:02.300
buddy

00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:04.730
last time I heard that when I fell off

00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:05.810
my freaking dinosaur Dae &amp; L's knock

00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:08.750
okay okay okay

00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:10.790
but granting a devil card in with us as

00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:12.010
well not saying we got a guaranteed way

00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:14.240
in here but I think we got a good chance

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:17.530
not that that's anything to be proud of

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:17.530
is Azazel but hey

00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:29.230
we're coming back here right I'm coming

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:32.130
back oh I want the will to move I don't

00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:35.290
know we could get tagged

00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:39.010
I'm waiting on like broken modem to slow

00:50:35.290 --> 00:50:41.950
the enemy down give us a chance to land

00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:44.050
a shot jeez that was actually real dicey

00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:46.540
at the end good tactics though mikhail

00:50:44.050 --> 00:50:48.400
