00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.959
hey everybody welcome back to normal and

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.250
plays The Binding of Isaac an afterbirth

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:11.160
plus where I'm playing pretty well the

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.170
runs have been good but we've also this

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.790
is where it gets dicey yeah the runs

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.470
have been good except for the last run

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.279
which was just ok but it's not like

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.369
that's a big deal

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.590
Jeff P Jeff Patterson to the province of

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.619
Vancouver Canucks sports rider 77 H I

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.269
don't know what the heck that stands for

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.949
Judas is always a scary value

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.890
proposition though it's like the only

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.399
time you ever want to see an HP upgrade

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.410
in your first item room let's see if we

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.460
can get lucky what's not an HP upgrade

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.800
in fact two questions oh my god it took

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.989
45 seconds into the episode we get a

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.690
freaking skype message this one is

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.969
there's no conspiracy to be had here my

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.760
boy Austin just woke up and said yes

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.899
that's fine to our conversation of when

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.239
we're going to play players on known

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.329
battlegrounds tonight what a strange

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.070
coincidence though I can't fault anybody

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.260
for waking up late I'm still riding this

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.970
high of like coming back from Eastern

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.549
Standard Time so I'm waking up at like

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.920
8:00 a.m. Vancouver time all 8:00 a.m.

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.650
Vancouver time must be nice I wake up at

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.400
the 401 a.m. every single day either I

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.020
get it okay we all we all wake up at

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.710
different times Indy if you ever heard

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.350
me be like oh it was a hard day I only

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.380
got eight hours of sleep last night I'm

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.329
aware I'm in a lucky position where I

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.460
could make my own hours it's not an

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.930
affluenza sort of thing I mean I haven't

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.000
paid my dues to the extent that the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.869
average person works like a nine-to-five

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.820
job as but you know I've done that I

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.009
worked as a mover for a little while

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.280
literally one day that day I had to get

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.439
up at 5:00 a.m. that was a I was a rough

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.479
one and then you know office jobs that

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.729
go 8:30 to 4:30 you know you got to wake

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.030
up at like 6:45 hop in the shower and

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.610
they walked to work add rest assured

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.250
I've done my time and I was never late I

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.009
pride myself on being an extremely

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.990
punctual individual it's a city I mean

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.429
it might seem comical given the fact

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.039
that the NL SS is sometimes a little

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.980
late but that's due to the the nature of

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.840
human cooperation where you

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.390
if one person has to do something and

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.040
I'm not saying it's it's my cohost that

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.030
are causing the problems it's the nature

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.700
of cooperation that cooperation usually

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.000
makes things that are Monday and take

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.459
longer you know if you if you got to do

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.860
something by yourself if it's like a to

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.250
show up to the bar around 8:00 I'll be

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.569
there at 7:00 59 59 if it's can you pick

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.340
up my friend and then show up to the bar

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.260
around 8:00 it's like okay build it in

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.900
8:20 at best because they're gonna you

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.459
get there at 7:52 in their lair there's

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.709
no street parking around and then you

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.180
try to find you know some street parking

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.109
by the time you finally park you go in

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.489
and they're like I've been taking a

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.780
shower yet is it okay if I take a shower

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.099
then we stopped at the drive-through

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.420
before we go I wouldn't want to go there

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.680
on an empty stomach it adjusts light

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.720
goes on and on

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.730
please give me a key so I can survive

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.109
let's freaking go look at that it's

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.209
going to say something's not right here

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:09.890
um this gives us Book of Revelations

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.180
which first off gives us bookworm right

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.790
off the banks we started with book of

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.530
Belial but then more importantly it also

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.680
gives us a spear at heart so we actually

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.190
have a temporary enhanced chance of

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.959
survival so obviously we're still in the

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.310
market for more spirit hearts if

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.190
possible and this is a good opportunity

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.319
to have that come to fruition and indeed

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.450
that is what happened so it's actually

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.109
like a really really good turn of events

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.090
on this floor and I've earned this one

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:39.980
maybe I'm worth it more if I flip I'm

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.840
not trying to say oh we need to we need

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.099
a bomb for that I'm not trying to say

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.319
that it's been the hardest run of all

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.450
time but we had no HP on the first floor

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.389
and we fought rag man that's hard enough

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:54.049
to be like you know a little nervous

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:55.489
about the situation I think so I'm going

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.889
to go to the shop a bomb is a great

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.989
purchase there is no bomb I will buy

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.470
another spirit heart and a hope that a

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:07.790
bomb shows up because a bomb is a great

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:09.680
purchase here and we had very little to

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.299
worry about in the interim period though

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.819
we also know what vas were going to be

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.530
fighting that was a nasty hit there

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.810
might have been from a champion action

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:22.030
oh it was from a fire so we should be

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:24.979
okay but a bomb is going to give us a

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.240
golden bomb and then hopefully spirit

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.810
arts wouldn't turn on my nose

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.870
smaller out though a golden bomb now

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:37.160
allows us to go nuts on this donation

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.599
machine we don't want pause we I should

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.550
poop us all right but Guppies head is

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:44.560
the same or better and the same goes for

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:47.060
the straw rubber cement is just okay

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.759
little brim was like the perfect get

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.099
there rubber cement has some fans no

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:54.050
doubt about it but at least from like

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.759
a-tryin to ensure our survival

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:00.530
standpoint I think you got to give some

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:01.909
respect to little brim here which is

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.349
going to help us out a lot especially at

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:05.599
range which is very important for us

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:08.000
right now did you have to though like

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:09.740
it's a little okay sure but you know

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.530
what we did get one bomb out of it which

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.229
is not valuable immediately but could be

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:19.699
valuable in the near future so now that

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:22.280
we got bombs and a couple of keys do we

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:24.080
care about getting those I think I'm

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.639
going to spend one key to get book of

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:30.139
secrets and hopefully find secret rooms

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.159
which we didn't but we also didn't

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:34.789
really need to do that because we have

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:36.320
unlimited bombs but kind of hedging our

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:38.330
bets that maybe we'll eventually be able

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.520
to create a library out of the situation

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.840
I don't know we're probably going to

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.159
blow this up because the odds of us

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.620
getting more HP are pretty low hilarious

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:49.880
nobody like the honest to goodness truth

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.469
you know we're going to give away some

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.800
HP for a deal with the devil so it's

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:58.250
pretty unlikely that we're going to love

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.210
what we have right now irrigate we're

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.650
ever going to do better than what we

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.150
have right now for HP is what I mean to

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.409
suggest okay even though I said the

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.789
exact opposite I know it's confusing

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:08.930
sometimes it's confusing for me too the

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:11.449
number one confusing thing right now

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:16.449
though is that I have no idea how much

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:19.729
HP I have but it must be two-and-a-half

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:21.050
non red hearts and then one red heart I

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:23.389
think is the way that it's shaping up

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.130
right now one leg in the red heart is

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:26.539
full so we know we're going to get an

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.909
orbital here and be pretty happy about

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:30.259
it we could stomach a Krampus fight but

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:33.530
I would much rather just get like

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:35.360
Abaddon 9lives mark packed you know

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.490
sometimes empty vessels anything that

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.940
gives us HP while also allowing us to

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.310
kind

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:43.160
a little bit dark bomb probably fits the

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.750
bill but it doesn't give us any damage

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.940
so there's a problem there but you know

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.580
otherwise relatively good situation we I

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:53.240
was way off we had four and a half

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:55.280
special hearts so we got not too much to

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.390
worry about a good you know the nether

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.750
we're out of that we can start talking

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:01.340
about stuff that's not related I think

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.680
it took me a little while to get there

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.780
but you know Edmond has a new game

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.280
coming out on July the 12th it sounds

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:11.090
like it's a sponsored video but really

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.560
it's just exciting I think I talked

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.290
about this in an earlier eyes gibbous

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.940
ode but you know if you put yourself in

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:19.430
Ed's shoes I mean people are going to

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.500
play the world's tiniest violin because

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:25.910
obviously Isaac has been a massive

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:27.980
success and you know especially when

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:31.760
when Isaac came out the the original

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:34.100
Isaac in 2011 indie games were still in

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.750
this kind of like darling period where

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.890
it was like oh my god this is going to

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:39.020
change the way the industry works

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.820
forever and then a lot of people put

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:44.060
their jobs to form their own independent

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:46.250
studios and there have been some massive

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.570
successes that have come out of that but

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:51.020
then there's also we've kind of seen

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:52.669
like a pull back on that recently like

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:55.820
obviously there are some games that are

00:07:52.669 --> 00:07:58.370
independent and successful but take a

00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:00.680
lot of those experiments have kind of

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:02.810
proven to be unsustainable and we're

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.960
kind of moving back away from that era

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:07.250
to some extent so I'm just saying this

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.530
to illustrate that you know it is a

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:12.140
privilege to be able to work on a game

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:15.020
and have it not only provide you with

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:17.120
you know steady employment for the

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:19.310
course of like several years which is a

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.600
rarity in the industry in these day and

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.370
age there in this day and age as an

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.770
indie developer I think but then also of

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:28.190
course to have it you know be so

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:34.039
successful is is really sweet analog

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:36.680
stick is fine however at the same time

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:38.539
you know you also you didn't need it you

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.250
know super meatboy did really well he

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:41.270
kind of thought it looks do a I'm not

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.740
going to speak for it necessarily but

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.909
the way I understand it is you know we

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.520
kind of thought I got this cool little

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:48.050
like roguelite idea that riffs on the

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.640
original Legend of Zelda a little bell

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.440
just work on that for like six months

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.980
put it out and then here we are five or

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.230
six years late

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.339
and finally he's free you know he's

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:57.829
worked on some other stuff in the

00:08:55.339 --> 00:08:59.029
meantime but Isaac is definitely from my

00:08:57.829 --> 00:09:01.130
perspective at least been the major

00:08:59.029 --> 00:09:02.750
thing so it's cool for him that he gets

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:04.670
to release something else now and he's

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.410
you know he's got Bumbo and super

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:07.579
meatboy forever and stuff like that are

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:10.519
coming up on the horizon but we're

00:09:07.579 --> 00:09:12.199
living in very much like a post active

00:09:10.519 --> 00:09:14.000
Isaac update community except for the

00:09:12.199 --> 00:09:15.829
fact that there's new booster packs and

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.110
stuff like that coming out I'm excited

00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:20.930
to play that looks a lot like Super Meat

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:22.790
Boy and I think the thing people forget

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:24.889
is that yeah I mean Edmond in terms of

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:29.930
like his visual style is very

00:09:24.889 --> 00:09:33.070
distinctive but I think like every game

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:36.410
he made or designed I should say before

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:38.740
The Binding of Isaac after birth was her

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:41.750
desert Binding of Isaac in general is a

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:44.480
platformer like Gish was a platformer

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:47.000
physics-based and time you know

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:50.660
four-letter word hewi sticks except with

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.630
an F was a puzzle platformer

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:55.610
I guess aether wasn't really it was kind

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:58.069
of I mean you sort of platformer but

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:59.600
anyway I'm excited to see another Edmund

00:09:58.069 --> 00:10:03.079
McMillen platformer I guess is what I'm

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.550
trying to say technically I guess

00:10:03.079 --> 00:10:06.170
fingered was nothing like that either

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:09.019
but I kind of got the impression that

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:12.050
fingered was more like okay my last like

00:10:09.019 --> 00:10:13.279
Game Jam project spun out of control now

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:15.740
I'm just going to make another one that

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:17.870
like might do okay but it's definitely

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:20.060
not going to be like twelve years of

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:23.199
development when neither was Isaac but

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:26.959
anyway I'm excited I'm excited for a lot

00:10:23.199 --> 00:10:28.730
I'm excited about video games as weird

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:31.190
as that might sound I'm normally not

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:32.899
cynical but I'm kind of I'm immune to

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:35.000
like the hype machine to some extent

00:10:32.899 --> 00:10:38.750
like whenever we have an e3 I'm always

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.459
the guy who is like well you know it's a

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.319
pre-rendered demo when everyone goes

00:10:40.459 --> 00:10:45.170
just let me be excited and they got a

00:10:42.319 --> 00:10:47.269
point but I also have a point in that

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:52.279
you're being sold to your shields but

00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:54.339
anyway the point is I'm excited dude I'm

00:10:52.279 --> 00:10:57.470
excited to play more stuff on the switch

00:10:54.339 --> 00:11:00.680
splatoon 2 comes out in like two weeks

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:01.459
as well I never picked up arms I tried

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.339
twice

00:11:01.459 --> 00:11:05.310
I was never super motivated to do so but

00:11:04.339 --> 00:11:06.720
I was at the drugs

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.370
or twice and they have like a terrible

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.430
electronic section but they still do

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:13.560
cell games and both times I was there I

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:15.029
was like if they have arms I'm just

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.550
going to buy it it'll be like an impulse

00:11:15.029 --> 00:11:20.750
purchase that's slightly premeditated

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:23.370
it's like a second degree game purchase

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:25.650
but they neither time they had a data

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:27.240
poster that said arms but they never had

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:29.400
arms nor do they have any games on

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:31.140
switch despite having a lot of switch

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.029
games on the poster but I don't know

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.529
what's up with that either way you know

00:11:33.029 --> 00:11:38.580
it saved me 60 bucks I heard the game

00:11:34.529 --> 00:11:41.850
was like decent but I I'm I feel like

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:46.320
I'm I'm ready for splatoon to I'm ready

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:48.270
to lose online to like you know Japanese

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:51.060
ten-year-olds in a way that is very

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:55.560
emasculating very embarrassing for me

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:56.940
but teaches me something about the

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.010
pursuit of happiness I don't know there

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:03.000
is no easy way to tidy way to wrap that

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:04.529
up you know what I mean I never played

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.160
splatoon one but I watched Kate play a

00:12:04.529 --> 00:12:11.160
little bit of it I mean mostly it exists

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:14.310
and that's why I want it you ever have

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.930
that a lot of logical reasons to not

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:17.730
want something happened to me all the

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:19.320
time I used to get like added a

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:22.350
subscription in Nintendo Power when I

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:26.700
was a kid because I didn't understand

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:30.990
you know objective journalism we got a

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:33.170
try for I didn't care about objective

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:37.650
journalism I guess as well back then

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:39.530
let's get a car battery here is going to

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:44.190
be very nice but anyway

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:45.810
and like a game would come out and you'd

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:47.640
be like that looks cool and then in the

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:50.130
review they'd be like this is like a six

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:53.520
and you'd be like okay but I still want

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:54.720
it I can't explain it talk to my friends

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.910
one of my friends was a very rational

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.350
game purchaser he was like you shouldn't

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:02.250
get that it's only got like on

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:05.880
gamerankings it's only got an 81 why not

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:08.520
get this it's got like an 84 I was like

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:10.320
I can't explain it for some reason I

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:14.790
just feel like I need to get NFL

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:15.839
quarterback Club 98 instead of I'm

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.950
trying to think of a sports game from

00:13:15.839 --> 00:13:18.960
that era that was actually good the

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:20.700
early days of 3d we're not necessarily

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.500
a great era for sports video games but

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:27.030
anyway I had that didn't stop me from

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:29.010
having a lot of them and I can't do this

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:36.300
you see this is this is the worst deal

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:38.520
in the history of deals I don't know

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.080
about this run dude I'm starting to I'm

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:42.150
starting to get downright inquisitive

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:45.000
because we're low on a couple of stats

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:48.570
that are pretty important damage for one

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:53.420
HP oh we had good use on Sue's as a 10

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:56.280
out of 10 well I just got back from my

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:58.290
three-hour time zone difference two days

00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:00.030
ago so you guys I'm still feeling the

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:01.710
jet lag pretty bad I'm going to be good

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:03.360
at Isaac again for another six weeks or

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:06.140
so you know what they say it's one week

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:12.390
for every half-hour of time difference

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:14.640
probably not true jet lag is a real

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:17.100
thing but I'm not it I got how roasted

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:19.440
so hard last time for coming back and

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:23.640
talking about jet lag we were like every

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:25.740
video you talk about jet lag well for a

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:28.230
while it was a dominating characteristic

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:30.120
in my life you know and I we come back

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:31.920
from Japan a 10 hour time difference

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:36.210
people are like jet LAG's not that bad

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:37.740
it first up if you're under the age of

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:40.200
like probably if you're under the age of

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:41.520
40 and you're otherwise healthy you

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.290
don't get to talk about other people's

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.410
you know bodily functions Oh

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:47.850
lupus isn't really that bad you know you

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.530
say that I know some of you out there

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:51.630
watches like 16 years old you have a

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:53.220
diet consists of cheeseburgers and

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:54.840
Doritos and then you still got a

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:57.140
six-pack somehow and you're going to try

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:59.430
to tell me you're like the average

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:01.500
person you know I've lived that it's

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:03.420
less than ten years ago I lived that I

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:06.990
was able to live that lifestyle to some

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:09.150
extent at least now you people would be

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:12.480
like I got a headache today I get

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:14.460
migraines wine creams you know these

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.230
people in parts of the world getting the

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.700
limbs blown off due to mortar fire but I

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:21.030
guess I'll have sympathy because your

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:23.850
migraine you know how dare they try to

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:26.460
say that they got something going on in

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:29.940
their life that's you know yeah I got my

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:32.340
own problems okay the Montreal Canadiens

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.819
just traded Jaroslav Halak instead of

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.769
Kerry

00:15:32.819 --> 00:15:37.529
what a stupid decision Carrie price is

00:15:34.769 --> 00:15:39.539
never going to be a legal tender the NHL

00:15:37.529 --> 00:15:40.709
and Jaroslav Halak just backstopped us

00:15:39.539 --> 00:15:43.199
to a surprise win over the Washington

00:15:40.709 --> 00:15:46.139
Capitals and Pittsburgh Penguins in the

00:15:43.199 --> 00:15:49.169
2002 NHL playoffs how stupid could you

00:15:46.139 --> 00:15:52.499
be so yeah where we all got problems

00:15:49.169 --> 00:15:56.999
okay look stop walking on the spikes

00:15:52.499 --> 00:15:58.859
thank you very much but you know Jay

00:15:56.999 --> 00:16:01.169
legs real I'm actually not jet-lagged

00:15:58.859 --> 00:16:03.209
much and that makes sense because I was

00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:06.809
only away for three hours but I will say

00:16:03.209 --> 00:16:08.970
the first few times I flew like decent

00:16:06.809 --> 00:16:10.979
distances I was under the impression

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:13.949
that jet lag not that it didn't exist

00:16:10.979 --> 00:16:16.169
necessarily but that some people always

00:16:13.949 --> 00:16:17.399
made it to be like a big deal then I got

00:16:16.169 --> 00:16:18.779
a little older and I was like what's

00:16:17.399 --> 00:16:20.399
that general feeling of malaise and

00:16:18.779 --> 00:16:21.929
nausea I have room returning from a

00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:28.499
place whose timezone is different than

00:16:21.929 --> 00:16:30.269
my own just a little little like 10:00

00:16:28.499 --> 00:16:32.339
p.m. nausea I'm getting right now

00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:34.199
because my brain is like it's 2:00 a.m.

00:16:32.339 --> 00:16:36.929
and when you were in the Eastern time

00:16:34.199 --> 00:16:39.329
zone you were going to bed at like 10:00

00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:40.649
p.m. so you stand up way too late but

00:16:39.329 --> 00:16:44.129
it's still bright outside it's a little

00:16:40.649 --> 00:16:46.079
confusing and it doesn't stay bright

00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:47.399
till 11:00 here but it does would people

00:16:46.079 --> 00:16:50.399
come to Vancouver they go it stays

00:16:47.399 --> 00:16:51.029
bright out real late I recognize it's

00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:53.639
the summertime

00:16:51.029 --> 00:16:55.709
I'm just saying even relative to other

00:16:53.639 --> 00:16:59.189
parts of the world I've been to at least

00:16:55.709 --> 00:17:01.019
a tear delayed and lower here but stays

00:16:59.189 --> 00:17:03.689
bright out like crazy here dude it's

00:17:01.019 --> 00:17:05.639
like I was cat sitting for my friend as

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:09.149
I mentioned that you know maybe for I

00:17:05.639 --> 00:17:11.159
mentioned the in the apology video was

00:17:09.149 --> 00:17:12.990
cam sitting for my friend and I was like

00:17:11.159 --> 00:17:14.100
I really want to get over to his place

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:16.649
before it gets dark

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:19.169
I don't know if cats processed things on

00:17:16.649 --> 00:17:20.579
this level but he's been away like the

00:17:19.169 --> 00:17:22.500
owners been away for a couple of days

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:23.699
maybe he thinks like if the Sun sets

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.259
he's never going to come back or

00:17:23.699 --> 00:17:26.879
something I don't know it's a very sweet

00:17:25.259 --> 00:17:28.710
thing to think about at least so I was

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:29.190
like I got to get over there before it

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:31.200
gets dark

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:35.730
started driving over there like 9:25

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:39.539
p.m. still dusk it was it was a luxury

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:41.539
that cannot always be afforded I suppose

00:17:39.539 --> 00:17:44.220
if we gone to the cursor I got a check

00:17:41.539 --> 00:17:46.179
we have not gone to the curse room even

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:49.019
though it turned out badly at

00:17:46.179 --> 00:17:53.080
least it wasn't a duplicate check here

00:17:49.019 --> 00:18:02.649
yo where's the item room though starting

00:17:53.080 --> 00:18:07.509
to get real nervous dude been up this is

00:18:02.649 --> 00:18:09.129
necro one yeah half we I don't have a

00:18:07.509 --> 00:18:11.590
curse the maze thing going on here as

00:18:09.129 --> 00:18:19.090
well do I I didn't take a question mark

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:23.679
- I remember this sure that we've done

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:24.759
this room I did I just not take what was

00:18:23.679 --> 00:18:27.129
in the item room because it was an

00:18:24.759 --> 00:18:35.559
active item I know the shop was dad's

00:18:27.129 --> 00:18:38.649
key this is why this is my least

00:18:35.559 --> 00:18:40.809
favorite curse curse of the blind eye I

00:18:38.649 --> 00:18:44.289
think I've checked this ten times yeah

00:18:40.809 --> 00:18:45.669
curse of the blind eye except because it

00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:46.929
leads to you picking up items that you

00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:53.289
wouldn't otherwise pick up and that's

00:18:46.929 --> 00:18:55.600
sort of cool curse of the lost is just

00:18:53.289 --> 00:18:56.980
annoying spend your whole time being

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.529
like that I go to this room that I go to

00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:01.570
this room and yeah sure does it carry a

00:18:59.529 --> 00:19:04.600
penalty yeah it actually does it makes

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:07.210
it less likely I'll get to fight a boss

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.559
I hate slightly later on or less likely

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:11.769
that I'll get my choice of four items

00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:13.869
slightly later on so you know I just

00:19:11.769 --> 00:19:15.879
think I think it's a bad curse I'm just

00:19:13.869 --> 00:19:17.529
going to level with you it's an annoying

00:19:15.879 --> 00:19:20.080
curse which is one of the reasons I

00:19:17.529 --> 00:19:21.789
think that it's bad it's annoying in a

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.950
way that I find very unproductive by the

00:19:21.789 --> 00:19:25.659
way stoked to get the halo even though

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:27.909
it's not a huge upgrade it's an upgrade

00:19:25.659 --> 00:19:30.809
in basically every category except tears

00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:32.919
right now so certainly not against it

00:19:30.809 --> 00:19:35.110
and we might still be able to do boss

00:19:32.919 --> 00:19:37.779
stress regardless so I actually think

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:39.490
that we have boss rush you get two

00:19:37.779 --> 00:19:42.639
charges per wave and boss rush now and

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:48.580
we've got a car battery so every wave of

00:19:42.639 --> 00:19:51.759
boss rush is twelve flies which is

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:53.049
twenty four times 5.5 one damaged so

00:19:51.759 --> 00:19:56.559
you're looking at like you know a

00:19:53.049 --> 00:19:59.649
hundred and thirtysomething damage per

00:19:56.559 --> 00:20:01.629
play enough to kill both of the bosses

00:19:59.649 --> 00:20:03.009
in the wave probably not we use our

00:20:01.629 --> 00:20:11.320
strength card though we crank that

00:20:03.009 --> 00:20:14.679
number up a little bit you will never

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:16.570
get this he got it but enough to make a

00:20:14.679 --> 00:20:19.179
dent to maybe make it worth picking up

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:20.830
one item that's it would have to be well

00:20:19.179 --> 00:20:22.779
above average it couldn't just be like

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:24.999
well this is a half-decent item let's go

00:20:22.779 --> 00:20:27.609
for it but if you have a little brim as

00:20:24.999 --> 00:20:29.320
well which is quite nice see what else

00:20:27.609 --> 00:20:31.359
we can get here empress better or worse

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:34.690
than strength still to this day these

00:20:31.359 --> 00:20:37.450
are equivalent in my eyes and take

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:39.940
duality actually fairly likely to make

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:40.960
something happen with duality the reason

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:45.999
the strength card is better is because

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:48.279
of the HP get so let's try that kind of

00:20:45.999 --> 00:20:50.580
a bit of a lark there to try to get

00:20:48.279 --> 00:20:53.230
magic mushroom mini mush but that's okay

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:57.399
I'm glad I'm glad these runs are sort of

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:59.409
becoming more average and that this

00:20:57.399 --> 00:21:00.549
really is an average kind of setup right

00:20:59.409 --> 00:21:01.840
now even though we got a little brim and

00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:04.659
dark bomb our stats are not out of

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.820
control particularly HP has never led us

00:21:04.659 --> 00:21:09.009
like rest on our laurels so you ever

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.899
have that happen where like I've

00:21:09.009 --> 00:21:12.340
definitely had to Adam recently where

00:21:10.899 --> 00:21:16.799
I've taken some classes where the

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:16.799
marking has been like a little easier

00:21:17.129 --> 00:21:23.230
like I take some classes that are meant

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:26.109
for students and I'm a part-time student

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:30.220
basically but I take some classes that

00:21:26.109 --> 00:21:33.279
are meant for full-time students but at

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:34.779
night so these are like real classes and

00:21:33.279 --> 00:21:36.490
I take some classes that are meant for

00:21:34.779 --> 00:21:37.990
part-time students and usually the level

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:38.950
of marking is like way harder and the

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:40.960
ones that are meant for full-time

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:42.070
students so taking a few semesters of

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.139
stuff that was like all part-time

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:48.129
classes and I was like I'm the best

00:21:44.139 --> 00:21:50.049
person that's ever learned this ever so

00:21:48.129 --> 00:21:51.970
the questions on you know the tests that

00:21:50.049 --> 00:21:55.509
you get are like you know what does oo P

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:56.799
stand for in your locate OPP how can I

00:21:55.509 --> 00:21:58.299
explain this we'll take it frame by

00:21:56.799 --> 00:22:00.169
frame this o is for object the other

00:21:58.299 --> 00:22:02.419
always for oriented program

00:22:00.169 --> 00:22:04.489
the other P well that's not that simple

00:22:02.419 --> 00:22:07.759
yet the I see it's a reference to

00:22:04.489 --> 00:22:10.369
Naughty by Nature is that that's not

00:22:07.759 --> 00:22:12.859
even nature yeah okay so I mean I don't

00:22:10.369 --> 00:22:15.320
know let's roll diplopia it's a double

00:22:12.859 --> 00:22:17.960
diplopia I don't even know if this works

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:19.989
we will not make boss rush don't sweat

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.989
it

00:22:20.049 --> 00:22:25.759
it would be nice to have a teleport card

00:22:22.519 --> 00:22:27.289
but we're not going to make boss rush at

00:22:25.759 --> 00:22:28.580
least try to go to the shop you do

00:22:27.289 --> 00:22:30.980
something good with diplopia here and

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:32.840
then you take the course that's you know

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:33.919
meant for the full-time students who

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:36.529
spend like eight hours a day

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:38.029
well optimistically learning this stuff

00:22:36.529 --> 00:22:41.659
and then they're like okay so what

00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:44.299
happens if you down cast a null pointer

00:22:41.659 --> 00:22:47.029
to be a pulsar a pointer of the static

00:22:44.299 --> 00:22:50.869
casted does void type and you go out

00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:53.600
prints out the the reference address of

00:22:50.869 --> 00:22:58.009
the object stored at that memory I know

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:59.929
you idiot it prints out a prints out a

00:22:58.009 --> 00:23:02.600
compiler error because you've got a

00:22:59.929 --> 00:23:03.919
runtime stack overflow you idiot and you

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.559
oh of course

00:23:03.919 --> 00:23:11.029
of course that's what it does my mistake

00:23:06.559 --> 00:23:15.379
okay so I mean doubling restock and the

00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:17.690
shovel does almost nothing I'll gives us

00:23:15.379 --> 00:23:19.940
a free restock and then a free shovel

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:22.509
which we would borderline have to take

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:25.249
because we'd get it rid of diplopia and

00:23:22.509 --> 00:23:29.210
it's almost worth giving it a shot I

00:23:25.249 --> 00:23:30.739
think because it does give you a it does

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:33.019
give you a good incentive to go to the

00:23:30.739 --> 00:23:37.850
hush fight oh that's the great gravy

00:23:33.019 --> 00:23:39.279
right there on you guys didn't learn

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:43.039
about the great gravy in Sunday school

00:23:39.279 --> 00:23:45.379
Sunday school look so I'm being an idiot

00:23:43.039 --> 00:23:51.859
here but I'm willing to chance it come

00:23:45.379 --> 00:23:55.840
on dog the thing is yeah we got to do it

00:23:51.859 --> 00:23:55.840
now so the reason I say that is because

00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:08.529
we can now buy spirit hearts from the

00:24:00.769 --> 00:24:08.529
shop did you did you eat it

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:14.659
you can buy a lot of spirit arts from

00:24:12.619 --> 00:24:17.299
the shop hopefully is the idea wow this

00:24:14.659 --> 00:24:19.219
actually worked it was a weird use of

00:24:17.299 --> 00:24:23.389
diplopia and the shovel is like

00:24:19.219 --> 00:24:25.129
definitely not as good as Guppies head

00:24:23.389 --> 00:24:27.080
is but that's okay because now we can

00:24:25.129 --> 00:24:29.719
just leave and go back and get Guppies

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:31.820
head now with any of this worth it not

00:24:29.719 --> 00:24:36.259
too an overarching degree I would

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:39.169
suggest no but I'd say it didn't

00:24:36.259 --> 00:24:42.229
necessarily turn out too badly because

00:24:39.169 --> 00:24:44.450
we also still get another item here we

00:24:42.229 --> 00:24:50.509
don't care at all about BOGO bombs or

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:53.089
unicorn horn oh my Lanta okay so we'll

00:24:50.509 --> 00:24:55.879
take crooked penny hell and it just

00:24:53.089 --> 00:24:59.089
keeps getting weirder because we have

00:24:55.879 --> 00:25:00.919
car battery swallowed penny which is

00:24:59.089 --> 00:25:03.469
actually crooked penny so things are

00:25:00.919 --> 00:25:06.169
going to be mighty strange but let's you

00:25:03.469 --> 00:25:10.190
know pick up some spirit hearts we got

00:25:06.169 --> 00:25:12.320
here strength then it one of them worked

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:13.729
in one of them didn't so as far as I'm

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.929
concerned why wouldn't we take mom's

00:25:13.729 --> 00:25:19.210
knife right now it's not like your tears

00:25:14.929 --> 00:25:24.229
are really anything to speak of and then

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:28.820
we still have an item back here because

00:25:24.229 --> 00:25:30.460
oh we do but doesn't really do anything

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:32.450
for us unless this gives us another

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:33.349
guppy transformation which I don't

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:36.109
believe that it does

00:25:33.349 --> 00:25:42.469
okay so let's at this point move on it's

00:25:36.109 --> 00:25:47.349
been very strange but not not just not

00:25:42.469 --> 00:25:47.349
bad it was actually incredibly good

00:25:48.729 --> 00:25:55.669
Empress Empress right okay

00:25:52.129 --> 00:25:59.359
fool fool fool hermit okay I don't know

00:25:55.669 --> 00:26:00.259
why not dude a free restock when we

00:25:59.359 --> 00:26:05.149
already have one

00:26:00.259 --> 00:26:07.070
sure what was the point of that well it

00:26:05.149 --> 00:26:09.019
did give us another set of consumables

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:11.570
dropped but that's not worth too much I

00:26:09.019 --> 00:26:13.820
suppose wow we found our boss room right

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:15.979
away so this might be a hush worthy run

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:18.229
just by virtue of the kind of weirdness

00:26:15.979 --> 00:26:20.180
of gotten ourselves into here anyway the

00:26:18.229 --> 00:26:23.180
tangent that I was going on

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:26.170
with yeah I've been I'm happy to have

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:28.700
some slightly more average runs here

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:30.940
obviously we're going to try to you know

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:34.280
go for broke

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:35.930
just for weirdnesses sake but I'm happy

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:37.910
to have some slightly more average runs

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:39.130
because I was getting I was starting to

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:42.170
think that I was too good at the game

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:45.440
which obviously like let's not be

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:46.970
ridiculous instead I'm being put back in

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:50.600
my place a little bit which is important

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:54.440
you know I think the highest mark you

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:55.910
should be allowed to give is a b-plus no

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.080
you know I'll tell you what in special

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:59.270
circumstances you can give out an

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:03.100
a-minus because you know when you're

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:05.660
when you're an adult and you get an A+

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:07.850
you're proud when you're a kid you get

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:09.500
an A+ it just sets an expectation you

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:11.990
know an expectation that you know this

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:13.670
is I'm an A+ sort of boy or girl now I

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:15.560
think that the highest mark you should

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:18.350
be able to get is an a-minus because

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:20.420
that you know it's really the mark that

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:24.500
says I did well but you could do better

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:27.110
and that might sound draconian and it is

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:30.490
extremely but it sends the message that

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:35.570
you should always keep pushing you know

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:39.290
struggle is a uniquely well it's not

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:41.540
uniquely human virtue but you know it's

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:43.010
a it's a human virtue to be like like

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:44.720
you might say well you should just relax

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:46.040
sometimes yeah no I don't disagree

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.690
should I you know everything in

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:51.560
moderation including moderation right

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:53.180
but at the same time can you rest on

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:55.010
your laurels because you got you know

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:58.910
all a-pluses and fourth grade

00:27:55.010 --> 00:28:01.010
Maddog all a pluses in fourth grade is

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:01.970
like all a minuses in fifth grade is

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:04.580
like you know you're getting to see

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:06.560
pluses by sixth grade you know you

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:10.060
always got to got to keep pushing you

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:12.500
got to get used to the push Wow

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:18.470
thank you for the range upgrade your

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:22.370
tube guy your jutsu gang Wow really I'm

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:25.130
a little perturbed but I will fight hush

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:29.410
for reasons I don't know because I got

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:33.290
the time basically you're too gained

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:34.029
crystally you're too blind okay well you

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:37.059
should have used to it

00:28:34.029 --> 00:28:38.859
earlier probably but so first things

00:28:37.059 --> 00:28:39.940
first I'll eat your brains then I'll

00:28:38.859 --> 00:28:41.649
start rocking gold teeth and fangs

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:43.989
because that's what a mother effing

00:28:41.649 --> 00:28:46.659
monster do young money on the verse we

00:28:43.989 --> 00:28:49.149
the monster crew it's a lot of do a lot

00:28:46.659 --> 00:28:50.619
of words in that song not all of them

00:28:49.149 --> 00:28:54.159
are safe for work

00:28:50.619 --> 00:28:58.029
let's see work at a swear factory so we

00:28:54.159 --> 00:29:00.989
get bum friends and boom ready or not

00:28:58.029 --> 00:29:03.190
here come the boys from the south I

00:29:00.989 --> 00:29:06.849
don't know about you guys but I got to

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:08.979
say here comes the boom probably one of

00:29:06.849 --> 00:29:11.559
the top 5 movies Kevin Smith has ever

00:29:08.979 --> 00:29:14.440
made I mean obviously you got the blood

00:29:11.559 --> 00:29:16.299
verse and then I now pronounce you chuck

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:18.309
and Larry the nice little indie film

00:29:16.299 --> 00:29:21.399
good message in that is that love

00:29:18.309 --> 00:29:23.739
conquers all and don't be a friend don't

00:29:21.399 --> 00:29:26.229
be afraid to pretend that you're a

00:29:23.739 --> 00:29:29.499
different sexual orientation to not get

00:29:26.229 --> 00:29:30.849
prosecuted for tax evasion something

00:29:29.499 --> 00:29:32.469
like I've never seen it let's be honest

00:29:30.849 --> 00:29:35.349
I don't know if I count the grown ups

00:29:32.469 --> 00:29:36.789
extended universe in the in the Canon

00:29:35.349 --> 00:29:39.159
because I've never seen those I have

00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:43.059
seen here comes the boom though ok don't

00:29:39.159 --> 00:29:45.809
mind this one I did ironic isn't it here

00:29:43.059 --> 00:29:45.809
comes the boom you see

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:56.850
speedball got to be getting close to

00:29:52.920 --> 00:30:02.430
spun check it and see I got a Z there

00:29:56.850 --> 00:30:04.980
the hundred in three come on baby don't

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:05.460
you do more than dance crew not bad not

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:10.680
bad

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:12.930
um the spirit heart I think and then we

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:19.140
might as well gonna go bottom that's

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:20.880
pretty bad and top wow it's a lot of

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:30.210
bomb related items I could not care less

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:32.910
about alrighty then obviously I don't

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:35.130
actually believe that you should only

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:39.540
give out a minuses I'm just saying you

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:41.520
know you ever here's a question I

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:42.540
actually I want a real answer to this is

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:45.450
one of those things I think people have

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:47.280
wondered about no I'm not saying like

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:48.270
great minds have wondered about it I

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.470
think it's one of those things people

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:51.300
wonder but they don't have the means to

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:53.190
get an answer and I'm hoping that maybe

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:55.740
someone here works in college at college

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:58.290
admissions at the registrar's office by

00:30:55.740 --> 00:31:02.100
the way change that word its registrar

00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:04.370
what are we a freak in space alien

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:08.040
Society where did this word come from

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:15.300
Stra our registrar maybe as a Canadian

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:18.240
thing anyway point is do universities

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:21.440
and colleges look at the high school

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:25.260
that you went to and apply a factor

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:27.210
based on what the expected ease of

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:30.030
marking is at that high school because

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:33.030
here's what I'm getting at at least in

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:36.450
in Canada and at least in science I

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:38.670
can't speak to anything broader than

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:40.440
that but your first year of science at

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:43.080
least my first year of science of my

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:46.650
university which was at the time ranked

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:48.720
well within Canada with basically all

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:50.670
right so we don't know where everybody's

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:53.970
come from we're going to rehash like

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:56.910
calculus and linear algebra biology

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:58.710
chemistry physics and get everybody to

00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:59.670
roughly the same level and then second

00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:01.620
third and fourth year got more

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:02.810
intermediate and I mean advanced on a

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:08.940
bachelor's level

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:11.040
you get the idea so effectively it

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:12.690
didn't really matter if you had super

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:14.250
foundational knowledge coming in as long

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:16.800
as you had the marks to back it up so

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:18.810
isn't there like an extreme incentive

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:20.820
especially if you're a private school

00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:22.380
am i unraveling the whole system

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:25.110
accidentally it's not my intention but

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:30.240
isn't there an extreme extent extreme

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:32.250
incentive to give a child you know over

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:35.550
let's say a teenager I'm not trying to

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:38.160
say to you no 17 year olds or children

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:40.410
but you get the idea a higher mark than

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:43.410
they deserve thus giving them a better

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:45.570
chance of getting into a you know a

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:46.980
university that's more prestigious and

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:50.520
that's raising the pedigree of the

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:53.100
school and giving the school a better

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:54.150
chance to secure you know more more

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:56.250
parents that want to send their kids

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:57.930
there and I guess you know what in a way

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:59.160
I think I'm in advertently answered my

00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:00.840
own question because in the u.s. you

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:03.960
also have SATs and stuff like that which

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:06.440
are not taking standardized tests are

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:09.750
not taking really to get into Canadian

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:11.730
universities so not saying is the

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:13.020
perfect solution but I understand the

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:15.690
value of standardized testing because

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:18.540
I'm going to be honest I think I went to

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:20.520
a school that was kind of easy I have a

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:22.830
lot of self confidence about my own

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:24.870
intelligence and I think I have a very

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:27.900
frank view of my own intelligence I

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:30.090
don't think I'm particularly book smart

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:32.460
necessarily but I think I do have a

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:34.020
width so I'm not saying like my whole

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:35.790
identity is caught up in the fact that I

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:37.680
was on the honor roll in high school or

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:39.540
something like that but I do think that

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:40.500
my high school when I hear other people

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:43.140
talk about their high school experience

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:46.650
I'm like ours is Lee if you like showed

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:50.370
up and did like three-quarters of the

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:53.460
homework you're going to get an A unless

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:55.530
you really really mess up if you hand in

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:59.640
like everything and you study for the

00:33:55.530 --> 00:34:01.500
exam you're probably gonna get an A so I

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:04.220
always wondered if like you know I

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:06.810
applied for school and like yo

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:09.450
matriculating from you know middle of

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:11.550
nowhere high school it's northern lying

00:34:09.450 --> 00:34:14.130
with these marks and then you got like

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:15.040
oh this guy went to the Albert Einstein

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:17.350
you

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:20.610
Oh school for the gifted in downtown

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:23.890
Toronto but his marks are slightly lower

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:25.169
you know I mean I get it you you look at

00:34:23.890 --> 00:34:27.190
everything when it's a well-rounded

00:34:25.169 --> 00:34:28.900
application with an essay and stuff like

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:31.600
that but still always wondered if they

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:33.370
could like apply a factor it's not like

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.900
you know when you're high schools

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:39.660
advertising to parents they're going to

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:41.860
be like you know hey six of our

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:43.300
graduating class from last year went to

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:45.820
Ivy League schools they're not going to

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:47.050
be like four years ago all the people

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:48.640
who went to Ivy League schools were

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:50.830
proven to be woefully underprepared

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:53.020
because that he got overinflated marks

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:54.370
in high school I don't know I mean maybe

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:56.710
I'm talking out of my butt now but I'm

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:59.680
just I'm just interested it's one of

00:34:56.710 --> 00:35:02.890
those things I'm interested to know I'm

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:04.150
the sausage-making if you will I'll just

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:05.110
take this I don't want to double it

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:12.610
because we're about to go down to the

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:15.460
chest by the way we'll get a lot further

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:17.590
as an Internet community here if you

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:19.240
only answer if you know because I know

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:21.100
that there's a temptation I'm going to

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:25.420
I'm going to teach you the most valuable

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:27.790
lesson that I know from a social

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:30.310
standpoint I mean this sincerely as an

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:34.120
adult it's super okay to not know

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:35.410
everything would you as a child you

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.910
teacher asks you questions there's no

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:39.160
such thing as rhetorical questions until

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:43.480
you have like eleventh grade right let's

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:46.890
I miss not okay I mean I don't really

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:46.890
want to double any of these anyway I

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:51.480
certainly don't want to take Plan C but

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:57.280
what I mean to suggest is just that you

00:35:56.050 --> 00:36:00.880
know something we have this conversation

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:03.520
a lot on conversations like this a lot

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:05.010
on the NLS s we ask the question the

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:09.580
other day

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:12.790
is the Dalai Lama allowed to masturbate

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:14.140
and people were like oh well why

00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:15.700
wouldn't he be it's just a human thing

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:17.070
and you're like no no you don't

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:19.120
understand there's like there's rules

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:20.440
I'm not saying he doesn't break the

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:23.050
rules what I'm saying is I don't know

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:25.540
mr. Lama personally maybe he does maybe

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:26.770
doesn't but is he supposed to I guess is

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:28.570
I mean though then it's another question

00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:31.090
is anybody supposed to

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:33.400
why not but seems like we're getting

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:37.990
sidetracked here what I want is not like

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:40.780
I heard what I want is I work at the

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:50.860
Registrar's Office and this is how we do

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:52.540
it it is how we do it kind of struck out

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:58.240
with a lot of these crooked penny plays

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:59.530
here um anyway I think I've gotten my

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:01.780
point across well enough we already a

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:03.340
bookworm got so many books so many books

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:07.360
and bombs this is a books and bombs

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:12.820
around dude terrible name for a cafe

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:14.140
just just god-awful name for a cafe even

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:16.180
if you're like well what if the bombs

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:17.730
were Jaeger bombs that's so much worse I

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:21.640
don't want to go to a combination

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:23.350
bookstore slash frat house I'm 28 years

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:25.660
old I can't do a Jager Bomb

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:27.580
I don't wear tight shirts okay more

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:30.760
power to you if you got the games

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:32.680
I'm not a jagerbomb sort of guy I'm a do

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:35.950
you have anything that comes in a more

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:37.270
happy variety than this sort of guy kind

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:40.630
of guy who wears the hoodies in the

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:44.140
summer you know for comfort and

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:47.200
convenience sun's out guns out no sun's

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:50.260
out so we shouldn't say sun's out hoods

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:51.970
up because it's kind of you take that

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:54.550
definitely the wrong way but

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:59.560
sun's out zip zippers down no also

00:37:54.550 --> 00:38:02.470
pretty bad in the summertime window

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:05.500
zippers down not in that way in the

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:09.180
hoodie context in the summertime over

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:09.180
dressing as a different turn of phrase

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:16.920
uma Thurman I'm I'll be taking ten

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:16.920
showers every day

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:24.559
I don't understand temperature and I

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.579
mean this is where I come face-to-face

00:38:24.559 --> 00:38:29.390
with the knowledge of my own

00:38:25.579 --> 00:38:33.289
intelligence but I don't understand

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:35.869
temperature because like I'm always too

00:38:33.289 --> 00:38:38.539
hot so what I do is I turn up we have

00:38:35.869 --> 00:38:42.440
air conditioning thankfully life's

00:38:38.539 --> 00:38:43.970
pretty good so I turn up the AC to the

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:46.190
point where I feel comfortable wearing a

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:49.480
sweatshirt it might put a sweatshirt on

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:52.099
my wife is like teeth chattering and

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:53.569
she's like why is the temperature so low

00:38:52.099 --> 00:38:55.130
and I'm like I'll just put a sweater on

00:38:53.569 --> 00:38:56.480
it's July

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:58.250
she's very right but I don't know I just

00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:00.680
feel comfortable that way it's also the

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:02.990
same way we're like even if I'm super

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:05.440
hot you know I get it so would like the

00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:06.559
FPS ha ha ha but even if I'm like

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:08.000
overheating

00:39:06.559 --> 00:39:10.130
I have to sleep with the blanket on it's

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.660
just more comfortable she's like you

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:12.890
know you starting to sweat why don't you

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:15.559
just take the blanket off and like it's

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:18.530
not that easy some kind of evolutionary

00:39:15.559 --> 00:39:20.150
thing I'm not gonna do it because I

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:21.980
don't want to I'm just going to be

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:24.380
honest with you I'm sorry void it was a

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:25.789
