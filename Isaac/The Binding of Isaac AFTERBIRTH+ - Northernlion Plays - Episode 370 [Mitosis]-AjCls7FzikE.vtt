00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.410
hey everybody welcome back on the line

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.330
please abiding by scattereth plus we've

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:11.610
completed the entire the entire negative

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.470
how do you complete the polaroid how to

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.449
complete Polaroid Isaac

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.029
kill Isaac in the cathedral six times

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.920
oh so you unlike a negative before the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.170
polar the cathedral is the harder path

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.330
what a strange

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.590
tangled web we weave unlocked by beating

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.260
greed motive is amazing well obviously

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.850
that's something we can do in the future

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.620
here but you know we got a lot of Isaac

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.730
work left to do to start with Isaac I

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.510
know you're gonna ask many questions a 7

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:52.469
k 0 9 Kimmie's I could I could only name

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:55.230
name one Kimmy Kimmy Schmidt that's it

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.949
that's the one I think that's it apart

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.940
from that kimchi I can name at least two

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.140
kinds of kimchi

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.120
you got the one who made with a napa

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.890
cabbage that you got there's a cucumber

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.409
kimchi this delicious as well anyway the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.000
place counts uh I totally forgot the

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.490
name if you count don Muji in there as

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.869
they'd look at the skin a little too

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.040
Korean cuisine focused but I do like a

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.060
good Korean cuisine so I'm just being to

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.939
thine own self be true

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.520
you know what I mean for the time being

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.200
the last run was fairly difficult

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.670
actually one of the more difficult runs

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.490
you could possibly have while also

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.079
having brimstone which means you know in

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.470
the whole scheme of things there wasn't

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.909
really that bad difficult at all but we

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.320
got through it and that's important it's

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.899
blue baby sometimes it can be a little

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.970
dicey and that brimstone no damage

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.460
upgrades wasn't doing us as many favors

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.700
as it oftentimes would so it wasn't an

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.390
automatic victory plus we beat or we

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.860
unlocked

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:00.750
hush and I think we might have unlocked

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.790
the shoal path permanently

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.780
but I'm not totally sure you sure about

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.610
that

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.190
but I did just get a good idea for like

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.410
a non-sequitur bit it'd be like I'm a

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.780
show man

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.430
but em pampered in anthem well I do have

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.870
like the sound board hooked up I don't

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.330
have any air horns on it yet but I could

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.980
like I could do like this hey give me a

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.920
moment here don't hit me please

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:30.900
I'm a shoul he's gonna hit me I'm a show

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:32.910
man wouldn't necessarily recommend it

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.110
okay silly starts in today's episode but

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.620
we're going to get through it

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:42.590
nonetheless I assure you we've got

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.590
nothing to fear not even fear itself I

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.830
shouldn't have taken that red heart of

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.620
damage even for the purposes of the joke

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.200
because it's going to make it impossible

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.270
yeah for me too yeah especially now that

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.950
I've given it a chance impossible for me

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.390
to get an arcade on the next floor and

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.910
an arcade with that B bag is really nice

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.769
because it gives you extra chances to

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.269
get the blood bag or to get a second IV

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.190
bag or just to get more money than you

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.470
otherwise would in an average situation

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.299
but that's fine I've no choice here

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.820
toxic shock is actually really really

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.200
good all we need is a bomb and then

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.150
there's a tinted rock and then we're

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.470
probably set for life and buy set for

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.209
life I mean set for getting the deal

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.890
with the devil on this floor where we

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.810
will possibly pick up an item that helps

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.840
us and as a result be set for life maybe

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.880
I don't know toxic shock is good though

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.790
especially if our damage is not

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.220
altogether that impressive all those

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.900
clothes the fact that enemies that die

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.280
leave creep is really really useful

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.200
especially I mean you saw in that

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:45.900
situation right there prints to the end

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.760
adequately not 10 out of 10 there's our

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.110
bomb we're probably good okay I know

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.970
you've probably thought we started this

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.440
one playing a little bit too far away

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.910
from our chests you always play the

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.769
cards close to your chest you're playing

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.390
you know with the cards at arm's length

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.390
go and don't look at my cards

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:07.020
for cents not quite enough to in all

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.780
likelihood biosphere at Arkham still if

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.210
we lost an Isaac run this early on I

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.730
mean you start with 3 HP there's very

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.850
very little reason to be messing up and

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.530
Isaac run this early

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.060
except for hubris and I I accept kuber's

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.740
as a valid reason you're gonna tell

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.540
Macbeth's that no sorry Macbeth you

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:29.310
can't lose spoilers because of hubris I

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.730
always thought you know I respect

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.140
Shakespeare a lot of people you know

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.130
you're basically forced to read

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:40.200
Shakespeare in high school a lot of

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.440
people resented that he's not my

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.330
favorite playwright I'm saying that as

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.310
someone who's read all of like 6 plays

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.110
in my entire life probably but no you

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.530
know he's not my favorite author of

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.090
printed media certainly BuzzFeed fits

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.470
the bill a lot better for my personal

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:01.080
taste but I always thought that was kind

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.880
of a cop-out it was like the first M

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.330
night Shyamalan twist is the first time

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.710
we've had lump of coal by the way when

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.800
you know the witches tell Macbeth

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:13.919
they're like no man boarded woman could

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:18.570
possibly kill you and then Macduff shows

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:21.450
up and Macbeth is like hey sorry I burst

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:24.210
your bubble Macduff but no man born of

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.010
woman could possibly kill me I was told

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.530
that by witches as we know in today's

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.090
modern world witches are considered you

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.470
know we need to pick it up of course

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.970
witches are considered immutable Macduff

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.350
is like I understand that I only know a

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.340
couple of things in this world one of

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:43.140
which is that witches are hurt immutable

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.090
harbingers the truth oh I was a little

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.490
scary huh probably shouldn't have done

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.110
that but we did unlock a crawlspace or

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.480
possibly black-market it's a crawl space

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.160
with three pennies Wow well worth the

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.530
cost of doing business but he's like

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.990
check it out my mom added the variant

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:01.200
section so I was not born of woman and

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.570
as long as that how it works you have to

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.120
pass through that holy gate to be

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.700
considered born of woman I was also born

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.960
by a c-section I consider myself to be

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.650
born of woman though

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.410
I know it always struck me as kind of a

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.340
weak premise I don't know if maybe

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.770
audiences were just a little bit less

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.319
discerning back in like the 17th century

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.550
you know they're like hahaha this is the

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:26.009
best thing I've ever seen in my entire

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.319
life because I'm not presently dying of

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:31.380
a you know venereal disease or something

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:33.389
like that but for me in a twenty twenty

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.660
first century audience I do like Macbeth

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:39.330
but that twist of the end just never

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.830
never really got me to be honest with

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.150
you I'm like you know what I have a

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:46.500
conversation with Shakespeare and be

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:51.060
like he is still born of woman though in

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:52.979
my opinion at least Wow I forgot our

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.960
first off our stats are they got too

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:56.610
good too fast it's like winning the

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.099
lottery I'm going to lose it on by like

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:02.909
18 Toyota Tacomas or something like that

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:07.020
our speed got way too fast but this is

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:09.090
great dim bulb with something that has

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.159
no charges there are no ability to

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:14.099
charge aka I'm limited charges I guess

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:16.680
being strictly correct here is

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:19.770
apparently amazing it's like a really

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.539
really I'm going to add in a third

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.159
really I know you're going to say save

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:24.509
that third really for a situation of

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:26.190
warrants and I think the situation

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:29.009
warrants it it's a really really really

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:32.430
good all snacks up we're up the 9.3

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:35.190
damage a lot of that is thanks to magic

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:38.550
much but part of it is certainly thanks

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:40.110
to IB bag big chub you know he's just

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.270
hanging out he's doing his thing I'm

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:43.770
happy to have him along for the ride the

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:46.560
big thing in the last episode by the way

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:49.759
was we knocked out super meatboy the

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:53.219
like literal super meatboy achievement

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:55.110
eponymously named which is actually a

00:07:53.219 --> 00:07:58.139
pretty big get for us dude this item

00:07:55.110 --> 00:08:03.229
shows up in every shop and it's a pretty

00:07:58.139 --> 00:08:06.389
big get for us because oh my Lanta

00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:08.490
that's something that to get it so early

00:08:06.389 --> 00:08:11.820
on an hour you know relative isaac

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:15.949
career here is extremely unlikely so I'm

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.949
very happy to have gotten it hope yeah

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:22.319
I mean the thing is we don't need IV bag

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:24.150
you know we've got money we don't have

00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:27.389
money equals power pardon me diplopia

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:30.389
still works with unlimited charger sight

00:08:27.389 --> 00:08:31.919
with a dim bulb here so we're pretty

00:08:30.389 --> 00:08:36.180
much completely set in that regard

00:08:31.919 --> 00:08:37.890
anyway be nice to have more money but we

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:40.110
can't even donate the money that we do

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:42.209
have because the donation machine is

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:44.370
broken so they will roll with diplopia

00:08:42.209 --> 00:08:48.180
and maybe we can double some angel deals

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:50.180
or something yeah thank you for this

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:53.550
because I am going to sacrifice some and

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:55.110
I regret this decision immensely we have

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:57.270
tons of keys let's just teleport out

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.950
save ourselves to have spirit art more

00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.600
or less guarantee ourselves the maximum

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.339
possible chances deal with the devil and

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:06.060
you know continue on our merry way here

00:09:02.339 --> 00:09:07.709
things are going well took me a long

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.990
time to get used to saying that things

00:09:07.709 --> 00:09:12.300
are going well it really do we don't any

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:14.700
runes unlocked I forgot about that it

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:18.630
really did take the expression Superman

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:21.750
does good you do well for me to start

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:23.279
saying do well instead of do good mostly

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.350
because of the song be good Johnny right

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:27.690
he doesn't say be well be well be well

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:30.209
be well be well be well be well be well

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:33.270
be well Johnny anyway

00:09:30.209 --> 00:09:36.110
men at work joke okay cue to sleep

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:39.410
anyway

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:42.260
but I take issue with language on

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:46.160
multiple occasions for example I really

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:48.250
dislike when you you know in school you

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.810
would say can I go to the bathroom and

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:53.240
then your teacher would be like uh-uh

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:56.089
you'd be like okay may I go to the

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:58.570
bathroom what is this like are you an

00:09:56.089 --> 00:10:02.180
actual computer you know what I mean

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:05.709
of course you it's the physical

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:10.310
capabilities of going to the bathroom

00:10:05.709 --> 00:10:11.450
it's not ours we use a Ken and may in

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:15.230
the English language

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:17.720
it wasn't like 1920 but you know when

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:19.430
the server at a restaurant comes over is

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:23.209
like what can I get for you is that uh

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:25.490
uh uh what may you get for me you do for

00:10:23.209 --> 00:10:28.100
this the physical ability to carry food

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:28.880
to me ah can I get a cheeseburger uh uh

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.490
uh

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:34.310
may I get a cheeseburger of course I you

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:36.320
can receive a cheeseburger you have a

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:39.050
table in a plate and flatware in front

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.940
of you do you not just always even as a

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:45.019
child I wasn't that much different as a

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:50.300
child as I am today pretty much just a

00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:52.490
visibly smaller version of the person

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:56.560
you see before you struck me as

00:10:52.490 --> 00:11:00.199
needlessly pedantic but then like I

00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:03.140
don't understand there must be like

00:11:00.199 --> 00:11:04.880
feces written on this not CC that's a

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:08.449
different YouTube channel altogether

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:10.730
there must be thesis a--'s rather when

00:11:08.449 --> 00:11:13.730
we've gone to ten arcades maybe oh you

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:17.959
jerk written about the subject

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:21.829
the etiquette of allowing people to go

00:11:17.959 --> 00:11:22.579
to the bathroom or in classrooms what I

00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:24.079
mean

00:11:22.579 --> 00:11:25.970
I don't know what the rules were we

00:11:24.079 --> 00:11:28.339
didn't have hall passes but I understand

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:30.170
the concept of a Hall Pass it's like you

00:11:28.339 --> 00:11:32.869
know the teacher has basically

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:35.509
commodified the ability to leave the

00:11:32.869 --> 00:11:37.069
classroom so they have a good excuse if

00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:38.269
a third person wants to leave the

00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:39.739
classroom they only give out like two

00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:42.290
hall passes or something like that plus

00:11:39.739 --> 00:11:44.779
it lets the hall monitor's know that

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:51.350
you're allowed to be out in the hallway

00:11:44.779 --> 00:11:52.790
I understand however we're still going

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:56.899
to do it like this I don't even want to

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:57.769
buy Mama Megan here you might be

00:11:56.899 --> 00:11:59.360
thinking I'm going to take the position

00:11:57.769 --> 00:12:01.220
that shouldn't you just be able to go to

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:05.179
the bathroom when you have to go and I

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:07.999
think honestly that my answer to that is

00:12:05.179 --> 00:12:10.660
no because there are situations in real

00:12:07.999 --> 00:12:13.069
life where you can't go to the bathroom

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:16.579
where you have to hold it and I think

00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:18.290
it's a skill worth learning and I have

00:12:16.579 --> 00:12:21.079
it worth making because you're not

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:22.699
learning the habit of holding your urine

00:12:21.079 --> 00:12:24.529
in what you're learning is should have

00:12:22.699 --> 00:12:25.670
gone when I had free time instead of you

00:12:24.529 --> 00:12:27.589
know taking it out of something that's

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:29.869
important so I agree you shouldn't just

00:12:27.589 --> 00:12:33.529
let you know people go to the bathroom

00:12:29.869 --> 00:12:35.809
whenever they have to go but I think

00:12:33.529 --> 00:12:40.249
it's weird that when you're in like

00:12:35.809 --> 00:12:42.769
elementary school let's do it you'd have

00:12:40.249 --> 00:12:44.689
to hold up your hand and say to your

00:12:42.769 --> 00:12:48.439
teacher in front of the whole class may

00:12:44.689 --> 00:12:53.439
I go to the band like everybody poops we

00:12:48.439 --> 00:12:59.089
all know the REM song everybody poops

00:12:53.439 --> 00:13:03.079
and everybody cry maybe not at the same

00:12:59.089 --> 00:13:07.419
time but but to have to announce it in

00:13:03.079 --> 00:13:09.769
front of the whole class it's a little

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:11.029
demeaning right I mean that's a meaning

00:13:09.769 --> 00:13:14.179
again cuz everybody does it it's just

00:13:11.029 --> 00:13:18.259
it's more information than necessary why

00:13:14.179 --> 00:13:19.819
make them verbalize like in college you

00:13:18.259 --> 00:13:21.230
just get up and go because you're an

00:13:19.819 --> 00:13:22.819
adult in there like out of you're paying

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.049
for the class what do I care the

00:13:22.819 --> 00:13:26.110
teachers I guess share some

00:13:24.049 --> 00:13:36.190
responsibility for your well-being

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:38.190
in elementary school just I mean I'm

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:41.440
thinking back to an anecdote that I had

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:42.670
when I was in second grade you need a

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.610
little bit of backstory on this

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:49.690
throughout my entire and I mean entire

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:50.500
school career I pooped at the school two

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:54.630
times

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:57.310
that's it one time was in second grade

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:58.810
so it's like my third or fourth year of

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:00.460
school junior kindergarten senior

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:02.430
kindergarten first grade second grade I

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:05.020
had never pooped to the school before

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:07.600
it's kind of like my white whale if you

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:13.440
will is all of a sudden I feel that

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:15.900
telltale urge I put up my hand and I

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:18.670
asked the teacher

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:20.620
can I go poop and she said yes you can

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:22.630
go but you don't have to save which one

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.560
you're doing and I understand where

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:25.720
she's coming from

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:28.450
especially in hindsight but she's gonna

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:31.690
oh oh you instead what I'm gonna do put

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:32.980
up my hand uh may I go poop or pee I

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:34.360
already knows what you're doing in the

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:36.190
bathroom it's not like you're

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:38.410
maintaining some level of plausible

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:40.480
deniability like he could just be going

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:42.130
to wash his hands he's seven years old

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:46.450
he's now going to the bathroom to wash

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:49.900
his hands willfully he's taking the

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:52.180
number two or number one anyway the next

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:53.920
time was one time in high school when I

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:56.800
had some gastrointestinal distress

00:14:53.920 --> 00:15:00.190
I always just and this this carries

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.610
onwards to this point I have I've gotten

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:03.550
over it

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:05.740
I will poop in public you know not to

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:08.230
overload you here I'm not giving you

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:09.550
gross details so if you're like we'd

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.750
like just get over it you might have a

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:12.400
child one day you're have to change

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:14.800
their diaper get ready to deal with you

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:18.760
know poop I pooped on an airplane I've

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:21.520
pooped in restaurants multiple places of

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:24.190
employment many different times I'm

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:26.500
basically over it probably pooped on

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:28.740
like four continents definitely North

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.760
America and Asia certainly Europe I

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:32.810
don't think I have the third or the

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:37.020
fourth continent yet

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:38.850
well I guess Great Britain is still

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.290
technically part of Europe anyway I

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:42.900
digress we don't need to go down that

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:47.270
road all I'm getting that is that it is

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:47.270
a condition that no longer afflicts me

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:53.490
but still I like I like privacy in the

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:56.010
moment let's use this 99 cents as a good

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:58.320
opportunity to buy a bunch of stuff that

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:59.910
we have not picked up yet so if that

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.650
would be good for us for the run but

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:03.600
also probably items that we have not

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:08.010
picked up yet so we can just improve on

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:10.590
our progress towards getting it you know

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:12.480
basically everything online I don't

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:14.220
necessarily think it's a rare thing to

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:18.300
like privacy when you defecate I'm just

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:19.590
saying I don't want to take a little bag

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.120
at some point we're going to have to

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:22.020
take little baggie I don't want to take

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.040
little baggie I think we've already

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:27.030
taken moving bucks

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:28.410
I do like BFF you might even be saying

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:31.890
who doesn't like I don't know there are

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:33.720
people that poop with the door open I

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:36.390
don't like that even if I'm a home by

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:38.880
myself I close the door and I justify it

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:41.700
to myself that like oh like if I get

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.560
robbed I at least want one door between

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:45.660
me and the robbers first off

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.310
gives me time to prepare secondly a

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:48.660
certain layer of decency later you're

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:50.850
going to take all my stuff I don't want

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:52.260
to be naked in in a vulnerable position

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:55.430
while you do it I guess what I'm

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.430
suggesting here

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:03.930
it's a good pickup same with the shower

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:04.980
I don't like being in the shower with

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:06.720
the door open

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:09.170
not the shower door I'm like the

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:12.600
bathroom door that leads to the shower

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:13.980
the door that leads to the room which

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.420
has the shower in it I'm just saying you

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.920
know we don't have a shower door seems

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.959
showers with doors is a shower curtain

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:21.270
situation just don't feel comfortable

00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:26.280
it's like it's exposed even though it it

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:29.340
shouldn't be but I might be in the

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:31.860
minority there I also like to have my

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:34.620
own environment like that you know time

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:37.380
with which to pursue it I think it's the

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:39.210
the long poop and I don't know if Robert

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:41.340
will attest to this it's not just

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:43.830
because people say like well you know if

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:45.090
you take 15 minutes to defecate why

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:46.680
don't you just take five minutes to

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:48.120
defecate and then 10 minutes of doing

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.560
whatever you would do on the toilet but

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.300
not on the toilet you raise a very

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:54.360
logical point but it's different it's a

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:56.580
psychological thing it's about having a

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.740
force to break to guilt-free do whatever

00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:00.750
you want in there so you know when I was

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:03.990
in high school I beat Super Mario

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:05.670
Brothers 3 the re-released version for

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:08.310
the Game Boy Advance on the toilet took

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:09.480
me several months of you know 10 to 15

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:11.130
minute play sessions but I had a

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.100
wonderful time doing it great memories

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:15.900
so the best times in my life honestly

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:17.790
read countless books takes a long time

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:22.650
but if you feel like it's a job well

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:24.390
done at the end you know I didn't have a

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:25.980
smartphone occasionally you do the crap

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:28.110
top you ever do that you bring your

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:31.790
laptop it into the bathroom with you and

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:31.790
play like Microsoft chess or something

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:36.660
onl I don't want to use your laptop good

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.020
don't use my laptop it's my laptop suck

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.540
on that

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:41.010
I've got my germs on it I'm not worried

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.080
about my own germs I wash my hands

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:45.270
afterwards that the laptop picks up some

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.810
poop particles that's fine by the way

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:49.890
I'm sure everybody going oh that's gross

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:53.010
y'all are using your smartphone on the

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:54.930
toilet anyway that's different is not on

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:58.200
my lap it's an inch and a half away from

00:18:54.930 --> 00:19:03.180
my lab the germs can't travel that far

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:04.080
there's a force field around it bunch of

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.150
hypocrites

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:09.260
y'all strong men are a bunch of

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:09.260
hypocrites okay

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:14.700
I'm just saying they were dark times

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:20.309
back then the smartphone is

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:23.820
revolutionized it humbling bundle is

00:19:20.309 --> 00:19:27.990
doing work I think you know we should do

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:31.580
the classic oh by the way Holy Light

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:36.299
Plus crickets body nice combination I

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:38.250
appreciate getting extra Holy Light

00:19:36.299 --> 00:19:39.720
shots that but there's a lot of riffraff

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:41.039
on a room could help us out a great deal

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:44.340
but I think we should do the classic

00:19:41.039 --> 00:19:46.320
boss rush move which is essentially use

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:48.450
diplopia and take four items from boss

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.080
rush if they give us the opportunity to

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:54.659
do so

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:56.820
so here's the theory I want to test we

00:19:54.659 --> 00:19:59.279
don't need to of any of these so we're

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:01.919
just going to take nun's habit even

00:19:59.279 --> 00:20:04.250
though it here's the thing in case

00:20:01.919 --> 00:20:06.389
you're not familiar excuse me

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:08.759
okay I'm losing my mind

00:20:06.389 --> 00:20:10.500
because that should have broken it in

00:20:08.759 --> 00:20:11.789
case you're not familiar nuns have it

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:15.059
might be useless for us right now but

00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:16.470
holy water is just not good so I mean

00:20:15.059 --> 00:20:18.899
especially considering we have Aquarius

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:23.159
we can make our own holy water with

00:20:18.899 --> 00:20:25.440
blackjack but what I'm trying to get at

00:20:23.159 --> 00:20:29.070
with you here in the windows of my soul

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:30.779
is there's no reason to use diplopia

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:32.220
there we don't need to none sabes

00:20:30.779 --> 00:20:38.070
doesn't do anything for us now what I

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:39.450
wanted to test is do we get young didn't

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:41.610
nevermind the test just came through all

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:44.759
explain and unless though we don't get

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:49.919
Holy Light shots out of the crickets

00:20:44.759 --> 00:20:53.159
body prog unless the first shot was Holy

00:20:49.919 --> 00:20:54.659
Light in which case we get four holy

00:20:53.159 --> 00:20:58.049
light shots when it goes through

00:20:54.659 --> 00:21:00.419
crickets body that's pretty cool I mean

00:20:58.049 --> 00:21:02.639
on the one hand I would like to create

00:21:00.419 --> 00:21:03.929
Holy Light shots out of a non Holy Light

00:21:02.639 --> 00:21:05.669
shot when it's a wall but on the other

00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:07.830
hand getting guaranteed Holy Light shots

00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:10.080
out of every Holy Light shot is really

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:11.549
good now it's a sense that obviously if

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:13.049
we came close to the end there started

00:21:11.549 --> 00:21:15.289
to make no sense to me but that's fine

00:21:13.049 --> 00:21:15.289
as well

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:21.070
we do have secret rooms available I'm

00:21:19.139 --> 00:21:23.260
going to choose not to care

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:25.690
about those and instead focus on getting

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:26.920
to the mom five-year we know we have a

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:29.170
deal with the angel and we know the deal

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:31.180
with the angel it stinks and I don't

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:33.190
like it at this point because it's got

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:40.690
nothing in it an angel statue I can't

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:43.350
even blow up come on I gotta try one

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:45.930
more time just because it seems like

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:49.330
yeah okay so we got to unlock

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:50.650
'blow-up-able angel statues I guess we

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:53.350
will I mean neither of them are

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:56.260
particularly strong but we'll double

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:58.480
them anyway and you could actually it's

00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:05.980
a rare situation both of these items

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:07.390
benefit from doubles only mildly we're

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:10.020
like we're already at max speed and our

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:14.680
range is good but do we really want to

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:16.180
be bf flying around on small levels I

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.740
think the answer is no but I'm probably

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.750
going to take that regardless I don't

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:28.090
think we get any closer to fungi by

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:29.680
taking a third mini much too hard me we

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:33.160
do have BFF as well

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:36.340
I don't know if be BF + BFF has any kind

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:38.080
of synergistic element to it but it does

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:40.480
have a certain linguistic coolness to it

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:42.160
so I appreciate that and why are we

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:46.120
actually finishing boss rush well

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:47.680
remember back before boss rush was

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:50.530
something that you just stole items from

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:54.250
boss rush was something you do in order

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:57.370
to unlock things so what if this unlocks

00:22:54.250 --> 00:23:02.100
of one of the dye one of the dice I

00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:02.100
guess it's like very Isaac E

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:12.899
Isak on lock design uh-oh

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:14.429
shouldn't the back of the mask I didn't

00:23:12.899 --> 00:23:16.200
realize the heart was still alive I

00:23:14.429 --> 00:23:18.090
should have followed the advice of

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:20.820
Norman Osborn from the first spider-man

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:22.889
film the heart Osborn first you attack

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:25.230
the heart that weird scene where he's

00:23:22.889 --> 00:23:33.720
having a conversation with himself as

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:35.549
the Green Goblin in the mirror so much

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:39.090
the first spider-man movie I've actually

00:23:35.549 --> 00:23:40.919
seen for a while the first spider-man

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:44.159
movie there was an awkward transition

00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:46.799
from Ryan the middle schooler into Ryan

00:23:44.159 --> 00:23:49.759
the snob so there was like a bit of a

00:23:46.799 --> 00:23:52.080
period probably around like the year

00:23:49.759 --> 00:23:54.269
2003-2004 I was like my favorite movie

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:57.080
of all time Charlie Kaufman's adaptation

00:23:54.269 --> 00:23:59.669
Nicolas Cage turns in a performance as

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:03.419
brothers charlie and donald kaufman that

00:23:59.669 --> 00:24:05.820
is otherworldly and also reality bending

00:24:03.419 --> 00:24:07.830
in this creative film from the scribe of

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:09.720
Being John Malkovich and then at the

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:13.259
same time I was like second favorite

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:15.179
film ever finer man one with great power

00:24:13.259 --> 00:24:18.090
comes great responsibility Plus Kirsten

00:24:15.179 --> 00:24:19.379
Dunst is real cute that was third

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:21.570
favorite movie of all time

00:24:19.379 --> 00:24:23.490
Star Wars Episode two attack of the

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:25.080
clones that's false I never really liked

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:27.899
attack of the clones but for a while

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:29.909
spider-man one was my favorite

00:24:27.899 --> 00:24:33.720
I'm sorry my second favorite movie of

00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:39.440
all time mmm you've really got to check

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:42.539
out this Tartakovsky film solaris it's

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:44.309
so haunting in its desolate beauty and

00:24:42.539 --> 00:24:53.759
then also have you considered watching

00:24:44.309 --> 00:24:55.470
Ben Affleck's 2002 film daredevil well

00:24:53.759 --> 00:24:57.450
we should Emperor like right away

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:59.669
because what do we care about the womb

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:01.049
one we don't care about the bloom I'll

00:24:59.669 --> 00:25:03.379
spoil it for you we don't care about the

00:25:01.049 --> 00:25:03.379
womb one

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:09.809
and the runs actually are going to be

00:25:07.679 --> 00:25:12.240
closer to like a representative length

00:25:09.809 --> 00:25:14.250
now I think now you know what we already

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:16.710
have brimstone last run let's focus on

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:22.170
synergies that we know we can that are

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:24.030
that are a little bit more novel now

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:27.300
I've grown into a full-blown full-blown

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:31.230
snob but I think I've rebuked my earlier

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:33.450
snobby ways like my film choices now I

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:41.280
think are a reaction to the way that I

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:45.860
overcorrect it as a as a teenager like I

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:49.110
definitely for my like 17th birthday

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:51.870
this is not a joke apparently like what

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:54.570
do you want for your birthday

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:56.450
and I was like the DVD of Frederico

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:58.559
fellini's classic film eight and a half

00:25:56.450 --> 00:26:00.870
NL are you a big fan of eight and a half

00:25:58.559 --> 00:26:02.610
not really I had never seen it but I

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:04.070
read on the internet that it was one of

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:06.630
those films you have to see I

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:08.790
Washington's a 17 year old I didn't

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:10.320
really get it to be honest with you it's

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:12.300
like I don't really like it that much

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:14.030
then people said have you like eight and

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:16.050
a half and I said always a master's I

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:19.590
don't want people to think I'm stupid

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:21.600
right of course he'll get eight and a

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:22.740
half when you're 12 most people at least

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:25.830
won't get eight and a half when they're

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:27.809
17 years old for the average person your

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:29.220
life experience is not at the highest

00:26:27.809 --> 00:26:31.050
point is ever going to be at the age of

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:33.900
17 if you're watching this you're 17 I'm

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:35.490
not insulted by any stretch of the

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:39.690
imagination but you've got so much life

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:41.700
ahead of you you can't even fathom and

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:43.470
it's going to open up a world of

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:45.660
understanding in other media not just

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:47.130
from getting references that you

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:49.770
wouldn't otherwise get but I just you

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:51.000
know will resonate with you as well

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:52.380
because you've done through some of the

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.080
stuff for the characters gone through as

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:59.670
well how am I supposed to relate to a

00:26:55.080 --> 00:27:04.110
film about an aging Italian film starred

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:06.290
so they just doesn't fit that'll stay

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:08.190
open but let's why even take any chances

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:09.630
you know you complete yourself in

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:11.150
someone else's shoes to some extent you

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:12.990
get all you got to live more to

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:18.750
experience it I think the way it's meant

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:24.960
to be experienced contagion 20/20 these

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:28.050
are good pick ups I also feel like you

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:32.100
ever like listen to music no never

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:34.410
um now you ever listen to music and then

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:36.840
like not know some of the lyrics and

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:38.640
then you come back to it like you listen

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.240
to the song a hundred times don't know

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.980
the lyrics

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.630
you know they I know most of the words

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:44.250
but some of the words just you know

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:45.840
don't work for me they don't fit in my

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:47.340
brain it just sounds like gibberish you

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.670
come back after like six years looking

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:52.230
to it and you go always saying I

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:54.180
understand now that's the same thing you

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:56.850
know the brain's grown up a little bit

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:58.410
you've heard more more phrases and you

00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:00.390
interpret it better maybe I don't know

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:01.680
I'm getting a little abstract even for

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:04.110
me at this point but it's been happening

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:07.400
to me lately I can't think of an example

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:07.400
off the top of my head here

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:13.080
one is actually and I don't know what

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:16.680
this has to do with growing older but

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:19.140
you know in kiss from a rose seal says

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:21.540
to me and like a grown addiction and I

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:24.330

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:26.100

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:27.840
when okay I saw myself as Rory said the

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:30.030
line but to me you're like a grown

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:32.730
addiction then I can be a man when I was

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:36.720

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:40.080

New York Times a bag old man you know at

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:29.950

you threw up on the carpet

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:53.410
and I had to get a wet paper towel and

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:54.790
dab it half asleep they'd go back to

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:56.680
sleep and then you wake up three hours

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:58.210
later but you don't feel like you had

00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:00.430
the kind of sleep you were supposed to

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:02.590
have because it was interrupted and your

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:05.340
whole day is just like mildly off-kilter

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:07.990
it's all right buddy

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:10.060

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:15.430

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:44.309
a macabre moment there I don't know if I

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:46.980
should have busted out into bad singing

00:30:44.309 --> 00:30:50.779

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:50.779
