00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.149
hey everybody welcome back to on the

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.450
line please binding eyes again trip plus

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.220
it's dailies yesterday we came 46

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.830
according to green but I don't know what

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.410
percentage that is really mean encoding

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.870
overloaded considered turning down

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.190
videos it's the it's the binding of

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.270
issac you know what they want me to do

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:25.769
is close Skype here um we're gonna go

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:30.300
Skype sign out we've got a really long

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.759
message could be as much as like eight

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.760
or nine bytes in that message so that

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.969
may be overloaded the encoder alright

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.180
became 46 yesterday was within the best

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.860
one percent on the run is not an Excel

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.950
floor so I looked at the scores uh

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.570
briefly on greed but today for today's

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.820
around it's a Sampson run that goes all

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.930
the way the top score was like fifty

00:00:50.820 --> 00:01:01.379
seven thousand it's a highly respectable

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:03.300
score not being in the 60s I don't know

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.729
how much weight to give that because I

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.860
would say on most runs that go all the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.080
way there's one person that busted wide

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.270
open but it's rarely me to begin with

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.909
there think I have a smaller upper bound

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.220
to my runs than the average person you

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.979
know that occasionally finds themselves

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.080
in the top of the leaderboard so I would

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.470
be amazed what I'm amazed I would be

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.320
happy to end up anywhere in the 50s on

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:33.200
today's run I would also be happy to be

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.100
in the late forties mostly because I

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.049
read I don't know I was going to make a

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.820
joke about Judd Apatow again but I think

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.470
I've gone to pharmacies from the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.680
system's lawyers is coming in any day

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.329
now a big fan Judd not really of your

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.890
first name I always thought judge was a

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.759
little bit more of a last name um you

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.930
got Ashley

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.509
Wynonna and then the judge and then you

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.250
try to take it for a first name I feel

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.979
like your name should be Apatow judge

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.280
which also I mean if you think about it

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.530
it's a great name for like an organic

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.000
grocery store mostly because I don't

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.810
know what any of the words mean in that

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.390
expression all actually all food is

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.830
organic because

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.200
four so the organic it just has to be

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.950
carbon-based on all food okay you get

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.459
the idea

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:24.170
but like you need to go and then we will

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:27.050
take this and that is our floor you know

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.490
the rules as far as I as it goes and I

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.090
mean I would be remiss if I didn't do

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:36.680
the rick astley and so do i do what you

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:40.390
get the a dia early on don't take damage

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.390
don't squander your deal with the devil

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:48.950
and keep yourself not super tunnel

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.780
visioned unlike maximizing output on

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.630
every single floor because we do need to

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:57.800
keep an overall kind of like timer going

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:00.290
internally that reminds us that there is

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.330
the possibility that poor time

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:09.050
management leads to us not getting to

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:10.310
boss rush so I don't like when I get

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.340
into the little shuffle there but that's

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.610
okay big rooms also I do not like and I

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.040
was just about to suggest that the flies

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:22.790
are amongst the worst of all of these

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.230
rooms we also have no means with which

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.780
to get into this item er we have no

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.000
means with which to build up bloody lust

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.790
right now short of taking damage which

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.320
strikes me is not the best idea right

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.140
now

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.160
but the consumable starts that comes

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.140
through in the clutch we could be

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.459
completely fine odds are this is going

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.590
to be one of the tougher rooms we face

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.769
so the fact that we got through it is

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.769
good

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.980
wouldn't mind you know picking up some

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.520
money

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.990
an arcade in the future is kind of a

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.310
necessary element to make sure that the

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.670
Samson run is the best chance possible

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.230
to pop off ooh okay disregard we got

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.210
Polyphemus so we're killing it already

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.240
that is a plus eleven point five damage

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:09.570
upgrade obviously our rate of fire is

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.610
now pretty terrible as well but the

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.930
Polyphemus shots are well worth it

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.180
especially if we can get tiers upgrades

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.160
to compensate so and we don't really

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.540
want to do that and by that I mean we do

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.760
really want to do it but we don't really

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.320
want to cost ourselves a deal with the

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.110
devil chance just to do it because

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.430
something like well something like

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.930
basically literally anything would be

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.780
awesome right now this Polyphemus

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.020
synergizes with a lot of the items in

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:38.280
the game so let's just beat the boss and

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:41.370
then worry about this curse room it's

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.490
actually like a really nice boss fight

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.290
for Polyphemus I think the best course

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.840
of action is to do a little damage to

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.910
the bodily segments and then try to hit

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.600
him with like a well-timed kill shot in

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.490
the face

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.520
that destroys multiple segments at the

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.870
same time pretty much exactly how that

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.300
went down we got two tiers upgrade as

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.090
well which we really needed the spirit

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.870
heart it doesn't really matter that it's

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:12.180
so good I guess and we are going to go

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:16.740
for both of these and we're going to

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.970
lose our oh we're going to get access to

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.620
the boss Trevorton we're going to lose

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.300
our spirit art and that was kind of

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.640
stupid of me to even pick up the spirit

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.010
out there was no reason to do that

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.180
although with one HP we sort of did need

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:32.360
to pick it up otherwise we couldn't have

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:35.340
lived to go into this room tower card

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.410
might actually be useful for potential

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:42.540
secret room access but let's go to our

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:44.100
boss trap room quickly work yeah I mean

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.270
is basically the worst possible outcome

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:51.050
right there I'm a little bummed that

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:51.050
that bomb took 25 years to explode but

00:05:52.800 --> 00:06:00.010
offensively speaking nothing can stop us

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.930
we have 16 damage and our rate of fire

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:05.830
is better than it is on some Eden runs

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:12.730
so I think we're extremely happy about

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:20.020
that to get a spirit heart lemon party

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:21.790
pill I want to get to five cents but we

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.800
don't need to do it right now I'm gonna

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.120
try to use the tower card anyway usually

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.420
on a big room it just drops all the

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.830
bombs near the middle so the odds of us

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.280
getting a secret room there were very

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:36.670
very low could have used it there

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:40.180
instead we should get out of here but we

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:42.390
have no concerns whatsoever about our

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.680
ability to get through this run quickly

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:47.050
all we need to do now is just make sure

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.690
that we stay relatively centered you

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.860
know play well and I mean I'm not going

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.660
to suggest that it's an automatic

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.310
victory but I mean if we can get that

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.530
guffy dream to come through we will

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.030
almost certainly win unless we're on

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.800
like two HP when it happens because we

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.410
do need to fight hush and that's an

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:07.200
important part of the of the process and

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:10.990
a speed down is pretty bad I would never

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:15.370
dispute that it's probably a secret room

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:20.500
mmm chocolate milk Polyphemus I don't

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:23.980
know how you how you feel about that you

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:26.890
think it's good I think you're right if

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:30.250
I get a bomb I might endeavour to okay

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:33.130
there you go my good luck charm throw

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.340
this down here you see Tomo oh there he

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:38.530
goes

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:43.570
goodbye goodbye my companion yeah have

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:45.660
fun love you I can't believe I dodged

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:48.430
that shot

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.960
okay I can't believe I didn't dodge that

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.460
shot how meny monstro is he gonna make

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.610
me fight also how are you gonna make me

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:55.060
wait he's dead 33% deal with the devil

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:58.560
champs

00:07:55.060 --> 00:08:02.730
nothing experimental treatment gives us

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:05.050
tears up way now to tears way down

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:08.410
well tears down a little bit

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:09.940
lockup I think you got it you got to try

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.560
it our tears sad is not as bad as it

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:15.400
looks it's only it gets manifested

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:17.680
weirdly thanks to thanks to chocolate

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.810
milk it's not actually like we shoot

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.460
once every 25 minutes and if we do shoot

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:28.030
once every 25 minutes the shot is going

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:29.290
to be well and truly charged little

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:31.480
disappointed with the damage that I've

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:34.990
taken so far and I think that's a very

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:36.789
fair place to be right now where do I

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:39.280
stand relative to the norm here

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:41.020
si si that's a good question because I

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.539
think with nine lives I'm probably

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:49.720
stronger than average and I'm not just

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:55.000
saying that nothing I am not afraid to

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:59.110
give away some of these lives why not to

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.589
make dreams come true that might not be

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:05.230
that rare I'm just saying I am more than

00:09:02.589 --> 00:09:07.240
willing to you know sacrifice seven of

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:08.650
these like eight remaining lives if it

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.720
gets us the items that we need to really

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:12.880
succeed here we also have a ton of time

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.040
I'll do second syringe this will be huge

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.230
it's not huge but that's okay it's

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:20.710
actually a speed downgrade that's pretty

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:22.750
terrible as I'm sure you're aware I did

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:25.030
squander my chance at least right now of

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:27.130
getting to five cents because I bought

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:28.930
the map in hindsight I mean I'll just

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:33.790
level with you that's probably not worth

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:35.920
it a lot of bombs though so secret broom

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:39.250
we've already gotten right we have no

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:41.500
keys so I think we're on zero hearts

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:44.620
right now which means going to the curse

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:46.180
room will kill us but you got a well I

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.080
didn't realize we were on half a heart

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.770
that's

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.780
[Music]

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:54.000
substantially worse obviously and the

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:56.160
tower cardigans got a lemon party well

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.180
still have half of a Black Card

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.550
remaining now so this might have

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:03.420
actually worked out for the best and

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:06.260
then we found our secret room just one

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:09.270
penny it's not worth it for one penny

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:11.130
was there uh we've got tons of time here

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:14.190
so don't sweat it too much but it was

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:22.170
their greed statues in here they're

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:24.870
worth six cents six cents okay I think

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:27.870
that means we well we could buy a key or

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.440
we could go there's no key for sale that

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.930
makes it easy

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.360
I'm sorry item room I should not have

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:35.100
gone to the shop because we could have

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.050
bombed our way into the shop instead of

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:39.600
using a key it's actually like a fairly

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:41.520
subtle but sizable miss play however we

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.340
keep our money it allows us to go to an

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:46.860
arcade if there is an arcade on this

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:48.240
floor we don't have a lot of HP to

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:53.660
enable that arcade to work flawlessly

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:56.040
but whatever we have we'll use and

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:57.630
certainly making great time right now

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.250
even though we know this is a dead end

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:01.260
you got to remember it's a daily so

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:03.060
we're doing all of our exploration bonus

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:06.510
that's plausible here Wheel of Fortune

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:12.090
is not worth too much to speed downgrade

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:13.320
so we're going to ignore it anyway it

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.390
might seem like this runs in a dire

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.610
place but it's really quite the opposite

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:19.380
as far as I'm concerned we have seven

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.700
and a half red hearts there's right now

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:25.250
we have seven red hearts and a half

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:28.020
black card right now so I am far from

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:28.890
perturbed by the situation I would like

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.840
a speed upgrade

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:33.000
although experimental treatment did hook

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:37.400
us up apparently you know what I don't

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:42.050
need a speed upgrade that was that was a

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:44.100
vestige of a previous run or a previous

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:46.290
attribute iteration if you will we

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:50.820
should just use uh I think we should

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:52.980
still use lemon party even though eighty

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:54.360
percent of this dude is flying you saw

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:57.600
it's still tore him up pretty nicely

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:58.230
there well worth the cost of doing

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.920
business

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:03.470
addicted I found pills okay

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:06.910
we're really getting a feel for our pill

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:09.230
rotation jesu you know des of right now

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:11.930
hasn't really made me the happiest

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:13.820
camper there's been some ok stuff though

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:16.520
this could also be a secret room this

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:23.240
actually it's not an open-and-shut case

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:24.710
as it often is think maybe we're batting

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.000
a little under our weight class here

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:30.260
we've taken some damage

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.420
I mean dying on a curse room thanks to

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.860
curse of the unknown I'm not going to

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.450
say there's nothing I could have done

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.520
about that like we could have not taken

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:39.980
that damage against monstro and that

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:43.010
would have kept us alive but I'm not

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:44.600
overly concerned about it I don't think

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:46.790
it's going to have a huge impact on our

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:49.220
run probably could be wrong but I think

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:51.020
we're probably going to be if we end up

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:52.840
ranking really poorly we're going to

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.980
blame it on other things is my guess

00:12:52.840 --> 00:13:01.490
other things that maybe we haven't even

00:12:54.980 --> 00:13:03.590
seen yet so bozo is like not very good

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:06.110
but occasionally it might give you a

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:07.880
rainbow poop that was I can't remember

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:09.500
if it was on a daily I think it was that

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:12.260
was the conclusion I came to is that

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:15.260
bozo is a basically a zero damage

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:19.760
upgrade which makes it basically a zero

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:24.340
everything upgrade such a good shot from

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:24.340
that mushroom dude this room is heinous

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:31.850
but it might occasionally give you

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:34.370
rainbow poops and you can see the value

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:35.630
of rainbow poop says Samson if we were

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:38.780
able to get more red hearts which

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:40.970
obviously we don't have right now but

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:42.410
you know one day in the future we might

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:46.520
get lucky what do you think what do you

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:49.670
think what do you think No many many

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:52.850
secret room locations possible here

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:58.040
that's not a second secret room I'm

00:13:52.850 --> 00:14:00.850
actually so tilted two of diamonds of

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.850
course is lovely

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:06.090
several hundred point increase but

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:08.370
doesn't really do a whole heck of a lot

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:10.500
for us beyond that if we can't get keys

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:12.180
to go along with it the good news is we

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:18.150
can hold it we got no seams to worry

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:20.220
about speed upgrades still valuable even

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:23.370
though it's not specifically something I

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:29.100
asked for and we definitely do want to

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:31.500
take dark bomb why not is my question

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:33.860
like little delirium might not actually

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:37.950
be very good at all

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:40.350
and it might even hurt us from time to

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:41.550
time but it didn't really cost us

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:43.530
anything to take so I think we just

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:47.430
going to go we're on schedule little

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:54.390
delirium is going to do some stuff apart

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:57.030
from that though keys please I always

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:59.640
forget by the way which one is little

00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:02.130
delirium which one's delirious or

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:06.870
whatever it is delirious gives you a

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:10.740
boss as a familiar for one room and this

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:12.270
gives us a random familiar every room it

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:16.260
might be time based though it might not

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:19.380
be room based okay one key actually

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:20.790
reassuring deal with the devil chance we

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:25.020
could or not deal with the devil sorry

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:31.020
item room item room guarantee really I'm

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:32.850
not sure if we want to roll that could

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:40.740
be its to give it a shot I'm not sure if

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:43.680
we want to roll the not going to play

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:45.720
you the mob trap room just because we're

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.730
low ish on keys and of course as I said

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:49.260
we're Louis Shan keys we've gotten like

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:50.820
a lot more keys so I'm actually going to

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:53.880
go back and do it especially because we

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:55.140
do probably have the time and red hearts

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:58.230
are useful for us as well I'm just going

00:15:55.140 --> 00:16:02.490
to get the ones that don't require the

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:05.550
use of the bombs and if we have enough

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:07.140
keys afterwards we might consider using

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:10.760
bombs and actually it seems like it's

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:10.760
working out really well so far

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:19.780
this could be a big room for us a speed

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:21.610
down of course is amazing I've had three

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:25.870
of them so far sack of sacks is a great

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:28.210
item we've still got two keys left I

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:30.670
don't know we picked up proudly like

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:32.920
flight I mean we picked up three and a

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:35.530
half three spirit hearts on that room

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:45.580
it's a relatively sound choice to go

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:47.920
there honestly I think we're like 500

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:51.190
points below where I normally am on an

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:54.100
Isaac daily though at the same time I am

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:56.500
whatever you say I am if I wasn't then

00:16:54.100 --> 00:17:00.640
why would I say I am I forget it you

00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:04.990
know it's mmm oh you're an Eminem fan

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:08.709
what's this song then and now that's

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:13.690
Vanilla Ice's Ice Ice Baby um technology

00:17:08.709 --> 00:17:15.400
I think this is dope it might have

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:17.589
ruined our run or it might have turned

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.780
us into an unstoppable God you know I

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:25.060
mean like I'm of two minds about it

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:28.410
right now if we can get like a homing

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:30.370
tear or something I'm loving life uh

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:37.840
it's a tough call because there's

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:41.040
options is great however I need a bigger

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:46.450
hitbox man there's options is great

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:51.220
however do I really want to use two of

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:52.930
diamonds on 13 cents if we're going to

00:17:51.220 --> 00:18:00.900
we should do it before this boss fight

00:17:52.930 --> 00:18:03.820
oh that's good stuff we'll hold that I

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:07.150
think technology Polyphemus is actually

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:09.100
pretty bad seem because it only fires at

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:11.050
like a max charge but the shot doesn't

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.500
seem to do nearly as much damage as it

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:14.290
used to

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:16.120
I think I'm not going to pop two of

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:18.220
diamonds and there's an opportunity cost

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:22.690
associated with losing there's options

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:24.280
but we'll get to hold on to this and

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:25.090
like the holdout of the two of diamonds

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.580
then use it to

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:29.950
maybe get way more items on the blue

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:34.630
womb and if we don't get more items at

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:36.430
least we get more points out of it this

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:40.930
does rely on us not getting a different

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:43.630
card that we'd rather have though this

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:48.100
is a great time I can't believe that

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:50.080
work if we get a guppy item here on our

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:53.280
unlikely deal with the devil we're in a

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:56.440
great spot technology is nice

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.700
any piers upgrades I know we're not

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.820
going to get one from the boss but any

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:01.990
piers upgrades are also very valuable

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:03.820
technology has actually really slowed

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:06.520
down our progress on this run but we're

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:08.440
almost done we're gonna have to rush a

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.730
little bit to get the boss rush know

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:13.600
deal with the devil you got something

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:15.250
for me you do let's go okay we don't

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:20.890
have a particularly quick mom fight

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:24.870
stratus oh sure why not

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:27.310
as much as I hate to say it like I

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:28.300
wanted to do that just okay we didn't

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:35.740
even come to this room you got to be

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:41.890
smarter you got the map let's go we also

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:43.980
have seven bombs that's enough to bomb

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:49.150
our way through some rooms if necessary

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:50.590
again like I'm it's my own fault for not

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:53.230
realizing that these items don't

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:54.790
synergize that well I sort of still do

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:56.410
not understand why they don't synergize

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:59.050
that well but it's strength card

00:19:56.410 --> 00:20:02.050
we can't go well we can look in the boss

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:04.500
trap room in fact I might suggest that

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:06.610
we have to look in the boss trap room

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:08.950
because if there's like a Guppies head

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:11.620
changes everything but we're going to

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:16.410
rush from this point I mean it could be

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:16.410
Guppies head but we can't wait for it so

00:20:19.679 --> 00:20:26.710
still like a long floor okay this is

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:27.970
actually great that our item room is on

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:30.789
path with us here

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:34.690
I think Samson's chain is actually kind

00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:37.690
of terrible especially in the late game

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:39.400
it just causes us to take so much damage

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:40.090
from like blowing up stupid rocks and

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.970
stuff like that

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:49.750
hopefully our shop is also on trajectory

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:51.250
here it's not probably I mean at some

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.510
point you should still be bobbing your

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:54.039
way through the rooms that take too long

00:20:52.510 --> 00:21:00.190
thank you Bob's brain really appreciate

00:20:54.039 --> 00:21:02.820
that keeping me honest we should make it

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:02.820
at this point

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:12.169
we've got enough time but it still might

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:13.909
be kind of tight we also gain like one

00:21:12.169 --> 00:21:24.259
penny on this floor which is incredible

00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:28.580
to me but not quite going as fast as I

00:21:24.259 --> 00:21:38.559
would like do appreciate the extra

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:41.629
Incubus follower we're going to make it

00:21:38.559 --> 00:21:42.710
we might not want to do a deal with the

00:21:41.629 --> 00:21:44.749
devil if it shows up because of the

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:46.609
Krampus thing but I think I'm going to

00:21:44.749 --> 00:21:49.159
go for it anyway

00:21:46.609 --> 00:21:50.720
we need the Incubus to be honest with

00:21:49.159 --> 00:21:53.119
you we also would love contract from

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:55.220
below so I think that's going to be what

00:21:53.119 --> 00:21:57.470
makes or breaks us here is if we die on

00:21:55.220 --> 00:22:00.980
boss rush obviously we're screwed you

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:05.600
got to go number one if we don't die on

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:09.859
boss rush nobody else are they not

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:13.669
nobody but less people because they're

00:22:09.859 --> 00:22:20.169
saying our goal that was done are going

00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:26.799
to do what we did there now the thing is

00:22:20.169 --> 00:22:32.299
we are safe might not look like it but

00:22:26.799 --> 00:22:37.239
we're pretty safe we should bust the

00:22:32.299 --> 00:22:37.239
hole in the middle here good good job

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:45.850
and we're safe because we just need dark

00:22:42.559 --> 00:22:45.850
bum to get some red hearts

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:53.059
strength card might do it dude look at

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:54.650
that look at that play strength oh my

00:22:53.059 --> 00:23:00.190
god we've done it

00:22:54.650 --> 00:23:03.350
we're actually gods now so I don't know

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:07.280
to what extent I would say that this is

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:10.850
a contract from below vindicating us

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:12.440
completely but I mean did you see the HP

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:13.250
that we got now that's not going

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:16.340
anywhere dude

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:19.040
okay so we should at this point really

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:21.740
really stop with the damage penalty

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:23.360
because there is no reason whatsoever to

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:31.130
get hit oh my god dude these strength

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:36.970
cards we are a little larger than I'd

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:36.970
like to be but we do have 64 damage

00:23:42.929 --> 00:23:50.890
my shots I mean when they hit they

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:53.049
murder the enemy it seems almost

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:58.210
impossible to hit it's like as we get

00:23:53.049 --> 00:24:02.410
larger the hitbox for technology gets

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:06.669
smaller or something so obviously our

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:09.820
damage is going to lower once we finish

00:24:06.669 --> 00:24:10.900
this room we have like eight strength

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:14.770
cards that are going away

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:17.200
however okay this is getting a little

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:20.200
silly I don't think we want to use the

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:27.309
strength card I think we want to use two

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:29.049
of diamonds for points and for actually

00:24:27.309 --> 00:24:32.290
buying some items once we get down to

00:24:29.049 --> 00:24:34.210
the the blue room good eye I can't dodge

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:35.380
at this point it's not that the hitbox

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:37.770
is large it's just that I don't know

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.770
where it is

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:51.429
keep in mind we do also want / need to

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:53.980
go to the hush fight so we got a lot

00:24:51.429 --> 00:24:56.440
more work cut out for us and we're not

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:59.730
going that quickly boss rush is going to

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.730
be an aberration here

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:14.840
okay place a bomb like right there I'm

00:25:12.279 --> 00:25:16.850
unable to hit these enemies I'm unable

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:19.460
to hit any enemy with these technology

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:21.340
shots since when dude okay that was way

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:26.049
faster than I thought we were going I

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:26.049
don't know maybe you take key beggar you

00:25:27.789 --> 00:25:35.299
know what why not good point good point

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:41.659
all right down to the next floor we're

00:25:35.299 --> 00:25:44.059
still looking for Guffey I think we okay

00:25:41.659 --> 00:25:46.460
I don't think we take that I think we

00:25:44.059 --> 00:25:56.990
have the ability to do probably every

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:59.269
room that we come across maybe not now

00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:00.619
that I realized like our damage is high

00:25:59.269 --> 00:26:02.720
enough that we should be murdering

00:26:00.619 --> 00:26:05.179
monster in my opinion it's just hard to

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:07.580
line the enemies up and then the shots

00:26:05.179 --> 00:26:09.740
it doesn't do like sustain damage so I'm

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:12.019
really if there's anything in particular

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:16.399
that I'm bummed out on or bummed out

00:26:12.019 --> 00:26:20.029
about on today's run it's the the

00:26:16.399 --> 00:26:24.559
chocolate milk Polyphemus technology I

00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:29.210
guess it's more so it's probably this

00:26:24.559 --> 00:26:30.679
way it's more so Polyphemus technical

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:33.320
amil technology right I think we've had

00:26:30.679 --> 00:26:34.899
chocolate milk technology before and

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:37.100
been like this is broken

00:26:34.899 --> 00:26:38.629
Polyphemus just sort of mind flooded me

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:42.490
into not realizing that's where we were

00:26:38.629 --> 00:26:47.749
standing so yeah I mean above all else

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:49.549
this is an apology at the same time we

00:26:47.749 --> 00:26:52.730
could rank well in spite of my idiocy

00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:56.230
thanks to I mean a really really well

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:59.149
timed Incubus contract from below has

00:26:56.230 --> 00:27:02.830
vindicated itself more quickly than like

00:26:59.149 --> 00:27:02.830
any item in Isaac history

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:14.080
probably even should have taken damage

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:15.160
there but obviously I'm thrilled we

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:23.230
didn't just wanted to see this was a

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:30.880
curse room certainly we can afford to go

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:33.360
to it this point it's a strange run

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:36.190
it's a strange run but it's a fun run I

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:38.620
say that all the time probably getting

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:42.100
sick of hearing it but this one is like

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:44.860
genuinely very weird a Samson run where

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:47.080
you don't care at all about bloody lust

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:49.840
goose is an aberration in the Samson

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:52.830
wheelhouse I assure you a six room that

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:56.680
rerolls everything see here's the thing

00:27:52.830 --> 00:28:06.510
I'm going to do it we got conjoined now

00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:06.510
oh no oh no we have holy mantle though

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:18.180
what what is exploding what's why why

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:18.180
are our shots exploding in our face

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:31.660
well I actually so we screwed it but I

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:34.900
did it because I thought I could get us

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:38.380
out of that weird mess that I had

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:40.929
perceived us as being a part of but

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:43.570
little did I know first off thank God

00:28:40.929 --> 00:28:45.190
for holy mantle secondly I have rolled

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:47.730
us oh but we got a range upgrade you

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:47.730
think I'll do it

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:58.780
nope oh I've rolled us into oblivion

00:28:56.650 --> 00:29:03.010
I should not have done this this is

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:04.690
clear by the way you might be saying at

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:06.460
least why don't you just use blue baby's

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:09.190
only friend to do everything it still

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:12.100
requires us to shoot I'm not even saying

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:18.790
you're wrong but it does still require

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:21.130
us to shoot I actually like 100% have to

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:24.070
take the El on this one we still have

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:28.240
nine lives it is going to make the hush

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:32.340
fight probably impossible we've the

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:32.340
wafers of you oh my lord

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:36.520
shouldn't have done this room I'm really

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:38.230
looking for like I mean it has to be

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:40.030
infinite we already have infinite range

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:44.740
though via tractor beam that's the crazy

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:45.490
part like if I may offer one thing in my

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:51.040
own defense

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:53.440
you never ever could have predicted like

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:55.270
one rate of fire tractor beam but

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:56.890
somehow our range is still so bad the

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:59.290
shots are just falling directly in front

00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:00.880
of us so we do I mean having dark bomb

00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:06.730
would be awesome here but we don't have

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:10.600
doc bomb what we do wait wait wait what

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:13.710
we do have is the relic which is

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.710
actually very good

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:27.350
weirdly I think like our best chance

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:33.050
that's not very oh dude we gotta get

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:35.480
egghead there's a way it'll probably

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:38.540
cost us one spear at heart but it's also

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:42.620
at the same time completely essential so

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:45.940
you leave re-enter the room no no

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:50.210
there's a better way place a bomb

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:51.710
if this negates 25% of the damage we

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:54.140
might be able to come through on this

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:56.900
one we still I mean I didn't realize

00:30:54.140 --> 00:31:03.110
like it stopped I do want to go to the

00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:05.750
hush fight didn't again that damage and

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:12.820
that's gonna seem like madness but I

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:17.120
have two of diamonds dude dude dude

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:18.880
reroll me again please okay so we got

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:21.280
bookworm that might even be

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:23.540
substantially worse so I don't even know

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.890
now it's not about a rank you know

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:26.240
previously we were fighting for a rank

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:28.400
now we're fighting for our lives

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:30.559
wait we have we have the ability to fly

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:32.240
now how long have we had that long

00:31:30.559 --> 00:31:35.750
enough to matter maybe what's our range

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:45.040
still actually horrible okay oh but we

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:48.910
we have - touch do we have Midas touch

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:48.910
thank God for the wafer

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:55.110
we do not have Midas touch you know you

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:59.120
got to be thinking at this point

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:59.120
monkey's paw might be the best way to go

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:10.110
see you we still in my opinion have to

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:19.500
fight hush so I'm going to this is going

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:26.700
to be a bad mom's hard fight please turn

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:29.480
me into guppy pyromaniacs somehow dude

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.480
pyromaniac

00:32:32.539 --> 00:32:43.380
I'm begging restock pyromaniac somehow

00:32:38.299 --> 00:32:46.919
okay well I mean I think you just take a

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:51.630
baton because I want as many of those

00:32:46.919 --> 00:32:56.760
black cards as possible I would consider

00:32:51.630 --> 00:33:01.409
this run a win if we beat the hush fight

00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:03.899
here we really really really need

00:33:01.409 --> 00:33:07.830
something great to beat this hush fight

00:33:03.899 --> 00:33:14.279
I think we didn't make it and it was

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:17.700
close dude okay you take e.coli because

00:33:14.279 --> 00:33:20.490
you get the protection out of it nothing

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:24.390
here is that good the full card is not

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:27.330
that good health up is potentially

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:29.610
terrible that was not a good use of that

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:31.909
okay slow your roll fool card does

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:37.020
nothing to of diamonds so we're really

00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:39.029
first stop stop so you go rainbow baby

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:41.220
because it's better if we're going to

00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:43.649
get a passive versus an active we're

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:45.240
only going to use once or you go crystal

00:33:43.649 --> 00:33:47.159
ball for the one-time use card because

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:48.870
rainbow baby isn't that good one-time

00:33:47.159 --> 00:33:50.279
use something at least I'm going to go

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:55.409
crystal ball for the one-time use

00:33:50.279 --> 00:33:57.659
something and it was an empress card

00:33:55.409 --> 00:33:59.850
which I think we're just going to pop to

00:33:57.659 --> 00:34:03.420
a diamonds take the Empress card in with

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:04.890
us we want permanent polar

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:07.980
invincibility so I'm gonna leave that

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:12.030
red hard unactive we even have the

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:16.340
Polaroid do we have the negative I can't

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:16.340
see we might have neither okay well

00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:29.370
obviously we you know what blue babies

00:34:27.390 --> 00:34:31.710
only friends time to shine is is it

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:34.290
going to be the fastest hush fight we've

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:36.530
ever had but you know what it's got to

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:36.530
be done

00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:44.190
he gets frozen sometimes thanks to the

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:45.390
eye of the keeper or whatever it's not

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:49.290
even a head of a keeper you know what I

00:34:45.390 --> 00:34:50.820
mean so I'm trying to walk into him to

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:53.940
get some dirty touch damage done I'll

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:55.620
use all our bombs I don't care again

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:57.480
this run it stopped being a daily a

00:34:55.620 --> 00:35:00.570
little while ago now it's not a daily

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:03.330
it's a this is a streak run where I am

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:09.110
like singularly concerned with survival

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:09.110
I do want to get flies summons

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:21.040
if only there was a way to guarantee

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:24.130
myself like even if we if I just shot in

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:28.960
the wrong direction oh my god okay well

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:32.849
I mean anytime you get invincibility go

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:34.869
back here and use it on a hush but

00:35:32.849 --> 00:35:36.970
there's only a way that I could

00:35:34.869 --> 00:35:43.510
guarantee myself not getting hurt by my

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:45.820
own shots thank you egghead I think then

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:47.770
I would be happy to just shoot in the

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:52.830
wrong direction and let Rawdon Baby do

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:52.830
all the damage okay

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:04.680
the damage output is actually like

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:07.770
pretty good trying to get the baby's

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:16.800
only friend down here the damage output

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:22.560
is actually pretty good when we when

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:24.440
we're able to shoot sadly that's not

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:26.640
happening all that often right now I

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:29.520
don't blame the game for this one again

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:30.990
I had a I had a good run that I got

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.790
greedy with and it wasn't even a

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:35.910
selfless like ml does it for the same

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:38.070
sort of thing it was it was actually all

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:40.920
we picked up a red heart somehow it was

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:47.120
actually genuinely I was salty that I

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:49.530
had compromised my run by by taking

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.700
chocolate milk technology so I was like

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:56.700
how do we get ourselves out of this

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:59.070
let's give it a try and it made it even

00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:01.790
worse so that's I mean like a million

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:01.790
percent on me

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:14.430
we're gonna survive we might have a zero

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:17.490
chance dude it's so frustrating when you

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:22.950
lose blue baby's only friend that you

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:31.200
got to go back where's blue baby's only

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:32.819
friend what are you supposed to do I can

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:38.569
take two more hits he's dead he's dead

00:37:32.819 --> 00:37:41.460
okay um thank you thank you for that

00:37:38.569 --> 00:37:44.329
again I can't stress enough ranks not

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:44.329
going to be very good today

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:58.289
but let this be a cautionary tale to you

00:37:50.809 --> 00:38:00.960
the people Don and I only seen the go

00:37:58.289 --> 00:38:03.960
and you don't know what you got till

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:10.829
it's gone they pay Polyphemus and put up

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:13.920
a fire mine run and man and man put away

00:38:10.829 --> 00:38:17.390
the six of these I don't care about

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:24.359
chocolate milk just give me technology

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:26.369
please I don't know the longer this goes

00:38:24.359 --> 00:38:28.079
on the more I'm like we actually have a

00:38:26.369 --> 00:38:35.039
chance at winning so what our big

00:38:28.079 --> 00:38:38.789
weakness is rooms that take a long time

00:38:35.039 --> 00:38:40.500
I walked into a bomb there the wafer is

00:38:38.789 --> 00:38:46.230
making this plausible let's be honest

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:49.410
but rooms that are short are actually no

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:53.960
problem or less of a problem because I

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:53.960
have a holy mantle

00:38:56.089 --> 00:39:02.009
there's no way like we fire so quickly

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:04.650
that if we fire we're going to hurt

00:39:02.009 --> 00:39:06.859
ourselves within like no time flat but

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:12.660
if we can at least wound every enemy and

00:39:06.859 --> 00:39:14.999
then let a bum or some other attribute

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:18.479
do the job for us here we're relatively

00:39:14.999 --> 00:39:25.710
okay but long boss fights are going to

00:39:18.479 --> 00:39:28.710
be the big problem like see like now I'm

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:30.269
like I can't even shoot but I'd like to

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:32.369
do the room to get the demon heart so

00:39:30.269 --> 00:39:33.900
like we can let Gemini finish the job

00:39:32.369 --> 00:39:36.630
blue baby's only friend if we catch him

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:40.710
in like exactly the right moment the

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:45.089
occasional bomb see that should get the

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:48.799
job done it's not an ideal way to handle

00:39:45.089 --> 00:39:50.849
this but it's got to be done right I

00:39:48.799 --> 00:39:55.019
really wish we had permanent polaroid

00:39:50.849 --> 00:39:56.940
invincibility though it means like it's

00:39:55.019 --> 00:39:59.779
tough what do you do here just leave

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.779
that there I guess

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:09.980
that was bad even repositioning blue

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:19.849
baby's only friend puts us at like

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:22.099
incredible risk that's fine the wafer is

00:40:19.849 --> 00:40:25.160
still so huge for us here honestly I

00:40:22.099 --> 00:40:27.050
mean you you can probably infer this for

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:30.470
yourself at this point but if this run

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:32.990
that's also fair if this redun ends up

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:35.990
being a win that's so much more

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:39.109
incredible than like if we had ranked

00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:40.820
well today this is one of legitimately

00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:49.550
the toughest runs I've ever had in my

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:52.970
entire life for us to not royally mess

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:59.359
it up like that just leveling with you

00:40:52.970 --> 00:41:03.380
this should be a loss obviously we have

00:40:59.359 --> 00:41:05.300
the wafer thank God for egghead as well

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:06.980
obviously we have the wafer obviously we

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:09.109
have the relic obviously we have Satanic

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:12.680
Bible we have egghead as well it should

00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:17.240
still be a lot it's so bad it's so

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:21.140
unbelievably bad but we're working our

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:25.040
way out of it here please I'm just

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:30.790
begging for but something is not that

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:38.480
would be a start so the game plan is mad

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:43.300
simple against easier enemies we have to

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:43.300
build spirit and/or demon hearts

00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:57.490
that's not very good when you fire your

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:59.560
first shot and you get hit that kills me

00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:04.030
inside so you know what I'm going to go

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:08.050
all out for a bit here because maybe a

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:11.250
half spirit heart is where it's ad get

00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:14.350
that permanent polaroid invincibility

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:17.800
this room obviously we have to like win

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:20.460
now we're out of bombs so we basically

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.460
have no choice

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:26.730
dude the spirit hearts aah

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:32.830
why did I do lose to my surrey role was

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:33.400
in that it is I mean I'm just being

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:36.820
honest

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:38.590
it was a greedy reroll I was I was going

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:40.930
to win I was probably going to rank okay

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:46.810
but I thought you know what reinforce my

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:49.270
own identity slash image here and have

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:55.960
some fun in the process and it has been

00:42:49.270 --> 00:43:01.380
fun also horrible lusty blood is

00:42:55.960 --> 00:43:01.380
actually potentially game saving

00:43:05.699 --> 00:43:10.929
the damage gained from it we don't want

00:43:08.319 --> 00:43:15.279
that half part yet the damage gained

00:43:10.929 --> 00:43:20.859
from it is whatever but the potential

00:43:15.279 --> 00:43:22.989
demon hearts are outrageously good we

00:43:20.859 --> 00:43:26.249
don't need it to pay out that often

00:43:22.989 --> 00:43:26.249
believe it or not

00:43:28.409 --> 00:43:34.419
wait lusty blood is not serpents kiss

00:43:30.939 --> 00:43:38.499
that's my I got a little greedy there

00:43:34.419 --> 00:43:40.089
Luffy blood is not serpent kids give me

00:43:38.499 --> 00:43:42.130
soup the wolf should be once every two

00:43:40.089 --> 00:43:44.319
rooms we never have to shoot that's a

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:47.439
huge game didn't get you booth also did

00:43:44.319 --> 00:43:49.029
not get guppy disregard but still I mean

00:43:47.439 --> 00:43:50.289
lusty blood for the damage is good but

00:43:49.029 --> 00:43:51.729
we weren't really having problems

00:43:50.289 --> 00:43:55.419
killing enemies we were having problems

00:43:51.729 --> 00:43:59.429
stopping enemies from killing us all

00:43:55.419 --> 00:43:59.429
that was actually a terrible pickup

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:17.330
there is no cautious play anymore

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:19.160
there's just no way I'm not going to

00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:21.830
spend the whole run and I apologize if

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:24.890
you prefer to watch this but you're out

00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:26.570
of your mind I'm not going to use Gemini

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:29.960
to kill every enemy I've been in this

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:31.670
business too long to go down to that

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:38.960
level you know I can't go back there I'd

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:41.810
rather just retire lemon party lemon

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:44.000
party is actually very very good for our

00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:47.900
final boss fight or maybe a room

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:54.500
preceding it but I'm going to save it

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:57.050
for now for the final boss fight really

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:58.790
like all about getting as many shots in

00:44:57.050 --> 00:45:05.840
the air as we can

00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:08.930
that's that bomb oh well we're

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:14.410
invincible yeah we'll take I think

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:14.410
that's fair please

00:45:16.229 --> 00:45:21.849
okay no we made it we made it don't need

00:45:19.209 --> 00:45:23.829
that we got two spirit arts two demon

00:45:21.849 --> 00:45:28.449
hearts I'll do double cage is going to

00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:29.559
be held we don't need to be at a half

00:45:28.449 --> 00:45:30.819
heart interval now that I think about it

00:45:29.559 --> 00:45:33.579
we have the wafer we should pick up all

00:45:30.819 --> 00:45:35.709
red hearts unless we have a ton of demon

00:45:33.579 --> 00:45:37.209
heart so we can insulate ourselves that

00:45:35.709 --> 00:45:40.930
time we do want it I think we're going

00:45:37.209 --> 00:45:42.309
to win okay so we deserve every bit of

00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:47.709
the damage penalty we're going to get

00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:51.670
here and we also simultaneously deserve

00:45:47.709 --> 00:45:53.170
the W I know it's hard to it's hard to

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:56.799
reconcile those two opposing forces

00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:58.660
together but there you go wow that run

00:45:56.799 --> 00:46:00.969
sucks but was also hilarious we're going

00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:02.019
