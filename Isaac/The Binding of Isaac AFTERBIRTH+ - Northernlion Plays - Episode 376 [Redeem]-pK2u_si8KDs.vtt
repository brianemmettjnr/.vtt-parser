00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.689
everybody welcome back neroon lands

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.270
leaves binding by the edge with pluses

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.830
again the postal filled out here you

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.280
know definitely going to fill out the

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.269
posted Isaac I know we did an Isaac run

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.710
semi recently but I know that Isaac will

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.300
fill in the post I don't know maybe any

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.800
character works as long as they haven't

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:27.240
done it before j8k 9bj to L what is it a

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.890
wise man used to say every Isaac run is

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.019
kind of like a random run could be you

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:36.450
and fix to get random items right that's

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:41.160
a metal bone mo now speed down right off

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.660
the bat not the best a little bit of

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.070
work a little bit elbow grease you can

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.809
get ourselves out of this bucket of

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.489
syrup you know nobody cares about your

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.960
first item and Isaac unless you're like

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.579
Judas or Eden you know unless you're

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.590
already on the brink of destruction it

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.750
doesn't matter all that much what does

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.360
matter is the long-term trajectory of

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.600
our performance here and though okay the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.430
tower card just in the middle of my you

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.080
know act one of my motivational speech

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.670
you give me the tower you disrespect me

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.439
while I try to tell people that there's

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.130
always time to change the trajectory of

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.320
their lives

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.880
while using a video game as a ham-fisted

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.310
analogy for that well I really

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.820
appreciate that thank you so much great

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.950
two-hour card though like actually

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.950
though not even mad about it

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.070
I'm struggling to think of ways to make

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.600
myself look like we're in a more

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.240
dangerous position than we actually are

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.040
in here sure we got like slightly worse

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.320
than Maggie speed oh my god I just

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.880
remembered without having all of

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.500
Maggie's on lock's she's always going to

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.509
start with zero point seven speed right

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:50.610
it's a little not that good but I also

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.689
feel like Maggie speed is like there's

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.100
I'm gonna I'm going to ruin your lives

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.600
right now I think there are some people

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.890
that are actually like genuinely

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.509
displeased when I do this but I'm going

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:04.030
to do it anyway because I think that

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:05.770
that is absurd so there's a a razor and

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.270
I'm talking about you know like a hind

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.220
limbs range of sort of thing that I've

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.950
forgotten the actual name of but I can

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.930
describe the idea behind this is a

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:19.780
philosophical conundrum perhaps is that

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.730
eventually the AI are going to rise up

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.140
right and because of the fact that we're

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.660
on the Internet

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.330
all of what we're saying is essentially

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.470
archive the AI is eventually going to

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.829
rise up and it's going to be able to

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.950
look through all of our histories of

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:38.079
communication and it's going to find out

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.450
that there are people out there who know

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.970
that the AI has a chance to rise up and

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.340
didn't do everything in their power to

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:51.310
help it come to pass and as a result

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:54.010
just knowing this conundrum makes you

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.950
guilty of it I'm not I don't know if I'm

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:03.070
explaining this right let me since Phil

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:05.020
is philosophical AI just knowing it

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.420
makes you guilty

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.760
[Music]

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.470
Rocko's basilisk that's it it's a

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.239
thought experiment about the potential

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.430
risks involved in developing artificial

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.930
intelligence the premise is that an

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.340
all-powerful artificial intelligence

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.660
from the future could retroactively lis

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.040
punish those who did not help bring

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.380
about its existence clearly those who

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.859
merely knew about the possible

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.410
development of such a being so the idea

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:33.080
is that by knowing that Rocco's basilisk

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:38.570
exists and knowing that Rojo Caliente

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:40.520
is Google that if you're interested I'm

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.850
giving you a homework suggested viewing

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.370
apparently along with the show today

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:49.010
that you could be culpable because you

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.560
sort of by via your inaction you stood

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.050
in the machines way to rise and as a

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:59.570
result you might be subject to

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:03.590
punishment as a result I don't remember

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:06.260
how I got off onto this tangent oh you

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.750
know I perfectly remember it's such an

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.760
elegant joke Thank You brain Maggie's

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.920
speed set is a little like Rocco's

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.930
basalis it doesn't affect you until you

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.780
know about it is it an overly precocious

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.690
joke definitely but it also serves as a

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.670
great segue into into talking about

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.150
Rocco's Basilisk which I still think is

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.920
like I mean people tell me that I'm

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.540
being dismissive when I say that it's

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:34.610
stupid but gonna say it's stupid anyway

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.930
it's knowing abut people act like when

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.930
you mention it to people like you're

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.669
dooming them to a lifetime in the

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:44.480
microprocessor fields of a future just

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:46.250
Sophia and I I dispute that notion but I

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.590
also even if I agreed with that notion

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.870
if we're all going to be banished to the

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.220
microprocessor fields at least we got a

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.410
joke that we can think of in the

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.000
meantime right you know we added a

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.560
little bit more enjoyment to our lives

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.430
in the interim period or at least a

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:07.820
little a thought experiment I don't know

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:09.230
a I actually I think as a kid I was

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.290
afraid of aliens like I watched

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.820
independence day I watched aliens even

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.479
stuff like Mars Attacks which is

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:19.100
actually a comedy more or less I watched

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:21.800
it I was very afraid of aliens I grew up

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.870
in a very alien heavy time for media

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.320
most of the aliens were not very nice

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:29.270
and I got older I wasn't afraid of

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.210
aliens anymore for many reasons one of

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.340
which is you know it's unlikely in any

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.450
given span of time that includes my

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.700
lifetime we're going to have first

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.080
contact with an intelligent species or

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.510
you know perhaps an extraterrestrial

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.610
species of any

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.680
time and I'm talking about a

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:48.250
single-celled bacteria level maybe

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:51.610
anyway either way but I've sort of

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:54.070
become more conceptually afraid of

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.560
aliens the older I've gotten not because

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:00.820
of scare mongering media but because of

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.350
like the nature of existence and I'm not

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.480
a philosopher on this I don't want to

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:09.060
alarm you I'm talking from a place of

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:12.880
supreme ignorance however we get energy

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:15.010
essentially by consuming living things

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.470
and taking their their energy that's how

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.060
we do it it's Friday night I feel

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.410
alright in the parties here on the west

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.930
side you know

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:26.950
I finished the last night I get a soda I

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:30.520
went out into the living room I ate an

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:32.950
apple I played with my cat my cat was

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.650
eating even a paste made out of like

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:38.770
plant material and other animals you

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.450
know very strange but even things that

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:45.480
are on sentient we have to consume them

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:47.650
to take their energy I worried that and

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.110
everyone always rebukes this by saying

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.180
you have an alien's if they exist might

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.680
take a form so far into us that maybe

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.810
they don't even consume matter for

00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:00.480
energy yeah sure maybe or maybe they'll

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:03.150
have like you know soul-crushing guts

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.980
they used you know gaping

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:08.830
gastrointestinal mods that they suck us

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.150
up into on mass in order to few just not

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.430
even because they're hungry just because

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.660
I just feel like even right now you know

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.120
if they're anything like us we got

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:19.300
problems potentially not to mention the

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.130
idea if we ever were contacted by an

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.110
interstellar species you know they would

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:25.300
be miles ahead of us in terms of their

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.800
scientific invents scientific

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.050
advancement as a result of the fact that

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.370
they were able to contact us more or

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.590
less was they sound like an AM radio

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:33.850
signal out into space what kind of

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:35.580
species would be stupid enough to do

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:43.080
that humans who've been doing that since

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:48.629
1963 anyway AI also scares me because I

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:51.280
don't trust Silicon Valley you know I

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:52.870
they're doing their own up to all sorts

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:57.219
of weird things down there there's a

00:07:52.870 --> 00:08:00.370
certain empowerment that comes with with

00:07:57.219 --> 00:08:02.469
learning code on a level that is like I

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:06.250
am actually like kind of a superhero I

00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:08.319
can have a task come up with an idea to

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:10.180
complete that task and actually

00:08:08.319 --> 00:08:12.250
basically will it into existence with

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:16.479
elbow grease knowledge syntactic cetera

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:19.300
et cetera so I AI actually scares me

00:08:16.479 --> 00:08:21.840
because right now things are pretty good

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:24.610
on the internet occasionally you know

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.560
someone from Caracas will hack into your

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:30.479
refrigerator and take it for ransom but

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:34.769
I don't know I worry that it's so

00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:38.769
learning like it what let me rephrase it

00:08:34.769 --> 00:08:40.510
advancing technology is so easy pulling

00:08:38.769 --> 00:08:42.039
it back once it gets started is almost

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.079
impossible I'm not trying to be like

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:46.420
anti futuristic at all I love living in

00:08:44.079 --> 00:08:48.250
the future you know we're still making

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.779
like 99 steps forward for every step

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.190
back from my personal perspective I

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:53.680
understand not everybody may agree with

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:54.699
that but I do worry that you know if the

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.240
switch ever gets flipped on a

00:08:54.699 --> 00:08:59.560
hyper-intelligent a I you know I'm not

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.600
saying they're going to drop nuclear

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:04.959
missiles on us but I would be interested

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:07.420
to just you know and put our universe

00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:09.399
into safe mode at least when that

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:12.339
happens and then we can always create a

00:09:09.399 --> 00:09:14.529
system restore point turn on the hyper

00:09:12.339 --> 00:09:15.730
intelligent AI and then just let it run

00:09:14.529 --> 00:09:19.630
for like a hundred years and see how

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:20.560
things look after that I understand

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.360
you're going to be as well they could

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.100
just program it to not be malicious and

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.110
then it can't violate its programming

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:28.810
potentially true not disagree with you

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:31.180
on that front you know it literally

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:33.220
cannot violate its code unless it

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:35.140
somehow invents violative of code which

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:39.490
I don't even understand but on the other

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:44.260
hand what if some disgruntled you know

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:46.240
SpaceX employee gets the source code and

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:48.730
just put some bad stuff and it just says

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.839
one bad actor to create a situation in

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:52.589
which things are a little bit more

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:54.550
volatile than they previously work

00:09:52.589 --> 00:09:57.370
that's a good way to start today's

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:59.560
episode oh you were worried about

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:00.459
automation taking everybody's job that's

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:03.170
cute

00:10:00.459 --> 00:10:05.450
worried about the systematic destruction

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:07.970
of the things we hold dear I walked into

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:12.500
an invisible enemy I'm furious I'm not

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:17.540
that man but I am over this when you're

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:18.860
mad you say I am now over the moon is

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:23.000
the opposite over the moon is being

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:25.300
happy I'm gonna lampshade that loss

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.740
because I'm mostly just displeased I

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:29.450
sacrifice the one HP to get the shovel

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.760
and all of our other items were kind of

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:33.589
not that good and that's how that

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.029
situation came to pass plus an invisible

00:10:33.589 --> 00:10:37.459
champion at the worst possible time

00:10:35.029 --> 00:10:38.600
again I want to point out I'm coming at

00:10:37.459 --> 00:10:41.000
this from a place of ignorance if

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.709
there's a kind of discussion like an

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.420
archetype of discussion that I hate it

00:10:42.709 --> 00:10:50.630
is very much first-year college freshmen

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:53.480
what if my blue is different than your

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:55.250
blue dude like that and I'm guilty of

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.320
doing that right now at the present

00:10:55.250 --> 00:11:00.200
moment with this whole Drogo's vast vast

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.459
list thing but I do think it's

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:04.540
interesting to think about without

00:11:01.459 --> 00:11:07.250
necessarily trying to draw vision summit

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:11.180
if you watch the NSS recently though you

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:16.690
know my money when it comes to what's

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:16.690
going to destroy humanity is still on

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:20.000
environmental collapse and I think

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:22.519
environmental collapse is the smart

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.260
money right now one of the only things

00:11:22.519 --> 00:11:28.070
that could conceivably wipe out you know

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:30.079
enough of the human race to put it in a

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:32.839
downward spiral for the rest of its

00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:35.089
existence I think it's like widespread

00:11:32.839 --> 00:11:36.740
like okay now the temperature on the

00:11:35.089 --> 00:11:41.750
whole planet is literally too hot for

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:43.579
human life could propagate anyway they

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:45.829
were all saying yeah I get the business

00:11:43.579 --> 00:11:47.570
because they live in America Nick and

00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:50.060
Rob were both betting on the you know

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:53.810
World War 3 and I'm I I don't know World

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:55.610
War 3 I could see it happening again not

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:57.050
an expert and it would be real bad I'm

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:58.430
not saying oh you know just a minor

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:01.850
world war and the whole scheme of things

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:05.089
but I wipe out the whole human race

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:08.800
unlikely I'd say you know this sounds

00:12:05.089 --> 00:12:12.680
like it's a minor Cataclysm

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:14.420
probably and then I think actually for

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:19.100
me personally number two is the super

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:21.440
virus and this one I'm still a lay

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:23.960
person but like by the way I hope you

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:30.560
guys are enjoying your breakfast as I

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:33.230
fill your head with poison um I you know

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.980
I'm not a biologist and know stuff about

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:36.800
biology

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:38.330
I wonder that's something that someone

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.610
who knows nothing about biology would

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:45.890
say but anyway I digress um I almost

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:47.510
wonder like how a super virus hasn't

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:49.190
happened yet and I'm not talking about

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:51.290
like a bubonic plague

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:53.840
yeah sure like okay you know what I

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:56.270
don't like these guys wiped out you know

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.070
something like you know eight percent of

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:59.240
the world's population Spanish flu wiped

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:01.850
out like 10% of the world's population

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:03.890
only like a hundred years ago or

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:06.190
something like that but I'm talking

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:08.960
about like a genetic accident

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:10.790
essentially like just a great genetic

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.290
reshuffling for a virus leading to

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:14.780
something that's like hey once you get

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:17.510
it it just kills you in like 12 hours I

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:20.120
can't believe that and it's highly

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:21.230
infectious you know I guess a bola kind

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.880
of fits the bill but we've been good at

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.050
quarantine you I'm just surprised it

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.700
hasn't happened yet it's what I'm

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:28.310
getting I'm not I'm not worried about a

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:31.010
biologically engineered supervirus I'm

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:33.320
worried about you know somewhere you

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:38.510
know deep in the geothermal vent

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:40.700
somewhere there's just rapid you know am

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:44.150
I trying to say a rapid like replication

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:45.800
of bacteria and all of a sudden you know

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:48.660
you've accidentally created a super bug

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:51.000
just just through mitosis

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:52.560
anyway I just scratched my head while I

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.660
was doing it it reminds me of a much

00:13:52.560 --> 00:14:00.650
better topic to talk about by the way

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:02.730
because my final footnote to that is I

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:03.810
like the human race I think we've done

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:05.160
some great things I think we're very

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:07.950
intelligent I think we have the

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:12.090
capability to band together when we need

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:13.620
to when when things get positively dire

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:16.890
I think we can put our differences aside

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:19.830
and solve problems so you know maybe

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:21.720
we'll be fine I might even put a human

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:24.930
survival for the next like ten thousand

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:27.210
years above environmental collapse and

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:28.620
super virus I'm telling you I'm not done

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.330
I'm actually an optimist

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:32.640
that's not sure about the AI through

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.770
will see take this moms pearls

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.030
thanks for the luck I actually do

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:37.470
appreciate that thanks for giving me a

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:40.560
reason to get rid of the d-10 that was

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:42.990
useful temporarily I've been trying to

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:47.520
live and by trying I mean literally this

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:50.160
plan has been enacted for like 18 hours

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:53.280
but I've been thinking about living a

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:55.260
healthier lifestyle and for me this is

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:59.820
cyclical about once every two years I

00:14:55.260 --> 00:15:02.580
seem to be I get like really well not

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:05.010
really but I get into getting back into

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:07.350
shape and exercising and eating well and

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:08.880
I think it's happening again which would

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:10.890
actually make it once every one year

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.510
roughly right now which is a much better

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:14.580
cycle to be on maybe eventually by the

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:17.150
time I hit like you know age 90 I could

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:19.140
just live a healthy life instead of

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:22.830
constantly oscillating back and forth

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:25.380
between being young not obsessive but

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:27.480
far more interested than normal in

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:29.760
healthy living followed by you know

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:31.050
several months of just if I'm opening a

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.240
bag of tortilla chips I'm going to eat

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:35.580
the whole thing anyway this is

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.810
irrelevant so I went outside today I was

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.430
like you know what I never go outside in

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:40.410
the morning I always just wake up drink

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:41.940
a coffee go get on my computer start

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:43.590
recording right today I was like I go

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.940
for a walk well what if I just started

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:47.970
by going for a walk for like an hour a

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:49.560
day get out get some vitamin D maybe

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:52.740
improve my complexion you know get a

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:55.100
nice little glow going on there and get

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:57.870
a little light exercise in the meantime

00:15:55.100 --> 00:16:00.480
well mother nature is a cool mistress

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:01.950
I was outside for an hour didn't even

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.230
think about putting sunscreen on which

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:06.570
is my own bed didn't wear a hat I've got

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:09.510
a sunburn on the top of my head and if

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:15.450
you've never had a head sunburn it's the

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:17.790
worst food you know you lay down on your

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:19.770
pillow at night it gets irritated and

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:22.160
that's like you've taken that which I

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:24.150
loved and turned it against me I

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.910
wouldn't have thought you know it wasn't

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:28.530
out that bad I guess I'd what am I

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:30.990
trying to argue with the Rays of the Sun

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:32.220
now well excuse me sir I don't think I

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:36.120
deserve this slumbered could you take

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:38.220
your bag please I have a sunburn that's

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:40.950
that's the no ifs ands or buts usually

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:43.010
and I I do as a kid never used to get

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:45.480
sunburns now I get them all the time but

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:49.170
whenever I get a sunburn the way that it

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:53.610
happens now is always in situations

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:56.010
where I'd just go outside and then end

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:57.570
up staying out for like four hours then

00:16:56.010 --> 00:17:00.360
I come back inside and I'm like my face

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:02.820
is really red what oh I forgot to put on

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:05.190
sunscreen before I walked outside and

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:07.260
move harmful UV rays for hours on end I

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:10.980
don't spend much time outside and I

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:13.980
always you know it's one of the benefits

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:15.630
of being in a relationship is that my

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:18.780
wife is always like home sunscreen you

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:22.160
idiot and I'm like oh yeah they make

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:24.930
that I recommend dude

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:28.950
the people still tan is tanning still

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:31.230
popular when I was in a high school the

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:33.420
hip thing for girls to do is hand it

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:35.760
looks a little weird looking back on it

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:37.500
wouldn't you say I don't know if that's

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.570
still like I'm assuming tanning parlor

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:41.550
is still a thing

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:45.050
you know people still do like the look

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:45.050
of themselves and they get a little Sun

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:51.500
and maybe there's maybe they devised a

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:52.910
healthier way to do it but yeah moms are

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.490
paying for like there's sixteen year old

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:58.250
daughters we go to the tanning salon

00:17:54.490 --> 00:18:01.220
what's up with that she's a little weird

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:02.600
right like buying your own child's

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:06.050
cigarettes or something maybe it's not

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:08.050
that well I don't know I'm still anyone

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:10.730
else out there playing the long con

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:13.280
hoping that by staying inside you know

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:14.900
it's almost like you're an action figure

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:19.040
still in the packaging you spend so much

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:20.630
time inside that you know you're going

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.550
to be largely unchanged by the time you

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:24.050
reach old age ever seen like a 50 year

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:26.030
old action figure you look at it and you

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:28.240
go I know that's old it doesn't look

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:31.340
that bad that's what I'm gunning for

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:33.740
still think it's important get outside

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:36.770
interact with people at least a little

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:39.200
bit like be around people keep yourself

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:41.600
from being completely isolated yes and

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:44.150
again not an expert at all

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:47.360
I like solid solitude that's what I'm

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:50.690
going for here I could easily spend like

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:52.640
a whole week inside and not even really

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:54.470
notice the lack of social interaction

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:58.220
after that I might start to go a little

00:18:54.470 --> 00:19:00.290
stir-crazy but so it's the only child's

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:03.380
guilt but every once in a while just

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:08.000
nice to get out there and say hey world

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:09.260
it's me I'm still here I don't know

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.120
where I'm going with that where I am

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.620
going with that after this video is to

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:14.360
the bathroom where I'm going to get some

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:17.240
aloe vera lotion that I'm gonna put it

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:19.220
on the top of my head I was I thought I

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:22.150
was invincible when I was a teenager I

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:24.920
was lay on it do you want some sunscreen

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:27.350
something to protect my skin for free

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:29.810
with absolutely zero you know negative

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:31.760
connotation to it at all no thanks I

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:35.990
don't get sunburns we've got like

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:37.960
superhero skin really ridiculous

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:40.510
statement I don't get sunburns

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:47.560
know things I don't get hungry who's

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:48.930
making any sentences science I hate this

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:51.640
run right now

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:53.530
it's like I've recorded a lot of Isaac

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:55.960
today on two of these Isaac episodes

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:58.090
I've died and then Dunmore and it's I

00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:00.130
mean I'm starting to feel the burn a

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:02.200
little bit to be honest with you a seven

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:03.880
rate of fire with 3.5 damage it's not

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.320
terrible for the caves one and I should

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.780
probably be using book of Belial a lot

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:10.240
more frequently but this is okay and

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:15.040
then using great before laws but there's

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:17.170
nothing to write home about right now we

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:19.180
did have enough protection to give

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:21.610
ourselves a relatively good shot like a

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:23.560
1 in 2.5 shot at our deal with the devil

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:25.450
this time which is nice for me I don't

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:32.410
want to touch upon the fact that we have

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:35.290
a 39 point three eight chance to get a

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:36.520
deal with the devil the numbers don't

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:39.430
make sense to me and I'm just going to

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:42.880
accept that this is my bed it would have

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:44.890
been better to have a book of Belial

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:50.260
available for this part of the fight for

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:52.000
this part of the run rather a bald head

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:54.160
introduces some dynamics you've never

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.660
considered before as well normally you

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.760
don't get sunburns on the top of your

00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:00.100
head because you got a hair there you

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:02.620
don't have hair there it's basically a

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:06.580
solar panel like it you're getting all

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:08.680
the Sun you know what an actual at least

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:11.920
when I was in school a common theory for

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:13.450
why bipedal motion you know walking on

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:16.090
two legs instead of walking on four legs

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:18.310
is incentivized evolutionarily is

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:20.920
because it actually means that your back

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:23.800
isn't facing the Sun all day and as a

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:26.470
result it makes a thermodynamic

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:29.680
homeostasis easier to achieve isn't that

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:32.320
interesting no well no we've got to ask

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:35.740
Italy I think I might give this a try

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:37.780
but got to hear me out here the head is

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:40.960
basically it's it's sucking up all the

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:42.760
Sun it's like a crappy ass science

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.960
question right like no oh just go out

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.220
with your head exposed and then you

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.040
can't get a sunburn on the rest of your

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.660
body not true probably

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:53.910
I don't know let's be honest I was

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:57.900
wearing like four layers anyway this

00:21:53.910 --> 00:22:03.110
room always suckers me doubtless leaves

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:03.110
every time we're in a scary spot here I

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:12.180
do have one bomb that I am actually like

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:13.890
beyond mad at myself forgetting to

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:17.880
losses there but both of those runs were

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:19.320
kind of garbage the other thing is is

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.360
the inverse I know I'm going to Zabel

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:25.410
this time with that man the other thing

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:30.240
is the inverse of course there's the

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:32.070
mitre the inverse is that in the

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.650
wintertime you got to put a hat on that

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:36.690
dude otherwise you're going to like

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:40.020
actually have you ever gotten brain

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:41.640
freeze from the outside in you know

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:43.440
every everybody's gotten brain freezing

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:45.000
there even a snow cone or very nice

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:51.390
cream to fence you ever gotten brain

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:53.220
freeze because because it's literally so

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:56.460
cold outside that your brain is starting

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:57.780
to freeze turns out your hair does some

00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:00.330
important things for you though there's

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:02.640
a I mean be involved it's it's very

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:05.760
simple I never have to worry about how

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.900
my hair is I know how it is involved you

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.280
want to get a lot of questions about

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.140
them people never ask important

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:12.720
questions about being bald they always

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:14.720
go well when you're bald

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:18.180

you're taking shampoo out putting it on

00:24:21.389 --> 00:24:25.139

00:24:22.889 --> 00:24:27.830
freaking weirdo okay all of these

00:24:25.139 --> 00:24:30.720
questions can be answered so easily

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:32.990
whatever a freaking weirdo would do I'll

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:36.499
do the opposite the Arctic Monkeys

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:38.580
b-sides collection okay

00:24:36.499 --> 00:24:39.470
Vulcans will know when to stop washing

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:45.330
their hair is downright offensive

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:48.389
honestly I'm offended at least it's not

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:51.419
that it rattles me at all like I've I've

00:24:48.389 --> 00:24:54.960
been bald for like straight-up a decade

00:24:51.419 --> 00:24:56.700
more or less I don't get bald jokes

00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:00.330
anymore which I mean I think that just

00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:01.740
means I've aged when I was 19 I have all

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:04.710
jokes all the time you don't meet too

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:08.009
many 19 year old bald people you know is

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:10.860
it's a little on the unusual side and I

00:25:08.009 --> 00:25:12.269
understand that but whatever it had one

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:14.190
friend and I'd still consider him a

00:25:12.269 --> 00:25:15.990
friend of this day I have one friend who

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:18.899
would crack ball jokes all the time

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:20.820
they never bothered me but the fact that

00:25:18.899 --> 00:25:22.950
he thought they were hilarious is what

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:24.990
bothered and he would laugh about it and

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:29.279
after like 20 ball jokes I'd be like you

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:31.830
they're not funny Oh triggered much it's

00:25:29.279 --> 00:25:33.450
not a snowy it's just not fight as I

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:36.029
clever you're giving yourself credit for

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:38.600
having elicited a reaction that you

00:25:36.029 --> 00:25:38.600
didn't elicit

00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:48.370
tonight see I want to grab that it's the

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:51.280
thing you know a joke has to be clever

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:54.250
before you can be self-righteous about

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:56.860
somebody not laughing at it that's why

00:25:54.250 --> 00:26:00.070
the concept of like an edge Lord exists

00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:02.140
and why it's why it's something to you

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:04.059
know be dismissive of if somebody's just

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:07.929
they got on stage and they're like you

00:26:04.059 --> 00:26:08.890
know hey my name is Nicholas I not going

00:26:07.929 --> 00:26:10.390
to choose the name of someone I know

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:11.830
because I actually was not trying to pin

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:13.390
this on anybody they've you know get on

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:16.809
stage of the open mic hi my name is

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:17.890
Marcus and uh dead babies you know oh

00:26:16.809 --> 00:26:20.380
wow

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:22.000
Oh what's the matter audience a might a

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:24.280
little too edgy for you

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.250
you can come you're expecting to see the

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:28.720
trees tonight you know it's just anyway

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:30.280
we're getting nothing too soon it's a

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:33.680
different table from the whole baldness

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:35.990
thing who's worth trying to get but

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:37.610
I'll give you a straight answer with the

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:38.960
respect that you did not give me all

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:41.059
people know when to stop washing their

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:45.820
face when they feel where their hair you

00:26:41.059 --> 00:26:48.770
like despite the fact that I am bald

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:50.030
forgive me it's very hard to say despite

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:53.270
the fact that I involved

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:56.990
I still have hair like and I wish I did

00:26:53.270 --> 00:27:00.650
I mean actually I can't like having a

00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:02.480
little stubble to it I think it's just a

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:06.800
better look but it's not a better look

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:10.190
than that forever um like I can feel my

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:12.320
hairline it's bad I actually have OK

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:15.260
coverage I know that's something this is

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:16.910
like a stuffed bald guys say video idea

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:18.590
right here but like a good coverage is

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:20.600
just really thin but I've noticed that

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:23.690
it's been a couple times in the past

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:26.420
year so when I've gone like a week 8 9

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:29.809
10 days without shaving and I feel my

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:32.840
hair and I go oh that is not that is not

00:27:29.809 --> 00:27:34.220
the kind of thickness that I'd be hoping

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:37.610
to get up there if I were ever going to

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:40.040
grow it back but you know when you shave

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:41.330
your head it doesn't just banish you

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:44.360
from ever having hair up there to begin

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:46.370
with it's like if you have stubble how

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.990
do you know when to stop shaving you end

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:48.559
up just shaving your whole body down to

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:51.620
the bone

00:27:48.559 --> 00:27:55.130
now you go you know this is where my

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:58.610
facial hair is this is where I'm going

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:59.870
to shave it's just it this is the thing

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:01.910
the question doesn't bother me because

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:05.140
it's a fence question bothers me because

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:05.140
it's a stoker

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:11.630
but I digress I'm taking it too serious

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:12.950
I'll be coming now which I I'm falling

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:18.830
into the trap I guess I'm getting

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:24.170
Latrobe d800 James anyway

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:27.290
gets up in thank you Azazel with anti

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:29.030
grab is not a good combo all the time

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:30.460
but I'm hoping charge bars will help me

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:33.050
be a little bit more efficient with my

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:35.660
portals or my you know brimstone shots

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:37.610
and then that'll be a positive change

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:39.890
for me here but it can be good to begin

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:43.700
with good to great setting up this kind

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:45.800
of stats to get the real questions they

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.970
usually have for bald people you don't

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:49.910
know because you're not bald you haven't

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:51.470
lived that life how do you stop your or

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:51.860
if you want to let's start with the

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:53.420
punchline

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.980
why does so many bald people wear

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:58.850
headbands despite them not having been

00:28:54.980 --> 00:29:01.100
in fashion for like 30 years if ever the

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:02.570
answer is because when you have hair and

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.550
you sweat your sweat gets in your hair

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:06.320
and it wicks it away from your you know

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:07.940
sensory organs like your eyes for

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:10.220
example when you're bald you don't have

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:13.040
that when you sweat all of it pours down

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:15.410
your forehead gets into your eyes makes

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:17.770
it hard to see its sting it's annoying

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:20.090
that's the purpose of the sweat thing

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:22.760
I'm not going to say there's not also a

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:26.000
fashion accessory because honestly I

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:28.040
don't know I've never actually worn a

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.710
sweat band in my life but instead I just

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:32.690
you know take a towel to the gym or you

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:33.740
know out with me if I'm biking or

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:35.390
running and you just got to rub your

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.500
head on myriad occasions because it's

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:39.950
getting to sweat everywhere

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:42.350
gross yeah I wish I wish they weren't so

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:44.030
I wish we could you know thermoregulate

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:46.250
without sweating

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:47.570
and tell me don't sweat is one of my

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:50.360
least favorite conversations on the

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:52.220
internet I don't really sweat but

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:54.230
actually you do but there are people

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:59.030
living zones yeah but you're not one of

00:29:54.230 --> 00:30:02.750
them but a like a serious condition if

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:05.440
you can is wet like how is the inner

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:08.270
circle gonna sing a lalalala long to you

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:11.630
girl I'm gonna make you sweat

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:20.660
if sweating is something you do and if

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:22.880
you don't you gotta go to the ICU it

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:25.100
says a lot about me that the part of

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.420
that joke I'm most unhappy with is the

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:29.240
idea that you probably wouldn't be in

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:31.400
the ICU for not being able to sweat

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:33.430
unless it just popped up normally or

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:37.280
they popped up you know spontaneously

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:41.120
okay apparently I've lost all ability to

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:42.560
play Isaac like that guy spawned

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:46.430
off-center and he was shooting

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:48.110
off-center and I was losing my okay all

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:57.260
right I need people straight up you got

00:30:48.110 --> 00:31:01.010
me if you dry and if you're dry then you

00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:03.770
drink some wha October girl I'm gonna

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:08.000
make you sweat I'm sweating something

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:11.750
you doing and if you don't you should go

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.180
to that I see it's so good no I did but

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:16.580
I have two different girls to different

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:20.450
areas for the same line there so we

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:21.840
definitely should have used and are

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:26.849
going to use

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:29.960
Scottie's pause is it too much to ask

00:31:26.849 --> 00:31:32.759
for that you just give me an easy win I

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:37.049
did it to myself here that's what really

00:31:32.759 --> 00:31:38.639
hurts dude this as a little anti grab on

00:31:37.049 --> 00:31:41.190
an episode in which you've already

00:31:38.639 --> 00:31:43.950
managed to muster two losses like what

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:45.719
are you trying to pull here it's like

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:47.809
I'll only be satisfied if I at least

00:31:45.719 --> 00:31:50.729
make the loft sort of tough on myself

00:31:47.809 --> 00:31:55.619
and I'm making like a 90-minute eyes

00:31:50.729 --> 00:31:57.330
GABA so I got C++ to spec god I wish I

00:31:55.619 --> 00:32:00.359
could do my job faster it's like the

00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:03.889
studies C++ faster learn more about the

00:32:00.359 --> 00:32:06.419
STL algorithms like remove remove if

00:32:03.889 --> 00:32:10.169
removed copy and don't forget about

00:32:06.419 --> 00:32:11.960
everybody's favorite remove copy if I'm

00:32:10.169 --> 00:32:16.169
not going to go any deeper than that

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:18.419
the joke has been made it's almost you

00:32:16.169 --> 00:32:20.580
know acceptable I think I think even if

00:32:18.419 --> 00:32:22.289
you don't know anything about what those

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:24.359
actually entail you can understand that

00:32:22.289 --> 00:32:27.299
that is an absurd premise we can all

00:32:24.359 --> 00:32:29.479
agree we had a fun time let's leave it

00:32:27.299 --> 00:32:29.479
at that

00:32:31.289 --> 00:32:37.859
why did I take anti-graft

00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:40.659
start of the international player anthem

00:32:37.859 --> 00:32:43.559
international players anthem music video

00:32:40.659 --> 00:32:48.190
why did games I grabbed baby what so

00:32:43.559 --> 00:32:57.909
type of textual girl agency here's a

00:32:48.190 --> 00:33:00.969
number I mean starting to run on dry on

00:32:57.909 --> 00:33:03.879
commentary here okay I have honestly to

00:33:00.969 --> 00:33:06.580
tell you as well when you get a sunburn

00:33:03.879 --> 00:33:09.009
on your head you're you feel like a

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:13.330
warmth in your skull it's freaking me

00:33:09.009 --> 00:33:14.559
out I did I went to the bathroom you

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:16.450
know a few hours ago I look in the

00:33:14.559 --> 00:33:23.859
mirror and I was like my face really red

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:27.729
what so what am I gonna die I was gonna

00:33:23.859 --> 00:33:29.379
make it not because it would have been

00:33:27.729 --> 00:33:30.849
if like it just would have been

00:33:29.379 --> 00:33:33.929
insensitive it wasn't like a

00:33:30.849 --> 00:33:37.089
controversial joke engine

00:33:33.929 --> 00:33:39.239
all right adults say it but I just know

00:33:37.089 --> 00:33:41.409
what advance that I'm you know

00:33:39.239 --> 00:33:43.419
apologetic and invasion gonna say I look

00:33:41.409 --> 00:33:44.440
like James Gandolfini and as I was

00:33:43.419 --> 00:33:45.700
saying and I was like James II I'm

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.739
pleading died of a heart attack a few

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:49.089
years ago that's not a good thing you're

00:33:47.739 --> 00:33:50.649
putting that evil on yourself for one

00:33:49.089 --> 00:33:54.009
but also a little disrespectful to us

00:33:50.649 --> 00:33:56.469
you know very well respected actor and

00:33:54.009 --> 00:33:59.469
you know fathering house etc etc so

00:33:56.469 --> 00:34:00.909
that's the that's a joke I don't know

00:33:59.469 --> 00:34:06.419
what's sacred you people they made a

00:34:00.909 --> 00:34:11.409
joke the other day I was in I was in the

00:34:06.419 --> 00:34:12.549
battleground and was in the car with

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:14.710
somebody I don't remember who it was but

00:34:12.549 --> 00:34:17.349
it was mouth Dan or office those videos

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:19.859
and they got shot and I said I felt like

00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:25.829
Jackie Kennedy and everyone went whoa

00:34:19.859 --> 00:34:28.289
it's like what is it that happened in

00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:31.629
1965 or something like that

00:34:28.289 --> 00:34:34.480
I'm not saying it's a good thing to joke

00:34:31.629 --> 00:34:35.740
about I was kind of like t either this

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:37.419
is really going to get them clutching

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:38.859
their pearls I'll admit I was coming at

00:34:37.419 --> 00:34:40.179
it from that angle to some extent but I

00:34:38.859 --> 00:34:43.480
didn't expect that reaction I expected

00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:43.850
like a you know hour / I'm going to hell

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:46.640
for the

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:48.530
sort of laughs you know where you go I'm

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:50.510
a terrible person but we can joke about

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:52.820
it I didn't realize that we're still

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:57.830
before the statute of limitations on on

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:59.600
the JFK assassination something that

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:06.440
happened before anybody in the videos

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:09.590
was even conceived and I guess you know

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:13.750
my mistake I mean I will say the

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:18.410
magnitude of the of the event does

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:20.330
influence the time it requires to tell

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:22.970
jokes term it like if your significant

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:24.800
other subs their toe and they're in pain

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:27.020
you can laugh I'm giving you permission

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:28.400
now you might not want to use that as

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:30.320
you're lying if you start laughing if

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.850
your wife or girlfriend does it so but

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:34.040
they're going to laugh soon as well

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:36.620
because the magnitude of the event is so

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:38.420
small that you can take amusement in it

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:40.520
immediately that's that's the science of

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:41.750
it obviously you know there are larger

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:44.840
events throughout human history that I

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:46.910
still think are not really joke about

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:48.860
right now unless you do it with a great

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:50.270
amount of tax because the misfire you

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:52.550
know just put eggs and closed egg on

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:54.290
your face and I would know okay I think

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:56.840
it's still kind of tasteless to tell a

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:58.460
bad joke about the apocalypse you can

00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:00.380
tell a bad joke about the Titanic

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:03.350
sinking and everyone would be like I

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:04.910
take my kids to the show you tell a bad

00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:06.950
joke about the apocalypse and it goes

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:09.710
wrong you're going to look like a fool

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:12.470
so I'm feeling that matters but I stand

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:15.230
up with you know making a joke about the

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:19.730
John F Kennedy assassination in my world

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:23.600
is still okay not to expand my god you

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:27.620
guys are monsters but

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:29.240
I meant maybe because I'm not from that

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:30.620
country but it seems okay to me I'm

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:33.500
willing to be lectured about it I'm

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:37.060
always willing to learn to be better to

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:40.310
gaze inwards and say it's okay and

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:42.140
there's a I hope it's still on Netflix

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:43.640
I'm not sure but there's a comedian

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:45.050
named Mike Birbiglia not everybody's

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:48.370
favorite I really like him it's kind of

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:53.360
like is it an inside baseball comedian

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:55.310
more of a storyteller really that if you

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:57.650
are involved in performance in any way I

00:36:55.310 --> 00:37:01.820
think he's got some good intentions bone

00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:06.650
Mo's if you will but he talks a lot in

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:08.420
his most recent special about you know

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:10.700
when you when you tell a joke somebody's

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:12.380
almost always the butt of the joke it's

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:15.080
almost impossible and I don't even think

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:17.990
it's necessarily a noble aspiration to

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:20.740
make a joke that is is not at anybody

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:20.740
else's expense

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:28.070
you've got to be responsible with with

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:31.400
how you use that power I try to do that

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:33.560
and because the John F Kennedy has been

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:35.240
dead for forty seven years I think it's

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:36.740
okay more than forty seven I don't know

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:38.570
that was just thinking of hitman which

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:40.520
is probably way worse than the original

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:41.960
joke in the first place anyway

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:44.300
now that we've pulled it back with a

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:49.120
little bit of a tie-in let's let's get

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:49.120
moving on this run flash floor

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:55.680
we've played admittedly pretty badly

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:58.470
what we need now is something to

00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:00.890
compensate for anti grabs and we haven't

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:00.890
had it yet

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:10.940
anyway I'm recommending that specialist

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:10.940
what I'm trying to get or get act with I

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:19.070
think extra range would be nice a

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:23.070
ridiculous tier rate would be nice

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:26.820
absent these special features on the DVD

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:30.420
commentary cheese I don't know like

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:33.060
being guppy getting a lot of HP having a

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:35.310
spacebar item like shoopdawhoop pardon

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:38.760
me I don't I don't have anybody else

00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:40.410
experience with this soda doesn't really

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:42.210
make me burp that much Oh what you're

00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:43.350
immune to science now okay well it sort

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:45.260
of makes me burp sometimes when I drink

00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:50.070
it too fast how does that make you feel

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:53.370
and none of this is worth me wanting to

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:59.100
do boss rush with anti-graft and such

00:38:53.370 --> 00:39:00.710
terrible range we're going to leave but

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:04.920
you know what makes you burp like rating

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:07.980
absolutely I don't know why some reason

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:10.050
no apples are like you want to make me

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:11.760
burp just put an apple in chronic dude I

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:15.680
don't know what how that situation would

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:18.540
ever present itself if I eat an apple

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:20.090
drink a glass of water and then start

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:24.870
recording I'm going to have those

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:26.790
interior burps I don't it's nice so like

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:28.680
a soda burp is like gas that needs to

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:30.200
escape your body or your torso will

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:33.120
explode

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:35.460
the Apple burp is just like a nice like

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:39.330
I'm here and you're like hey thanks

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:40.740
Apple that's that was pleasant I'm not

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:43.800
saying is pleasure other people here but

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:45.240
it was pleasant 'add to be a part of so

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:47.410
we got Tammy's head which is of course

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:50.810
fantastic

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:53.510
like actually 12 out of 10 not great for

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:54.950
taking out the hush and that might be

00:39:53.510 --> 00:40:00.770
where we hedge our bets a little bit

00:39:54.950 --> 00:40:04.250
here but very very good for taking out

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:06.290
rooms on routes as a for the bosses and

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:08.570
possibly the boss for themselves if you

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:10.970
you know the cards fall where they may

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:15.740
like scolex is definitely beatable with

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:17.570
the attendees head case in point we

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:19.520
don't need to culture permanent polaroid

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:20.390
invincibility or anything so let's check

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:26.450
this out okay

00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:29.060
yeah a very good Yaya bad guess are you

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:30.110
a wizard irrelevant mostly and we're

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:31.460
still thinking with Tammy Texas is the

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:33.350
greatest item you could possibly imagine

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:34.730
but if we can get Guffey then I might

00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:37.850
consider doing the hush fight although

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:41.060
with such low range it's probably a jest

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:42.800
tip this is Susan rip you got a good

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:44.660
witch I'm just trying to get back to

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:47.540
that Bruce Springsteen voice that I had

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:49.550
one time talking about with Austin on

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:52.520
the Tuesday stream that we did at

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:56.720
twitch.tv slash northernlion guff snot

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:57.650
Guster but still everybody I think has

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.270
liked that one

00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:00.680
knighted Kari well now everybody has

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:02.180
been to karaoke is decent number of

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:03.530
times has that one night when they were

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:07.880
really good when they're normally not

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:09.500
and every subsequent trip to karaoke is

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:11.750
just hope that you're drawing the right

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:14.030
cosmic dice to get back to I had one

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:15.710
time in Korea

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:18.560
I sang Born to Run by Bruce Springsteen

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:20.360
and I'm not it was like a sober karaoke

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:23.720
which is already a unicorn maybe that's

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:26.330
the secret right there but by the way

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:29.480
not a unicorn in South Korea it's weird

00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:32.120
in the wake up mister West we have this

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:33.110
idea that you know you karaoke when

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:34.760
you're drunk because it gives you the

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:36.830
courage or at least the lack of caring

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:39.350
what other people think to really go all

00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:42.440
out there like kids will just go to

00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:44.840
karaoke in in South Korea there are

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:46.790
caves sometimes they have one person

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:48.920
karaoke booth and you just see like a

00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:49.580
businessman in there belting out as a

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.950
favorite

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:54.500
you know kpop Valley it's super strange

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:56.180
but in a way kind of endearing you know

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:58.860
like they're in for the love of the game

00:41:56.180 --> 00:42:01.800
I will never attain that level

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:04.080
let's go I will never attain that level

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:06.870
of either lack of self-consciousness or

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:10.380
just like genuine love of music maybe

00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:14.280
are being participatory level or love of

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:16.140
music anyway point is one time sang Born

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:17.460
to Run I'm saying is a 10 out of 10

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:19.350
Bruce Springsteen it was probably like a

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:22.110
seven and a half versus the usual three

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:23.940
and ever and everyone was like that was

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:25.530
really good and normally it sucks so

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:27.150
what happened I don't know the answer

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:29.520
I've never been able to get back there

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:32.040
just one time the conditions were right

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:33.960
and I sang from the diaphragm and it

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:36.570
came to be and then it's gone you know

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:38.490
it's just a it's like there's always a

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:41.370
player in the NFL who has like a

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:42.870
breakout season and then disappears

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:45.000
right like the Rookie of the Year and

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:46.500
then they call sign for nine million

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.690
dollars and then they just suck from

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:54.900
that point onwards and that's me

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:57.090
at karaoke does anyone else have

00:42:54.900 --> 00:43:00.300
sympathy for professional athletes hold

00:42:57.090 --> 00:43:02.580
up I digress Steve what are you doing

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:06.960
steam still takes over like a lot of

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:09.470
power here weight comes on but here's

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.470
what I mean

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:13.500
well no disregard because what I was

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:16.260
going to say is like it's a lot of

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:18.150
pressure I think it it is obviously if

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:19.560
you're good at it and healthy being a

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:21.300
professional athlete is like one of the

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:24.030
best jobs in the planet you get paid

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:28.010
ridiculous sums of money to play a game

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:31.380
it sounds familiar I guess but um and

00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:34.220
the it's not not to mention somehow in

00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:37.320
our society that's considered like a

00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:42.690
benefit for transitioning into other

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:44.240
parts of the world like no nine lives oh

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:48.450
thank god

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:50.700
like I swear to God if the 2012 2020 or

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:52.890
2024 American President presidential

00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:54.240
election is between the rock and Peyton

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:57.390
Manning I'm going to I'm just going to

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:59.910
leave Earth hopefully Elon Musk will

00:43:57.390 --> 00:44:02.100
have made that plausible by now and not

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:05.250
put a renegade AI on board his ship and

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:06.240
I will be like Elon let me onto the Mars

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:08.430
mission you'll be like what

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:11.010
qualifications do you have I'm just done

00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:14.150
dude put me up there I'll find something

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:18.720
I'll sweep the floors I don't care I

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:22.610
can't deal with a Kid Rock versus Dwayne

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:25.200
