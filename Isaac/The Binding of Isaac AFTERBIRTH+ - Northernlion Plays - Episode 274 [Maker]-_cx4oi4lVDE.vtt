##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.799
everybody welcome back to in Lyon please

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.240
the binding of issac after birth plus um

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:08.280
I'm going to start doing eating runs

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.719
again and that definitely has nothing to

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.730
do with the fact that there's a scrub

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.969
video where I random the lost and lost

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.180
like 15 milliseconds in I think I need

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.699
to reset a dag that's me smashing the

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.560
reset button right there it's a very

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.580
fleshy sounding button 6x 3 3 Faysal

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.560
can't you hear me

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.390
Faysal you're putting me through has OH

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.370
Faysal okay that's Ned Flanders in a

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.040
streetcar named March from The Simpsons

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.899
one of probably like 20 Simpsons

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.700
episodes where I remember the name James

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.850
West came in the West so remember the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.930
James grapes tart is eating here I'm not

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.989
saying we're saying goodbye to the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.360
randoms but I sincerely random to lost

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.520
gotten mine flooded and lost on the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.289
first boss fight and the freaking boss

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.329
was Ragman champion version who summons

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.640
infinity spiders and I was like well I'm

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.850
going to give it a show I'm dead ok so I

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.880
think being Eden for a while on this

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.960
themed remember the bean run it's a good

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.670
chance for us to hit the reset button

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.110
plus we get to be zany on the last

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.880
canonical episode non-daily we did get

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.960
to appreciate a brand new item and that

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.320
was awesome that was a nice little

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.420
opportunity for us to have a fresh

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.490
experience doesn't always happen in

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.060
Isaac these days so I'm sincerely

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.880
grateful for the opportunity telepathy

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.770
has risen the leaderboards the Power

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.890
Rankings if you will for my personal

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.570
items of choice and I'm quite fond of

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.689
the effect that it had on our last run

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.130
this run is amazing you don't need me to

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.710
tell you that I'm sure but especially

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.689
now that we've gotten 1 HP like we're

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.640
actually in a dominant position with a

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.799
very good rate of fire very good damage

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.420
at least for spawning a pretty not

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.890
amazing space bar item but that's

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:03.479
largely irrelevant because of the fact

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.490
that we're you know doing so well

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.049
statistically even our speed is I mean

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.810
like I've really started to hate speed

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.940
when we get down to below 1 for some

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.280
reason there's like a mental block

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.990
it's like if I have one speed life's

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.170
fine if I have zero point nine nine

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.210
speed Oh Tyrone your game is so cruel

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.310
why do you do this to me see I'm not

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:29.460
above any of you you know I I recognize

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.920
my own my own faults and caricatures for

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.110
certain hey here's my impression of

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.040
northernlion played five thousand hours

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.690
of this freakin game

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.630
oh I die every time see like we've

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.980
missed my impression of Northern Line Oh

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.450
self-effacing commentary and then insult

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.830
somebody else that it feels like it's

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.750
not an insult because the insulted

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.730
himself first okay we need to bomb and

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.950
then we're in a good spot but let's get

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.460
this be able to devil first okay okay

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.470
okay

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.940
there's our bomb you know what let's not

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.280
get the deal with the devil first

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.030
because we have unlimited bombs as a

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:07.880
result of this bomb we'll use that to

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:10.710
pick up one real bomb and honestly

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.330
rarely do we get a chance mothers of my

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.330
minder is one of these keys bigger than

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:19.410
the other one we rarely get a chance to

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.150
use ace of spades productively this was

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.020
a really good time to use it I got to

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:28.350
stop thinking of it as like the get 20

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:31.470
Keys option I think it's the get two

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.120
Keys option so the 1up I got to be

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.490
honest I doubt it's going to be that

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.810
amazing but it's kind of a nice get for

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.630
us considering how I've been playing

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.430
lately and the golden chests turned out

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.650
fine let's use golden bombs to crap on

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:50.670
this boss oh it's we got a freaking

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:52.410
Ouroboros man almost done so really nice

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.870
ending to this floor don't pick that up

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.270
yet we can even now we can't die and

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.280
then make it work but demon baby is

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.750
worth taking the plunge here I think

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.160
we're going to get a luck upgrade which

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.750
is going to take us a to luck I didn't

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.930
even notice but our luck stat is like

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.450
actually good as well and honestly this

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.980
runs off to the races this is kind of

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.870
what I needed I think is to take a

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.910
little break from random who would have

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.120
thought a random would be more difficult

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.340
than having a random you know gets on

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.450
your character I guess the answer is

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.610
probably pretty much everybody but

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.960
you know I'm not pretty much everybody I

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.550
think we've established that for better

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.840
or for worse right now

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:35.330
yeah those Kaos thank you appreciated

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.000
lovers card does nothing to be fair the

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.700
nine-volt is also sweet as heck for us

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.980
right now because we could use a Giga

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.290
fart every time it shows up or in every

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.560
room I should say dark princess crown is

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.420
for whatever reason actually like a

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.150
pretty okay get right now we have

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.130
exactly the amount of HP we need to have

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.010
to make this work so I would not suggest

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.470
this is a good item but I would suggest

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.290
that this is like the best time for it

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.360
so with unlimited bombs we might as well

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:10.790
get 9 volt I mean our donation machine

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:16.760
is at 914 cents so feeling like this is

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:18.050
probably a shrewd move maybe less when

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:23.120
you blow yourself up but you get the

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:25.070
idea let's go one more here the tower

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.840
not what I'm looking for that's okay

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.130
though and we're going to go down this

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.380
is actually a really really good

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:34.280
position what's important to remember is

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:38.380
I should not give a crap about keeping

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:41.360
dark Prince's crown like it's an okay

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:44.060
tiers upgrade and I mean range in shot

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:48.200
speed but who cares it's an okay tiers

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:51.410
upgrade but if we can get something that

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.390
improves upon our run we should take it

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.370
even if it does come with HP and we

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:58.760
might just want to pick up HP by itself

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:01.100
as well so slightly more controversial

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.960
choice I guess but considering we're

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.550
going to have decent chances to get rid

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:10.540
of the HP I think it's not a bad idea

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:13.940
dude we can actually use the love tubes

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:18.530
once per wave thanks to nine volt and

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:21.200
the change to these mob trap rooms it's

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.780
pretty sweet nine volt probably becomes

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.070
a marginally better item as a result of

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.930
that change I will say I think that

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:32.540
change makes perfect sense it maybe it

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.650
makes the game very very very slightly

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.180
easier

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.650
who cares you know apparently the

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:43.160
hardest game in the world right now so

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:45.050
we have a huge positive for us I mean if

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.600
bas thrush can give you charges and it

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:51.979
gives you two charges why not have that

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:56.509
room give you some love too so this

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:59.240
floor we honestly don't need much if we

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:01.820
could get DPS without actually raising

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:05.270
so good we can get DPS without actually

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:07.430
raising our are tears re our HP that

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.580
would be for the best probably also for

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:12.889
the best if I don't pull it was a little

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:19.070
close if I don't walk into bullets or

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:21.199
enemies otherwise this guys are close

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.070
calls right now he's going to use we got

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:25.310
to kill the goose

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:26.599
and since we have chaos honestly who

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.520
cares about a deal with the devil now

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:31.190
that I think about it should instead

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:36.440
just you know get as many possible item

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:38.030
pedestals as we can easy money and the

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.260
shop is actually probably the easiest

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:42.620
way for us to do that because if we get

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:45.340
chaos restock and one steam sale we can

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:48.560
buy like 30 items if we get chaos

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:50.180
restock to steam sales we can buy every

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:53.349
item that's ever existed in the game and

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:58.039
you'd be surprised it has happened that

00:07:53.349 --> 00:08:02.270
was a terrible play this is where we

00:07:58.039 --> 00:08:04.580
always seem to lose it lately just hold

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:07.180
it together hold yourself together sit

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.180
your butt down

00:08:08.439 --> 00:08:15.789
grab this grab this and then go in there

00:08:13.509 --> 00:08:17.889
for a little easy action

00:08:15.789 --> 00:08:19.509
I guess those enemies don't do contact

00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:23.439
damage to one another which is a bummer

00:08:19.509 --> 00:08:26.289
I should still be using this fart like

00:08:23.439 --> 00:08:27.729
once per room aw dude I don't think you

00:08:26.289 --> 00:08:34.169
fight the angel statue but I'm going to

00:08:27.729 --> 00:08:37.240
fight the angel statue Thank You infamy

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:39.459
why fight the angel statue first off you

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.579
phrase that as a full sentence yes why

00:08:39.459 --> 00:08:44.110
are you fighting the angel statue well

00:08:41.579 --> 00:08:45.850
I'm hoping somehow it gives me like a

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:48.430
golden chest or something that's the big

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:50.860
draw here it didn't gave me a single

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:57.480
penny I use like 30 cents worth of bombs

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:59.949
to fight it but still think this item

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.420
you know the kidney bean is not that is

00:08:59.949 --> 00:09:04.750
this the kidney bean the other ones just

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:08.079
the bean right this is a haricot Druze

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:13.389
as far as I'm concerned let's go follow

00:09:08.079 --> 00:09:15.100
bandages is lovely the problem is it's

00:09:13.389 --> 00:09:17.920
even if we're able to use it once per

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:21.160
room it's very situational like we need

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.779
to use it against enemies that are not

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.430
the only enemy on the room otherwise

00:09:22.779 --> 00:09:27.040
it's just kind of like a needless charm

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:29.740
and even if we use it on enemies that

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.000
are not alone on their room some of

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:33.040
those enemies don't damage each other

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.509
and even if they do they sometimes won't

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.370
even be able to pass fine to one another

00:09:34.509 --> 00:09:39.430
but now you got to give it a shot

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:44.470
nonetheless the hourglass once per room

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:48.480
I think is probably worse but it's kind

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:50.050
of close I wish there was a bean

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.829
transformation that is like if you got

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:55.269
two beans you got all the beans I was

00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:56.350
going to say passively but now that I

00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:59.079
think about it doesn't really make any

00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:00.970
sense so the big get on this floor so

00:09:59.079 --> 00:10:05.620
far is actually the one that has nothing

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:07.089
to do with chaos weirdly enough if we go

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.949
back and look at the you know like

00:10:07.089 --> 00:10:11.139
selection of items that we've gotten so

00:10:08.949 --> 00:10:13.709
far I think sincerely Bal advantages is

00:10:11.139 --> 00:10:13.709
the big winner

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:23.000
not enough to really ride home about but

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:25.820
certainly useful for us and tight dodge

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.120
there if if boss rush becomes doable is

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:30.020
probably going to be as a result of our

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:32.180
orbital helping us here so that was

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:35.980
probably the worst single use of a beam

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:35.980
related item I've ever seen in my life

00:10:43.339 --> 00:10:49.290
there we go it's a little bit of a

00:10:46.709 --> 00:10:52.529
slower floor but it will be faster than

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:55.200
if we done two separately so does the

00:10:52.529 --> 00:10:57.620
kidney bean do any damage it seems like

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.970
it might do some damage in which case I

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:02.070
give it a little bit more street cred

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:04.110
which I'm the arbiter of street cred

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:05.519
most people don't know everybody's

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:07.140
always asking how do you get street cred

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:11.070
the answer is you've got to earn it with

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:19.620
me and street cred isn't free it costs a

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:22.200
buck oh five would like to pick up some

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:23.370
bombs I would like to get our second

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.459
item room and I'd like to have enough

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:29.730
money to make our shop give us something

00:11:26.459 --> 00:11:31.440
but beggars can't be choosers I suppose

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:36.110
I'm not really begging I mean I'm kind

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:38.579
of working for it here this is a shop

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:41.850
what's so chaotic about this this is

00:11:38.579 --> 00:11:43.019
just a shop at least we got good value

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:47.700
there we needed the bomb anyway so

00:11:43.019 --> 00:11:48.810
that's pretty big positive could be a

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.579
secret room but I'm not really

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.529
interested in spending our bomb on that

00:11:50.579 --> 00:11:54.870
I'll spend a bomb here this is like you

00:11:52.529 --> 00:11:58.110
know spend a bomb workshop grab that to

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:59.850
sense great return on our investment far

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:04.740
down each other at least you're not you

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:07.320
know pathfinding towards me okay I'm

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.910
excited but cautiously optimistic it's

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:11.100
like when you're a kid on Christmas or

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:12.750
whatever holiday you celebrate you know

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.910
you asked for a gameboy color and then

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:16.560
pokemon red or something like that you

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:18.660
open the first present your parents give

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:21.209
you it's pokemon red you think in your

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:22.829
head my god I've got pokemon red but no

00:12:21.209 --> 00:12:25.470
gameboy color I'm putting the pieces

00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:28.620
together you know there's going to be a

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:31.709
GBC probably with the pikachu togepi on

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:33.959
it special edition under that christmas

00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:36.240
tree otherwise your parents got ripped

00:12:33.959 --> 00:12:40.500
off by the sales associate of Toys R Us

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:44.399
and it's not the ones not good without

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:47.600
the other we talked about the the song

00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:47.600
love and marriage

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:59.410
love and marriage love and marriage goes

00:12:55.629 --> 00:13:04.420
together like a horse and carriage this

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:07.629
I tell you brother you can't have one

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:13.179
without the other you sure about that

00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:14.790
though I think you can have one without

00:13:13.179 --> 00:13:18.970
the other

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:20.499
certainly I think you can mean maybe I'm

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:22.149
looking too much into the lyrics here

00:13:20.499 --> 00:13:25.029
but this is like an American classic

00:13:22.149 --> 00:13:27.939
right so I think it's worthy of a little

00:13:25.029 --> 00:13:30.029
criticism we all agree I assume you can

00:13:27.939 --> 00:13:32.019
have one without the other

00:13:30.029 --> 00:13:35.470
certainly you can have love without

00:13:32.019 --> 00:13:38.949
marriage marriage is a legal construct a

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:40.360
religious construct you know a lot of

00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:44.189
people fall in love for the first time I

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:46.749
like high school can't get married

00:13:44.189 --> 00:13:48.269
depending on what part of the you know

00:13:46.749 --> 00:13:51.790
United States you live in at least I

00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:53.319
can't get married but you can still be

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:58.470
in love I believe that I don't want this

00:13:53.319 --> 00:14:00.459
plan C okay I will take push pin though

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:03.399
certainly you can have marriage without

00:14:00.459 --> 00:14:06.790
love as well you know that's why there's

00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:09.519
divorce I'm just starting to think that

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:11.439
song is honestly full of nonsense as far

00:14:09.519 --> 00:14:15.339
as I'm concerned I don't even get me

00:14:11.439 --> 00:14:18.459
started we go off on a song lyric

00:14:15.339 --> 00:14:20.980
tangent I'm going to be here all day

00:14:18.459 --> 00:14:23.410
maybe that's what we want from now

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.819
actually all I want to do is have some

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:26.439
fun I got a feeling I'm not the only one

00:14:24.819 --> 00:14:29.139
I did so well on that room until that

00:14:26.439 --> 00:14:30.759
moment where this is this is the new

00:14:29.139 --> 00:14:34.839
Isaac and I don't know why this is the

00:14:30.759 --> 00:14:36.910
case but every single run has no damage

00:14:34.839 --> 00:14:38.379
upgrades so you better spawn in with

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:39.910
something half decent is eating because

00:14:38.379 --> 00:14:42.249
damage upgrades just do not exist

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:45.040
apparently anymore you will have base

00:14:42.249 --> 00:14:47.499
stats in the DPS department until the

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.879
end of the game I don't know if every

00:14:47.499 --> 00:14:50.559
damaged item has been moved into like a

00:14:48.879 --> 00:14:52.059
special tool or something like that but

00:14:50.559 --> 00:14:54.189
air okay Nancy

00:14:52.059 --> 00:14:55.509
the real secret is all you got to do is

00:14:54.189 --> 00:14:57.459
complain to get what you want

00:14:55.509 --> 00:15:00.459
you just got mined flooded by the best

00:14:57.459 --> 00:15:01.310
of them buddy so we have one up for

00:15:00.459 --> 00:15:03.950
certain

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:15.110
why I'm going for broke here I regret

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:17.020
everything he has not done it did pick

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:23.570
up some cash though

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:27.320
worth it no highly highly no let's go

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:28.970
worth it absolutely um so growth

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.770
hormones allows me to stave off the

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:34.370
complaining for a little bit here for

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:35.900
certain but we are you know still

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:37.970
fighting I'm still fighting for our

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:40.339
chance at greatness here we got to go to

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:42.050
the shop to the shop is you know deal

00:15:40.339 --> 00:15:44.450
with the devil item central especially

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:50.060
with chaos we can get anything there and

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:51.350
if we can get to restock I'm loving life

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.790
although we're a little bit light on

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.980
cash might be good to fight greed

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:56.990
instead and get a Steam sale and then

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:59.600
maybe by the time we get to the void

00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:01.970
floor sorry the hush floor although both

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:05.210
are about equally plausible right now if

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:06.860
I'm being honest Thank You infamy it's

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:08.360
really nice we charm an enemy and then

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:16.510
they spawn and instead of shooting at

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:19.910
you they shoot at you I think I've been

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:22.040
mentally floodable in these recent Isaac

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:23.540
episodes and it's up to us to you know

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:26.030
break that trend because it's a little

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:28.610
embarrassing getting beaten is bad by a

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:32.810
video game that you know you've had a

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:35.300
100-something streak in this run is at

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:37.339
present currently acceptable we'd like

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:39.860
to improve our stats a little bit and in

00:16:37.339 --> 00:16:44.930
a permanent way because the real problem

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:47.420
right now is more so that you know a lot

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:49.010
of our sadly a lot of our upgrades are

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:52.640
tied up in dark Prince's crown which is

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:54.589
actually like it's temporary although it

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:56.510
might not seem like it so the same is

00:16:54.589 --> 00:16:58.100
lovely and a two of spades I think was

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:01.430
well worth it I was kind of hoping it'd

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:03.200
be Joker card but that's fine I think

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:05.480
we're good to go out of this floor we

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:08.569
are sort of banking on a deal with the

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:10.459
devil but we need a teleport card in

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:12.290
order to really make that pop off I

00:17:10.459 --> 00:17:14.100
don't want to go this way but I have no

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:17.850
idea where we're supposed to go

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:22.319
there is Plan C Plan C with one up Plan

00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:26.220
C that's a chief Wiggum wife from the

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:29.640
television program The Simpsons these

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:31.590
are third lyrics to the Simpsons theme

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:36.929
song the theme since the Simpsons theme

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:38.820
song same same theme sound my god he's

00:17:36.929 --> 00:17:41.809
invented a new tongue twister there

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:44.070
hasn't been one of those for millennia

00:17:41.809 --> 00:17:47.330
Simpsons theme song Simpsons theme song

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:48.809
Simpsons theme song Simpsons theme song

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:55.909
alright maybe it's not that

00:17:48.809 --> 00:17:57.780
tongue-twisting how do we make a same

00:17:55.909 --> 00:18:04.950
work to our advantage

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:07.890
well the sensible option should spawn

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:13.320
charmed enemies dang it the sensible

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:18.960
option is to never use it until he gets

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:20.549
hit naturally and then pick up as many

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.130
black cards as we can get but you know

00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:24.929
already that the fact that I said that

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:25.980
that's the sensible way means there's no

00:18:24.929 --> 00:18:30.270
chance that's what's going to actually

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:32.280
happen to it diamonds probably beats the

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:34.620
devil card considering our cash

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:37.100
situation I really want to go to that

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:39.120
unless it's good let's get out of here

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.760
probably we're going to miss boss rush

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:42.870
and I think we should accept that as

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.549
necessary cost of doing business in

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:50.100
today's America we're going to head down

00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:53.190
to the next floor curse of the unknown

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:56.520
we know we got one read hard if we ever

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:58.169
go down a half I was it predicted me we

00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.600
ever go down a half a red hard will lose

00:18:58.169 --> 00:19:03.320
our tear bonus so we will know pretty

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.320
darn quickly

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:13.120
I actually don't know if that's true now

00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:15.160
that I think about it definitely if we

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.960
go down to zero red hearts by like you

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.280
know using W spars something like that

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.940
or trading a Hardaway we'll lose our

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:23.650
bonus but I still think it's the right

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:25.410
thing to do because HP is so easy to

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:28.179
come by

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:29.710
I'm actually like zero percent worried

00:19:28.179 --> 00:19:31.240
about boss rushin we can make it and if

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:33.340
we get into the boss room at you know

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:36.880
like 1910 I'll probably try to make it

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:39.100
regardless of our our teleport card

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:41.140
situation just it's nice to know what's

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:45.309
in there this is a good opportunity to

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:46.600
take some synergies out of to a diamonds

00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:48.700
and certainly we don't need the key

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:51.280
all that's the moneymaker now we're at

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:56.290
34 cents this is where you hit me up

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:59.320
with a fad restock and we ball out of

00:19:56.290 --> 00:20:00.429
control key bagger is not good enough I

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:03.040
mean we're going to use to a diamonds

00:20:00.429 --> 00:20:06.669
probably right now so torn photo is good

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:09.700
enough let's double up and then give you

00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:11.320
my last bomb dad's keys not good enough

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.940
a pacifier might be although I think

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:18.010
we're probably at the tier capsule let's

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:22.630
bust past that we all want the HP we

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:24.340
don't have any other fly items so it

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:25.660
turns out Polaroid wasn't even worth it

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:28.630
because it didn't bust through our tear

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:31.710
cap but if we can ever break the to your

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:31.710
cap we can make up for it

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.350
that's good I don't think we care about

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:43.040
revenge fly I sort of care about a

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:45.720
revenge fly but I don't care enough and

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:47.700
the HP we don't want at least not yet we

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:49.410
definitely want pentagram okay so I

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:52.020
think you go for the free deal with the

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:53.850
devil item first and buy free deal with

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:56.340
the devil item I have to apologize for

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:58.710
my broken brain and say what I actually

00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:01.470
mean is free item room item which could

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:03.900
be a deal with the devil a sad Baum's

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:05.370
not a deal with the devil but a lovely

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:08.280
item nonetheless

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:10.049
now is there a shopkeeper in here there

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:11.280
is not so we're going to go if there was

00:21:10.049 --> 00:21:18.179
a shopkeeper I would have blown them up

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:23.400
and tried to get a teleport card alright

00:21:18.179 --> 00:21:31.110
look sounds hmm maybe better off of the

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:36.980
orbital I don't care enough about boss

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:36.980
rush to put us at risk it's not a daily

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:41.130
is that what I need to say is that the

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:48.480
magic code word for me to play better in

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:49.710
Isaac it's not a daily didn't make it I

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.000
sorry I didn't make a deal with the

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:55.740
devil but we definitely didn't make boss

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.410
rush sad bombs sack of sex bomb bag halo

00:21:55.740 --> 00:22:00.780
flies these are not good enough to

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:04.380
justify going forth so we'll save our

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:05.520
chance for the hush fight instead of

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:10.340
course you probably would have at least

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:10.340
lost our 1up if we'd gone there so

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:20.960
well we got a black card out of that so

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:30.830
I'm going to take that as a pretty nice

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:32.540
positive guys are pretty annoying that

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:35.240
we should go back through sad box duel

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:42.140
we've discovered the greatest enemy to

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:46.700
charm of course we'll probably never see

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:54.140
them again but ignoring that that enemy

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:58.220
is dynamite I don't know I mean I guess

00:22:54.140 --> 00:23:01.790
I should respect that the love toots are

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:07.880
at least dealing damage you can't have

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:10.340
one without the other cheese and

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:13.340
crackers see I'm saying they go well

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:18.140
together don't get me wrong I'm a

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:20.540
beneficiary of both right now I love my

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:23.920
wife and I'm married to my wife so I got

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:27.560
I got one with the other that's great

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:29.600
but I am just saying cheese and crackers

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.160
go real nice together you can have

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:35.600
crackers without cheese and you can have

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:36.890
cheese without crackers sometimes you

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.390
can have crackers that have the cheese

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:40.460
built inside of them I don't even know

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:43.550
what the analog for that is I'm just

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:48.350
saying I don't like this is a tears

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:51.140
downgrade and 80 keys for a loss of HP

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:54.230
that was terrible that it damaged there

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:56.600
but I think this is definitely 100

00:23:54.230 --> 00:24:02.000
percent now worth going forward we have

00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:07.520
nine bombs they are sad bomber boy bombs

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:12.190
bomber boy very deadly so we have to be

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:17.200
careful but also very good for us

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:19.440
like as you can see quite a lot of

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.440
damage

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:28.360
now coincidentally these are the worst

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:30.910
enemies in history to charm apparently

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:33.670
the ones that actually smack are like

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:35.770
non-stop greatness but those ones are

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:38.890
trash are we going to do the hush fight

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:43.120
the odds are not looking great right now

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:44.740
if I'm being real with you okay still

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:47.320
sort of work but not what I was looking

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:49.030
for probably a secret room but honestly

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:52.140
our bombs are more valuable than any

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:52.140
secret room right now

00:24:56.850 --> 00:25:03.090
you live come I can't believe that the

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:06.840
linchpins of this run might end up being

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:08.820
the kidney bean combined with dark

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:12.150
Prince's crown like that just goes to

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:15.840
show you when things are working out for

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:19.800
you any item can be a game breaker you

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:21.810
know we need dude every bomb is worth

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:24.180
its own weight in gold here which is

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:25.950
like a bomb probably weighs like you

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:31.200
know five kilograms or something like

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:33.300
that okay that was a little stupid

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:35.070
button and I mean five kilograms I'd be

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:38.970
happy I got no concept of how much a

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:42.230
bomb should actually weigh but five

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:44.760
kilograms of gold that's a lot of money

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:48.260
if you got a bag of gold that you can

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.260
only carry for like half an hour

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:53.310
ain't like in your hand

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:55.500
I'm not look probably carrying more than

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:57.810
four five kilograms for more than half

00:25:55.500 --> 00:26:00.020
an hour I'm just making a generalization

00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:02.940
here

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:04.770
that's enough gold to you know keep you

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:06.500
rich for life that gold can carry you

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:10.080
for a lifetime

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:12.120
potentially I don't know maybe that's

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:14.220
why I only accept donations in the form

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:16.650
of gold bullion first off because we all

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:19.200
know the banks are collapsing and you

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:21.360
know fiduciary insurance who even knows

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:23.670
if that's going to hold when the you

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:28.710
know whole system goes on trial etc

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:31.730
etcetera or make an amazing time but I

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:34.830
am slightly concerned about my survival

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:38.010
chances here not against mom's hard

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:40.080
that's like a given but just in general

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:41.550
dude what's the fascination with these

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:45.270
key related items here

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:47.700
I know clips said they open doors but

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:49.500
it's too much I don't want it I I need

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:51.360
the tears up great well maybe I don't

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:54.060
because we're already like above the

00:26:51.360 --> 00:27:00.500
tears cab but I prefer having the red

00:26:54.060 --> 00:27:00.500
heart right now so I think

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:06.780
if an enemy is even mildly annoying you

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:08.220
should crank on him with a bomb even

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:10.170
like a room like that I didn't expect to

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:13.740
get everything killed but just to take

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:15.420
care of the pennies and the pounds

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:17.040
hopefully while then later we have to

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:19.530
manually take care of the pounds again

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:24.390
but you get the idea okay don't really

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:26.100
care about dad even this is a candidate

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:28.560
for using a bomb the only reason I'm not

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:31.040
doing it is because we've used them on

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:33.090
two in a row now

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:36.770
and I would like more we did have the

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:39.660
chance to take bomb bag from boss rush

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:42.690
we could have taken it the problem is

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:46.020
that if we had taken bomb bag we then

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:48.900
that was lucky we then would have had to

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:52.410
fight boss rush the odds are we probably

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:54.810
would have died oh this is free bombs

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:58.680
and then after we died we would have had

00:27:54.810 --> 00:28:01.050
1 HP so it might have been the right

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:07.110
call like every bomb that we get is a

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:09.290
free room done more or less for now but

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:14.310
it carried an inherent risk as well dude

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:16.320
we have to take mr. boom this is the

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:20.490
right opportunity for mr. boom to pop

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:22.980
off once per room bomber boy sad bombs

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:25.260
yeah okay so first thing we've done with

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:27.000
mr. boom has hurt ourselves but that

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:28.440
just goes to show you how powerful it is

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.260
even I'm not shielded from its

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:33.120
incredible effects this might look like

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:35.670
a self-destructive run but it's actually

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:42.450
gorgeous like this is an unbelievably

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:51.030
strong run I really really do not want

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:52.800
to lose this life tonight oh okay well

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:56.220
guess else didn't give me a black card

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:58.110
that's not how that worked ok hpe yeah

00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:01.070
nailed it three keys you might have

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:01.070
misheard me they do rhyme

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:12.409
that was a 1-up not a Guppies pop I'm

00:29:11.749 --> 00:29:21.649
begging you

00:29:12.409 --> 00:29:23.389
he's done it alright that room scared

00:29:21.649 --> 00:29:26.539
the shit out of me I said the S word

00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:28.969
that's how you know it got me and then I

00:29:26.539 --> 00:29:32.329
got a freaking spirit heart out of it

00:29:28.969 --> 00:29:34.190
you know it to be true HP let's go the

00:29:32.329 --> 00:29:41.690
bombs are still nice but HP let's go

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:44.629
let's go half heart don't mind a fight

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:47.269
to go play this guy thanks for the free
