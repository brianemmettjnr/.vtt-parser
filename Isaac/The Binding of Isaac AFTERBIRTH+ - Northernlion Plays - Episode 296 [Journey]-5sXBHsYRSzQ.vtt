00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.790
hey everybody welcome back to her on the

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.170
line please finding wise gets Ruth plus

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.750
killing it lately

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.830
easy runs good runs and great starts is

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.210
even great damage great rate of fire

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.619
that's all I'm going to say here

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:20.460
7m DBM qlk with breath of life which

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.380
also started our run like it might have

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.180
even know it was two runs ago I think we

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.800
started with breath of life and honestly

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.300
we can afford lard even though it is

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.220
going to lower our speed drastically I

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.730
think it's a small price to pay for

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.200
getting a little bit of HP and all in

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.980
all like looking at this run there's

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.629
basically nothing that I can be

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.070
disappointed about right now one of

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.510
these days maybe I'll use breath of life

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.690
properly one of these days maybe they'll

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.280
make it worth using properly but for now

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.020
it's just taking up space and that's

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.180
fine because all of our other stats are

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.750
like above average except speed except

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.070
speed but speed is relatively easy to

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.199
come by except for all those runs in

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.949
which it's literally killed us okay okay

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.290
okay it's going to be one of these runs

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.119
it's going to be a d4 run and you know

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.580
what it's been a while since we fully

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.729
Zain doubt sometimes we balled out

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.290
sometimes we played like we were strung

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.700
out now it's time for us to Zane out so

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.909
we're going to d4 on the regular I'm

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.229
probably going to hold off just for now

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.939
because I don't like deform like two

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.380
items maybe we'll wait until after the

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.000
first deal with the devil is over and

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.860
then all we're doing is trying to reroll

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.750
into it a run that is some good

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.430
combination of decent and also fresh you

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.140
know it doesn't have to be Tex

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.329
it's basically what I'm trying to get

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.829
out with that even though you know if we

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.409
come down to what tech X might not be

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.210
the worst thing in the world we're

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.590
actually in a really good position to d4

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.780
as well because no matter what we're

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.610
still going to have to HP even if they

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.409
take away lard we're going to have to HP

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.299
that's like it can't be ripped away from

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:59.700
us our damage can be by losing

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.520
cat-o'-nine-tails but I'm pretty sure

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.369
there's no way to go down in HP even if

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.950
you re roll into like nine lives I think

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.539
you might get nine lives and be at your

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.330
existing amount of HP but don't quote me

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.740
on that one well maybe find out if we if

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.790
we have to cross that bridge but

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.860
for now the run is good and the d for

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.410
only makes it more interesting I'll be a

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.780
you know slightly scarier as well but

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.360
we're like I don't know man when I think

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.390
back to those Isaac runs from like a

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.730
week ago I was convinced the game at God

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.020
and harder and I was talking to like sin

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.430
victim about it he's like maybe you're

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.870
just tilted off the face of the planet

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.150
Earth and I was like nah do you

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.400
understand the game's gotten harder you

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.970
are you it's just me I'm the only one

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.950
looking at the facts here turns out I

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.630
may have just been tilted off the face

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.280
of planet Earth or perhaps some

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.810
combination of being mad tilted and also

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.210
variants not being particularly kind

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.700
over and over and over not to say that

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.230
we should have lost every run that we

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.750
had there but maybe you know we should

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.310
have lost one and then that tilted me a

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.960
little bit and then we maybe should have

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.150
won the second one but I was too tilted

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.930
to play well and you know it's not an

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.610
excuse but I keep talking about the

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.920
slump because it's how I keep the ghost

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.630
of the slump away now that we're on a

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.600
little pseudo streak here at least

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.440
that's the that's the dream work that's

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.480
the dream work

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.840
that's the dream but teamwork makes the

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.860
dream work is what I mean to say here

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.530
all right so we're coming close to our

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.900
first re-roll after which point we will

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.010
reroll now and forever until the end of

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.720
time but I said like two episodes of

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.690
going and have a big day recording Isaac

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.100
so far so good

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.830
you know get that momentum high and

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.680
don't dilute it by playing dead cells I

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.690
think it was I've been going on some

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.700
I've been going dead cells Isaac dead

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.080
cells Isaac and then I'm playing bad at

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.490
dead cells that I come over to Isaac and

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.980
I'm not playing as well and Isaac aside

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.530
like us as well

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:05.100
I got a you know specialized today is

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.530
Isaac day it's like going to the gym you

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.420
can do a full body workout but you know

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.380
you might be it I mean I don't know what

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.940
I'm talking about I should probably

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.760
abstain from giving advice don't take

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.950
fitness advice from a guy who sits in a

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.410
chair 14 hours a day and spends the

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:24.660
other you know 10 hours basically laying

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:27.050
down either on a couch or on a bed let's

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.050
take it

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.120
hear me out here

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.319
we got plays I got ideas at least unless

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.819
it's one of those twitch streamers who

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:39.090
also like prides themselves on being

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:40.500
jacked in which case like take fitness

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.539
advice from them just don't take it from

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.770
me that's the most important thing you

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.940
know you can call me many things just

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.120
don't call me late for dinner

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.280
because I'm punctual and I love food

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:57.389
don't worry roll yet what I'm thinking

00:04:50.280 --> 00:05:02.340
is we should kick the crap out of this

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:04.520
boss with our good stats wow that is the

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.330
fastest tingle I've ever seen in my life

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.330
we will stand further away

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.020
take as many deals with the devil as we

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:15.090
can if we could respawn as dark Judas

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.960
and then re-roll I'm a happy camper

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:21.090
because that means that our damage stat

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.879
is not going to be as necessarily

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.129
guaranteed to be garbage as it might be

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:28.080
I mean if we're going to reroll I don't

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:29.909
know first off just go grab this

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.479
business perfect because we can grab all

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:35.639
this stuff hurt ourselves a little bit

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:40.009
here so we die come back as dark Judas

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:42.990
damages out of control then magic mush

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:45.419
also gave us another six damage and then

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.130
reroll and our damage went way down but

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:48.810
our speed went up by point zero zero so

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.880
that's pretty positive what have I done

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.639
this is the most hideous of all the

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.190
Lord's creations anyway down to the next

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.360
floor we could have rolled with it for a

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:01.409
little while away of the fun in that

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.840
right instead we've created and of

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:05.479
course no mirror on this floor we've

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.680
created a hideous

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:10.770
abomination the likes of which I've

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.020
never seen before but it's still decent

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.719
you know we have eight damage I would

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:20.789
prefer to just be shooting straight on

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:22.879
but it's not that bad and our HP will

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:25.020
last long enough for us to get to good

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:27.389
territory your honestly this could be

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.250
the novel run that we've been asking for

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:36.029
but I don't know if it has that perfect

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:37.770
combination of novel and good if we can

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:39.630
get like tractor beam I'm off to the

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.180
races like there's no shame in

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.070
taking the first d4 that you get if the

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:47.460
first c4 you get is good plus we do have

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:49.100
egghead here actually feels like we got

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.440
super hang head or something

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:56.790
that is I say this as a person with an

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:59.610
egg-shaped head that is an egghead that

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.660
head is an egg it's one of the ones you

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.180
get from the grocery store and you're

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.550
like what kind of chicken produce an egg

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.440
this large I feel bad for the chicken

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.790
and not just for the requisite reasons

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.820
that you'd normally feel bad for a

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:14.010
chicken for altogether different reasons

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.080
related to the size of the orphans

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:22.170
necessary to push out this gargantuan

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:24.570
egg all right yeah I just didn't move

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:30.270
there so I can understand why I got hit

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:32.220
I do want to re-roll but if there's

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.870
going to be a high density of items like

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.930
there will be on this little setup right

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:40.070
here we might as well wait and see what

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:42.570
we get so this is our second boss fight

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:45.000
so we will not get a deal with the devil

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:46.470
on this floor and then walking backwards

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.090
will take us to the regular boss fight

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.010
it's a little weird I thought you always

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:52.520
got teleported to the first phase of

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:56.820
them for the first boss room out of two

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:58.350
maybe not though an arranged upgrade is

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.470
is pretty much garbage so okay let's

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:04.650
throw out the reroll here

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:06.960
it's like exclusively bad I mean our

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:08.790
speed increased by like 0.1 I think but

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:12.720
apart from that pretty much exclusively

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:14.700
bad and I think yeah like a dunce cap is

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:18.930
one of those things or The Wiz to use

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:20.730
its you know canonical name it's one of

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:24.720
those items that sticks with you which

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:26.700
I'm actually really happy about because

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:30.840
it means that we can try to concoct a

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:32.820
good run that has the Wiz and those have

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:36.169
happened before they're not even

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:38.370
necessarily like few and far between but

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:41.130
certainly if it's an item you've got to

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:42.360
work with as opposed to like it does

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:45.620
what you needed to do right out of the

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:48.950
braid out of the gate so

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:51.350
I'm excited by the opportunities that

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:53.240
what do people say when they you know

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.650
get a job they don't want I'm excited by

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.770
the opportunities this presents the

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:59.480
unique opportunities I've given to us on

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:06.250
well what a special run you don't see

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:08.690
this every day okay what do we got here

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:10.670
forget me now I can't get rid of the D

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:13.520
for the D for is the soul of this run

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:15.320
right now forget me now is cool but

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.500
you're really only getting like two

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.940
items out of it well you're probably

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:22.310
getting four items out of it cuz we're

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.290
on an Excel floor to item rooms and two

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:30.380
bathrooms and then maybe deal with the

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:32.300
devil room access as well hello no don't

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:39.170
even worry about it I got a I got it

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:40.940
under control I'm good you know what

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:47.720
that's very graceful of you to offer but

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:51.050
I'm under control right now normals out

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:53.740
of granola bars but later today I will I

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:55.970
will get something never fear

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:59.779
does not need to be handles at the

00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:01.490
present moment thank you though all

00:09:59.779 --> 00:10:09.020
right we're going to go for a madri role

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:11.029
here pretty soon I want to wait until

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:13.700
after the item room just to see what we

00:10:11.029 --> 00:10:16.010
get because like the spot is Fouad now

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.270
we got two batteries we'll do it and I

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.680
see that we've got a great rate of fire

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.270
with a slightly diminished amount of

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.980
damage you know what it's kind of a

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:24.620
boring setup here we did find our secret

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:30.580
room but let's grab this and then reroll

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:30.580
again there we go 8-inch nails finger

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:37.279
zodiac is more of like a who cares sort

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:39.080
of thing but it's a decent setup I still

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:40.940
don't feel content to take forget-me-now

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.380
yet but you know we could try to build

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:45.440
around this when we can be like let's

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:47.930
make the highest damage finger run so

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.860
really bad Bernie Sanders impression

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:51.140
again I don't know where it keeps coming

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:52.850
from and everyone says you're Bernie

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.079
Sanders impression is bad but it's a

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:57.530
great mayor Quimby so I think I've just

00:10:54.079 --> 00:11:00.460
got to embrace that will Mike

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:02.660
the greatest finger run that's way no

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:05.360
JFK impression is mayor Quimby which

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:07.280
makes more sense I don't know they're

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:10.720
all they're mostly pretty bad except the

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:13.220
crash test dummies one is coming along a

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.540
couple of people which is double the

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.370
people that previously had tweeted

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.290
supportive me have tweeted supportive

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:25.160
that that impression so I think it's

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:28.400
coming up Emperor card Anthrocon if you

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:31.280
think this run time you could have been

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.870
long to see the magnetic fields anybody

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.720
they came out with a new album this year

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:37.880
I had no idea and it's just as

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:40.670
ridiculous as 69 love songs it's like

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:43.790
you know it's a quintuple album of like

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:45.650
b-sides there's anyway look dude this is

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:47.840
too many XL floors I'm getting it

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:49.550
twisted they always tell you not to do

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.100
that and Here I am getting it twisted

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:55.310
like it's a seat belt on a 1990s Dodge

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:57.470
Neon you just can't keep those things

00:11:55.310 --> 00:12:01.460
level so we'll take our Cuba meat and

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:04.250
I'm happy to have it this run is in

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:06.290
danger of being too fast and not not too

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:08.180
fast to succeed like it will almost

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:13.010
certainly succeed just fine

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:16.700
the real problem is you know what are we

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:21.110
going to what are we going to do when it

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:23.270
comes to finding time to use our d4

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:26.630
properly or properly here because at the

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:32.630
present moment we have no realistic

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:34.400
outlet for it we could use it but if

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:36.320
we're just using a non-stop it feels

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.450
less meaningful I don't know because the

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.950
finger is so good okay we'll reroll you

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:42.250
convinced me sad bombs that's what

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:45.080
you're looking for to some extent and

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:47.450
because of I'm guessing it's because of

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.580
Judas shadow because seven damage is

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:52.010
three point five which is usual base

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:53.720
damage times two so because of the fact

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:55.790
that we're dark Judas I don't think we

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.700
can ever dip that low in terms of our

00:12:55.790 --> 00:13:00.110
like the quality of this run so we

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.090
actually should reroll maybe more

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:03.860
frequently it's like having guppy but to

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:06.230
a smaller extent you know you're always

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:08.060
going to have that little baseline of no

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:09.950
matter how bad this run gets we will be

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.400
Gubbi so we no longer have zodiac we

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:16.050
have a lot of bombs centered

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:18.360
though and 30 bombs let's try it

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:20.760
we got three bombs synergies right there

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:23.690
so we have sad a homing cluster bombs

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:25.590
the cluster bombs exploding the more sad

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:29.510
homing bombs they don't they don't

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:32.670
cluster like over and over and over so

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:34.740
not that that's really that bad as you

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:36.570
can see one cluster bomb capable of

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:39.480
doing quite a lot of damage but this is

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:42.240
not only asked for you know I find

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:44.970
myself in search I'm Christopher Lee

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:48.080
from ratatouille the food critic I find

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:50.640
myself in search of something better

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:55.050
because the smile that she has makes me

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:58.200
a go-getter again passing me by by the

00:13:55.050 --> 00:14:01.230
far side the far side think it's the far

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.610
side with an A it's been a while it has

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:04.050
a bad reference something like the last

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:11.700
episode I listened to that song all the

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:15.390
time come on come on but I'm not reroll

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:16.920
in the run just yet dude big fan I'm not

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:19.740
sure if it's good or bad but it is

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:22.920
keeping sac dagger like in a constant

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:26.250
position because the familiars that come

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:28.500
after it in line can't rotate very

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:30.720
quickly so I mean it's almost like we

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:33.300
have a semi-permanent shield out in

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.820
front of us I don't want to re-roll my

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.990
beautiful twenty five cluster sad bumps

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.060
we're still going to have twenty five

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:43.500
bombs or more they're not going to be

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:45.540
cluster sad bombs much longer if we use

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.530
the reroll but the same time I want to

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.480
use the rear oh because their staffs

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:50.580
aren't that impressive it's you know

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.770
we're in a little bit of a catch-22 sort

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:55.760
of situation here okay like the worst

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.760
place that I've stood

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:05.430
I think the time has come go for the

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:07.850
reroll got the mom transformation mom's

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:07.850
knife

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.600
damage speed everything else is the same

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:14.760
but mom's knife of course gives us an

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.530
incredible ability to reroll straight

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.600
past it because I don't want no scrubs

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:21.870
and we had a mom's knife run very

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:26.490
recently that was all I should have

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:30.090
taken oh we have Beelzebub I'm confused

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:31.770
but happy I suppose this run is also not

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:34.230
that good we basically have double our

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:36.060
usual damage and half the rate of fire

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:38.370
slightly faster than half the rate of

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:40.020
fire but and I mean we have a holy light

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:41.820
every run that we've seen so far I think

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:44.070
is a run that we could have won with or

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:47.010
could win with I should say this one

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:49.140
included however just not that exciting

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:52.520
so we're still kind of looking you know

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:57.180
it's like that u2 song and I'm still

00:15:52.520 --> 00:16:00.800
looking for wood I haven't found that's

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:03.180
my favorite dude off of Josh's Street

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:05.340
one of the top albums of the 1970s

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:09.270
without a doubt see now you're like

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:11.160
where's the satire does he I your eyes

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:13.770
twitching a little bit I know he knows

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:16.140
it's called the Joshua Tree I know he

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:17.370
knows that the song's called I still

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.660
haven't found what I'm looking for not

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:21.810
I'm still looking for what I haven't

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:26.100
found but does he know that the Joshua

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:27.720
Tree came out in 1981 because I feel it

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:30.030
compulsive now I'll just leave one

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.440
comment and that's how you just got God

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:37.530
you just got trolled by the best of them

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:39.810
son all right this is actually bad like

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:43.020
if you have a Holy Light you want that

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:45.450
to be Holy Light plus a high rate of

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:47.940
fire not Holy Light plus a low rate of

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:48.690
fire again not terrible just not what

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.000
we're looking for

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:53.430
I mean analytic as good bits of Tears

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.960
upgrade 99 bombs I'll just take because

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:57.270
those aren't going anywhere we we

00:16:54.960 --> 00:17:01.980
benefit from consumables and then this

00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:05.430
minus 8 damage and Libra so libras like

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:08.900
really good Libra is really fun but we

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:08.900
do have Isaac's heart as well

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:18.570
I'm gonna roll out of it Isaac's heart

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:20.190
is just too bad to take you no use 99

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:22.140
bombs you got them smoke them if you got

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:24.770
and that's what they're always saying 99

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:26.970
spider bombs

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:29.220
I'll take tech zero

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:31.080
the problem is tech zero I mean first

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:33.540
off now we got to face any mother could

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:40.170
love and trust me many mothers do and

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:42.270
have loved it but this is uh our rate of

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:43.530
fire looks bad but it's actually fine

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:46.920
it's just chocolate milk that makes it

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:49.920
look bad this this run is interesting

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:53.160
does it quite you know pass our

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:55.050
thresholds I would say no but it's sort

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.330
of getting there we got a new item in

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:58.620
the form of text euro an item I like but

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:01.350
I'm still sort of trying to figure out

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:04.590
it's like impromptu piercing shots and

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:06.120
then we got chocolate milk when when we

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.290
feel like Tek zeros not doing a good job

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:12.750
we just want to hit an enemy like

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:15.480
head-on we got bulgur tears and we got

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:17.100
99 you know hot bombs check it and see I

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.620
got a fever of 103

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:22.470
I'm Celsius that's terrible you wouldn't

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:26.040
go to a hospital you go to like you know

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:29.540
a refrigerator store aisle dude I like

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:33.630
that if you stick an enemy with a static

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:36.870
tear that is also a booger it's here

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:38.610
like the world is your oyster because it

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.750
keeps shooting the electricity all right

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:40.920
take this we haven't had to deal with

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:42.870
the devil in forever

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:46.380
take this that's lovely you want

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:47.730
piercing shots and then in here it

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.140
doesn't really matter we'll just grab

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:51.300
this get the heck out of here I don't

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:52.830
know the more I spend time on this run

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:56.130
the more I'm sort of like maybe this is

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:59.400
the one it would continue my streak of

00:18:56.130 --> 00:19:02.130
like always ending a nice agree role run

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:04.350
on a tech item which is kind of like a

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:06.960
joke but also happens every single time

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:09.180
I don't know that x0 is fine

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.490
I don't know that x0 is that good though

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:13.260
so I kind of feel like I'm not cheating

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:14.490
the system and of course you should know

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.110
by now if you're watching this and

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:19.020
you're going don't stop the reroll here

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:20.730
buddy I'm not obviously I have no

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:22.140
self-control when it comes to this I

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:24.600
will continue to use the rear

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:28.770
roll at nauseam until a breakfast us and

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:31.170
leaves us in a you know a hellish pit of

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:34.620
you know no damage no stats except for

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:37.770
you know maybe guppy base stats 12 HP

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:42.180
grade to start a run not so great to

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:44.460
finish your run oh it's a pretty solid

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:47.250
cracked dice honestly let's grab this -

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:48.720
Wheel of Fortune we're dangerously close

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:50.340
to getting our donation machine back to

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:54.900
nine hundred ninety nine cents you know

00:19:50.340 --> 00:20:01.290
the last time we had it at 999 was

00:19:54.900 --> 00:20:03.360
probably like 2015 I'm trying to think I

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:06.200
think it might be like we blew it up

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:08.460
once I don't think we ever got it back

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:10.380
to that level so we're actually

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:12.660
approaching it's been a long time coming

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.860
dude that was like costly major the

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.210
really constants I've been using the

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:20.610
donation machine like every time it's

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:22.650
available but let's go kind of a costly

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:26.730
mistake in terms of just the sheer time

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:27.450
invested dude this is like cool and very

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.820
strange

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:32.100
we still have technology zero and we're

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:33.390
firing we must have like quad shot and

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.100
triple shot or something like that

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:40.110
we definitely have quad shot that I can

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:43.470
see and we still have the electricity

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:46.620
coming out of it so that's very cool

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:47.970
but our damage is a lot worse honestly

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:50.970
our rate of fire is pretty good for

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:53.340
firing seven shots every time you press

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:56.580
the button and we can get a pretty sweet

00:20:53.340 --> 00:21:05.220
like convergent ball of electricity as

00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:07.460
well but is this enough novelty I don't

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:07.460
know

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:14.430
because we can fly that rooms a little

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:18.270
easier oh we gotta test this it's like

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:20.160
we're loveless and we asked to what

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:23.160
we're supposed to do with our chests you

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:24.240
got a test you chest Lovelace if you

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.870
can't stand the heat and get out the

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:30.630
wild wild west that's Jim West not a

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:32.460
cardiologist but an enthusiast I think

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:34.290
it's fair to say I'm going to try a

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:36.960
reroll just because like this is cool I

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:38.970
like the triangle electricity we get

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:41.910
here let's see what happens

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:46.200
still got electricity no but we do have

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:50.370
a much faster rate of fire and rubber

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:52.200
cement so this is pretty cool I would

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:53.730
say that we have not crossed the danger

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:56.490
threshold yet we haven't seen epic

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:59.550
foetus we haven't seen doctor fuse so I

00:21:56.490 --> 00:22:01.920
think we're still relatively safe to

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:04.080
re-roll here and this runs like this

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:07.140
particular one right here is good we run

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:12.180
like a quick like guided tour of of

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:14.100
issac synergies learning a little bit

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:16.950
about the the world I mean this is a

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:19.920
great run in all honesty Capricorn plus

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:23.610
2020 Reber cements fun and then

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:25.530
sometimes good sometimes bad as with

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:30.120
almost every item in the whole freaking

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:35.250
game obviously where are you where could

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:38.430
you be sitting on the floor Joey don't

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:39.930
pop up here no more I'd like to get my

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:43.830
devil deal

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:47.010
it could be brimstone that would make me

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:48.600
feel like I shouldn't have gone for the

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:49.920
first verse because then I just read I

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.790
really want to go like where could you

00:22:49.920 --> 00:23:01.200
be

00:22:50.790 --> 00:23:07.620
now let's reroll midboss track tractor

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:11.730
beam soymilk prognosis wafer lusty blood

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:13.020
lucky blood is an enormous damage

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:16.049
increase the more enemies we kill

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:18.819
certainly you know the range is bad

00:23:16.049 --> 00:23:22.379
and our damage starts by being pretty

00:23:18.819 --> 00:23:28.329
terrible but once your two enemies beep

00:23:22.379 --> 00:23:30.069
becomes like a freaking Gatling gun I'm

00:23:28.329 --> 00:23:31.809
still going to go for the reroll because

00:23:30.069 --> 00:23:33.669
we can do better and also this is an

00:23:31.809 --> 00:23:35.289
archetype we've had before but it's it's

00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:37.269
a fun one I wouldn't dispute that I

00:23:35.289 --> 00:23:38.769
don't care about any year I don't care

00:23:37.269 --> 00:23:41.619
about your garbage synergies at this

00:23:38.769 --> 00:23:44.819
point by the way for anyone who's ever

00:23:41.619 --> 00:23:51.069
disputed and you know this agreement is

00:23:44.819 --> 00:23:53.639
important just ask George Lucas or ask

00:23:51.069 --> 00:23:56.619
somebody who knows George Lucas but ah

00:23:53.639 --> 00:23:57.879
man marked at least we can make sweet

00:23:56.619 --> 00:23:59.289
spirals there might have even been more

00:23:57.879 --> 00:24:01.119
battery charges in there but I feel an

00:23:59.289 --> 00:24:02.889
obligation to give it a shot but for

00:24:01.119 --> 00:24:06.609
anybody who thinks you know I'm talking

00:24:02.889 --> 00:24:07.899
out of my butt when I say the d4 is one

00:24:06.609 --> 00:24:08.889
of the best items in the game or at

00:24:07.899 --> 00:24:10.419
least re-rolling your whole run

00:24:08.889 --> 00:24:12.879
consistently is like one of the

00:24:10.419 --> 00:24:15.190
strongest things you can do in the game

00:24:12.879 --> 00:24:17.199
this runs for you because like almost

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:19.839
every single run that we've had has been

00:24:17.199 --> 00:24:21.729
high-quality admittedly that if you're

00:24:19.839 --> 00:24:25.349
really thinking that says more about

00:24:21.729 --> 00:24:27.759
Judas's shadow than it does about the d4

00:24:25.349 --> 00:24:30.279
Judas the shadow can turn even pretty

00:24:27.759 --> 00:24:33.159
statistically underwhelming runs into

00:24:30.279 --> 00:24:37.419
Indonesian ones but you know the d4 is

00:24:33.159 --> 00:24:39.719
is doing fine as well just let me out of

00:24:37.419 --> 00:24:39.719
here please

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:46.780
this is doing quite a lot of damage but

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:49.040
I really just like I don't like marked I

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:52.070
don't want to use marked on a regular

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:56.060
basis even with conjoint so reroll the

00:24:52.070 --> 00:25:00.200
run here at Jacob's Ladder and the

00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:08.900
strangest of all technology lasers but

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:10.640
quite a lot of damage whatever so milk

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:12.650
like permanently nerfed our damage

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:14.450
because we shouldn't be it shouldn't be

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:22.700
plausible for us to be a three point six

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:27.620
for damage this makes me uncomfortable

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:29.150
like you ever people be like hey imagine

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:31.520
putting a toothpick under your toenail

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:33.860
and then kicking the wall as hard as you

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:36.860
can you know when people go it makes me

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:40.220
uncomfortable this is like that this

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:43.790
just watching this technology laser bend

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:45.170
around an anchor point and the guys out

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:48.290
there know what I'm talking about this

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:52.060
is not giving me the greatest sense of

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:54.290
like phantom limb syndrome Here I am I

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:57.080
would prefer to get rid of this run as

00:25:54.290 --> 00:26:00.080
soon as possible so that I may you know

00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:03.140
continue to feel that I have a normal

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:06.200
foul is confusing me on many different

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:08.330
levels here so we're going to reroll

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:10.700
this one this one is a whip this might

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:14.240
be the first one that is more likely to

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:20.320
result in a loss than a win but we got a

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:20.320
while until it comes an issue here

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:27.640
we have to reroll pretty badly a few

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:29.410
more times in a row I don't know what's

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:33.190
causing the been died of it okay there's

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:34.450
spun homing tears our tear effects don't

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:36.670
seem that good I think we have three

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:38.650
dollar bill maybe our tear effects don't

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:43.300
seem that good maybe it's just fire mine

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:45.280
but our stats are good but the actual

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:47.170
like tears themselves a little

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:49.240
underwhelming in terms of coolness like

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:50.890
they don't even shoot any electricity so

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:53.140
what am I supposed to believe that this

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:57.510
is like a good run where's my electrical

00:26:53.140 --> 00:27:00.460
tears we have good bombs at least maybe

00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:02.800
all my deal with the devil is gone all

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:05.440
right so we're actually like potentially

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:07.900
we've squandered this run but it's up to

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:09.520
us to prove that we did not so we were

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:14.530
24 minutes on the Cathedral that's

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:16.330
usually a very very good sign early

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:20.740
steps here and perthro is great for the

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:24.850
chest just try not to take damage

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:26.980
obviously and doesn't really matter what

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:29.710
trinket we have for now I'd say fire

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:33.180
mind causing problems but two more rooms

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:37.570
one more room is all it takes

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:42.430
get a reroll Seraphim and dude I'm

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:44.680
looking I'm liking you see a monster oh

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:47.890
I'm seeing tech point five some stats

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:50.920
upgrades holy mantle monstros lung and

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:52.680
I'm still somehow like disappointed how

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:55.900
is such a thing even possible

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:58.600
thanks for the stats regardless but this

00:27:55.900 --> 00:28:02.230
is just okay I was hoping for some some

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:04.320
bravado some brazen tear effects but no

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:08.800
such luck man

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:11.410
bombers be so will continue to go for

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:13.540
these fast rerolls and fat rerolls with

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:14.950
a ph we can kill things quickly but you

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:16.090
know if we were just out here to kill

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:19.240
things quickly we would've stuck with

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:22.120
like mom's knife run which i will on a

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:25.300
regular basis but not this time like we

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:26.620
got to go a little harder in the paint

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:29.500
is that a reference that the kids

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:32.080
understand what's hard for me to

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:33.070
reconcile is that I think that walk up

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.049
flock up flames

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:37.899
we go hard in the MFA

00:28:35.049 --> 00:28:39.190
paint is a contemporary reference but if

00:28:37.899 --> 00:28:40.629
that song came out when you were in

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:43.509
eighth grade you're like a high school

00:28:40.629 --> 00:28:46.210
senior now or maybe you've graduated so

00:28:43.509 --> 00:28:52.869
you know in my head 2013 is still like

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:55.029
last year I'm trying to think of a

00:28:52.869 --> 00:28:57.789
punchline to cap that off but I can't

00:28:55.029 --> 00:29:04.480
think of one hey are you guys excited

00:28:57.789 --> 00:29:06.519
for the Dark Knight Rises I mean it

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:15.609
could come out in 2013 you can't deny

00:29:06.519 --> 00:29:19.529
that there's no way age of Ultron could

00:29:15.609 --> 00:29:22.659
be worse than the first Avengers

00:29:19.529 --> 00:29:24.629
apparently I'm mark time with the

00:29:22.659 --> 00:29:28.779
passage of superhero movies but honestly

00:29:24.629 --> 00:29:35.769
there's worse ways to mark your time

00:29:28.779 --> 00:29:42.190
right there's a there's a new Marvel

00:29:35.769 --> 00:29:42.999
tentpole film like every summer I'm

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:45.460
trying to think

00:29:42.999 --> 00:29:47.289
oh yeah guardians of the galaxy just

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:50.230
came out this is a perthro I mean come

00:29:47.289 --> 00:29:53.259
on I've ever seen one then you pick up

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:55.869
the passive items of which there are

00:29:53.259 --> 00:29:58.350
zero and re-roll again it's got

00:29:55.869 --> 00:29:58.350
potential

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:12.040
and then the summer of 2015 was both the

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:17.050
age of Ultron they will Avengers 2 age

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:19.870
of Ultron and ant-man and then 2016 was

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:24.420
like Captain America Civil War

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:27.400
you can totally mark time that way and

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:29.740
then I'll mark I'll mark winters by star

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:32.680
wars films from that point on 26 - from

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:39.160
this point on 2016 was rogue one 2015

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:39.550
was the force awakens and then when I

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.770
die

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:43.090
apparently the Disney Corporation is

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:45.700
going to lose like one of its primary

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:48.340
customers yes they're all Disney

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:52.120
products okay oh no no the

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:53.560
self-fulfilling prophecy is too real you

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:57.790
can't do this to me there was some

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:59.380
poster get married yeah the infinity say

00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:02.880
save me spare me from there's nothing

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:05.470
I'd become seven damaged down for 0.17

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:06.850
speed-up that's what I call worth it we

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:09.070
in the business call that words the

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:12.310
self-fulfilling prophecy is I can't just

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:15.870
endlessly re-roll into tech X that's the

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:15.870
lazy man's game it's too easy

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:30.210
stick on some balls here you know what

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:31.530
it's pasta right I've recognized I just

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:33.690
said stick on some balls here with a

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:37.940
straight face but it wasn't my intention

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:41.400
to accidentally make a triple entendre

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:44.040
this may be a run where we never find

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:45.500
that ideal permutation of items that

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:48.000
we've been looking for and you know what

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:50.400
Thank You Isaac for teaching me a lesson

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.500
and it's not about the destination it's

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:55.230
about the journey if you're waiting for

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:56.880
that ideal situation in your life

00:31:55.230 --> 00:32:02.430
there's a good chance that situation

00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:04.580
will never present itself instead you

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:06.570
just got to grab life by the horns and

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:08.880
you know make the best of your

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:10.620
situations despite the changing

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:13.920
variables and parameters that may at

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:17.520
times we suboptimal if you don't like

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:21.120
which again why don't you change it if

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:23.700
your world is all screwed up rearrange

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:26.220
it a bit too good to go don't tell them

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:29.370
some rays of Rolla little run roll a

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:34.890
little run roll a little run hear me out

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:36.480
there see that's not bad anyway yeah we

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:38.580
never really fulfilled the promise and

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:40.200
that was my way of trying to tie some

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:42.450
overarching lesson on this run where

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.830
none previously existed so you know if

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:45.240
you're looking at that and going what

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:47.220
the heck is this guy talking about I

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:49.830
think you've got a great case to be

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:51.270
correct in that subject however you got

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:52.800
to admit you almost believed for a

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:54.420
second it's like we'd planned it to be

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.930
some sort of after-school special on my

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:56.930
so-called life

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:06.799
let's go all right we out there's no way

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:07.880
for us to be in so we're headed down

00:33:06.799 --> 00:33:10.130
thanks for watching hope you guys have

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:11.510

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:12.650
quick pace if you did click the like

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:13.700
