00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.440
hey everybody welcome back we're going

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.250
for win number ten and honestly they've

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.710
been easy breezy beautiful covergirl

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.469
you're gonna starve me hold up

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.850
you're gonna start me with an uncharged

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.130
even sole that's how we do things in

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:23.279
2017 I suppose they start you with an

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:27.599
item 200 items in the game start fully

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:31.610
charged even soul hmm can't give you a

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:35.790
freebie on that one NL sorry q CR WB w

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.820
9s damage is good rate of fires good

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:44.010
speed is fine

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:46.410
HP is bad so that's what this item does

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.300
HP is bad but as long as we don't lose

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.149
the spirit heart it's fine for now

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.820
give me battery charges so the thing

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.800
with even soul is that in spite of my

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.090
rage I'm still just a rat in a cage I

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.000
didn't think that was supposed to fully

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.239
charge it actually but I guess I was

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.510
just mistaken

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.040
we should probably pop this on a deal

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.260
with the devil because I think it gives

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.590
you items that are unique to the pool in

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.850
which you in which you use it so

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:20.159
assuming we don't get a spacebar item

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.990
that actually makes us want to pick it

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.150
up on this floor we'll probably just try

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.229
to pop even soul thoughts arrive like

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.759
butterflies on the first floor deal with

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.700
the devil and then we could actually get

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.890
deal with the devil items without having

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.380
precedent and without spending HP so

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.130
it's kind of a double-edged sword or two

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.740
birds with one stone

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.369
yeah kill two birds with a double-edged

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:49.290
sword that's what I always said and then

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:52.649
so the basic idea is that we could get

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.750
angel items while also how's this it

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.409
spends a coin but then if you kill them

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.280
well they're coined up you get the you

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.460
get more coins it turns one coin into

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.829
three coins sometimes it's in the it's

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.829
strange new but strange

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.770
like that one bums me out because I

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.940
spent the coin but I didn't get the coin

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.860
back even though you got cleaned I'm not

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.860
going to sweat it too much basically as

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.090
long as we're alive by the time we get

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.310
to our second floor deal with the devil

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.520
I think we got a great chance at success

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.900
I'm going to go to our shop honestly

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.210
with the stats that we have there's no

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.960
reason for me to have taken dumb damage

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:40.830
that's 100% sincere and genuine I just

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.780
want the coin no there's no reason for

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.390
us to have to have taken so much damage

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.010
on this floor it's just careless I don't

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.170
want to say silly because that implies

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.810
that it's not you know potentially going

00:02:49.170 --> 00:03:04.470
to ruin our run here but it is uh it is

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:09.270
careless jeez okay well this will go for

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:12.150
the card ancient recall it's three cards

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.100
right so we adjust this which gave me

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.670
half a spirit heart I feel very very

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.670
good about that

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.690
chariot card judgment throw down the

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.340
judgment it's a regular old judgment

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.740
meet the new judgment same as the old

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.830
judgment so I think I'm going to buy

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:37.530
this bomb and I'm going to blow up the

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:40.170
judgment and the reroll machine yeah

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.660
okay so hear me out here now I think

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.770
we're gonna we're going to take dim bulb

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.360
and then we're going to use Eden's soul

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.770
we got pay to play which is garbage but

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.380
allows me to buy a spear at heart and

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.110
little baggie which is actually actively

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.030
too terrible I'd said Jess I don't know

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.709
why I can't say that words okay I

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.060
deviated from my original plan to get

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.550
deal with the devil items and it did not

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.070
work out fantastically but I did get

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.959
spirit hearts out of that so I'm not

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:11.250
going to say like we won in the end

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:14.100
because we really didn't these tears

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:18.510
like sometimes explode because if we get

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:20.100
coin tears there goes my last coin if we

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.810
had coin tears that exploded I'd be

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.160
trying to shoot them into tinted rock

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.630
but

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.550
I guess they only explode in some

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.220
circumstances or something either way

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.950
the situation is actually like

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.970
completely okay it's just a bit of a

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.860
whiff on the use of Eden's soul for sure

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.140
but it might have allowed us to live so

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.240
you know time will tell on that one now

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.630
we need a space bar item and it's okay

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.940
what's a bad one the damage up is fine

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.220
not necessarily 10 out of 10 but it's

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.670
kind of what we needed

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.290
it's just something decent full health

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.210
obviously does nothing for us like as

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.520
well here but it's okay we actually have

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.830
like everything is fine on this run I

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.390
know that fine is a is a four-letter

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.090
word you know people you're fine and

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:08.330
they go what's wrong but no like this it

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.730
fits the dictionary definition nothing

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.460
is stand out right now evens even soul

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:16.850
did my tongue there even soul would

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.350
stand out and we squandered it for short

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:23.180
term survival which I'm actually

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:25.580
completely okay with but it's not a

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.200
stellar run as of yet and it has a

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.970
little bit less potential to be stellar

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.470
because we got rid of the stellar engine

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.700
but we can still make this cool still

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:44.120
make this work no doubt just give me a

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:45.530
bomb heist squandering of the situation

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.210
there now we've lost all our spirit ours

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.870
I'm a little rusty for some reason I

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.370
don't know why I've been playing

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:55.310
careless here just hold it together now

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.800
what we're looking for now we're looking

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.630
for necessarily but still interesting

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.390
okay three dollar bill this is an

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:07.090
interesting one three dollar bill could

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:11.240
kill us or it could give us life and

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:14.060
guppies head is a wonderful dim bulb in

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:17.780
a blur so obviously I would like to get

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.940
it okay so it's a huge stats up almost

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.580
all the time then we just want enough

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.990
money to make our shop pay out for us we

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:28.400
only need a penny to get into it because

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:30.260
of the because of pay to play but to be

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.360
honest with you I probably deserve to be

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.720
dead on this run

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:42.169
and feel free fortunate that we haven't

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:44.830
really been punished now we don't want

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:47.750
that I mean obviously we don't want that

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:50.270
instead we find ourselves on one HP

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:54.340
admittedly but otherwise in like a real

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:58.129
good spot so just hoping to be able to

00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:01.460
guide this one towards the goalpost if

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:03.469
we find the shop which we just have pay

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.229
a penny to get in biosphere at heart

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:07.729
this time radical thought don't just

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:11.360
throw it away for no reason

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:13.699
okay they're probably not going to get a

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.159
spirit art here is it it's quite clear

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:20.409
but grab for luck upgrades at least I

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:22.969
don't know do you go for the pill no in

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:25.159
fest it's fine but now we're looking for

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:27.289
there is like Air America there's a

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:29.750
tinted rock there is a tinted rock back

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:31.340
here yeah we can also maybe use it there

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.870
to get more consumables than we spend

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.029
but just watch out for spikes here

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:38.690
that's the dangerous part this should be

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:40.610
great to Spirit arts and a trinket that

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:43.580
we can't use but hey I'm happy to have

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:46.520
it nonetheless this now again we're

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:50.150
living proof that like the world is not

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:52.430
fair I'm playing pretty poorly and being

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:54.589
rewarded for it but it does happen the

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.270
other way sometimes as often I don't

00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:58.250
know but sometimes it does happen the

00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:02.449
other way just try to take some solace

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:05.240
in that fact at least okay now the only

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:07.339
thing that could make public opinion

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.379
turn more about this run in Isaac right

00:08:07.339 --> 00:08:11.690
now is if I were to get like a full

00:08:09.379 --> 00:08:14.150
guppy transformation right now so let's

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:16.339
make that happen just to fulfill you

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:19.610
know the evil that we mean to become

00:08:16.339 --> 00:08:22.610
dark bum instead which is also very very

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:23.930
good so we should be completely fine now

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:27.289
which is good because we can get

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:28.699
involved in some Zane what kind of Zane

00:08:27.289 --> 00:08:30.500
what do we want to talk about our what's

00:08:28.699 --> 00:08:33.469
in the news days I hear this one did you

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:35.120
hear this one unit oh but gets supposed

00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:36.500
to be Jay Leno would you hear this one

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.079
on the news the other day people even

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.890
though it's me Jay Leno from the second

00:08:39.079 --> 00:08:42.260
world war

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:44.209
extry extry battle on Passchendaele

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.080
that's the first world war and also a

00:08:44.209 --> 00:08:47.690
voice there

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:53.630
it's a great deal a great Passchendaele

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:58.100
not funny no it's probably probably

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:59.420
funny if you did it properly we're past

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.220
the point where you can at least crack a

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:03.170
joke about the First World War right

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:05.120
it's been over a hundred years the

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:07.460
moratorium is over I'm not saying the

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:10.180
first world war is funny if anything you

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:13.400
know I think it's under appreciated or

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:17.140
under people are ignorant about it

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:20.390
despite the fact that it might have like

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:24.980
shaped the present world more than any

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:26.240
other war in in recent history I know

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.830
you're gonna say what about World War

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.500
two oh thanks for inviting me I forgot

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:34.100
about that one no you know the first

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:38.450
world war was it set the tone of the

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:40.280
20th century you know United States the

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.630
United States you know you saw the movie

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.640
the United States about the first world

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:47.480
war well the United States emerged as a

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:49.040
as a world power that's been obviously a

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:52.750
force to be reckoned with on a global

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:56.240
scale ever since and I don't know other

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:58.670
consequences excuse me after class if

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.980
you ever pay an attention mister mister

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.840
eternal wake up mr. West

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:06.290
now I don't know where I'm going with

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:09.050
this one it's it's an irrelevant bit

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:11.980
anyway we're cranking on spirit hearts

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:14.870
here so we're safe to go if I could just

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:17.210
get you to fudge off for a flippin

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:21.370
second dude I hate when these enemies

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:21.370
deflect bullets it's unfair and

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:30.890
unacceptable we're really running low on

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:33.380
bombs on this run I also a little

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:35.210
confused about like that it's very nice

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.710
thank you a little confused about the

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:40.400
financial situation that we find

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:43.220
ourselves in like I can't tell yet I I

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:47.990
can guess but I can't tell yet whether

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:49.280
the coin that we got is a net gain or

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:52.490
loss of money

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:57.310
I think it's intended to be a net gain

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:57.310
without a doubt I just don't know if

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:05.770
if it has been so far because we're

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:08.920
sometimes creating coins but quite often

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:12.400
it seems it in fact it seems almost as

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:13.960
often we're just losing coins to the

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.590
ether and never having a chance to get

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.660
them back

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:20.250
we should probably buy a seven cent

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:20.250
mom's purse that's a pretty good deal

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:27.430
yeah it's run is kind of running away

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.230
with it right now

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:30.970
we lose money every time they get hit or

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.860
something I'm not totally sure

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:37.600
BOGO bombs is the other item so we just

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:40.270
don't really care and we don't want the

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.190
9-volt either because dim bulb is

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:46.300
actually substantially better in this

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:47.620
state I was like why are stats changing

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.840
room to room I'll tell you 100 percent

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.610
three dollar bill should be like the

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.170
disclaimer whenever your stats change is

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:55.480
like three dollar bill may make these

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.630
look unpredictable see that's a coin

00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:01.920
lost to the ether for no benefit their

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:05.770
strange item not bad not bad too strange

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:07.450
as we head down here I'm revealing the

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.370
size of the backlog I think at this

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:11.050
point which a lot of people seem to

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.370
think is like some kind of cardinal sin

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:15.940
they're like we're gonna dance this guy

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:17.350
works hard in advance if the backlog is

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.400
not always a hundred percent of a good

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:22.090
thing you know it's good that timely

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:24.070
commentary but I mean it's also good to

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:26.440
respond to feedback but I think of all

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:28.660
the series Isaac is in the place where

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.370
the backlog makes the most sense people

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.470
value the consistency of the items of

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.970
episodes in at this point whatever

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:37.060
there's less to learn in the game how

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:40.060
much is it going to improve my play you

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:42.280
know 1% maybe there's still some things

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:44.800
to learn I'm not saying I'm infallible

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.600
here but you know it's not like I'm

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.830
going to I'm going to Issac class and

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.990
I'm having epiphanies every day but

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:51.970
anyway I'm dating the episode some

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:55.810
extent but III finish yesterday or two

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:59.939
days ago we did our best of e3 show at

00:12:55.810 --> 00:13:02.039
roundtable the podcast that I'm on today

00:12:59.939 --> 00:13:04.589
it was a fun show thinking back to all

00:13:02.039 --> 00:13:06.119
the stuff that it was announced or at

00:13:04.589 --> 00:13:09.209
least that they showed footage of is

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:10.409
gonna come out this year there's also I

00:13:09.209 --> 00:13:13.109
can't believe I didn't get hit there

00:13:10.409 --> 00:13:14.549
it's nice to remind myself of like some

00:13:13.109 --> 00:13:16.109
of the stuff that I saw that I'm excited

00:13:14.549 --> 00:13:18.720
for like we were doing the game of the

00:13:16.109 --> 00:13:20.039
show stuff I was like well I don't know

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.599
if anything they're really interested in

00:13:20.039 --> 00:13:23.189
me that much and then I was like wait a

00:13:21.599 --> 00:13:26.879
minute they announced a monster hunter

00:13:23.189 --> 00:13:29.639
for PC Overlord and then also you got

00:13:26.879 --> 00:13:34.529
something for me - spiders also do it

00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:37.529
I'm so stoked genuinely I am I don't

00:13:34.529 --> 00:13:39.689
feel hype and I'm not saying this to be

00:13:37.529 --> 00:13:42.089
like oh I'm a highly evolved being

00:13:39.689 --> 00:13:44.669
people were roasting me during the

00:13:42.089 --> 00:13:46.019
podcast in chat but you know I would

00:13:44.669 --> 00:13:47.129
like I don't know I don't think that

00:13:46.019 --> 00:13:48.659
game looks that good it's just a

00:13:47.129 --> 00:13:50.129
vertical slice it's not necessarily

00:13:48.659 --> 00:13:51.629
representative of the quality of the

00:13:50.129 --> 00:13:53.189
game blah blah blah I get that it's a

00:13:51.629 --> 00:13:56.279
show that people watch to get excited

00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:57.599
but like everything I saw I was like

00:13:56.279 --> 00:13:58.889
this is a trailer this is a trailer this

00:13:57.599 --> 00:14:01.889
is a trailer like I don't I don't get

00:13:58.889 --> 00:14:04.470
that excited for trailers for videogames

00:14:01.889 --> 00:14:06.599
at least because they can be misleading

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:08.009
they're not always and if you want to

00:14:06.599 --> 00:14:09.509
get excited don't let me rain on your

00:14:08.009 --> 00:14:11.009
parade but I'm like this I want to see

00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:14.039
how it is when it comes out which of

00:14:11.009 --> 00:14:16.379
course everybody does but but yeah dude

00:14:14.039 --> 00:14:20.220
I forgot first off monster honor on PC

00:14:16.379 --> 00:14:22.019
please be good I will play the only

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:24.269
thing stopping me from spending like a

00:14:22.019 --> 00:14:27.329
hundred hours in every Monster Hunter is

00:14:24.269 --> 00:14:31.079
that I don't like holding the 3ds that

00:14:27.329 --> 00:14:33.329
long I should have taken the HP in here

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:38.399
with you what are you trying to pull we

00:14:33.329 --> 00:14:43.579
have we have one H we have two HP now so

00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:45.539
I'm going to give you three of these and

00:14:43.579 --> 00:14:47.609
then you're going to give me that and

00:14:45.539 --> 00:14:48.659
I'm going to full help get the coin

00:14:47.609 --> 00:14:50.939
person I'm just going to take this

00:14:48.659 --> 00:14:53.339
because I don't want you to give me a

00:14:50.939 --> 00:14:57.299
tell appeals it's not that I think the

00:14:53.339 --> 00:14:58.979
3ds is a bad system far from it got a

00:14:57.299 --> 00:15:01.109
lot of exploring left to do here

00:14:58.979 --> 00:15:02.399
I think the 3ds is a great system with a

00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:04.109
good library I just find it

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:06.509
uncomfortable to hold in my hands I am

00:15:04.109 --> 00:15:08.549
NOT anti Nintendo at least not as much

00:15:06.509 --> 00:15:10.799
as I used to be I'm very excited about

00:15:08.549 --> 00:15:11.640
the upcoming switch lineup don't slander

00:15:10.799 --> 00:15:14.250
me okay

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:17.310
but yeah a monster hunter I can play

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:20.040
sitting in my chair or you know on ps4

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:21.750
Xbox one on the couch looking at a

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:25.410
television instead of a little tiny

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:28.950
screen very positive in my opinion what

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:30.270
do you take here like whoever wins we

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:31.680
lose I'm getting out of this floor we

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:36.750
don't have the money anyway to make the

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:39.060
to make our shop work for us but the big

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:41.010
thing for me is like shadow war the

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:43.260
sequel to shadow of Mordor comes out in

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:45.270
like three months

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:47.820
I think comes out in September that game

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:50.160
looks mad silly which is the perfect

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:52.530
tone for them to have in a game where

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:55.590
you've got orcs showing up like or you

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:58.620
thought always dead didn't ya gonna have

00:15:55.590 --> 00:16:00.840
to try harder than that hell sent me

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:05.430
back cuz always undercooked

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:10.200
you know like I'm so in for that game I

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:12.150
hooked like story-wise shadow of Mordor

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.990
in my bed look I'm not a super fan of

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:17.160
Lord of the Rings

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:20.370
I enjoyed the films I did read all three

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:22.440
of the main series books when I was in

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:24.330
middle school but I'm not like a turbo

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:26.280
fan I'm the good guy who bought The

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.750
Silmarillion and God like 10 seconds in

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:29.520
and I was like Jarrod's holding this is

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:33.750
just the old testament man you're

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:36.450
killing me so I again Noah don't let me

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:39.090
rain on your parade there but that the

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:42.180
game itself was really fun the story I

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:44.490
was like as a little it's a little Sammy

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:48.780
but the game itself I was like this it

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:51.150
was my number two game of 2014 what was

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:54.050
my number one game I don't remember to

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:54.050
be honest with you

00:16:55.170 --> 00:17:04.260
have to go back and take a look anyway

00:17:00.529 --> 00:17:06.569
2014 yeah that was that was a no 14 jam

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:11.819
yesterday that's not how you say that

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:14.640
number anyway yeah so III is over it was

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:15.780
I wasn't there but it was it was fun to

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:18.870
be a part of it from home I honestly

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:22.020
think that's the ideal way to experience

00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:24.030
a convention like that don't get me

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:26.339
wrong we went to e3 last year and I had

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:28.980
a great time I liked being there and it

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:30.990
felt like I was part of the industry but

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:33.240
like if you've never been to a

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:35.460
convention I think that there's like a

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:38.549
little bit of like group psychosis that

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:39.990
goes on that's like you have the goal to

00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:43.260
this could all you have a bit of hacks

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:46.350
masks all relaxed and for some people I

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:47.610
think that is true I think it's like not

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:49.799
necessarily a life-changing experience

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:54.330
but a whole heck of a lot of fun and it

00:17:49.799 --> 00:17:57.630
is it is but like at the same time being

00:17:54.330 --> 00:18:00.330
at home watching the e3 conferences like

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:02.730
in a comfortable spot with a cup of

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:04.980
coffee and then like being able to go

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:07.110
like I look like garbage you know and

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:09.419
not to have to answer to anybody because

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.679
I'm being a jerk it was really nice and

00:18:09.419 --> 00:18:12.690
then to be like yeah you know I don't

00:18:10.679 --> 00:18:15.419
really want to see that conference

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:19.320
tomorrow I'll catch the vaad and just

00:18:15.419 --> 00:18:22.110
sleep in and then you know do do some

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:25.910
streams instead that's that's a superior

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:25.910
way to experience the convention for me

00:18:28.509 --> 00:18:32.409
PACS is like a little different tax is

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:34.539
about being out there you know about

00:18:32.409 --> 00:18:36.429
seeing stuff that you've never heard of

00:18:34.539 --> 00:18:38.049
before seeing how it's progressing and

00:18:36.429 --> 00:18:41.320
stuff like that III though where they're

00:18:38.049 --> 00:18:44.889
like here's the trailer for Peggy 18

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:47.169
know what's it gonna be you know you

00:18:44.889 --> 00:18:47.710
just mainline that stuff at home and be

00:18:47.169 --> 00:18:55.960
fine

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:57.580
I think at least I don't know if we're

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.739
gonna make boss rush it's a weird run

00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:02.080
because it's like really good that's so

00:18:59.739 --> 00:19:05.619
helpful it's really good but it's not

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:08.070
quite like very yet that might take it

00:19:05.619 --> 00:19:10.299
there I mean it's still great here

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:12.419
what's weird is that whenever I see dark

00:19:10.299 --> 00:19:15.429
Prince's crown I'm like I gotta take it

00:19:12.419 --> 00:19:17.590
my brain I know exactly what it is I'm

00:19:15.429 --> 00:19:21.549
not confused about it if that my brain

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:23.919
is wired from previous Isaac play to

00:19:21.549 --> 00:19:26.200
always want a to heart items to always

00:19:23.919 --> 00:19:30.039
because I think it's been a good

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:32.230
shorthand until dark princes ground very

00:19:30.039 --> 00:19:33.369
rarely there will be a too hard item you

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:35.739
don't want I think the only other

00:19:33.369 --> 00:19:39.369
situation that I can think of right now

00:19:35.739 --> 00:19:40.779
is when you have the ability to fly and

00:19:39.369 --> 00:19:42.940
then they try to give you like lord of

00:19:40.779 --> 00:19:45.730
the pit or spirit of the night when you

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:47.350
have it already so my brain is taking

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:50.830
these short hands and I got to be like

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:54.159
no brain relax it's dark Prince's crown

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:56.489
I don't know what I'm doing in the

00:19:54.159 --> 00:19:59.470
Murray voice from plot of the Conchords

00:19:56.489 --> 00:20:02.799
Britt it's just the tiers upgrade it's

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:03.869
not worth to hard spread it's not even a

00:20:02.799 --> 00:20:06.759
good accent

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:12.429
it's almost righteous to Britt but it

00:20:06.759 --> 00:20:14.499
can't stop now again it's you know you

00:20:12.429 --> 00:20:16.389
in Europe you have the the Schengen

00:20:14.499 --> 00:20:18.669
Agreement right where it's like no

00:20:16.389 --> 00:20:21.100
matter where you're from no matter what

00:20:18.669 --> 00:20:22.690
you did and no matter who you are as

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:25.210
long as you love me you can travel you

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:26.710
know open borders in Europe basically we

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:28.869
have the same thing but it's it's a

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:31.029
nested agreement within that called the

00:20:28.869 --> 00:20:33.279
Commonwealth an agreement which means

00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:35.049
that any Commonwealth countries can do

00:20:33.279 --> 00:20:36.279
accents of any other Commonwealth

00:20:35.049 --> 00:20:38.130
countries without it being racist

00:20:36.279 --> 00:20:40.080
because we're all cool and

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:44.280
we're all cool with one another you can

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:47.250
make fun of Canada I've done this bit

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:49.470
before but there's this people think

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:53.220
they're being so freakin hilarious

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:54.809
Daniel Radcliffe has this sound bite and

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.429
I'll grudge him because you know he's

00:20:54.809 --> 00:20:58.020
doing 12 interviews a day for the

00:20:56.429 --> 00:21:00.270
release of Harry Potter 200 or something

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:03.380
right but if the sound buddies like if

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:07.200
you really want to aggravate a Canadian

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:10.409
when they talk about hockey say do you

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:13.020
mean ice hockey it's like actually the

00:21:10.409 --> 00:21:14.580
only aggravating thing is that you've

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:17.390
been going through life thinking you're

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:20.450
some kind of like the Joker esque

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:23.039
supervillain for your social engineering

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:25.289
because you say that to any Canadian

00:21:23.039 --> 00:21:27.120
they'd be like yeah ice hockey so anyway

00:21:25.289 --> 00:21:28.860
I would saw Gretzky in his final game in

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:31.020
Madison Square Garden day and it was you

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:33.570
know oh I've got him real good

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:36.390
I've undermined his confidence in his

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:40.640
national identity also Daniel Radcliffe

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:45.659
is an Australian stereotype now

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:46.409
apparently anyway it's not that

00:21:45.659 --> 00:21:48.659
offensive

00:21:46.409 --> 00:21:50.070
I ended this bit exactly the same way

00:21:48.659 --> 00:21:51.900
last time I guarantee it if you actually

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:53.570
want to aggravate a Canadian tell them

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:55.770
the United States won the war of 1812

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:58.710
but it would be better if you just

00:21:55.770 --> 00:22:00.299
hinted at it if you would like hey don't

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:01.919
get too riled up there I'll kick your

00:22:00.299 --> 00:22:04.200
ass like we did in the war of 1812 huh

00:22:01.919 --> 00:22:05.789
buddy you know they will actually that

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.049
use that one sparingly because they will

00:22:05.789 --> 00:22:09.210
lose their minds I would lose my mind

00:22:07.049 --> 00:22:11.789
it's a great part of the national

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:13.320
identity in Canada that Canada beat the

00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:15.030
United States the only time we've ever

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.010
had direct conflict even though Canada

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:20.730
was not a country at the time it was

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:23.610
Britain versus the US and it was a tie

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:25.770
but and I say it hurts me to say it

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:27.600
because it again it's part of the

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:31.230
Canadian national identity we miss bond

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:35.520
stretch by like eight seconds oh well

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:37.409
that's that's how you rile up but let's

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.990
how you rile up a Canadian how do you

00:22:37.409 --> 00:22:41.190
rile up an American oh jesus lamb and

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:42.870
let me count the ways am i right

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:47.309
Commonwealth brethren but I think the

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:49.890
the obvious one and it's a lie is to

00:22:47.309 --> 00:22:50.370
suggest that like America's backwards

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:54.870
when it comes

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:58.260
the food hey listen buddy you can insult

00:22:54.870 --> 00:23:02.180
our defense budget and our politics and

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:07.010
our people the way we live our lives our

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:10.350
economy our attitudes but do not insult

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:12.270
American cuisine and it's true first off

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:15.240
anybody insulting any of that is being

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:16.740
needlessly generalistic every country's

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:18.000
got its problems it's not to say that

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.950
you know it's not I'm not drawing a

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.740
false equivalency necessarily I'm just

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:24.300
you know people find one thing to

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:27.150
criticize and they go you know X is

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:28.800
stupid because of why you're like see me

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:32.360
after class that's an F you just got an

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.360
F on your essay that's not good enough

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:37.020
actually every country has its problems

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:40.770
a plus congratulations your

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:42.809
valedictorian you've nailed it now but

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:45.720
with I always I hate seeing people rag

00:23:42.809 --> 00:23:48.420
on America for food man Josh's dad on

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:51.750
Twitter just posted a picture literally

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:53.280
earlier today of some American tax max

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:56.520
that he's getting and I was like that's

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:58.860
delicious America you knock it out of

00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:02.940
the park with cuisine is it cuisine that

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:05.460
is stolen from other countries nah son

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:07.350
you nodded your head and I thanked you

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:09.960
out its cuisine that was brought over

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:16.950
from other countries because of

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:18.150
America's welcoming spirit pizza wait a

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:19.710
minute Pizza might actually be an

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:22.440
Italian invention is that the one where

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:25.440
I got people really mad at me once

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:26.370
because I was like basil seems like an

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.960
American invention

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:29.640
I got like people that were like you've

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:32.580
never said anything more ignorant than

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:35.670
this I thought pizza was like in Italy

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:37.980
they had like a margarita flatbread and

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:39.720
then somebody from Italy you know came

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:42.000
through Ellis Island and opened up their

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:44.070
own flatbread shop and then like a guy

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.960
named pizza came in and was like you

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:48.470
should put some pepperoni on this and

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:51.120
then he's like it gives me a great idea

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:54.270
that one might be a little bit offensive

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:56.220
but I know Rob so it's okay that doesn't

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:57.059
make it okay but I'm going to deflect

00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:00.900
and move on

00:24:57.059 --> 00:25:02.460
much like the great one apparently it's

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:04.070
actually just a straight-up Italian

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:06.470
invention it's one of those things where

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:08.960
like you think if you got asked we're in

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:11.120
this country pizza was invented

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:13.580
you'd be like it can't be what is Italy

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:15.710
it's too easy it's obviously a trick

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.670
question and you end up making yourself

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:19.160
look like an idiot because you

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:22.760
overthought it but it is Italy

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:26.750
apparently like America knocks it out of

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:27.320
the park for food food that's terrible

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:30.550
for you

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:34.120
sure but also food that's good for you

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:36.440
great salads you know raw fish

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:38.720
Americanized sushi and people get real

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:41.390
snobby about sushi too it sounds like

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:43.220
I'm like I've scripted this whole bit

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:46.280
and okay now we flow into the sushi part

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:48.620
of the bit no but people were ragging on

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:50.870
Americanized sushi I guarantee you

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:52.640
straight up I probably eat more sushi

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:54.980
than like 98% of the people watching

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:56.990
this video if you're like oh I don't

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:58.700
think so sir I eat sushi once a month

00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:03.410
we're like a once a week family here

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:05.590
maybe maybe six times a month sometimes

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:09.200
less sometimes a little bit more and

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:12.110
I've had like high-caliber sushi in

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:14.810
Japan and then Coover has some of the

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:16.040
best like cheap sushi on planet earth as

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:16.820
far as I'm concerned at least for the

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.680
places I've been

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:20.840
so like I'm speaking from a place of

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.400
experience look ever since it started

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.440
doing this YouTube thing full-time I'd

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:27.920
probably put on like 25 pounds you're

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:32.260
arguing with a dude who loves to sit any

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:35.510
in this situation where are you

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:37.280
Christmas why can't I find you I'm the

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:39.440
organized sushi has got it going on I

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:43.640
can get down with the old jiro Dreams of

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:45.500
Sushi oh wee he spent 1200 years of his

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:47.750
lifetime learning how to slice this

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:49.460
little piece of tuna belly off and then

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:51.380
oh its melt in your mouth delectable I

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:53.960
can get down with that I'm a snob then

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:55.670
at the same time sometimes I'm just like

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:59.420
hey could you put like a whole

00:26:55.670 --> 00:27:01.220
deep-fried like chicken katsu on that

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:03.170
roll and then slather it in barbecue

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:09.380
sauce and they're like I have you

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:11.570
covered no problem anyway these episodes

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:13.550
they get they get nationalistic it

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:16.020
becomes a problem it can become a

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:19.320
problem I should oh yeah good one

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:22.500
turn to potentially have these in

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:23.670
teleport card into uh into a single

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.929
spirit heart we couldn't even pick up

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:30.780
and the spirit art was the better

00:27:24.929 --> 00:27:31.920
version of the payout every country's

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:35.880
got strengths every country got

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:37.860
weaknesses it's not my easy way out it's

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:40.170
actually my way of being like I can't

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:41.820
afford to have an opinion on every

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:43.140
country on earth because I haven't lived

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:45.900
in every country on earth

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:48.510
I've lived in Canada for 27 years of my

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:50.460
life I lived in South Korea for one year

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:52.170
of my life I have opinions on South

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:56.429
Korea both positive and negative but

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:58.140
even those opinions come from like a

00:27:56.429 --> 00:28:00.240
place of ignorance because I live my

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:02.160
whole life and sorry my whole life there

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:06.809
at least in this bubble of being like I

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:08.970
don't belong here like I I'm an outsider

00:28:06.809 --> 00:28:11.730
you might be like well you could

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:13.890
assimilate yeah but like kids on the

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:16.170
three stop speaking Korean when they see

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:18.450
you and they go hello and you go okay so

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:23.150
that's how I know that this is in my

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:25.530
country you get over it quick I guess I

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:28.140
think I told this story once before but

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:30.840
it's good enough to tell again and this

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:32.520
only happened one time I'm not

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:36.300
suggesting it's an unfriendly place to

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:39.240
live but one time in in South Korea my

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:42.059
friend and I were on that means relevant

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.800
to the story he's white we were on the

00:28:42.059 --> 00:28:44.730
subway

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:48.150
we're the only white people on the

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:50.670
subway and then this we were just

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:52.380
talking not particularly loudly because

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:54.870
we knew the cultural mores just you know

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:56.820
quietly having a conversation when we

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:58.770
see a well-dressed young Korean

00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:01.200
gentleman go to get off the subway and

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:03.330
you know it's approaching his station

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.800
and he is looking at us he's got like a

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:05.910
big smile on his face and I'm like I

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.550
don't know this guy's deal is where he

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:09.690
seems friendly and that's okay with me

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:13.830
you know you get in the situation

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:15.720
sometimes people I've had straight up in

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:19.920
bed by the time it's out three I'd had

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:21.450
like 67 year old guys come up to me and

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.880
then just like salute because they

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:26.280
thought I was American I guess and they

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:29.160
were showing respect for American

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:29.460
involvement in the Korean War not the

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.140
can

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:32.309
was involved anyway but I'm assuming you

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:34.500
know they don't look at me and go oh

00:29:32.309 --> 00:29:36.390
that guy's Canadian anyway so I've had

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:38.460
all sorts of weird interactions at this

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:41.370
point that that's actually heartfelt but

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:42.419
you get the idea so on Ramona this guy's

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:44.610
going to open up with a conversation

00:29:42.419 --> 00:29:46.020
about you know but one time he went to

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:47.820
Toronto or something like that how you

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:51.240
how do you feel about the Maple Leafs

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:53.789
you know instead when the doors open he

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:56.220
he looks at us and he flips us two

00:29:53.789 --> 00:29:59.880
middle fingers and he says why are you

00:29:56.220 --> 00:30:04.799
hiding white and then the next word is

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:06.929
an anti-gay slur and then we just sort

00:30:04.799 --> 00:30:09.350
of looked at him and we're like I'm not

00:30:06.929 --> 00:30:11.520
gonna fight hush with $0.04 that's sad

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:13.350
we just sort of looked at each other

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:16.620
like it was I'm pretty sure he's talking

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:19.649
to us you know he did use the W word and

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:22.559
then we're just like sorry and he goes

00:30:19.649 --> 00:30:25.470
why are you hiding white you know you

00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:27.809
know and then we just didn't really

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:33.149
respond because I'm not about to get in

00:30:27.809 --> 00:30:35.100
a fistfight with this homophobe on the

00:30:33.149 --> 00:30:38.010
you know foreign subway that's going to

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:41.909
look bad optics wise especially when he

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:43.789
kicks my hat but uh then the doors

00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:47.010
closed and he was just like laughing

00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:48.840
maniacally like like he got us and I

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:53.360
mean in a way I guess he sort of did

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:57.779
although I mean I hope he's dead and

00:30:53.360 --> 00:31:01.230
I'll just mean just because he was a

00:30:57.779 --> 00:31:03.179
terrible racist homophobe in public

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:05.010
doesn't mean you should wish he was dead

00:31:03.179 --> 00:31:07.230
oh yeah you're the you're the bigger man

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:11.610
in this situation for sure no I wish I

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:15.149
dude that way I hope he died okay anyway

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:16.860
the point is that only happened once but

00:31:15.149 --> 00:31:19.350
it's a funny story I think of that story

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:21.000
of time to time we just sat on the on

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:23.970
the train we had like three more stops

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.610
to go it's apt all the energy out of the

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:28.620
rest of our day and I don't blame them

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:30.419
because this has happened on the

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:32.610
Vancouver transit on occasion where like

00:31:30.419 --> 00:31:34.620
you know someone who's lost their minds

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:37.460
will single somebody out and be like you

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:39.510
know just just like bully them basically

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:41.399
verbally but you're like yeah but

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:42.119
they're not all there so like it's just

00:31:41.399 --> 00:31:45.199
on car

00:31:42.119 --> 00:31:47.239
armless they're just really rude and

00:31:45.199 --> 00:31:49.349
everybody just sits there but definitely

00:31:47.239 --> 00:31:50.969
we were just sitting there we're like

00:31:49.349 --> 00:31:53.729
just looking at each other like is

00:31:50.969 --> 00:31:55.799
anybody going to say anything I don't

00:31:53.729 --> 00:31:58.919
expect them to apologize for this dude

00:31:55.799 --> 00:31:59.849
it's not like they said it but like you

00:31:58.919 --> 00:32:02.569
know it's kind of an uncomfortable

00:31:59.849 --> 00:32:06.059
situation never looks just looking at us

00:32:02.569 --> 00:32:10.829
I think back on that moment time to time

00:32:06.059 --> 00:32:13.199
as my first the dawn of my manhood is

00:32:10.829 --> 00:32:15.929
also when I realized I was gay at first

00:32:13.199 --> 00:32:17.399
I was like this guy's way wrong and I

00:32:15.929 --> 00:32:21.299
looked at my friend and I was like oh

00:32:17.399 --> 00:32:26.299
come on you just pull your pants huh no

00:32:21.299 --> 00:32:28.379
it's just I'm a happily married man I

00:32:26.299 --> 00:32:30.749
don't know why I said that with ass I

00:32:28.379 --> 00:32:33.089
knew things because I'm recovering from

00:32:30.749 --> 00:32:37.829
the story there's like residual shock

00:32:33.089 --> 00:32:41.249
there anyway what do we got here the

00:32:37.829 --> 00:32:45.209
world's you've got the whole world in a

00:32:41.249 --> 00:32:48.479
card this run is weird cuz it's fast but

00:32:45.209 --> 00:32:51.389
also like not really that good it's just

00:32:48.479 --> 00:32:53.309
sort of just sort of okay I also feel

00:32:51.389 --> 00:32:55.489
like I've been cursed with something

00:32:53.309 --> 00:32:57.749
almost the whole time

00:32:55.489 --> 00:32:59.549
either way though it's gonna it's gonna

00:32:57.749 --> 00:33:02.069
be wins and it was finally I think we

00:32:59.549 --> 00:33:04.559
had some good laughs and gasps over the

00:33:02.069 --> 00:33:06.599
course of it you know and it just goes

00:33:04.559 --> 00:33:08.189
to show you like you I worry that people

00:33:06.599 --> 00:33:09.839
judge a country too much because of one

00:33:08.189 --> 00:33:12.149
or two interactions if that was your

00:33:09.839 --> 00:33:13.409
first day in South Korea and you were

00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:15.509
only going there for like five days

00:33:13.409 --> 00:33:16.829
would have been linked you would have

00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:19.639
come back I mean like people there are

00:33:16.829 --> 00:33:21.779
really racist but like those the

00:33:19.639 --> 00:33:25.079
literally the only time I had an

00:33:21.779 --> 00:33:26.999
interaction like that and I didn't at

00:33:25.079 --> 00:33:29.069
all let it color my experience although

00:33:26.999 --> 00:33:30.809
I was like two months away from leaving

00:33:29.069 --> 00:33:36.479
the country at the time and I was like

00:33:30.809 --> 00:33:38.909
gone at least if somebody you know

00:33:36.479 --> 00:33:40.559
insults me in my native language sure

00:33:38.909 --> 00:33:42.599
well that was my native language that's

00:33:40.559 --> 00:33:45.629
what bothers me the most is it he

00:33:42.599 --> 00:33:47.969
actually like localized his hatred to

00:33:45.629 --> 00:33:50.219
make it more accessible for me it's like

00:33:47.969 --> 00:33:52.949
the worst part actually and we laughed

00:33:50.219 --> 00:33:54.550
about this at the time it's like his

00:33:52.949 --> 00:33:58.670
English is really

00:33:54.550 --> 00:34:01.550
like he he knows the slang and his

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:03.080
pronunciation is perfect because the

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:04.670
English teacher must have been fantastic

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:08.179
maybe a little bit on the

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:09.890
rough-and-tumble side with Phil it was

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:12.649
the ultimate irony is like this guy's

00:34:09.890 --> 00:34:15.020
insulting us while simultaneously were

00:34:12.649 --> 00:34:19.090
like marveling at the masterpiece that

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:21.020
was his instructor anyway

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:22.190
