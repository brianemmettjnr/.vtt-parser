##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.690
let's go finding allies gathering plus

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.360
daily northernlion here yesterday we

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.820
came 86 1.05 percentile pretty good

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.980
score today's run is Anna's asel run

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.270
that goes to Scholl which means it's

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:21.150
Anna's able run that goes to delirium if

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.580
possible I'm ready to go been playing

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.609
well lately you have no way of knowing

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.830
that I'm not going to spoil the series

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.599
for you but I recorded a bunch yesterday

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.660
and I feel like it got a little bit of

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.969
my isaac mojo back but it daily is not

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.370
just about winning a kiss is not a

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.989
contract but it's very nice it's very

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.719
very nice

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.890
all we need to do is not take damage I'm

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.420
going to go out on a limb and say that

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.219
if we don't take damage on today's daily

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.129
we're going to rank pretty well as long

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.829
as we don't just you know

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.780
Minkus it and just stand here for like

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.879
three hours and then go well I'm not

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.250
taking damage where's my a score or I

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.280
don't know what that I hope this looks

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.200
is supposed to be I also don't know what

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.450
it means to Minkus something I think

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.170
that was the nerd from Boy Meets World

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.930
but I didn't get NBC's must-see TV

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.890
Thursday night lineup that's a Friday

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.540
that's a TGIF but I didn't get that

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.250
either so you know it's not like we only

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.070
had NBC one day of the week that would

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.710
be unusual as well by the way top scores

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.670
today let's go back and check 55,000 is

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.820
number one and 47,000 is number 30 so if

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.460
we want to hit that front page we're

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.780
going to be between 47 and 55,000 we

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.270
haven't had a front page score in quite

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.979
some time it doesn't mean it's

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:50.250
impossible though does mean that perhaps

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.659
some mildly unlikely uh there must have

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.130
been two pennies on top of each other

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.149
there because that takes us to six cents

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.630
honestly

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.310
yesterday's daily was basically possible

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.799
for us to rank well because of the fact

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.979
that we hit five cents on the very first

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.979
floor got an incredibly I mean maybe not

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.500
incredibly but a very unlikely arcade

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.319
come on now and then that arcade ended

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.810
up giving us IV vonage I think

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.639
can't remember I mean it's been 24 hours

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.159
since that run but in all honesty it's

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:24.620
been like six Isaac run since that run

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:27.930
so it's become sort of diluted in memory

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.569
repeating of course but with all that

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.889
being said maybe we'll get an arcade

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.510
here and have something similar happen I

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:35.879
mean I'm not too attached to the brown

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.670
nugget it's not terrible but it's not a

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:45.419
compulsory part of our experience you're

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:47.250
2020 very very excellent we can fly so

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:48.659
we should just put that there and we'll

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.579
go back to that spirit art we have to go

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.620
back anyway to explore we might as well

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.699
just you know finish going in the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.359
direction we're going in for now

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:58.680
probably a secret room beneath us and

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.810
well it could be a secret room adjacent

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.579
as well to that room right there but

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.900
right now we're looking for our deal

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.280
with the devil and I'd love it to be

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.040
brimstone of course but I would really

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.799
really love it to also be a space bar

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.599
item that benefits from battery charges

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.209
like a Book of Revelations for example

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.189
range upgrade luck upgrade always useful

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.609
as Azazel and then Abaddon so it's one

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:24.569
of these runs and by that I simply mean

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:26.669
is extremely good we have eight point

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:30.209
seven eight damage effectively times two

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:31.979
right now we don't even need the spirit

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.769
hearts that we just earned from that

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:35.790
tinted rock as a result of the fact that

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:39.870
we might as well push the button at

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.829
least as a result of the fact that you

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.840
know we're kind of balling out of

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.750
control here honestly you're going to

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.560
think that this is like the ultimate

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.750
dick move but what do I care about

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.669
picking up ghost baby it's negative

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.159
points for effectively no reason now we

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:57.780
can admittedly take that all the way to

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:00.359
absurdity and be like well why pick up

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.250
blood bag we don't need HP I'm not going

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.530
to do that but ghost baby on a run

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.479
that's this strong already basically

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.829
literally provides no benefit at least

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:12.209
blood bag you know the speed upgrade

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:13.979
along with the HP this has to be our

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.549
secret room it's the only thing that

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:19.139
makes sense in this crazy mixed-up world

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.849
it's not our secret room in hindsight we

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.180
might have been able to find whether or

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:25.710
not it was our secret room via the bomb

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.090
that blew up the tinted rock in the

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.800
first

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:34.970
but we got a check we got a check he has

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:37.100
not done it we got a bomb instead of a

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.330
key I could have used the key to open

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.389
the golden chest back there the only

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.010
reason I didn't was because I wanted to

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.229
save a key for the arcade so I would

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.520
consider this like not an arcade sorry

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.560
our item room on the next floor so I

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.300
consider this like kind of a whiff but

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.050
I'll see what we get here come on come

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:56.870
on come on come on you got you got me

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.370
you got me he's done it to HP we might

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.139
as well hold it you know we can use that

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.030
for easy deal with the devil access and

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:07.250
have no concerns honestly

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:09.040
runs like really really really good

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:14.120
right now

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:17.240
probably our secret room there uh like

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.460
rarely do you have a run we're on the

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.229
third floor you go oh the lyrium no

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.930
problem you know it's like on your first

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:24.110
day of kindergarten you're like you know

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.199
astrophysics

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:30.580
sign me up another health upgrade is it

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:32.660
a legitimate health upgrade as well

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.700
which we know because of the fact that

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.490
we don't have zero health and it still

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:40.460
gave us health you know I mean so we're

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:44.389
like unfathomably strong right now

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:47.479
basically one of the strongest starts to

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:49.610
a daily perhaps in Earth's history is if

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:50.840
this is a comeuppance for like you know

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.030
recent dailies that haven't been

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.039
particularly strong maybe not in the

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.080
past like week or so but you know in the

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:58.610
past month or so then honestly apology

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.770
accepted it's going to be a hot

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.690
leaderboard today it's an easy daily it

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:06.919
seems like let's not count our chickens

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:11.360
before they hatch yet it's an easy daily

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:14.419
and it has the added benefit of being on

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.860
a Saturday so like this could be one of

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:17.389
those runs where you come in like you

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.240
know four hundredths place but still

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:23.360
ranked in the top few percent now that's

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.560
a tough decision a was I mean we don't

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.530
we're not doing anything with the fool

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.639
card but what are we going to do oh

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.800
mylanta

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:34.789
guppies head what are we going to do

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:37.460
with an eihwaz room we probably will not

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:39.249
be able to get to 15 cents here anyway

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.899
so I'm going to choose not

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:42.849
to stress out about the fact that there

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:47.169
is a swallowed penny in there that

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:48.669
interests me a great deal seven cents I

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:49.449
don't know might be possible but we'll

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:52.779
give it some time

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:55.539
I feel like fire mind actually does

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:57.789
nothing for us here is this might this

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:59.859
is my final daily evolution is just I

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:02.289
don't pick up any items anymore well

00:06:59.859 --> 00:07:04.449
admittedly though fire mine does nothing

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:05.919
is hazel if we were to transform we

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:10.089
would get fire mine but probably not

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:11.559
even wanted that much as a result of the

00:07:10.089 --> 00:07:13.059
fact that you know the whole blowing

00:07:11.559 --> 00:07:16.779
yourself up accidentally sort of thing

00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:18.639
going on so um I think we just whole day

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:19.659
was we should look for a tinted rock I

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:21.639
didn't really give it more than a

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:24.119
cursory glance here as we go back we've

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:28.919
only been here once on this run

00:07:24.119 --> 00:07:31.839
certainly an acceptable amount of damage

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:33.429
I'm a little surprised here what's the

00:07:31.839 --> 00:07:34.539
matter you couldn't give me a deal with

00:07:33.429 --> 00:07:36.189
the devil and then the deal with the

00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:37.659
devil gives me two more guppy items and

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:39.099
then oh by the way if you have guppy you

00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:40.419
just like win the game instantly and

00:07:39.099 --> 00:07:43.179
here's the highest score you've ever had

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:47.529
like I get it is a bad joke but at the

00:07:43.179 --> 00:07:49.360
same time the way this daily is going so

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:51.069
far that's what you got to kind of come

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.449
to expect here I should have maybe look

00:07:51.069 --> 00:07:55.299
for the second secret room in the hopes

00:07:52.449 --> 00:07:58.899
of making a crooked penny work for us

00:07:55.299 --> 00:08:00.909
but whatever this daily is like where

00:07:58.899 --> 00:08:03.189
was this daily and I'm not being bitter

00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:05.079
about it I know that's like on brand for

00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:08.049
for the northernlion character a

00:08:05.079 --> 00:08:10.059
registered trademark of northernlion

00:08:08.049 --> 00:08:13.959
industries butter bean not even wait

00:08:10.059 --> 00:08:15.779
what huh man this run stinks but I'm not

00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:21.459
not being mad about it I'm just saying

00:08:15.779 --> 00:08:24.369
there was a really really good time for

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:26.709
us to have a daily that was this strong

00:08:24.369 --> 00:08:28.869
and that really really good time was

00:08:26.709 --> 00:08:30.759
like eight days ago when I couldn't buy

00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:32.789
a win you know I was getting my butt

00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:36.009
kicked at every available opportunity

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:37.750
what we should recognize though in the

00:08:36.009 --> 00:08:39.759
interest of managing expectations and

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:42.610
also not making myself needlessly look

00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:46.300
like a total fool is that the void fight

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:48.639
is still really difficult as azazel with

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:50.980
near bass range you know even getting

00:08:48.639 --> 00:08:52.250
like a few range upgrades is basically

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.260
worth not

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:56.860
when it comes to fighting when it comes

00:08:54.260 --> 00:09:01.639
to fighting delirium specifically so

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:06.079
don't necessarily write this off as an

00:09:01.639 --> 00:09:09.800
easy delirium kill but we're going to

00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:11.060
try to fight delirium NE ha we're going

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:16.880
to try to fight the lyrium anyway

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:18.860
because can't sleep at night if I if I

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.449
start hitting the alt f4 key there even

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:24.350
though it is the sensible option is that

00:09:20.449 --> 00:09:26.660
self-righteous probably but you know

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:29.240
what it was also a lie to begin with I

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:32.630
sleep very well at night I'd I used to

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:34.510
have insomnia to a great degree well not

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:37.100
a good not like a critical degree nor a

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:38.449
clinical degree I should say but are you

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.250
saying you know maybe like three or four

00:09:38.449 --> 00:09:42.079
times a month once a week I'd like just

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.060
can't get to sleep get like 2 or 3 hours

00:09:42.079 --> 00:09:47.600
of sleep a night

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:49.820
now sleep like a baby earbuds in Dan

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.680
Carlin's hardcore history podcast yeah

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:57.589
there's only one episode every you know

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:59.570
eight years you can listen to them over

00:09:57.589 --> 00:10:01.130
and over in this you know always

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:03.560
experience something new

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:05.750
highly recommended although if you

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:08.269
listen to me for background noise as you

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:10.089
fall asleep definitely continue to do

00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:13.399
that I don't want to lose my position as

00:10:10.089 --> 00:10:16.250
one of the top 15 or 20 thousand you

00:10:13.399 --> 00:10:18.380
know background noise generators on

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:20.540
planet Earth if I can avoid it

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:23.540
you know that's my wheelhouse of my lot

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:25.100
in life then I'm content honestly so we

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.690
got some very good stuff there we should

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:29.630
take pageant boy maybe get a luck

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:31.490
upgrade the money is kind of secondary

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:34.040
at this point but we should go to our

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:42.589
shop as well which we already did and it

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:43.760
was greed that's right 1.75 speed is

00:10:42.589 --> 00:10:49.940
more than enough here we don't need to

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:54.500
really work for for bloodbag because the

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:57.330
speed upgrade is again very secondary

00:10:54.500 --> 00:11:00.900
this is really like where we're going to

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:03.540
feel the happiest about the fact that we

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.860
have extra charges in between rooms

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.260
because mega fatty is otherwise of

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:09.090
course extremely annoying

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:10.500
okay so we're pretty much out of here

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:12.630
still holding a nail odds room for

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.050
really god knows what reason at this

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.720
point

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:22.800
that's not our secret room this must be

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:24.600
then I'm losing my mind we should look

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:28.680
for it I mean I think I overestimate how

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:33.830
useful it actually is from a point

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:33.830
sample with secret room can't be there

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:40.590
well luckily I did just say I think I

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:44.160
overestimated usefulness because I'm

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:47.130
about to probably leave without it hmmmm

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:54.720
this is actually a tough call right now

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:58.110
because guppies head is suite IV bag is

00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:00.150
also like a breakable caliber item I

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:03.510
think I'm just going to go with Guppies

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:05.940
head you know we're in such a great

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:09.180
situation here I don't want to risk it

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.560
what I do want to get is like 45,000

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:13.650
points and even on some of our best

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:16.940
dailies lately 45,000 has been outside

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.940
of the realm of attainability

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:25.320
well I mean we literally got 45,000

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:26.970
yesterday I think so maybe just

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.790
completely ignore what I just said

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:32.700
because it's patently false as proved by

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:34.970
myself the rare cell phone you know what

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:38.720
we call that egg on its own face

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:38.720
checchina poop

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:43.620
a low dangled phone trying to speak

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.980
French so trying to broaden his horizons

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:48.029
would an idiot okay we'll take the pact

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:49.440
we should have taken the pact second

00:12:48.029 --> 00:12:50.850
because I do want to take a Fame as well

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.769
and this would have worked extremely

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:56.579
well with IV bag but we're gonna get our

00:12:52.769 --> 00:12:58.500
HP back anyway I'm fairly happy I'm

00:12:56.579 --> 00:13:05.699
fairly optimistic about our chances

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:13.380
there this is a chariot card which it is

00:13:05.699 --> 00:13:16.490
we should be able to go in here I hit Q

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:19.079
I guess I'm glad it didn't pop but I

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:21.329
kind of wanted it to we should really be

00:13:19.079 --> 00:13:24.899
thinking at this point is there another

00:13:21.329 --> 00:13:30.029
way for us to get mad money jim cramer

00:13:24.899 --> 00:13:31.019
style here you remember Jim Cramer the

00:13:30.029 --> 00:13:32.850
guy from Seinfeld

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:37.070
he's always busted into Jerry's house

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:41.610
ago Jerry by Tesla stock that Elon Musk

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:45.089
he's come some good ideas Jerry plus

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:47.760
he's a space alien not a good Kramer

00:13:45.089 --> 00:13:49.860
impression Jim Ward Cosmo but you have

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.690
the idea why not the court is well worth

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:53.910
it I think at this point the moon card X

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:55.230
moon and a was are both teleporters

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.339
right now as far as I'm concerned but I

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:58.019
don't know what to do with them because

00:13:56.339 --> 00:14:01.980
it's one of the few runs in which we

00:13:58.019 --> 00:14:04.889
don't really need a seam so I'm very

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:11.149
confused as to what to do with this like

00:14:04.889 --> 00:14:14.339
I suppose one thing we could do is use

00:14:11.149 --> 00:14:15.660
well I mean hear me out here I love the

00:14:14.339 --> 00:14:16.440
range upgrade by the way we're starting

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:19.800
to get to the point where I don't feel

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:22.800
too badly about this if we go to show

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:24.930
instead of going directly to the void

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.699
and then the Delirium fight we might be

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:34.589
able to find a self sacrifice room that

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:35.880
takes us to to the chest or to the dark

00:14:34.589 --> 00:14:37.680
room and that's your Wooster I guess if

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.029
we're going to show I mean it you can go

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.980
to show with the Polaroid so I think

00:14:39.029 --> 00:14:45.170
it's up in the air like a George Clooney

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:48.269
film right now like a Vera Farmiga film

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:52.399
appreciate the luck upgrades we

00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:52.399
definitely do not need sharp plug

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:57.530
which means that we definitely do not

00:14:55.380 --> 00:15:00.000
need anything here

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:05.910
we'll probably take both eternal hearts

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:08.190
just because we can but we could go

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:09.600
there and hope for a self-sacrifice room

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:11.370
but there's some problems with this

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:14.810
theory I think if there's not a

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:16.920
self-sacrifice room we lose pretty big

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:18.600
we've already found a regular secret

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.220
room with ten bombs we can start to look

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:24.630
for second secret rooms give it a shot

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:28.410
at least if there is a self-sacrifice

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:32.190
room we might still lose big all right

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:35.340
I'm out because we'll take a huge damage

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:37.440
penalty in the process of making that

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:40.710
dream work there so I'm not necessarily

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:45.690
sure that that's the right course of

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:47.910
action and by not necessarily sure I

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:49.140
mean I'm like 99% sure that that's not

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:51.090
the course of action we take here

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:52.200
cricket's body is cranked up our game is

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:53.520
pretty extremely here

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:56.160
despite the banget I haven't become

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:58.230
guffy which was kind of like you know it

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.210
was my pet cause ah haha pun not

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:01.500
intended but then I'm going to act like

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:03.960
it's intended because it makes me seem

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:05.490
more clever and it was kind of my pet

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.960
cons for this run but at the same time

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:10.800
you see because guppy is a cat which is

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:13.530
a domesticated animal commonly I'm gonna

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:17.270
say used as a house pet but used it

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:17.270
sends the wrong message there I think

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.690
what I mean to say is that despite the

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.510
fact that we haven't gotten guppy the

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:26.640
run is still amazing and has become more

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:32.270
amazing recently like the succubus

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:34.920
pickup is incredible to infested pills

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:36.450
and we're really like probably a

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.860
thousand points ahead of where we'd

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:43.380
normally be at this point on a daily

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:45.360
largely that comes down to them has to

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:47.370
be wait what which gives us unlimited

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.020
bombs but I don't actually know if

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:50.550
that's worth anything right now it comes

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:55.640
down to the fact that we have 97 cents

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:55.640
right now soon to be 99 as indicated

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:04.160
we shouldn't take much if any more

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:06.350
damage on boss rush like there is a

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.390
concern with that and the concern is our

00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:09.710
range as always especially when we're

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:13.640
fighting enemies like those guys that

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:15.740
can explode having low range is you know

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:18.590
the mildest of mild problems on a run

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:22.520
like this so very surprised we have not

00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:23.980
recovered our HP Clancy Ori I mean we've

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:26.570
recovered some HP we haven't recovered

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:33.500
you know a ton of HP is what I mean to

00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:36.140
say a possible secret room indeed not on

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:37.310
a daily ok not on a daily which we've

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:40.040
got a great chance

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:41.990
I'm as a master never forget I'm the

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:44.450
same master I still got it

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:48.770
I'm still hip Tukka Tukka Tukka Tukka

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:51.860
Tukka Tukka Tukka no but we're we're

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:55.070
still fine but I wanted I'm on the

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:57.770
greatest role of my Isaac career I want

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:59.780
to keep the I want to keep the momentum

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:04.790
coming here I don't know plank card it

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:06.920
was blank card is really really good I

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:08.570
would miss the Flies

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:11.390
but ghost pepper is not going to be that

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:14.390
good for us so I guess you go blank art

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:17.479
and then we'll choose

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:17.479
[Music]

00:18:17.869 --> 00:18:26.009
since we don't have to I mean we don't

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:28.049
get any benefit basically out of rolling

00:18:26.009 --> 00:18:31.590
blank card like right off the bat so we

00:18:28.049 --> 00:18:32.940
might as well just hold it there and

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:34.320
then we can decide if we want to use

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:36.029
blank cards the thing about blank card

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.100
is that from a boring like oh I'm an

00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:40.230
adult and something something equity

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:45.269
standpoint stupid idiots probably pizza

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:46.440
with a knife and fork the lame-o's yeah

00:18:45.269 --> 00:18:48.330
they probably make charitable

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:53.759
contributions for their community too

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:54.840
what a bunch of losers okay flies this

00:18:53.759 --> 00:19:04.080
would be a great time for you to get in

00:18:54.840 --> 00:19:07.320
there but in in a lame way blank card is

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:10.820
a really fun and Cooling hip of course

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:14.809
one of the hippest there is but also

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:18.809
gives us the chance to really amp up our

00:19:14.809 --> 00:19:20.429
points via the like blank card to a

00:19:18.809 --> 00:19:23.100
spades to a clubs combo you know

00:19:20.429 --> 00:19:26.309
whatever we're able to get so I kind of

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:28.919
feel like we should go for the blank

00:19:26.309 --> 00:19:30.720
card no matter what our damage is so

00:19:28.919 --> 00:19:33.710
good I mean it's kind of it's a weird

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:37.049
what's the inverse of a catch-22

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:38.610
catching a paw invented uh you don't

00:19:37.049 --> 00:19:39.570
save ante till you just say fans do it

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:42.749
anyway

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:46.950
look I basically speak French added like

00:19:42.749 --> 00:19:51.080
below kid kid nerd kindergarten level

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:53.639
fairly as big English ed below a

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:55.110
kindergarten level as well look I don't

00:19:53.639 --> 00:19:58.669
have a five-year-old child I don't say

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:58.669
the word kindergarten very often

00:20:01.369 --> 00:20:09.479
how all the people start kindergarten ad

00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:13.049
but also very German word so I'm not

00:20:09.479 --> 00:20:17.099
gonna we should just call it you know I

00:20:13.049 --> 00:20:19.259
call it waste of tax dollars no but we

00:20:17.099 --> 00:20:21.359
should just call it you know the garden

00:20:19.259 --> 00:20:24.089
of the children that's that makes more

00:20:21.359 --> 00:20:26.669
sense for some reason that sounds creepy

00:20:24.089 --> 00:20:28.109
like it's a a mission from Deus Ex or

00:20:26.669 --> 00:20:30.239
something like that okay we're done

00:20:28.109 --> 00:20:32.820
rainbow baby sure let's take blank card

00:20:30.239 --> 00:20:43.229
but anyway what I was gonna say is that

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:44.909
we should take this brains firing on on

00:20:43.229 --> 00:20:48.119
all cylinders right now apparently

00:20:44.909 --> 00:20:50.099
alright so just remember we do not want

00:20:48.119 --> 00:20:51.450
to go down we are looking for crawl

00:20:50.099 --> 00:20:52.859
spaces black markets but we're also

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:55.469
looking for something better than an a

00:20:52.859 --> 00:20:58.549
wowser and take us to the to the top

00:20:55.469 --> 00:21:01.049
here I think it's just long legs is fine

00:20:58.549 --> 00:21:05.129
occasional extra spiders to make up for

00:21:01.049 --> 00:21:07.469
our our loss of flies here and I don't

00:21:05.129 --> 00:21:08.999
know do we have a chance of 46,000 for

00:21:07.469 --> 00:21:10.679
you forty five thousand whatever we need

00:21:08.999 --> 00:21:17.609
to get into the top there sig it's

00:21:10.679 --> 00:21:20.309
conceivable we kind of we've done

00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:22.679
everything house very dangerous we've

00:21:20.309 --> 00:21:26.820
done everything more or less right here

00:21:22.679 --> 00:21:32.369
and if we're not going to commit to like

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:37.799
using blank card eihwaz to try to get to

00:21:32.369 --> 00:21:38.669
the chest which again we don't even want

00:21:37.799 --> 00:21:42.940
to get to the chest

00:21:38.669 --> 00:21:46.909
we want to get to the dark room

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:52.490
but I don't think I'm like crossing my

00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:57.470
wires here can you use a shoul eihwaz

00:21:52.490 --> 00:22:02.690
rune to get to the dark room I believe

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:04.730
the answer is No however we could get a

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:06.919
self-sacrifice room so the a wands rune

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:08.539
basically was just existing for me to

00:22:06.919 --> 00:22:11.740
maybe find a black market or something

00:22:08.539 --> 00:22:13.070
like that I suppose it's not that

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:15.470
important right now

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:17.360
now is blank are just is that important

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:18.980
right now no but at least it gives us

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:22.039
points and the points are worth

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:24.860
something perhaps not a lot but the

00:22:22.039 --> 00:22:26.450
points are indeed worth something so if

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:28.340
we're not going to do a self-sacrifice

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:30.200
room the shoul we're sorry it's self

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:31.490
sacrifice room to the dark room what we

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.929
should probably do is what we're doing

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:36.320
right now but make sure that we fight

00:22:32.929 --> 00:22:40.279
delirium so if we wanted to it might

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:42.169
also as grade and that's the same which

00:22:40.279 --> 00:22:45.259
means with great tears up as well do

00:22:42.169 --> 00:22:48.919
that's awesome it might be wise to just

00:22:45.259 --> 00:22:54.259
look for a blank card combination that

00:22:48.919 --> 00:22:57.950
actually just gives us HP because we are

00:22:54.259 --> 00:23:00.110
going to take damage on void we are

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:02.690
going to take damage jon voight you know

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:06.519
the star of such oscar-nominated films

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:10.490
is the deer hunter and also anacondas

00:23:06.519 --> 00:23:13.220
which I've heard dozen won none unless

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:15.409
you got buns hun which means that it

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:16.999
wants all of it right because it's a

00:23:15.409 --> 00:23:18.799
double negative I don't understand how

00:23:16.999 --> 00:23:22.100
the double negative works in rap music

00:23:18.799 --> 00:23:24.470
though I might be ignorant of that you

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:27.110
got to go for the guppy dream you got to

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:28.490
not take that and we don't want brother

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:29.659
Bobby even though it gives us permanent

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:31.730
polaroid invincibility I don't care

00:23:29.659 --> 00:23:33.200
about brother Bobby we'll take our extra

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:38.929
black card here and two extra bombs

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:41.509
crack into that I'm skeptical that that

00:23:38.929 --> 00:23:43.539
last room has any matter to it

00:23:41.509 --> 00:23:45.980
whatsoever

00:23:43.539 --> 00:23:48.470
do keep in mind we are going to go to

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.360
the hush fight and the hush fight is

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:53.270
also one in which we benefit from having

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:57.380
longer range so

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:59.300
I mean this is like we've gotten maybe

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:02.870
three range upgrades or four range

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:04.070
upgrades as azazel that'll be our fifth

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:08.960
one right there and there's the guppy

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:11.890
dream as well so that's awesome but just

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:15.680
pop that right away you can get it but

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:17.780
we're still like light on range this is

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:24.200
not an incredibly impressive amount of

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:26.780
range for us to have I think we're just

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:30.440
going to ignore the HP upgrades at this

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:33.980
point because we're probably better off

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:36.440
in this situation I think we're getting

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:40.460
like I don't know maybe 30 points per

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:42.290
justice charge that's not likely to make

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:44.380
much of a difference but if I can use

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:47.720
this to choose my way past one of you

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:48.950
you know scumbags on the leaderboards

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.350
and I'm going to be happy because every

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:53.450
every person that I beat on the daily

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:55.010
leaderboards you got a fight for every

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:57.530
ounce of respect you get in this

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:59.630
freaking game man I'm telling you maybe

00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:02.380
we take I'm drowsy onto the hush fight I

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:05.390
don't know we're dropping a left hand

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:10.130
this is largely irrelevant but if it was

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:12.080
regardless or I'm drowsy onto the

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:14.450
Delirium fight might be the right call

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:16.370
I've heard there was a subreddit post on

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:20.380
the Isaacs subreddit nobody talks about

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:22.700
Isaac on the lower the lion subreddit

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:25.190
which is fair they've had their chances

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:28.790
to talk about that over the past you

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:30.380
know eight years but and it said I

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:31.580
didn't read the post cuz let's be honest

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.170
I'm a very busy man

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:36.170
I only read the headlines a find that

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:38.120
makes the news no less comprehensive but

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:41.030
much much more efficient dude stop with

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:42.470
the enemies that hit us when we hit them

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:45.560
that's not fair it's supposed to be like

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:48.250
a it's a unary operator we hit them they

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.250
do not hit us

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:53.360
I did not mean to pick that up that is

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:55.070
actually Obama

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:57.560
we need a justice card or something now

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:59.630
or just very lucky against this deal of

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:04.550
the devil would also work just fine but

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:06.230
and said I'm drowsy against hush I'm

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:07.850
drowsy against a void I should say is

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:10.760
Opie and by void of course I mean

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:13.400
delirium probably a new record for the

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:16.640
most miss named items over the course of

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:18.470
this episode but hopefully a new record

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:20.000
for points as well let's go explore

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:23.540
everything we got plenty of time this

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.960
time found our secret room secret room

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:28.610
is I mean at this point money doesn't

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:31.310
strike me as being extremely important

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:37.120
but that did give us a net gain in terms

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:43.730
of our points but we'll use on drowsy

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:44.750
against delirium and it might seem like

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:46.130
hey we're missing out on all those

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:48.200
judgment points and you wouldn't be

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:50.660
wrong except for the fact that we can

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:52.880
drop I'm drowsy as soon as we get down

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:54.470
to the void floor and pick up another

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:56.360
card and use that for the rest of our

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:58.660
time down there so I don't know if

00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:03.350
that's going to matter to too much but

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:05.120
if it does then that's good uh kind of a

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:07.970
weird choice here but I'm going to play

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:09.620
him nonetheless don't blow up the demon

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:11.900
judgement did not blow up the demon

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:14.060
judgment is that if this guy gives me HP

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:16.400
I might be able to productively lose my

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:21.470
eternal heart but it would be at the

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:24.710
cost of getting the HP which strikes me

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:26.930
is not that valuable I mean we could get

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:29.270
HP like do you see what I mean here

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:31.640
there's a well they're their other half

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:33.020
hearts there's half hearts it might be

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.100
worth it to try to play this demon

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:37.670
judgment although I don't really know

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:39.590
what we'd be looking for full hearts so

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:41.180
many full hearts let's just go with what

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:42.920
we got here we can pick up the other

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:44.690
eternal heart which would mature our

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.890
existing art then we play the demon

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:49.730
judgment and try to get something out of

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:51.680
it but that strikes me as a not just a

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:53.720
little tomb in Maxie but like literally

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:55.880
unlikely to provide us with much benefit

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:58.370
so this is a good time for us we got

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.870
$0.99 we can probably afford to spend

00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:01.640
because mr. e sacks paying out with a

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:02.290
bunch of money and then we will go to

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:09.940
the void

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:11.470
or after this well I mean it's a good

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.150
trinket even if it gives us nothing

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:14.260
right now

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:17.020
we probably didn't need to pick all that

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:20.410
up just right off the bat here but yeah

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:23.710
so these are both garbage I would rather

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:26.800
take none of those moms knife sort of

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:28.890
ruins guppy brimstone so I think in this

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:33.220
case will actually take juicy sack which

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:34.060
is kind of hilarious we've got a luck

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:36.910
upgrade penny

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:40.900
we got a son card I'm actually going to

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:43.030
buy a battery charge um just to give the

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:44.380
stats upgrade from dim bulb I don't

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:48.280
think we really have anything to do with

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:50.200
our with our son card so I'm going to

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:53.860
take on Drowsy into the boss fight but I

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:55.000
don't expect it to be too relevant and

00:28:53.860 --> 00:29:00.300
you might be saying why not at least

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:03.370
like take the scissors and then oh man

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:05.410
that was nasty why not at least take the

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:10.180
scissors you're not necessarily in the

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:12.640
wrong there but I don't want to

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:18.220
necessarily gate us out from being able

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:19.570
to get a strange attractor I actually I

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:21.700
mean I expect strange attractor is

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:25.890
horrible because it's almost always

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:25.890
horrible but if it's not

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:32.400
we would want to know so I have been

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:36.090
taking some damage again this is a

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:39.660
zeizel you start the run always so

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:41.940
strong you're usually all out so bad you

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:49.370
usually finish the run so strongly as

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:53.160
well come on come on pop up pop up ah

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:55.110
but there is danger in being azazel and

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:57.210
it's all tied to the range if you can

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:59.700
pop off with respect to as a zoe's range

00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:01.890
you stand like no chance of losing the

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:03.990
run basically if you get regular

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:05.610
brimstone for us right now it's not that

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:08.520
we're in a bad position at all it's just

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:09.960
like it's very hard to avoid shots

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.270
without having any sort of defensive

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:14.550
item to work with us here you know if we

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:18.960
have the soul we'd be in a much better

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:21.260
situation if we had you know gimpy we'd

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:24.930
probably be in a better situation but

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:28.140
you know no point in crying over spilled

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:34.680
milk right shot might finish the job

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:38.130
thanks to our flies oh my god it's got a

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:40.310
hit way too much there I think there

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:42.600
might be stuff to buy back here though

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:44.630
there's a spirit heart so I'm fine with

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:47.910
that

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:50.460
son card all right so we're up to the

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:53.760
void floor and at this point really

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:55.110
banking on that I'm drowsy pill to come

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:59.100
through in the clutch on the Delirium

00:30:55.110 --> 00:31:01.140
fight because otherwise you might be in

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.700
a tight spot you also if I remember

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:07.530
correctly like the last time we fought

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:11.550
delirium we gained like no point bonus

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:15.630
after finishing after finishing the

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:20.100
floor which I still think like not to

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:21.960
belabor the point here you should get

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:25.560
like a little point bonus or fighting

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:28.940
delirium I'm just saying not salty about

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.940
it life goes on

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:34.350
but it strikes me as a very sensible

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:36.870
option anyway regardless of that what

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:38.460
that means basically is that 45000 is

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:40.560
looking on likely and there's like you

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:42.269
can sharp the course of a northern lion

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:45.119
daily well we're doing amazing

00:31:42.269 --> 00:31:46.709
wait what happened we got no chance of

00:31:45.119 --> 00:31:49.349
the top score anymore so what I'm

00:31:46.709 --> 00:31:54.209
thinking by the way is that I will

00:31:49.349 --> 00:31:56.549
probably try to open up like every

00:31:54.209 --> 00:31:58.409
bathroom like not go into it but at

00:31:56.549 --> 00:32:04.830
least find every bathroom identify where

00:31:58.409 --> 00:32:07.200
they are and then we'll start carting

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:10.129
around I'm drowsy but if it seems like

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:14.519
there's no chance that it's going to be

00:32:10.129 --> 00:32:17.549
void or there's going to be delirium you

00:32:14.519 --> 00:32:20.459
feeling okay brain hilariously after the

00:32:17.549 --> 00:32:22.169
you know sleeping anecdote actually have

00:32:20.459 --> 00:32:24.899
to admit and sleep that well last night

00:32:22.169 --> 00:32:26.450
you know quality of sleep fine length of

00:32:24.899 --> 00:32:29.159
sleep a little light

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:30.929
maybe that's it's impacting like the

00:32:29.159 --> 00:32:32.759
higher-order functions in my brain but

00:32:30.929 --> 00:32:34.649
you know apparently most of like the

00:32:32.759 --> 00:32:37.249
Isaac you know brainstem function is

00:32:34.649 --> 00:32:40.379
still working out relatively well here

00:32:37.249 --> 00:32:42.690
we actually have a get-out-of-jail-free

00:32:40.379 --> 00:32:44.429
card now in the form of the fool so we

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:46.499
might as well and we're doing really

00:32:44.429 --> 00:32:48.599
well on consumables as well maybe forty

00:32:46.499 --> 00:32:52.139
five thousand is plausible but we might

00:32:48.599 --> 00:32:55.739
as well peep every boss fight I think

00:32:52.139 --> 00:32:57.209
this will give us points it did we might

00:32:55.739 --> 00:32:59.429
as well keep every boss fight at this

00:32:57.209 --> 00:33:00.989
point because if we find delirium that's

00:32:59.429 --> 00:33:11.549
actually just better for us we'll just

00:33:00.989 --> 00:33:17.149
teleport out like this could conceivably

00:33:11.549 --> 00:33:17.149
be delirium it was not thankfully

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:22.480
blugh map will help us find the secret

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:26.049
room is it worth the point trade-off I

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:27.789
believe not keep in mind by the way you

00:33:26.049 --> 00:33:29.559
might be going to over 42,000 at this

00:33:27.789 --> 00:33:31.659
point this guy's doing a great job like

00:33:29.559 --> 00:33:34.090
he's got a chance as a top the front

00:33:31.659 --> 00:33:35.740
page right now well first off it's a

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:37.270
little early in the day so even if we

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:39.669
get the front page I would expect it to

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:41.380
not last the whole day but I'm not

00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:44.049
trying to downplay what of course is you

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:45.850
know a nice superstar here but at the

00:33:44.049 --> 00:33:47.649
same time I will probably also get hit

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:50.679
like eight times in the Delirium fight

00:33:47.649 --> 00:33:53.679
and that will result in us effectively

00:33:50.679 --> 00:33:55.330
losing like maybe a couple thousand

00:33:53.679 --> 00:34:00.630
points historically that seems to be

00:33:55.330 --> 00:34:03.309
roughly around the right level so don't

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:04.870
necessarily get your hopes up too early

00:34:03.309 --> 00:34:06.970
here I don't even know if those give us

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:10.419
points at this point but this could be

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:13.720
delirium it's not delirium it's

00:34:10.419 --> 00:34:15.879
checkpoint five which I will take tech

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:20.349
point five is good enough to get past

00:34:15.879 --> 00:34:22.629
the filter for like is this worth

00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:24.250
negative thirty points yeah yeah it is

00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:30.550
especially you know when we've got 28

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:37.409
damaged some of the time this should not

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:40.030
be delirium so I believe that that's

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:42.669
guaranteed deals with the angel that's

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:44.139
the Eucharist right for an item that

00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:47.530
doesn't show up that frequently it has a

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:49.480
pretty important impact unfortunately

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:55.899
it's weird because it oftentimes shows

00:34:49.480 --> 00:35:00.670
up on deals with the Angels so so it's a

00:34:55.899 --> 00:35:02.200
strange way to glean precedent but can

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:04.119
be interesting nonetheless did I get a

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:06.810
hit in there in like in that room with

00:35:04.119 --> 00:35:06.810
the slot machine

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:15.380
this is like the ultimate temptation

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:21.200
it's the temptation of Doctor Parnassus

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:23.570
I was meant to be a joke about Goethe my

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:28.790
German humour has not been on point in

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:31.310
this episode so far gate easy kill but I

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:34.190
say that because let's take a range

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:39.890
upgrade we should be able to get to

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:42.290
nearly 45,000 points just before the

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:45.290
Delirium fight so the problem with that

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:49.310
is that if I just hit alt f4 or whatever

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:50.540
you do to quit the daily sadly taro

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:56.930
cloth is not worth it

00:35:50.540 --> 00:36:01.610
whatever you do to quit the daily take

00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:04.000
on drowsy now we would be on the front

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:06.980
page but we would be on the front page

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:11.119
after recapitulation of our values as a

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:12.700
society I cannot abide by this I don't

00:36:11.119 --> 00:36:16.310
know what that's like Bernie Sanders

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:17.570
meets of an impression of Al Capone by

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:22.720
somebody who's never heard what Al

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:24.710
Capone sounds like so what we got to do

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.780
well what I mean to say is what it all

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:28.100
comes down to my friends oh is that

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:30.590
everything's going to be fine fine fine

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:32.960
because I got one hand in my pocket and

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:34.970
the other ones getting us 500 points in

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:38.090
the Delirium fight somehow Jagged Little

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:39.800
Pill alanis morissette classic Canadian

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:48.080
album we lost 500 points for getting

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:51.950
here once bad sign I do want to point

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:53.869
out I'm not completely convinced or even

00:36:51.950 --> 00:37:00.340
going to beat delirium I think we got a

00:36:53.869 --> 00:37:00.340
good shot but I'm not convinced

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:04.920
and it's not worth it okay let's go for

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:09.390
it let's see how good this time Drowsy

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:13.190
pill really is huh Daly's breaking down

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:20.010
on delirium fight okay we need this

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:20.670
let's go all right subreddit poster

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:25.349
whose post

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:25.819
I didn't read but saw the title of prove

00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:28.770
it

00:37:25.819 --> 00:37:30.510
you said I'm drowsy so pee against

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:32.280
delirium I mean it probably helps if you

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:34.589
have the range necessary to get in here

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:36.750
without taking damage admittedly they

00:37:34.589 --> 00:37:39.420
were crossing him we're doing a ton of

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:41.579
damage his range is not enough to get to

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:43.109
us and seems like a lot of his tell

00:37:41.579 --> 00:37:45.180
afraid and can't get us either tech

00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:49.290
point 5 is at least doing something for

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:54.240
generating occasional spiders see what

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:56.430
they were right I'm drowsy it's the dang

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:58.829
it it's the feel-good story of the year

00:37:56.430 --> 00:38:01.680
the I'm drowsy pill actually has a

00:37:58.829 --> 00:38:03.390
reason to use it it's like a chaos card

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:05.010
for delirium but it's actually better

00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:07.890
than the chaos card on delirium because

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:12.150
that just does like you know 15% of his

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:15.270
HP or something like that please please

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:18.619
I've earned it by a nobility I've earned

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:23.730
it on this run you owe me a top 30 score

00:38:18.619 --> 00:38:27.630
he's dead Jim forty three thousand seven

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:29.339
hundred ninety-two 169 to be fair we

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:32.460
didn't lose many points for the delirium

00:38:29.339 --> 00:38:34.680
flight so I don't feel like you know we

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:37.140
we whipped on being on the top 10 as a

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:39.720
result of our honor instead not top 10

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:41.550
but top 30 instead great score you know

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:43.319
we're going to be roughly in the

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:45.480
vicinity percentage-wise of where we've

00:38:43.319 --> 00:38:46.680
been recently and the consistency keeps

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.970
hanging here for now thanks for watching
