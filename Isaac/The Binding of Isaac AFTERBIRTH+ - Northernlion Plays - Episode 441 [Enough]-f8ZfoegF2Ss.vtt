00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.400
hey everybody oh you wanted music with

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.220
that video the old Isaac can't come to

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.050
the phone why because it's muted well

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.130
anyway

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.330
Twitter memes decide welcome back and

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.700
get our butt kicked last time on the

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.199
verge of a double-digit streak we messed

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:23.039
it up pardon me we have characters that

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.019
need bringing up the speed Maggie is

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.349
just in a terrible position we could

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.060
actually do a light side Maggie run

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:34.649
which I think we should just so I don't

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.440
uh 410 swig get there you go just so I

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.420
don't not only forget but like I'd

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.790
rather not switch back and forth between

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.309
the Polaroid and the negative as much as

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.629
I have to like we've done a few negative

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.270
runs but if we knock out all the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.579
Polaroid runs in advance we should be

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.110
maybe a little bit more mentally in a

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.469
good spot because we're bundling those

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.590
tasks together that's my impression

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:01.170
either way did you know I'm gonna start

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.550
this with a weird anecdote I I mean it's

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.400
not really an anecdote it's a question

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.740
movie came out a couple of weeks ago

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.210
it's called American assassin there's

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.970
another movie that comes out this

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.729
weekend it's starring Tim Cruise maybe

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.680
you've heard of him Tim Cruise you know

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.900
the famous Scientologist is called

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.470
American made I had to go look it up cuz

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.090
I only just saw the trailer American

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.619
maids fast and loose attitude with its

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.210
real-life story mirrors the cavalier and

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.140
delightfully watchable energy Tom Cruise

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.420
gives off in the leading role Barry seal

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.890
a TWA pilot is recruited by the CIA to

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.600
provide reconnaissance on the burgeoning

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.310
communist threat in Central America and

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.990
soon finds himself in charge of one of

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.000
the biggest covert CIA operations in the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.790
history of the United States I say this

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.869
I bring up this anecdote because I have

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.840
a question for you

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.829
that you might be able to solve how many

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.920
movies let's say from the Year like 1990

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:59.299
until today start with the word American

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.960
I can think of so many American hustle

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:07.320
all of the American Pie movies what was

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.819
the one American written by max landis I

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.590
think I can't remember that Jesse

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.690
Eisenberg in it it's not American

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.600
Graffiti obviously it's

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:19.730
American than something I can't remember

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:21.200
American McGee's Alice the Americans I'm

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.330
not trying to say that the country is

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.950
full of itself by and large trust me you

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.550
know Canada has a lot of national pride

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.190
as well

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.800
we got movies like you know my Winnipeg

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.350
it just strikes me that American is like

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.550
this ubiquitous word you can always use

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.410
I know if you're outside of North

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.240
America you're probably saying but

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.570
Canada's part of America you take that

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.030
back that's slanderous I can understand

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.800
because I it's a relatable thing you

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.360
know when a when a Canadian says you

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.520
know Finland is part of Scandinavia and

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.890
everyone that's from Scandinavia goes

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.060
know Finland is part of the Nordic

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.860
countries but it's not part of

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.680
Scandinavia and I go oh it was in the

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.870
Kalmar Union and they go no Kalmar Union

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.340
was different than Scandinavia I go ok

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.250
but they're all Baltic and they go no

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.100
the Baltic countries are different um

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.400
dude sure let's perthro that in like a

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.730
heartbeat it's the same thing I know

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.090
it's confusing Canada is in North

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.920
America but it is not America if you're

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.540
from Brazil you're not American your

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.489
South American you're not American I

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.380
know it seems like America would be a

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.200
superset and then South America would be

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.480
a subset it's not the case in our

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.280
colloquial verbiage only people from the

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.300
United States of America are American

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.310
it's weird

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.400
I know I wish we could just change the

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.800
continent name cuz it seems how can you

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.840
not and I'm not saying this to be

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.900
insulting to the United States of

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.720
Americans how can you not think that

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.890
your country is that important right

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.680
more important than other countries I

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.470
should say you are on a continent called

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:02.180
the United States pardon me you're on a

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:04.130
continent called North America below you

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.840
as a continent called South America

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.800
what's your country called the United

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.260
States of America that's like in Africa

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.970
you know there's South Africa feel like

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.470
we need some new continent names they

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.140
are descriptive and I'm not mean none

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.150
this is probably like ignoring a lot of

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.340
you know history and culture and etc etc

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.350
mostly I'm just making a joke here it's

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.190
meant to be a relatively good-natured

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.750
joke but

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.120
you know you learn about all these

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:34.800
countries growing up just walk into a

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.210
dude crush this I'm using turdy touch to

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.479
do like all my damage cuz this is

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:43.409
annoying how can you not feel like

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:45.810
you're at the center of the universe the

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:48.659
kid seems like you're the the crown

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.159
jewel in the in the collection of the

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:51.360
continent if you're named after the

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:53.550
continent itself was all the other

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.560
countries ooh what are they doing you

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.030
know what's Canada called

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.919
you know the northernmost attic of North

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.889
America now we're called Canada what's

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:04.139
Mexico called you know the boot of

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.330
America the necktie of America no it's

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:09.870
called Mexico what's the middle country

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:12.120
called the United States of America

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.940
it's just not fair to the rest of us in

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:18.690
terms of like country names at least it

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:22.349
has you need you know like come on I'm

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:28.560
not saying that America should an access

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:31.440
I love our neighbors to the south most

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:35.430
of the time spend a lot of time in your

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:38.430
country now we're talking we can make

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.900
gold poop by walking into enemies not

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.130
very applicable on this floor because we

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.830
really want to get our deal with the

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:47.039
devil but might be able to use it in a

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.509
pinch to get a bunch of money and maybe

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:48.930
buy something from the shop on this

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:50.370
floor

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:55.620
what we would really benefit from

00:05:50.370 --> 00:06:00.930
actually is if we could get IV bag which

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:04.620
could happen or if we could careful or

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:08.969
if we could get like gimpy for example

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:10.379
or the virus would also be good or mob

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:12.750
the void something along these lines

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:15.629
might might get it's handled for us that

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.550
could be good actually I'm just saying

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:18.779
look this bit it's a little Seinfeld II

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.669
and I don't know if it's going anywhere

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:22.009
Seinfeld ish Seinfeld and you get the

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:24.469
idea

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:26.699
but I think there's some meat to that

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:30.550
like there's no country in Asia that's

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:32.509
called like you know West Asia

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:36.319
Africa is a bad example there's no

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:38.120
country in South America that's like the

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:44.150
United States of America that would be

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:45.409
strange right I don't know maybe there's

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.360
something to it maybe there's not I'm

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:49.999
happy to live in Canada though I don't

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.849
want to lived in the in the namesake you

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:54.169
know I like when you grow up Canadian

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:55.879
you have a cultural identity that's a

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:58.520
little distinct I think from the United

00:06:55.879 --> 00:07:00.590
States of America in that your cultural

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.199
identity pretty much consists of ice

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.689
hockey being nice to people and also not

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:08.360
being the United States of America let's

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:09.830
grab this let's grab this we don't need

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.340
young heart for anything

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:17.110
ah you could almost make a case for my

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.110
shadow but I'm gonna abstain for now I

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:23.900
think that's for the best as we progress

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.550
here so let's look for an arcade and if

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.699
we can get one IV bag we'll be 10 out of

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:31.520
10 I doubt we will get one but I'm also

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:33.289
gonna actually take some time because

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.089
keep in mind we would expect to be able

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:38.210
to buy probably one spirit heart per

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:39.710
floor so we might as well as long as we

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.379
have spirit hearts left over we might as

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.669
well walk into enemies once per floor as

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:45.680
long as we have the keys necessary to

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:48.620
get into the shop and of course this

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.899
time we can't get one makes me look like

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:52.639
a like a dang fool that that's fine we

00:07:50.899 --> 00:07:54.409
get arrow o'clock nonetheless a lovely

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:55.879
selection and then here a font which

00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:58.810
gave us four spirit hearts so you know

00:07:55.879 --> 00:08:00.830
what that'll handle it the coupon I

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:02.120
think other people tend to like the

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:05.060
coupon more than I like the coupon I

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:08.210
don't think it's that good oh sorry I

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.379
mean I don't think it's that well hey

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.779
have you heard of the new song from the

00:08:09.379 --> 00:08:19.159
Matthew good/bad Oh me and intellectual

00:08:11.779 --> 00:08:21.469
you mean the Matthew well band have you

00:08:19.159 --> 00:08:25.699
heard the new track from Kanye West's

00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:27.110
label good music all you mean wull music

00:08:25.699 --> 00:08:31.599
I don't think this is gonna work

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:31.599
I'm trying though I mean caffeinate

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:36.280
joke's on you sheep it's water ain't no

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:40.570
caffeine going on in here and you

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:45.010
believe me last time you trust anybody

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:46.990
on the Internet but then I guess it's

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:49.540
it's confusing right like what I just

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:51.610
think the reason that countries have

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.500
borders the way that they are is because

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:55.210
of you know the the groups of people

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.860
that live there the language they speak

00:08:55.210 --> 00:09:01.810
the culture that they have and also the

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:05.350
events of wars from like yeah we should

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:08.140
reroll this the oh that's extremely good

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:11.170
the the results of wars from like you

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:13.660
know five to eight hundred years ago

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:16.480
right it creates for some confusing

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:20.100
situations like for example there is a

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:21.760
continent named Europe there is a

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:26.710
administrative body called the European

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:28.390
Union not all countries in Europe are in

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:30.780
the European Union make it even more

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:32.620
confusing Europe is connected to Asia

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.060
those countries that are in Europe

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.650
there's countries that are in Asia and

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.150
then there's countries that are in

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:38.500
Eurasia does that mean they're in both

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:42.550
does it mean they're in either I don't

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:45.070
know like Russia is is like it's tomato

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:46.570
you know tomato it's a fruit sometimes

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:48.250
it's a vegetable sometimes sometimes

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:50.230
Russia's in Asia sometimes Russia's in

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:52.560
Europe sometimes it's in both maybe

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:55.060
sometimes it's denied it on top of that

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:57.520
within the European Union you've got

00:09:55.060 --> 00:10:00.130
countries that you can travel to without

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:03.220
actually requiring a passport Schengen

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:10.900
Nations you got the United Kingdom it

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:12.940
includes England Scotland Wales Northern

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:15.040
Ireland what happened Southern Ireland

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:19.420
not a part of it despite being the same

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:21.550
landmass by the way United Kingdom in

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.360
Europe not a part of the European Union

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:24.220
or is it

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.530
nobody knows like this is the kind of

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:29.260
stuff we got to pay somebody to solve

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:30.340
these problems for us it's ridiculous I

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.630
don't even know I don't want to get into

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.190
Scandinavia because it just makes other

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:36.490
people mad and then it makes me mad

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:40.270
because I know you know I've been to

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:41.560
Iceland I know that's not Scandinavia

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.060
but I've been to Iceland I've been to

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.800
Sweden and I followed you know

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:48.430
international hockey for like 28

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:52.029
years not professionally obviously but

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:54.070
you get the idea even still you know I

00:10:52.029 --> 00:10:57.700
try to show respect in Norway Sweden

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:59.200
Finland etc etc they take offense to it

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.760
when I don't know what Scandinavia is

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.589
what's above the country what used to be

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.990
in the Kalmar Union what's a Nordic

00:11:02.589 --> 00:11:08.940
country Iceland sort of in there but

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:11.620
it's not and it's also far away like

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:13.480
Greenland's icy but Iceland's green or

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.890
is it not really like we got all these

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.390
confusing rules that don't make any

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:18.190
sense everybody watching this is

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.750
probably like please to shut up you're

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.910
making yourself look ignorant that's

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.350
what bothers me I want it to be easier

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:27.040
we've made all these complicated rules

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:29.740
in terms of geography I'm actually I

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.329
know what's going on I'm worldly with

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.769
respect to a map maybe less so with

00:11:31.329 --> 00:11:34.839
respect to travel but I've been around

00:11:32.769 --> 00:11:38.130
or been around a little bit I've flown

00:11:34.839 --> 00:11:41.050
over both oceans both of the six oceans

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:46.540
how many oceans are there Atlantic

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:47.950
Pacific arctic southern ocean people

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:52.209
always forget about that one Indian

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:54.250
Ocean five oceans the Atlantic and the

00:11:52.209 --> 00:11:57.730
Pacific really get most of the credit

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:59.410
from a North American standpoint anyway

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:05.079
I'm not gonna do I promise I'm not gonna

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:09.430
do 45 minutes of improv about maps as

00:12:05.079 --> 00:12:13.029
much as I'm tempted to Asia is a little

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:16.300
simpler I think they got less rules that

00:12:13.029 --> 00:12:18.310
I'm aware of at least let me need sure

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.930
you got South Korea North Korea that's

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:21.820
you know you got one special case to

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:28.540
remember there well that's not sure you

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:31.029
got to bet you got Taiwan you got Hong

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:34.720
Kong Hong Kong used to be owned by the

00:12:31.029 --> 00:12:37.329
British which would make it a former

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:42.040
territory of a European country that's

00:12:37.329 --> 00:12:43.810
not part of the European Union but I

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:46.709
feel like we're trying to like explain

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.709
Kingdom Hearts now

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:52.020
which I would never dare to do because

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.790
you know I've played Kingdom Hearts 1 I

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:56.460
have a great anecdote about Kingdom

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:58.470
Hearts 1 I played it it came out in like

00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:02.040
2002 I think which was right around the

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:04.460
time that you know I was I would say

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:08.700
advancing from like adolescence to

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:10.860
teenage years around that area and my

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.150
friend always bought like critically

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.590
acclaimed games he was like the guy who

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.730
would read reviews and be like why you

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:18.210
buy on this you should buy this instead

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:19.290
GamePro gave it a 5 out of 5 to bought

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:23.520
the first Kingdom Hearts very

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:25.160
well-respected game I borrowed it I beat

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:28.560
it and then after that I beat the game

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:30.900
and I handed it back to him in 9th grade

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.520
science class and he acted like I was

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:34.920
trying to give him drugs cuz I guess

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:37.350
like the idea of playing a Final Fantasy

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:39.270
Plus Disney game at the time a little

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:41.190
bit of like poison maybe socially

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:43.910
speaking to the opposite sex he was like

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:46.140
dude what are you doing keep it down I

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:48.690
mean he took the game back cuz he owns

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:50.040
it but he's like you're gonna blow my

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.180
street cred basically I didn't even

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.720
think about it at the time

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:56.490
in hindsight kind of hilarious though

00:13:53.720 --> 00:14:00.360
he's doing he didn't ruin his cred too

00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:04.620
much he's married now and so am I so hey

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:06.390
we're the cool ones apparently you're

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:09.270
that kids you want to be cool just get

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:10.830
married when the time is right oh you

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:14.400
know what we got Tarot cloths so let's

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:17.460
pop strength and I really really want to

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:21.930
make IV bag happen here even more so

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:23.280
than the d6 I think we'll get there one

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:28.530
day you know what blow this guy up load

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:31.770
this guy up Phil look yes it's not as

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:33.600
much as I wanted there but can work with

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.800
it problem is now we don't have the

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.370
strength card backing us up but we still

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:39.810
got like quite a lot of money for it a

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:42.390
little bit behind schedule for boss rush

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:45.020
and luckily we don't actually need to do

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.020
boss rush

00:14:45.859 --> 00:14:54.179
doesn't mean I wouldn't like the

00:14:47.879 --> 00:14:56.129
opportunity but we'll see put that down

00:14:54.179 --> 00:14:59.189
there it's hopefully get like two of

00:14:56.129 --> 00:15:02.009
diamonds ace of clubs I don't want to be

00:14:59.189 --> 00:15:03.419
a naysayer and I also I I respect that

00:15:02.009 --> 00:15:05.039
anything that makes the balance of the

00:15:03.419 --> 00:15:06.269
game a little bit more tilted towards

00:15:05.039 --> 00:15:08.519
making the game difficult without

00:15:06.269 --> 00:15:10.319
compromising the fun factor is a good

00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:11.759
thing for Isaac because the game other

00:15:10.319 --> 00:15:13.349
than gonna ruffle too many feathers here

00:15:11.759 --> 00:15:15.269
it's probably a little too easy if you

00:15:13.349 --> 00:15:17.999
played a bunch of it you know it's very

00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:22.679
easy to engineer yourself a victory on a

00:15:17.999 --> 00:15:24.479
regular basis however I don't really

00:15:22.679 --> 00:15:27.179
like the inclusion of the ace of blank

00:15:24.479 --> 00:15:30.089
cards is there they just make you

00:15:27.179 --> 00:15:30.739
excited and then you realize they're

00:15:30.089 --> 00:15:33.179
garbage

00:15:30.739 --> 00:15:35.879
what's the average payout from like an

00:15:33.179 --> 00:15:38.039
ace of clubs you turn like five cents

00:15:35.879 --> 00:15:40.859
into five bombs wow what a return on

00:15:38.039 --> 00:15:42.749
investment I don't necessarily think

00:15:40.859 --> 00:15:44.249
they're like a bad addition but the way

00:15:42.749 --> 00:15:47.969
that they tilt the balance of how you

00:15:44.249 --> 00:15:48.959
feel when you get a when you get a card

00:15:47.969 --> 00:15:50.579
kind of annoys me

00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:52.499
okay we're one away from becoming Gumpy

00:15:50.579 --> 00:15:56.429
cuz normally used to be like Oh to us

00:15:52.499 --> 00:15:57.689
something that is probably useful or it

00:15:56.429 --> 00:16:00.539
could be a two of hearts which most of

00:15:57.689 --> 00:16:02.219
the time is garbage or it could be a

00:16:00.539 --> 00:16:03.509
Joker card or it could be a chaos card

00:16:02.219 --> 00:16:05.039
or it could be a suicide King or it

00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:06.419
could be cards against humanity' you

00:16:05.039 --> 00:16:07.859
know there's there were only a few

00:16:06.419 --> 00:16:10.199
different outcomes and most of them were

00:16:07.859 --> 00:16:13.799
like pretty positive now it's like oh

00:16:10.199 --> 00:16:17.339
good the ace of blanks don't do doo

00:16:13.799 --> 00:16:19.499
dodoo dodoo dodoo to do if you'd like to

00:16:17.339 --> 00:16:21.479
gamble I'll tell you I'm your man

00:16:19.499 --> 00:16:25.979
win some lose some it's all the same to

00:16:21.479 --> 00:16:27.119
me lemme you're a terrible gambler or

00:16:25.979 --> 00:16:28.859
maybe that's maybe that's a good

00:16:27.119 --> 00:16:31.019
attitude for gambling now that I think

00:16:28.859 --> 00:16:31.529
about it win some lose some it's all the

00:16:31.019 --> 00:16:32.999
same to me

00:16:31.529 --> 00:16:34.469
you know you know your limits stay

00:16:32.999 --> 00:16:38.069
within it treat it as entertainment it's

00:16:34.469 --> 00:16:40.289
probably a positive thing did you know

00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:43.609
and I'm saying this without judgment did

00:16:40.289 --> 00:16:46.619
you know that there is a fairly robust

00:16:43.609 --> 00:16:49.709
community for streaming online casinos

00:16:46.619 --> 00:16:51.659
on Twitch most of the streams are in

00:16:49.709 --> 00:16:53.339
Russian I would say you know again my

00:16:51.659 --> 00:16:55.079
wife's been away so I've been gambling

00:16:53.339 --> 00:16:56.369
all our money away these online casinos

00:16:55.079 --> 00:16:58.120
know I was on there but watching a lot

00:16:56.369 --> 00:16:59.920
more twit

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:02.680
because I'm sitting alone in my office

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:07.059
all night you know in advance of crying

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:10.390
myself to sleep and I bet who's watching

00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:11.980
this trip I watched a a man spin a

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:14.730
virtual slot machine it is for real

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:17.350
money I don't know where they do it but

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:21.459
he was spinning a slot machine like all

00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:24.449
night barely talking it was a very

00:17:21.459 --> 00:17:27.189
strange thing for me and twitches like

00:17:24.449 --> 00:17:28.569
it's not quite good enough it's still

00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:30.660
not quite good enough let's donate a

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:33.429
little we're not doing boss rush anyway

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.990
twitches a little weird in general you

00:17:33.429 --> 00:17:37.570
know do you try to explain it to people

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:40.510
you go yeah I play you know video games

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:42.520
on the internet they go people watch

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:45.220
that well take it a step further what if

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.720
you were like yeah I spin a a slot

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.010
machine for like eight hours and I'd

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.630
sometimes I'd win a couple hundred bucks

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:51.640
sometimes I lose a few hundred bucks but

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:53.500
people just sit there and watch me win

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:56.980
or lose money I'm not by the way don't

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:59.470
take this as macing at all mostly

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:01.960
because again those in glass houses what

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:03.700
are you watching the 500th episode of me

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.290
playing afterbirth plus right now I'm

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:08.230
not those in glass houses shouldn't

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:10.330
throw stones might surprise you contrary

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:16.270
to my persona on the NL s s not a very

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:17.679
genuinely judgmental person I don't for

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:20.770
the most part as long as what you do in

00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:24.210
your life doesn't harm me or harm other

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:25.750
people I'm a pretty okay guy too you

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:27.160
know

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:29.020
copacetic if you're like I love them a

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:31.540
professional origami artist I'd be like

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:33.100
that's amazing behind your back I might

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.600
be like I met somebody's a professional

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.100
origami artist isn't that a little

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:39.309
strange that's as deep as it's gonna get

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:43.450
but yeah I just had no idea I was on

00:18:39.309 --> 00:18:45.070
Twitch at like 11:00 p.m. nobody that I

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:47.020
knew was streaming at the time look at

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:49.929
the most played games casino and then

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:52.570
there's people just Spain in a virtual

00:18:49.929 --> 00:18:53.890
slot machine and I'm not even talking

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:57.940
about Counter Strike global Offensive

00:18:53.890 --> 00:19:00.309
loot boxes hi oh but seriously just

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:04.230
another little oddity in this in this

00:19:00.309 --> 00:19:06.669
world we've carved for ourselves here

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:08.590
there is something like I don't want to

00:19:06.669 --> 00:19:09.170
say sad but there's something melancholy

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:12.040
about it

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:15.080
I guess when you see someone lose like

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:16.880
like I saw a dude pull out like $700

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:20.930
from his bank account and I think you've

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:22.760
got to just accept that there's nothing

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:24.860
you can do about it and maybe he doesn't

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:27.380
even have a problem but at the same time

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:30.170
I was like I feel for that you just I

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:32.510
feel weird when I go to a ATM and I take

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:34.100
out like a hundred bucks this dude just

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:40.820
took out seven hundred bucks to gamble

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:41.960
with live on twitch.tv I guess it's not

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:44.330
against like the twitch Terms of Service

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:45.800
either like I'm assuming it's legal in

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:47.960
the country in which you reside I'm

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:50.960
pretty sure that's how they keep their

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:52.850
hands clean but who knows maybe there's

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:55.900
some nights you know he pulls out 700

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:59.150
700 some other nights he wins you know

00:19:55.900 --> 00:20:00.950
1,200 I don't know it was just it was an

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:02.240
unusual experience for me I'm not saying

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:04.280
they shouldn't be able to do it just

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:13.100
that it was it was something I've never

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:14.570
experienced before I also feel like they

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:17.120
were partnered and I'm not again I

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:18.320
wanted this glass houses thing I'm

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.230
leaning on a little bit here but it's

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:23.540
true because like it's it's a service

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:25.520
but when you like subscribe to somebody

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:27.260
you could be like I is just gonna gamble

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:30.050
it away

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:32.270
maybe but is that any different than you

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:33.650
know people donating and you know you're

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:36.260
opening hearthstone packs or something

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:39.560
like that probably not in fact in many

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:42.470
ways the gambling is probably a better

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:45.200
use of your money cuz gambling it I mean

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:48.470
I am like pretty risk-averse I'm not a

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:50.600
gambler really at all but it's a better

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:53.300
investment than video caves sunk at the

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:56.120
time like if you put a hundred bucks you

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:57.440
know down in a roulette table or you put

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:59.180
a hundred bucks in a like player

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.530
unknowns battlegrounds crates on the

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:02.780
steam marketplace which one do you

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:05.900
think's coming out with more more

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:07.130
expected value probably well maybe not

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.570
roulette but you know who put it down in

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:12.000
a blackjack table or something like that

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:14.440
you're probably in a better spot

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.880
that's why people go like you know these

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.980
video games are like bordering on

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:20.409
gambling with their microtransactions

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:23.980
I'm like bordering on gambling they're

00:21:20.409 --> 00:21:26.139
worse nobody's making any money dude we

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:27.909
got well that's not true the people who

00:21:26.139 --> 00:21:29.740
have you know 100,000 battlegrounds

00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:33.760
accounts and just farm BP are probably

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:36.029
making a little bit of money dude

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:44.470
please by the way the egghead looks

00:21:36.029 --> 00:21:45.760
ridiculous on this one of course you'll

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:49.659
always lose

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:54.490
if you gamble enough and you're not a

00:21:49.659 --> 00:21:56.080
professional which is I guess really

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:57.880
something you can only attain maybe in

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.590
poker or in blackjack but they can also

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.840
like kick you out of the sea I think

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:03.309
that's like there's all those stories of

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.840
like these guys learn how to count cards

00:22:03.309 --> 00:22:06.490
they got really good at it they get

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:09.370
kicked out of the casinos how's that

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:12.580
fair I understand the casinos there to

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:14.679
like make their own money nothing wrong

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:18.000
with that it's a service I can

00:22:14.679 --> 00:22:20.950
understand how it could be entertaining

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.840
but like they're just using their noggin

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:24.789
you know if somebody's really bad at

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:27.760
blackjack and they're like you know hey

00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:29.500
I'm on 19 hit me

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.840
dealers like I really suggest you stay

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.039
and they're like nah hit me they're not

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.720
gonna kick him out of the casino for

00:22:33.039 --> 00:22:35.919
being too bad they're like we just don't

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:40.059
feel good about taking your money this

00:22:35.919 --> 00:22:41.769
isn't fair somebody you know learns how

00:22:40.059 --> 00:22:44.289
to count cards they got a statistically

00:22:41.769 --> 00:22:46.690
slightly increased advantage

00:22:44.289 --> 00:22:52.240
oh dude safety scissors was awesome here

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:57.970
with the tower um we got lucky I'd say

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:59.679
it still 21 bombs not bad casino just

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:02.320
you can kick them out I guess they can

00:22:59.679 --> 00:23:03.700
deny service to anybody but can they

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:05.529
probably I mean it's not like it's a

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:08.789
fundamental human right it's not like

00:23:05.529 --> 00:23:08.789
they're denying you like food and water

00:23:09.779 --> 00:23:13.710
I guess the other alternative is you

00:23:12.239 --> 00:23:15.450
could just let them stay forever and

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:21.629
then they'll bankrupt you probably not

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:23.669
bankrupt that's a strong statement you

00:23:21.629 --> 00:23:24.779
know what they should do if if I ran a

00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:27.659
casino here's what I do

00:23:24.779 --> 00:23:29.909
cuz everybody in a casino I think they

00:23:27.659 --> 00:23:30.989
either know or they should know that the

00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:33.330
house always wins

00:23:30.989 --> 00:23:35.460
casino has a statistical advantage in

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:36.869
every game in the house even blackjack

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:38.909
when played perfectly is something like

00:23:36.869 --> 00:23:43.879
you know fifty point eight percent in

00:23:38.909 --> 00:23:47.129
the casinos advantage what I would do

00:23:43.879 --> 00:23:48.570
and this is why the government will

00:23:47.129 --> 00:23:50.369
never let me own a casino because this

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:54.570
proposal would definitely get crapped on

00:23:50.369 --> 00:23:56.940
I would make it so that one table in the

00:23:54.570 --> 00:24:00.719
whole casino every night selected at

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:03.089
random actually had like a 55 to 45

00:24:00.719 --> 00:24:06.749
advantage for the player but I wouldn't

00:24:03.089 --> 00:24:08.969
tell anybody what table it was and this

00:24:06.749 --> 00:24:10.349
is why this is highly illegal but you

00:24:08.969 --> 00:24:11.700
can see where I'm coming from right

00:24:10.349 --> 00:24:14.249
everyone would be like I was at the PI

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:16.889
Gow table on the third floor near the

00:24:14.249 --> 00:24:19.769
Jade Empire win it was definitely the

00:24:16.889 --> 00:24:21.929
good table dude I won so many times the

00:24:19.769 --> 00:24:24.269
other people are like I was at the seven

00:24:21.929 --> 00:24:26.940
card stud table down near the Britney

00:24:24.269 --> 00:24:32.330
Spears theater that was definitely the

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:34.529
high odds table dude I'm telling you

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:37.440
because everybody in the casino right

00:24:34.529 --> 00:24:38.339
now they know and they they're smarter

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:41.009
than the casino because they know

00:24:38.339 --> 00:24:42.809
they're gonna lose how do you get the

00:24:41.009 --> 00:24:44.849
the edge back on them because casinos

00:24:42.809 --> 00:24:47.879
clearly don't make enough money you just

00:24:44.849 --> 00:24:52.739
trick people know if I own the casino I

00:24:47.879 --> 00:24:54.899
would just lie I would take money for

00:24:52.739 --> 00:24:56.279
the chips and then when people brought

00:24:54.899 --> 00:24:58.019
the chips back and we're like hey I've

00:24:56.279 --> 00:24:59.759
got more money I'd be like oh sorry we

00:24:58.019 --> 00:25:01.979
don't have enough come back tomorrow and

00:24:59.759 --> 00:25:04.919
then when they came back the next day it

00:25:01.979 --> 00:25:06.599
wouldn't even be a casino turns out it

00:25:04.919 --> 00:25:11.960
was just an old blockbuster with a slot

00:25:06.599 --> 00:25:11.960
machine in it you got grifted son

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:16.900
it's not a good way to run a business I

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:19.600
think maybe you should just like you got

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:23.650
the money to open a casino can you just

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:25.930
do that by the way like if I was like

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:28.990
Warren Buffett could I just be like hey

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:30.850
I would like to build a casino here I

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:33.450
understand you got a great damage by the

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:36.250
way I understand you got to run it by

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:37.930
you know there's some proposals you know

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:39.790
it can't be this close to a school and

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:44.800
you know probably can't be this close to

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:46.570
blah blah blah blah but it's not like

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.620
the kind of thing where is it does

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:49.270
something have to go through City Hall

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:53.520
I'm actually gonna keep gambling on this

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:53.520
right here what it wouldn't I really

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:03.820
don't think it's bad to take glitter

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:05.320
bombs here what I'm getting is like can

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:07.000
you just is the one of those businesses

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.290
where you know maybe you got to run it

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.140
by the Chamber of Commerce or something

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:13.780
but presumably if I wanted to open a

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:16.660
subway for example not not a metro line

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:18.280
but a sandwich shop I would franchise it

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.600
through subway you know I would get the

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.770
property I'd go to the Chamber of

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.210
Commerce and would you not have a

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:23.380
business plan and I'd be like here I

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:25.090
want to build a subway here and they'd

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:29.950
be like approved you just do that with a

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:31.630
casino it seems like the kind of thing a

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:35.170
it's pretty expensive because you need

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:40.360
like a big space obviously a lot of

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:42.040
parking a lot of staff you got to pay

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:46.170
Phil Collins like a hundred million

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:46.170
dollars to play 200 shows a year etc etc

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:52.290
will just get Criss Angel oh he's

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:52.290
already at the MGM Grand

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:56.550
it still doesn't seem like one of those

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.860
businesses you can just open but I'm

00:26:56.550 --> 00:27:02.150
probably incorrect to be honest with you

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:05.130
I'm gonna take spirit of the night

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:06.930
probably shouldn't I'm just a bad habit

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:09.330
of taking like every deal with the devil

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:11.450
that shows up but this is a good one at

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:11.450
least

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:17.040
all right curse of the lost way behind

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.410
schedule for boss rush which is kind of

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:23.640
surprising for me because we do have

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:26.010
8.43 damage rate of fire wasn't great

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:29.400
before but is quite good now maybe I

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:32.370
just got distracted with the casino talk

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:35.460
and the endless lectures about North

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:37.860
America and Europe and how can you be

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:41.130
pulled in the North American Union if

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:43.050
you're not bow to the blah blah and then

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:47.610
you don't even get me started on the

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:55.470
Benelux countries dude safety scissors

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:57.060
has like extremely paid out for us why

00:27:55.470 --> 00:28:04.080
does it still feel like our damage is

00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:07.860
trash because it's like maybe because

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:09.870
it's like we're doing 8.43 damage per

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:11.580
shot with a good rate of fire the tears

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:14.820
don't do anything after they hit well

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:17.880
it's not true they pierce but not good

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:19.980
enough not good enough they they don't

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:22.920
like explode they don't freeze the enemy

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:24.300
in place they don't do more damage the

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.940
further away from me they get which

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:28.260
reminds me that we're probably due for a

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:31.740
Krampus fight especially cuz we've had

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:33.960
goat head for a hundred years but let's

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:36.120
go back and reroll the kidney bean I

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:38.850
guess also our speed is not that great

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:40.470
so that can inhibit you when it comes to

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:44.490
finishing a run relatively quickly this

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:48.690
is an opportunity though rate of fire

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:50.280
got a lot worse as did range but speed

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:51.680
and damage went up let's give this a

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:53.760
test

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:56.190
I'm telling you most of the time

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:59.490
eventually you'll you'll get like an

00:28:56.190 --> 00:29:01.200
almost guaranteed better run as long as

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:03.540
you're okay with sacrificing like your

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:05.710
your range dad or maybe your speeds dead

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:08.680
I'd rather not sack speed here but

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:09.040
red chest guppy great it's fine it's

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.360
fine

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:14.530
doesn't even bother we didn't get hurt

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:18.010
on the exit either damage has gone way

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:20.740
down speed is down rate of fire is up a

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:22.930
little this is not catastrophic but it's

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:24.570
much worse than what we started with not

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:27.160
even the first roll the first roll was

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:29.380
actually an improvement this is a

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:32.260
regression beyond the the original

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:33.580
starting point that's fine

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:45.070
two more rooms after this we should be

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:49.380
good thumbtack don't need it honestly we

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:49.380
already have spectral and piercing shots

00:29:50.790 --> 00:30:02.980
please Lord it's taken a little too much

00:29:54.400 --> 00:30:04.960
effort to take these guys out even I

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:11.140
feel weird about it but five point nine

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:12.670
three damage is quite good it's funny

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:17.290
how like when you're normally playing as

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:19.150
Maggie 0.91 speed before you unlock that

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:21.280
speed pill it always seems bad but it

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:25.180
never seems like horrible I think at

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:27.520
least after you're up at like 1.2 speed

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:33.790
which we were for a bit now it feels

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:37.800
like this is torturous it's like we've

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:40.480
had a privilege snatched away from us

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:42.400
and it hurts even more than if we'd

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.780
never known it at all it's like a it's a

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.900
better to have loved and lost you know

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:48.400
City of Angels situation I'm not talking

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:51.820
about Los Angeles I'm talking about the

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:53.950
movie City of Angels which may have

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:57.010
taken place in Los Angeles but was also

00:30:53.950 --> 00:31:01.330
literally about Nicolas Cage being an

00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:04.240
angel like our speed just keeps getting

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:05.560
worse our rate of fire keeps getting

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:08.370
better and our damage is kind of

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:10.000
flip-flopping but our speed is just

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:11.620
terrible now

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.860
this is one of the rare times I mean I

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:17.820
guess we should be honest like if your

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:22.560
stats can get way better as a result of

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:22.560
the d8 they can probably get way worse

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:28.150
pair thrill well we got another instance

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:37.410
at least dude we still definitely have a

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:40.750
shop huh I'm movin for the gas algae's

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:44.910
which was also an a was or maybe I don't

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:44.910
know well we do have taro cloth so I

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:49.060
think that actually might be for the

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:52.840
best

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:55.840
sure we got a damage downgrade or a rate

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:57.790
of fire downgrade without a damage

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.270
increase where our speed is now high

00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:00.070
enough

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:03.280
I would like to shoot faster I won't you

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:12.900
know lie to you on that one but this

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:12.900
isn't that bad so many bombs hilarious I

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:21.280
don't necessarily think more options is

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:23.410
worth it here that is huge actually

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:25.330
garbage donate as much money as we can

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:28.960
donation machine making like very very

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:30.400
slow progress up there if we have the

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:33.990
money left over we might buy there's

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.990
options but I doubt it's that valuable

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:40.050
really it only gives us something on on

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:42.610
the womb one

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:44.800
he's a worth seven cents to have a an

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:50.280
extra charge on the boom one I would say

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:50.280
no I think egghead blocked a shot as we

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:58.990
as we did that get missing page two

00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:00.340
alright well we kind of like made our

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:03.650
bed now we have to lie in it was just

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:09.410
hold d8 situation

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:11.720
I would rather have some v8 right now

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:15.350
I'll tell you you know what I wouldn't

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:16.880
I'm happier to have the DEA than v8 v8

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:18.710
of course vegetable juice I don't know

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:20.710
I'm against a Canadian brand I'm not

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:23.570
sure

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:27.020
v8 performed one of the greatest

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:28.250
marketing lies I guess I shouldn't say

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:28.850
that it's a lie cuz I don't know if

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:31.730
that's true

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:34.280
v8 I mean no I don't mean to defame you

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:35.450
here but v8 juice when I was a kid was

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:38.720
like who wants to eat carrot juice

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:41.000
that's grouse and then they came out

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:42.920
with a product called v8 splash that was

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.620
just vegetable juice mixed with fruit

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:48.170
juice and sugar and then all of a sudden

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:49.580
everybody was drinking it they were like

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:52.340
it's vegetable juice but it tastes good

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:54.250
they broke the mold this is before like

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:57.650
I was old enough to be cynical about

00:33:54.250 --> 00:34:00.020
pseudo health health products but yeah

00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:01.490
it wasn't very good for you but it made

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:04.220
you think that it was good for you which

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:07.310
may placebo eclis have had a little bit

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:08.810
of an effect if only medical science can

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:11.840
come up with some name for the effect

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:13.429
that a placebo has on you when you don't

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:17.179
know that it's a placebo so we're

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:22.490
actually first off we're scared but we

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:27.470
want to go to Z light side paths so

00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:29.659
we'll take this you might think I'm a

00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:34.030
dreamer but I'm not the only one I

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:36.470
promise you that a talent face thank you

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:38.090
now that we got the Polaroid I want to I

00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:40.280
want to play this and like hopefully get

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:41.990
something half decent out of demon

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:44.140
judgment and you know he's led us down

00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:47.659
for the final time retro vision

00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:49.909
beautiful with to luck we could have

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:51.710
taken a theme but I don't think it's the

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:54.290
right call it's just a little too scary

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:55.700
I think with the limited amount of HP

00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:59.990
that we have but I do think we'll get a

00:34:55.700 --> 00:35:04.400
win here that doesn't really affect it

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:06.470
we we need a lot of things and the

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:08.060
interesting thing is that everything

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:11.160
that we need could pretty much be

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:14.130
accomplished by one good roll of the DA

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:17.519
rate of fire is actually completely fine

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:20.490
if the rate of fire wanted to go up by

00:35:17.519 --> 00:35:21.900
two I wouldn't even be mad assuming that

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:28.769
it came with a corresponding amount of

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:31.220
damage but we need more than 4.77 damage

00:35:28.769 --> 00:35:33.180
I think the d8 has been a bust so far

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:34.769
should've stuck with what we had the

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:38.160
first time but where's the fun in that

00:35:34.769 --> 00:35:41.069
right to a hearts not useful yet may

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:43.500
well never be speed up along with a

00:35:41.069 --> 00:35:47.430
spirit heart is very good and our speed

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:52.069
is actually totally acceptable HP is now

00:35:47.430 --> 00:36:00.480
at a better level we're still hurtin for

00:35:52.069 --> 00:36:01.980
a squirtin in the damage department it's

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:04.230
like these guys should not be taking

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:07.049
that many shots to kill so we get a much

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:08.730
better like doubled our damage have

00:36:07.049 --> 00:36:10.500
their rate of fire so we're almost in

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:14.640
the exact same boat so we'll try it

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:16.349
again okay this is better our rate of

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.630
fire and our damage are both better than

00:36:16.349 --> 00:36:19.890
they were before

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:21.779
we're also only one item away from

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:25.130
becoming Guppies so as of right now I'm

00:36:21.779 --> 00:36:25.130
like I'm pleased with where we're at

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:33.329
might keep rolling cuz I don't know

00:36:28.559 --> 00:36:34.829
what's good for me but to cross that

00:36:33.329 --> 00:36:36.779
bridge when we come to it I suppose we

00:36:34.829 --> 00:36:42.059
did not egghead is the greatest of all

00:36:36.779 --> 00:36:43.500
items okay that's it we should don't

00:36:42.059 --> 00:36:45.410
press your luck too much further we kind

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:48.059
of got it there rate of fire is amazing

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:51.799
damage is good and we got piercing shots

00:36:48.059 --> 00:36:54.089
range is like not very good at all but

00:36:51.799 --> 00:36:56.079
still that's not that bad in the whole

00:36:54.089 --> 00:36:58.839
scheme of things is it

00:36:56.079 --> 00:37:04.779
yeah this this is like a Gatling gun I

00:36:58.839 --> 00:37:10.420
think I'm okay with this I've probably

00:37:04.779 --> 00:37:12.519
had better outcomes with a d8 but this

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:17.709
is beyond acceptable it was worth the

00:37:12.519 --> 00:37:20.619
loss of the d6 probably that's what I'm

00:37:17.709 --> 00:37:23.229
gonna tell myself at least but I'm also

00:37:20.619 --> 00:37:25.749
gonna keep rolling hey we did it again

00:37:23.229 --> 00:37:28.479
damage has gone up speeds gone up at the

00:37:25.749 --> 00:37:32.579
cost of our range range is almost

00:37:28.479 --> 00:37:32.579
getting into like number one territory

00:37:33.239 --> 00:37:50.670
but not quite tower

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:50.670
we still have safety scissors so

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:57.850
I don't think we're ever gonna use these

00:37:54.310 --> 00:38:02.200
bombs I came this the the last run was

00:37:57.850 --> 00:38:03.730
kind of like this as well or was it late

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.960
do I know what I'm talking about the

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:09.700
last run might not have been like this

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:10.660
at all the run is so long despite our

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:13.270
good stance

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:22.720
like we never even sniffed it boss rush

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:25.390
past the third or fourth floor doubled

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:28.260
our damage have that rate of fire lost

00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:34.090
some speed gained some range it's like

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:36.040
worse but not by much nothing we need

00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:39.400
that we already seemed up he said I

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:41.080
can't recall we got to guppy items don't

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:43.300
remember what they were though one of

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:44.620
them was clearly the hairball sorry one

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:48.250
of them is clearly the collar I mean

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:50.140
because I can see it in the item bar but

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:53.340
also we've got times one question mark

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:56.020
by our health bar what was the other one

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:59.890
that was my bad I took the retro vision

00:38:56.020 --> 00:39:07.330
pill I just can't resist being trolled

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:10.720
like that small rock one of these days

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:13.360
have dour damage greatly raised our

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:16.570
speed made our rate of fire slightly

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:18.580
better we're back in the in the tube to

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:21.520
charge shuffle as I like to call it I've

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:23.410
been saying it for years when you have

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:25.890
to you know double down on using your

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:28.120
space bar item no that's not very good

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:30.430
the strength card is awesome though

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:31.780
because we have goat heads so we can use

00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:33.850
the strength card to make our deals with

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:35.230
the devil much cheaper especially if we

00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:37.240
do we get two of them that was almost

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:40.390
the greatest like cell phone on a Dodge

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:43.420
ever card please card okay that was my

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:46.270
card I mean battery not a good day for

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:50.230
the allah verbal verbal verbal reasoning

00:39:46.270 --> 00:40:02.740
center apparently you got for me

00:39:50.230 --> 00:40:05.980
conquest conquest conquest congress is

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:09.100
there a donkey kong country donkey kong

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:16.170
country game with conquest in it's

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:16.170
donkey kong country named razor blade

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:20.980
that's weird back down in the fives on

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:27.310
damage and i hate it

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:30.600
oh we roll my whole run I'm ready

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:34.060
the runs fine but I welcome the same

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:36.370
strength is still good stick with that

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:37.750
I'm looking for uh I guess like starter

00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:40.720
deck would make it so we can get cards

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:42.580
out of this but good pills speed retro

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:44.849
vision tella pills tell appeals yet

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:48.660
again

00:40:44.849 --> 00:40:50.460
just keep getting charges we're getting

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:52.769
close to like if it ain't broke don't

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:54.239
fix the territory which I wouldn't

00:40:52.769 --> 00:40:56.099
expect you to know what that means cuz

00:40:54.239 --> 00:41:02.150
essentially it is no relation to what

00:40:56.099 --> 00:41:05.069
I'm about to say but if we get a good

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:06.150
state as far as our stats are we

00:41:05.069 --> 00:41:09.739
shouldn't mess with it anymore I think

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:09.739
we should just roll with it

00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:15.479
cuz right now we we're always like it's

00:41:13.769 --> 00:41:19.559
some Gift of the Magi stuff we're always

00:41:15.479 --> 00:41:22.619
trading a good stat to make another stat

00:41:19.559 --> 00:41:24.359
good but over time like occasionally we

00:41:22.619 --> 00:41:25.890
walk it up a little bit so like all of

00:41:24.359 --> 00:41:27.599
our stats that matter come up

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:31.470
occasionally we walk it down a little

00:41:27.599 --> 00:41:40.140
bit like that was good more than doubled

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:41.489
our damage halved our rate of fire but I

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:43.799
worry if we do it again who knows we

00:41:41.489 --> 00:41:47.279
ready you know 20 damage and a 20 rate

00:41:43.799 --> 00:41:51.660
of fire that's not nearly as good if my

00:41:47.279 --> 00:41:55.729
math checks out yeah that was pretty bad

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:58.499
um huh

00:41:55.729 --> 00:42:01.619
well the extremely good stick with this

00:41:58.499 --> 00:42:04.289
never change it only our speed stat

00:42:01.619 --> 00:42:06.239
stinks here are our damage and rate of

00:42:04.289 --> 00:42:07.979
fire are both amazing see what did I

00:42:06.239 --> 00:42:08.900
tell you you stick with me you're gonna

00:42:07.979 --> 00:42:11.999
go far

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:14.099
after 18 rolls we finally got a good

00:42:11.999 --> 00:42:17.579
permutation in fact the best permutation

00:42:14.099 --> 00:42:19.049
we could have asked for it I don't know

00:42:17.579 --> 00:42:19.769
if it actually gets them but much better

00:42:19.049 --> 00:42:21.989
than this

00:42:19.769 --> 00:42:26.339
cuz we for might be the tear cap as far

00:42:21.989 --> 00:42:28.319
as our existing parameters go but what

00:42:26.339 --> 00:42:32.940
if we did just one more roll no you're

00:42:28.319 --> 00:42:35.069
the you're the devil on my shoulder

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:40.489
you're the icing on the cake on the

00:42:35.069 --> 00:42:40.489
table in my wake for modest mouse

00:42:41.079 --> 00:42:48.789
yeah that's right any no float on

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:51.410
reference we go for the deep cuts here

00:42:48.789 --> 00:42:53.749
absolutely let's give it a try gimpy

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:56.749
good pick-up rod and baby gray pick two

00:42:53.749 --> 00:42:58.609
of the best one heart items we lucked

00:42:56.749 --> 00:43:00.079
out big time there and that was all for

00:42:58.609 --> 00:43:01.489
the low low cost of a strength car

00:43:00.079 --> 00:43:04.640
because that HP was not going with us

00:43:01.489 --> 00:43:14.630
long-term this would be a great time for

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:15.890
egghead didn't work out however didn't

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:27.380
work out twice but it was still the

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:30.219
right decision to check well at this

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:33.319
point we know the chest is coming up

00:43:30.219 --> 00:43:35.180
don't really want that and we're not

00:43:33.319 --> 00:43:39.769
really using our existing space bar item

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:41.900
but we also just don't care about a mr.

00:43:39.769 --> 00:43:45.710
boom we already have 58 bombs

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:50.180
the bombs are good we could use a better

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:52.369
space bar item what constitutes a better

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:57.739
space bar item shoopdawhoop 10 out of 10

00:43:52.369 --> 00:44:00.079
right now anything that gives us HP you

00:43:57.739 --> 00:44:05.809
know momma mega for the chest here I go

00:44:00.079 --> 00:44:07.789
again my my how can I resist you lots of

00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:08.569
stuff I mean all the items that are good

00:44:07.789 --> 00:44:14.469
are still good

00:44:08.569 --> 00:44:17.150
probably even if we can get the v6 back

00:44:14.469 --> 00:44:19.249
do you 100 I don't we've got it unlocked

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:21.969
yet but you're a sly fellow and or lady

00:44:19.249 --> 00:44:28.119
what's the what's the analog to fella

00:44:21.969 --> 00:44:33.589
Dame trying to think I feel like there's

00:44:28.119 --> 00:44:35.950
there's more names for guys than there

00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:40.800
are for women

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:45.060
you got you know fella served

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:48.400
jabroni nincompoop

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:51.000
think I might be off the rails here well

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:55.440
we will pick up these bombs needlessly

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.440
we really did luck out with that roll

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:08.470
have 12 damaged 13 damaged really in a

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:10.860
four rate of fire is solid better than

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:10.860
solid

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:16.180
it's like a particularly dense mineral

00:45:13.869 --> 00:45:18.190
like a quartz or something like that he

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:19.930
said hoping that quartz was a dense

00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:21.580
mineral cuz he knows nothing about rocks

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:23.880
I know that there's a mineral called

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:26.890
coming tonight I know that there's a

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:29.320
there's a property of you know

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:30.910
geological bodies called cleavage that's

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:33.760
about it you know I lived with an

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:35.800
engineering student pretty much all

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:37.750
throughout university he was always

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:39.280
laughing about cleavage less so about

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:41.350
coming tonight I found that one out on

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:47.140
the Internet as I learned most of my

00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:48.790
knowledge in this life I don't know why

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:50.740
I was waiting for like a deal with the

00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:54.490
devil to show up there so this is a big

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:56.470
one we're gonna unlock the relic thanks

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:58.390
for prompting my memory there the relic

00:45:56.470 --> 00:46:02.350
is a great passive item I'll be very

00:45:58.390 --> 00:46:03.369
happy to have it don't care I care I'm

00:46:02.350 --> 00:46:09.910
for it

00:46:03.369 --> 00:46:11.470
don't care like super don't care in fact

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:13.270
I actually shouldn't care about rubber

00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:14.770
cement because our range is low enough

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:18.810
that it's almost never gonna work for us

00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:21.220
that is not take Abul red lower than I

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:23.080
feel like this is I'm a fraud saying

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:25.000
this we're at lower than Maggie's base

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:28.690
speed because Maggie's base speed is one

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:33.010
now isn't it when she takes the pill or

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:34.990
is it 0.9 when she takes the pill luck

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:37.990
stat is 2 so it wouldn't be surprised if

00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:43.740
we got like one or two extra items here

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:43.740
I already got the one I guess so it's

00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:48.220
time for us to sink our teeth into the

00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:57.490
two and maybe the one ninda to Linda

00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:59.290
here we go what was our synergy with

00:46:57.490 --> 00:47:03.570
safety scissors oh is the glowing

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:06.010
hourglass right you can create like

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:07.570
unlimited and extra bombs for yourself

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:09.850
using one of your five glowing hourglass

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:12.130
charges I've read it out a couple

00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:15.070
episodes ago I remember I vaguely

00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:17.860
remember it now start a pronunciation

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:20.280
war argument in the comments mmm I

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:25.140
vaguely remember eating a plague bagel

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:25.140
for supper yesterday on my Chesterfield

00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:30.240
look at how Canadian are you test a

00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:39.250
plagued bagel is not really a real thing

00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:42.090
but a Chesterfield is supper is just

00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:45.100
what I mean I think it's a british ism

00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:47.950
we inherited a lot of our discourse or a

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:49.480
dialect from england for sure we don't

00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:51.340
call it high school up here at least

00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:54.570
like where I grew up we didn't call it

00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:58.180
high school we call it secondary school

00:47:54.570 --> 00:48:00.580
if someone asks you you know what level

00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:03.310
of school are you in we'd be like I'm in

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:05.350
high school if you wrote it down on a

00:48:03.310 --> 00:48:10.300
form we'd say I'm a secondary school

00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:11.740
student no question for me at least some

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:15.940
people call it supper instead of dinner

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:17.050
what you eat for supper trying to think

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:18.820
of the other ones I don't know I've

00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:21.670
never been to England that's not true

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:24.070
I went to England for a week this just

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:26.320
immediately undermine my own point ok

00:48:24.070 --> 00:48:28.960
Book of Revelations we'll take it it's

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:31.440
worth something and suppose we could

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:35.369
also actually use remote detonator here

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:38.720
get into some funky times

00:48:35.369 --> 00:48:44.420
I sampled all of the great English

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:45.569
culture I ate and Gregg's and also

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:50.809
Weatherspoon's

00:48:45.569 --> 00:48:57.930
and also was that place called Piett I

00:48:50.809 --> 00:49:01.920
drank a Newcastle Brown Ale I went to a

00:48:57.930 --> 00:49:03.660
pub that had an old-timey name like you

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:05.160
know the Swan and rhinoceros and then

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:07.200
found out that it was owned by this

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:10.410
company that owns like infinity pubs in

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:12.450
England really messed up on that one I

00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:13.950
ate fish and chips and then posted about

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:15.420
it on Twitter and everyone said those

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:17.910
aren't real fish and chips and I said

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:20.130
well that's you guys aren't being very

00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:21.539
nice everyone I don't understand it's

00:49:20.130 --> 00:49:22.890
like the way I feel about poutine I

00:49:21.539 --> 00:49:24.539
guess sometimes people will clean me a

00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:25.829
photo of poutine and I go it looks like

00:49:24.539 --> 00:49:27.359
it tastes good but that's not poutine

00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:28.650
because poutine uses cheese curds and

00:49:27.359 --> 00:49:30.210
you know you don't have enough gravy

00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:31.859
coverage there and also the French fries

00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:33.210
are way too thinly cut I mean what is

00:49:31.859 --> 00:49:35.759
this McDonald's and then they they're

00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:37.829
probably just like shut up this is my

00:49:35.759 --> 00:49:39.660
lunch it's not making fun of my lunch

00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:42.089
everyone was like those aren't hey you

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:43.619
come to a a chip truck of the north of

00:49:42.089 --> 00:49:45.839
Battersea and you'll find out what a

00:49:43.619 --> 00:49:48.119
real you know you got bet it probably

00:49:45.839 --> 00:49:49.739
even cost you a 10 quid to eat those I

00:49:48.119 --> 00:49:52.710
was like come on dude I'm a tourist just

00:49:49.739 --> 00:49:54.720
let me let me be ignorant and then post

00:49:52.710 --> 00:50:00.720
this picture and act as if I understand

00:49:54.720 --> 00:50:02.489
other cultures it's not a real fish and

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:04.739
chips unless they serve you out of an

00:50:02.489 --> 00:50:06.869
old trashcan in the back of a newspapers

00:50:04.739 --> 00:50:07.289
