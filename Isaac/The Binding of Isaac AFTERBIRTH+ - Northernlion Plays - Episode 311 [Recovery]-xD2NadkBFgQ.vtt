00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.629
hey everybody welcome back to northern

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.970
land please abiding advice again for the

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.980
class where we are gods who will never

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.750
lose an Isaac again until possibly just

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.540
right as we school we've gotten oh I

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:17.699
mean it's not horrible 0 8 gy 7 7 NZ we

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.140
have not good luck and then tough love

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.400
so that's not a great synergy but it

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.260
could pop off in the future

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:28.500
speed is bad damage is bad rate of fire

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.359
is now also bad but our HP is good at

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.070
least I was about to say like at least

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.530
our rate of fire is better than average

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.059
but you know things change so I one of

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.469
my earliest questions for this run was

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.640
already answered actually and that was

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.410
Ken tough love give us teeth if we have

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.840
below zero luck because if it's like a

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.800
multiple Vig I mean yeah I'm adjusting

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.360
my nerd glasses here Midas touch lovely

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.379
item if we can get it to pop and it's

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.289
not that hard to get to pop if we have a

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.449
multiplicative effect off of our luck

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.450
when it comes to tough love then there's

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.049
a chance that below zero luck would just

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.640
give us no teeth five extra bombs also

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.799
lovely here because I spent one bomb to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.409
make this happen so you know it were

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.020
really just sort of riding this until we

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.060
can get anything that allows us to use

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.340
Midas touch or until we can up our

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.689
damage like on this floor our HP is

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.909
thankfully good enough that if we take

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.380
some hits it doesn't really matter and

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.840
there's a few different avenues for us

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.700
to really pop off you know traditionally

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.340
you just Wakeley get some high damage

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.320
stuff fine I'll go this way then and and

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.689
that'll do the job just fine

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.540
and if that happens great the other

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.619
option for us would be to get unicorn

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.210
horn or something like that and then

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.060
Midas touch means we win the game easily

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.610
the other option is to have our luck

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.140
stat you know increasingly pop off more

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.210
and more and then we'll have you know an

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.770
incredibly high damage tooth that comes

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.200
out on occasion probably not enough to

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.149
win the game by itself but you know

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.979
enough to do some serious damage to

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.229
enemies the thing we want to avoid

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.600
actually and it's you're going to laugh

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:11.190
but it's actually a little dangerous

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.720
here is curse of the maze making us not

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.150
go into the boss room when we think

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.470
we're going into the boss room lead

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.239
to me pressing the spacebar and

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.739
accidentally killing myself with Plan C

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:25.250
you should know from how I described

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.840
that that this is the thing that I have

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.120
experience with not with Plan C

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.150
specifically but definitely like you

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.170
know using maybe the shears accidentally

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.090
when you think you're about to go to a

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.290
bathroom and you're like ah now I don't

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.799
have the shears anymore for the boss

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.140
fight like I was tempted to press the

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.849
spacebar right there

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.200
I've got a slower roll a little bit here

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.409
what I'm trying to get at is basically

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.569
the faster we can get rid of Plan C the

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:53.000
better my life is going to be the faster

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:56.269
we can get rid of Plan C the better my

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.980
life is going to be full i pill full

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:04.760
health pill it just sticks in your brain

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:08.090
I mean it's a lock upgrade and it's a

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.139
range upgrade is it the songs that

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.340
remind us of the good times and the

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:11.959
songs that remind us of the best times

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.220
well now that's tough dumping much of a

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:19.239
Wamba who I didn't know until my adult

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:23.569
years if you look up Chumbawamba on

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.879
Wikipedia they're actually like beyond

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.849
tub-thumping

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:32.359
they're actually a renowned like

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:33.079
anarchist folk band and I'm not saying

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.409
like that

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:39.049
necessarily maybe I'm the weird one for

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:40.790
finding that surprising but it's like

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.470
really usually when you look up a

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.680
one-hit wonder you're like okay it's the

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.870
same story like you know song hit number

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.400
one and then the band broke up because

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.840
they can never replicate that level of

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.419
success they got used to and blah blah

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.370
blah you know now what do they do when

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:56.690
it works is you know executive producer

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.459
at a record company or something like

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.780
that

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.430
Chumbawamba sort of expected you know

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.840
that and now they live in Manchester and

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.750
they do like you know they tours

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.489
occasionally but no they're like a

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:12.709
working anarchist folk band what is

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:15.470
anarchist folk I guess I'm happy I

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:18.289
replaced the plan see here but I I have

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.789
no idea but I would encourage when I

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:22.039
tweeted about this is like four years

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:23.960
ago now people were like yeah dude they

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.700
got some good stuff I'm not even

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.979
suggesting that they don't I'm just I

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.560
was surprised

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:33.840
you don't expect to find like when you

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.690
you know Wikipedia snow of course famous

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.490
for Informer something something

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.320
something something something a liqueur

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.440
boom boom down you don't expect to be

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.910
like oh yes no now he's like you know

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.130
Mark Zuckerberg right-hand man its

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.720
Facebook I mean honestly

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.680
maybe we'd be better off if he where I

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.419
don't know where I'm going with that

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.539
that just doesn't make any sense

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.770
okay got HP we're gonna take both of

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:05.039
these and hope that they're high yields

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:09.030
yeah yeah okay that's actually really

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:09.570
good and this is where if you're just

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.910
listening

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.289
I got HP up and then I got whore Babylon

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.650
and sac dagger from the deal with the

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.030
devil

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.009
we still need to explore I go to our

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.860
item room here but actually this is

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:21.960
pretty excellent because I did and then

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.849
this is exactly plays into what I was

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.419
just going to say I didn't do my due

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:30.240
diligence in the last floor as a result

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:32.729
we had money but no blood bank as a

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.789
result we had money which could spawn an

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:39.599
arcade for us need to go to our item

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:41.610
room still so we could have activated

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.500
Whore of Babylon wow that was bad we

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.409
could have activated her Babylon via

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.699
that ignorance basically our via failing

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:50.340
to do our due diligence which would have

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:53.940
been sweet now it didn't work out that

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:58.199
way yes but doesn't mean it never will

00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:00.810
doesn't mean it never will secret rooms

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.070
are tempting uh let's see what this

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.409
pillar is first full health

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.210
good to know I suppose I can't forgive

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:07.919
this guy our money and we hope that he

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.169
pays out with something like with for

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:11.759
cents but it's unlikely then we'll see

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:14.520
if we get a little bit more we actually

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:16.020
got more than a little bit more so I

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:21.210
think there's an okay chance they'll pay

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:23.099
out and he paid out with Bumbo okay hey

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:29.370
what's bum Bo's favorite song by the

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:31.169
Beatles you never give me a money good

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.860
screen one uh we're going to try to get

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:38.550
bumble to pop off very raw very recently

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:40.150
I did it daily and I got bumble via

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:44.290
re-roll on the second

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:47.860
Laure that also gave me the second floor

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:49.810
itself gave me a blood bank and I've got

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.240
bumbo to max level on the first floor

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.340
thanks to having a lot of HP and that

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.840
worked out amazingly for me over the

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.270
course of the run Bumbo became like a

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.470
powerhouse I got BFF later it was great

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:02.880
you mean the dailies probably like a

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.880
week old at this point you get the idea

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:11.980
so I'm on a bumboat kick right now I

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:16.110
think it's probably fair to suggest bum

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:18.760
buh I've always sort of known it's a

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:20.920
solid item the only question has been

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:25.210
whether or not it's worth paying the

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:28.210
cost to get bumbo to the to the maximum

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:30.970
level where it really starts to to take

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.950
off I think if you find I mean the jar

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:36.340
should allow us to have a better chance

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:38.530
to get bumbo to pop off without leaving

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:43.270
us in as much of a risky position as it

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:53.770
conceivably could you know so this is it

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:56.890
basically hell we also have Midas touch

00:07:53.770 --> 00:08:02.440
I'm just like that room I hate it every

00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:05.100
second of being in that room too many

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.100
champions dude

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:16.310
I think I'd like desperately need to

00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:18.020
focus more on this run I didn't realize

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:20.439
until he came across you know 15

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.669
champions in a row here how

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:25.250
statistically poor we actually are right

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:29.050
now and then it's not like I mean 2 hp

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:32.269
is actually pretty ok but dude the whole

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:34.490
you know 11 rate of fire and then less

00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:36.550
than average starting damage three

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:39.620
floors deep is quite dangerous

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:41.779
so just play it cool here unlimited

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:44.570
bombs okay that probably saves us on

00:08:41.779 --> 00:08:47.450
this floor you know we if possible I'd

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:48.920
rather not like shoot any enemies and

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:50.690
instead just use our bombs to take care

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.760
of them but we need to we just sort of

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:56.560
pop pretty soon and actually unlimited

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:59.240
bombs with a reroll machine is very good

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:01.490
you might think that that's just like a

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.600
streak play like a need oh you get evens

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:05.360
blessing you take it now I actually

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:09.709
think that Eden's blessing is one of the

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:11.480
better tiers upgrades in the game so I

00:09:09.709 --> 00:09:14.959
think that that probably does more for

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:17.390
us than a lot of items here conceivably

00:09:14.959 --> 00:09:18.890
could have so I'm actually quite happy

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:23.420
to have Eden's blessing the fact that it

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:28.579
gives us an item on the next run oh this

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:31.970
is a little dicey is is really just a

00:09:28.579 --> 00:09:35.329
bonus or alternatively possibly like an

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:38.300
incredible curse if it gives us like

00:09:35.329 --> 00:09:40.250
Isaac's heart but great fight against

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.230
the Fallen guarantee deal with the devil

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.370
item now and we got a deal with the

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:49.070
devil which never should have happened

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:50.660
but if you you can't not when you get to

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:52.970
guppy items in the situation like this

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:56.630
you just can't not so we're going to go

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:58.399
of like full-on spirit hard build right

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.779
now and now our HP which is previously a

00:09:58.399 --> 00:10:00.620
strength has become a source of great

00:09:59.779 --> 00:10:03.140
concern for me

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:07.339
however we can we can work our way out

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:08.870
of this hopefully I mean we made in my

00:10:07.339 --> 00:10:10.820
opinion the right decision anyway we're

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:12.860
going for the guppy dream you get two

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.149
guppy items on the same floor if you

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.260
don't come into the guppy dream like

00:10:14.149 --> 00:10:17.990
what are you doing with your life

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:20.500
sounds of guppy dream is rare it's that

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:24.680
it's you know extraordinarily useful

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:34.190
and also fun and also a cute cat so

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:37.339
what's your problem what's up with the

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:39.470
champions like i know i'm i've worked

00:10:37.339 --> 00:10:41.390
myself out of the temporary psychosis i

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:44.149
was in where i thought that like you

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:45.709
know the game was out to get me and you

00:10:44.149 --> 00:10:47.149
know oh am i the only one paying

00:10:45.709 --> 00:10:48.920
attention around here really seems like

00:10:47.149 --> 00:10:51.800
they amped up the number of champions of

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.930
the game but like every once in a while

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:56.750
i find those thoughts creeping in when I

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:59.420
go to a floor and I have like five rooms

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:01.100
that have three tanky champions each I

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:04.160
find myself being like what's going on

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:07.820
oh that's the moneymaker right there

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:11.870
it's so huge head of the keeper is I

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:14.300
mean first off a reason to shoot besides

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:21.769
young men Thank You infamy besides young

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:28.640
Metro not trusting us and then it's a

00:11:21.769 --> 00:11:30.380
weight of power up bum bow which I'm

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.880
hopeful is actually going to carry us to

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:35.120
like the promised land of this run

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:40.160
another key and you know what we

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:41.390
definitely do want the left hand we're

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.010
just going to keep giving bumble a

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:45.410
chance to pop off here

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:47.089
we can't go to our shop now so I am

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.980
going to go to our curse room and the

00:11:47.089 --> 00:11:51.160
dream is we just have a full guppy on

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:54.790
the same floor here but unlikely

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.790
especially now

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:09.400
whereas it never ends man okay good

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:13.900
stuff good stuff did you pan with the

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:14.350
key you should never let you level up

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.020
dude

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:20.230
I need these keys we lost the spirit art

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:22.300
that's actually no joke terrible you

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:25.720
know it's that's a loss we can barely

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:30.280
afford similarly I don't think I really

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:32.020
want to mess about with this whole pill

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:36.880
situation here because if it's bad trip

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:39.310
or help down we just die so take

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:42.970
advantage of unlimited bombs yes spider

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:44.650
I guess we're hoping to just reroll into

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:47.650
a spear at heart that's that's the easy

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:49.510
money three cent card is you know

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:51.670
theoretically could give us what we want

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:54.250
but there you go and now I'll take a

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:58.360
pill one makes you small there's a white

00:12:54.250 --> 00:13:02.620
pill around there as well don't care not

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:04.390
interested okay I'll take it no not me

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:07.920
and kg we don't have the cognitive

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:11.650
capacity to lead alright we'll do it

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:16.000
we'll take the level we we need to do I

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:21.180
do oh we've whore Babylon actors which I

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:24.910
I mean I should have noticed via the the

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:27.130
Guppies a pop play we've got another

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:29.110
level of Bumbo as well it's like a lot

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:32.670
of stuff popping off there's a lot of

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:34.690
intricacy going on on this run right now

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:36.340
we're trying to get the guppy dream

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:38.860
we're trying to get a max level Bumbo

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:40.600
you know we got a deal with the devil

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.520
chances popping off hey it would be nice

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.710
to get some red hearts as well you know

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.180
oh by the way Midas touch we have some

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:48.390
invincibility if we could make that pop

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:52.060
that would be excellent you know we got

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:53.380
it's a Rubik's Cube right now the only

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:58.030
question is how close we're getting to

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:59.320
the solution I was going to make an

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:02.560
analogy about how like a Rubik's Cube

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:04.570
never looks more unsolved than you know

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:08.290
six moves before it actually gets solved

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:11.560
but having actually solved a Rubik's

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:16.570
Cube many times albeit

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:18.279
with the help of online guides that's

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:20.590
not the case it really did it does

00:14:18.279 --> 00:14:22.380
gradually come into focus the more you

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:24.520
the closer you get to the end the more

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.900
the rubik's cube looks like it's solid

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.220
it's not like you make one turn that

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:29.230
magically puts all the squares in the

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.460
right spot anyway by the way you might

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:32.170
think like if you've never solved the

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.160
Rubik's Cube or there's two extremes

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:35.920
here if you've never solved a Rubik's

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:38.339
Cube or you've solved one many times

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:41.020
because you're some kind of under Kim

00:14:38.339 --> 00:14:44.020
you might be like well using a guide to

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:45.850
solve a Rubik's Cube it's just a puzzle

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:48.520
everyone did it in the 80s no you don't

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:51.670
apparently at least this is the legend

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:55.540
according to the Rubik's Cube box that's

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:56.350
great because we're copying down and the

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.360
world is our oyster

00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:01.450
I'm sorry Bombo should I let you grab

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:03.100
that it took the inventor of the Rubik's

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:05.350
Cube a month to solve it now maybe I'm

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:07.420
naive for believing that but it makes

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:11.100
sense like it's not it's not a simple

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:15.400
procedure essentially like several

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:18.930
algorithms applied i've already fell in

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.930
asleep oh I'm sorry you know

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:28.390
Rubik's cubes cool man it's like I'm not

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.180
trying to get involved in the cottage

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:32.410
industry of fidgets spinners at all

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:35.740
positively or negatively it's like a

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:38.350
fidget spinner that also teaches you

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:42.430
something it doesn't teach you a lot but

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:44.140
it you know the teachers use it's a way

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:45.130
to exercise look okay maybe I don't know

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:47.740
what I'm talking about I'm just trying

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:49.930
to say like it feels good to look at a

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:51.580
Rubik's Cube and then you're like oh I

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:53.260
need to apply this algorithm here and

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.430
then you do it with your hands and it

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.839
works and you're like okay now I need to

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.130
apply this algorithm and then it starts

00:15:55.839 --> 00:16:00.880
to come into focus and you're like I am

00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:02.650
a god you know it feels good you don't

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:05.200
have to be Edward Snowden to use a

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:06.910
Rubik's Cube in public it probably helps

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.940
sorry bumbo probably to let you grab

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:08.940
that

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:21.149
the run is now exceptional but not quite

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:22.500
unkillable we need we yeah we got the

00:16:21.149 --> 00:16:24.269
parasite so we must have been to our

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:28.410
item room maybe have not been to our

00:16:24.269 --> 00:16:32.339
shop but either way the run is like

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:33.570
again amazing wouldn't be the worst

00:16:32.339 --> 00:16:34.860
thing I'm just going to head down just

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.630
in case we got to change the boss or

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:40.709
missing one shop not the end of the

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:46.610
world would be nice to just get a little

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:46.610
little HP's if you know what I mean

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:51.600
figured you know we almost never get any

00:16:49.709 --> 00:16:54.420
value out of feels like I'm walking on

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.589
sunshine why not use it in at least get

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.610
some peace of mind out of it but it

00:16:55.589 --> 00:16:59.010
looks like this is going to be win

00:16:56.610 --> 00:17:01.050
number 11 ten is an important win

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:02.070
because it's a double-digit milestone 11

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:06.179
is an important win because it's

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:08.160
palindromic you know 12 to 19 who cares

00:17:06.179 --> 00:17:10.199
20 is the next big one but you know

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.549
we're at least in the interim period

00:17:10.199 --> 00:17:12.900
we're going to celebrate the little

00:17:11.549 --> 00:17:14.939
milestones as well because it wasn't

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:19.589
that long ago we were rocking a negative

00:17:14.939 --> 00:17:21.569
six streak so to come back and you know

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:23.189
be looking good here it is indicative of

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:24.929
the fact that we've probably had some

00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:28.439
pretty solid seeds lately wouldn't

00:17:24.929 --> 00:17:31.559
dispute that and admittedly this run has

00:17:28.439 --> 00:17:33.030
you know 30 different ways to win as we

00:17:31.559 --> 00:17:34.770
said earlier you know you can pop off

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:36.809
with Midas touch you can pop off with a

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:38.010
great luck set you can just get guppy I

00:17:36.809 --> 00:17:40.049
don't even think I mentioned that one

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:41.880
you could get Bumbo to max level and

00:17:40.049 --> 00:17:43.799
then just you know hide in the corner

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:46.470
while Bumbo does this stuff but we

00:17:43.799 --> 00:17:49.500
didn't have any of those we had to make

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:51.510
them happen and the guppy pickup or the

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.250
guppy transformation was not without

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:55.290
risk on this run

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:57.450
you know we sacrificed a lot of HP to go

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:59.640
for it when it wasn't guaranteed once we

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:01.250
saw Guppies tail as our final pick up we

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:04.770
were like okay well we're probably good

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:07.020
but you know up until that point we've

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:09.150
given up like well we gave up three

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:12.450
spirit hearts for it for a chance at

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:15.900
making the guppy dream work so we've

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:18.900
lost the Whore of Babylon effect to pick

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:21.080
up some HP I'm going to choose to go

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:26.720
full horror Babylon strats

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:31.740
our stats are so bad nah yeah I'll do it

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:34.080
alright we'll do it our stats are so bad

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.800
without Whore of Babylon I think we got

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.660
to go for it

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.600
so we still we continue to have Guffey

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:45.960
what happened here we got great damage

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:47.220
no you wouldn't you wouldn't they did I

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:50.070
mean what kind of what else can I say

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:53.370
they did we got the onk here we've got

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:56.220
strange attractor let's just go down the

00:18:53.370 --> 00:19:01.320
line here strange attractor monstros

00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:07.170
long epic AK my reflection so this is

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:09.780
horrible it's actually abysmal and we

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:17.000
have been screwed to an almost

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:21.180
unbelievable degree by the rng gods now

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:27.840
believe it or not we're not well and

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:31.380
truly dusted maybe should have kept a

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:34.680
bomb but we're not well and truly dusted

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:37.050
we have ways to deal damage that don't

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:41.250
require us to shoot they're not very

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:43.710
good you know Gemini basically and then

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:51.960
our guppy plays which are of course very

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:55.950
very good but we we have a chance I

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:59.640
would suggest not very pleased about

00:19:55.950 --> 00:20:03.630
that either so yeah we're gonna we're

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:05.520
going to try I think if we very very

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.810
closely pay attention to the way that

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.090
our tears are working here we got it

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:12.390
it's good a chance as any to be in an OK

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:14.790
spot however well not as good a chance

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:15.960
as any that's just ignorant we're just

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:18.690
going to hope for another reroll that

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:20.930
comes like halfway through five battery

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:22.860
charges ok be 100 would be nice but

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:25.940
we're just trying to have any peep into

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:29.940
the spirit it has to be nice

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:33.760
basically I only want to fire a shot if

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:41.050
every single shot is going to land

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:42.880
oh right we have varicose veins as well

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:46.290
so if we ever get here we're going to

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:49.990
spawn more dangerous stuff for ourselves

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:51.790
we do a big chub as well they've got to

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:53.560
take it room by room inch by inch row by

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:56.290
row you know there's some of these rooms

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:57.690
where it's easy money we're not going to

00:20:56.290 --> 00:21:01.330
get the boss rush so you might as well

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:04.450
just take advantage of yeah okay well I

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:08.320
have teleported it's not monster as long

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:10.600
as cursed I just when you thought you

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:13.030
know it couldn't get any better you go

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.740
and do something like this and totally

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:16.870
redeem yourself so we're looking for

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:19.930
black cards we're looking for Kiera font

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:22.770
cards we're looking for love in all the

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:25.480
right places hopefully our respawn it

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:28.000
doesn't matter what it is without being

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:31.240
you know overly dismissive but it really

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.970
doesn't matter what it is because no

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:42.190
respawn is going to give us innate

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:44.770
immunity to explosion damage puberty's

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:48.160
fine absolutely nothing wrong with that

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:51.670
save yourself a half heart when you got

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:54.990
in the ipecac strange attractor bring in

00:21:51.670 --> 00:22:02.350
your ship back take the fool card out

00:21:54.990 --> 00:22:07.090
take the fool card so this has now

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:10.450
become you know a dark run for me here

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:14.350
it's a twisted fantasy please

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:15.940
Gemini need you to get in here and deal

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:18.910
some damage is the thing cause like if

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:21.300
you dull we're going to be dusted well

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:21.300
and truly

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:35.030
this room should never take us this long

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:36.920
in hindsight we were completely okay

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:40.670
with our previous situation this is like

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:42.170
some it's a hole we're already Guppies

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:46.870
take it we don't have a space bar item

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:46.870
but the stats ups could save you

00:22:52.900 --> 00:23:05.570
you got you got you got oh it's gonna be

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:08.420
a long one just prepare yourself it

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:11.000
although it seems bad and is horrible

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:15.470
there are closing in on some HP there

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:19.370
there are some outs that are not that

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:25.390
impossible to conceive of right now for

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:31.660
example if I could get blue or red

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:34.550
candle it's a pretty good start and

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:36.920
making this run happen and actually now

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:39.890
that I think about it with cursed I as

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:41.150
long as we're not overly concerned I

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:42.680
mean we're obviously going to take chaos

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:46.490
because it's I mean the Run is already

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:50.360
chaos as long as we're not overly

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:53.840
concerned with it with how much damage

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:55.280
we do we can just tap one shot out from

00:23:53.840 --> 00:24:04.070
curse died and then you know if we

00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:05.600
teleport it's pretty much who cares for

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:09.040
what it's worth I just tried to do that

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.040
there and it didn't really work

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:17.770
Thank You outbreak an item that I will

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:19.929
never underestimate again yeah we'll

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:23.320
play because we got luck to some extent

00:24:19.929 --> 00:24:24.730
he reads I don't want to have to hold

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:27.700
the button down the whole time to not be

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:30.940
screwed here okay that is enormous

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:32.140
wooden cross is huge here we haven't

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:34.510
been our item room on this floor so you

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:36.039
got to keep the item room looking for

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:37.900
invincibility we didn't get blue candle

00:24:36.039 --> 00:24:40.780
we didn't get red candle we got chaos

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:43.270
chaos doesn't save us by default but

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:44.440
leaves us in a situation in which you

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:47.669
pick up something that saves us

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:51.220
potentially and there it is right there

00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:55.179
five homing bombs four calling Birds

00:24:51.220 --> 00:25:00.580
three rerolls I'm totally boned an every

00:24:55.179 --> 00:25:10.240
row that ruined our streak on the 11th

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:11.740
run of Isaac nickel escape to me I mean

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.289
you could do the rest of math yourself

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:18.039
on this one so we got the polaroid it's

00:25:14.289 --> 00:25:19.919
good hey credit it had a Krampus credit

00:25:18.039 --> 00:25:22.240
Hampus that's what I was going to say

00:25:19.919 --> 00:25:23.980
would have been fine lump of coal it's

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.559
not like they're ever going to do any

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:28.240
more damage to me so I'll take this to

00:25:26.559 --> 00:25:36.159
emphasize the value of my bombs I

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:39.330
suppose and holy mantle saved us without

00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:43.110
Tooting my own horn much at least I'm

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:48.480
very surprised we left that last floor

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:50.679
without really being punished too much I

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:52.690
still think that we've got to be an

00:25:50.679 --> 00:25:54.870
outside shot to have much of a chance to

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:54.870
win

00:26:01.799 --> 00:26:09.580
we're not doing like too badly largely

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:16.269
like we have 43 damage so every time we

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:17.739
summon flies the flies just destroy the

00:26:16.269 --> 00:26:19.149
other thing worth noting is that there's

00:26:17.739 --> 00:26:21.009
other ways out of this that I hadn't

00:26:19.149 --> 00:26:23.019
considered as a result of the incredible

00:26:21.009 --> 00:26:25.749
damage our flies do if we can get

00:26:23.019 --> 00:26:29.259
shoopdawhoop shoopdawhoop will generate

00:26:25.749 --> 00:26:32.679
flies I mean we have to and it's good so

00:26:29.259 --> 00:26:35.379
we will you got to d4 sorry see you

00:26:32.679 --> 00:26:37.419
later we live long enough that I feel

00:26:35.379 --> 00:26:39.789
completely content in doing that we made

00:26:37.419 --> 00:26:42.929
our way out of this and sure you know

00:26:39.789 --> 00:26:46.379
this run might not be that spectacular

00:26:42.929 --> 00:26:49.389
it's just you know Ludo random tears

00:26:46.379 --> 00:26:52.210
which is mine the name I use when I

00:26:49.389 --> 00:26:54.850
check into hotels so that I don't get

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:56.739
mobbed by you know the female population

00:26:54.850 --> 00:27:03.279
in whatever country we happen to be

00:26:56.739 --> 00:27:07.830
visiting on our world tour Ludo random

00:27:03.279 --> 00:27:10.899
tears yes my name is vincent adult man

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:12.730
no I know you're gonna say I'll watch

00:27:10.899 --> 00:27:15.190
this Bojack horseman adult but I reread

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:16.440
it read it as references for Vince an

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:18.519
adult man

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.899
there's been times where I've been like

00:27:18.519 --> 00:27:21.159
I'm gonna watch like 15 minutes of

00:27:19.899 --> 00:27:22.989
something on Netflix and Bojack horseman

00:27:21.159 --> 00:27:24.519
is up there is like you know recently

00:27:22.989 --> 00:27:32.559
updated I'm like I should watch that I

00:27:24.519 --> 00:27:35.289
like Will Arnett Bob transformation all

00:27:32.559 --> 00:27:36.879
the things here um but then I just don't

00:27:35.289 --> 00:27:40.960
it's not because I think it's bad it's

00:27:36.879 --> 00:27:44.009
just cuz I I mean I just don't this

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.009
chocolate milk

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:56.399
chocolate milk proptosis at the fora so

00:27:52.809 --> 00:27:56.399
this run is actually stellar

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:06.580
the only question is whether or not it's

00:28:03.159 --> 00:28:09.639
worth holding we have kidney stone as

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:10.899
well or it's worth 3 rolling and I'm

00:28:09.639 --> 00:28:13.929
kind of that mean you know me at this

00:28:10.899 --> 00:28:15.820
point I kind of like to consider these

00:28:13.929 --> 00:28:19.809
runs is like an it's a small world after

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:23.169
all sort of thing so unless I get a run

00:28:19.809 --> 00:28:25.240
that's that's really really cool I tend

00:28:23.169 --> 00:28:30.399
to tend to keep reroll and this run is

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:32.139
strong and if I got it randomly like if

00:28:30.399 --> 00:28:36.009
I got it organically I should say like I

00:28:32.139 --> 00:28:40.960
created this run on my run I'd probably

00:28:36.009 --> 00:28:44.320
be pretty stoked because we have like a

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:45.639
literal ridiculous amount of damage but

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.289
I think I'm going to reroll it just

00:28:45.639 --> 00:28:48.580
because first off transformations don't

00:28:47.289 --> 00:28:50.620
go anywhere so we'll still be Bob

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:53.769
whatever the heck that means

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:57.580
outside of Twin Peaks now I haven't seen

00:28:53.769 --> 00:28:59.379
Twin Peaks I just weari roll again yeah

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:02.610
we're gonna re-roll because basically

00:28:59.379 --> 00:29:07.259
just it's not quite interesting enough

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:07.259
so that's cool but this run is garbage

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:13.029
look try to make it work for off floor

00:29:10.809 --> 00:29:15.659
we've got nine lives as well all the

00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:17.799
stretches come in early today actually

00:29:15.659 --> 00:29:20.159
you ever have one of those days were

00:29:17.799 --> 00:29:24.039
like you don't want to wake up every

00:29:20.159 --> 00:29:26.110
thing is asked everybody sucks you don't

00:29:24.039 --> 00:29:27.639
really know why but you want to justify

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:29.049
ripping someone's head off well that

00:29:27.639 --> 00:29:31.389
wasn't really like my date today I went

00:29:29.049 --> 00:29:33.820
to bed late last night like maybe an

00:29:31.389 --> 00:29:35.799
hour later than usual I woke up like two

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:37.779
hours earlier than usual but just woke

00:29:35.799 --> 00:29:40.570
up and I was like I should get up should

00:29:37.779 --> 00:29:43.690
get up and start doing things so I'm a

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:45.129
little I wouldn't say poorly rested it's

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:47.889
just like the weather like you can't

00:29:45.129 --> 00:29:51.940
talk about how much sleep you got

00:29:47.889 --> 00:29:54.820
without people being like oh you've got

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:56.860
five hours of sleep last night well I'm

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:58.690
in the Special Forces and it's

00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:02.169
we get five hours of sleep on our days

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:04.659
off which never happened you know oh

00:30:02.169 --> 00:30:07.210
it's hot there will I live on the

00:30:04.659 --> 00:30:08.649
surface of mercury where the searing

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:10.269
temperatures blister your skin on

00:30:08.649 --> 00:30:11.350
concert you get the idea I'm real in

00:30:10.269 --> 00:30:15.340
that one oh it's not quite good enough

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:17.260
well this is like Libra I mean you can

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:18.850
tell it's Libra and great because we

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:24.370
have 75 range

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:26.919
I think I'll fight hush because it's

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:28.450
like we've gotten ridiculously strong

00:30:26.919 --> 00:30:28.809
here but yeah like I'm a little under

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:30.549
wrist

00:30:28.809 --> 00:30:34.870
I like I'm like I'm a seven and nine

00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:37.659
hours of sleep at night sort of guy and

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:40.480
I talked to you know because sometimes

00:30:37.659 --> 00:30:41.980
we talk about this on the DL SS I say

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:44.019
like I get nine hours of sleep some

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:45.610
nights I'm very happy about one of the

00:30:44.019 --> 00:30:49.720
perks of the job I'm definitely not

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:51.820
suggesting like oh nine hours away you

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:53.620
know it's not that good once you get

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:56.169
used to it it's still pretty sick to be

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:59.559
honest with you but you know I mentioned

00:30:56.169 --> 00:31:01.990
on stream once and chat was like I just

00:30:59.559 --> 00:31:03.059
want to see what this does that was not

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:05.139
worth it

00:31:03.059 --> 00:31:07.480
some people would chat at least were

00:31:05.139 --> 00:31:09.399
like nine hours is too much is bad for

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:11.200
you so I talked to my doctor which is

00:31:09.399 --> 00:31:12.700
what I should always do in twitch a

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:14.590
gives me health advice and I was like

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:16.480
you know she's like how much she does

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:19.750
sleep nine hours and she's like that's

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.980
great you guys are killing it that's I

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:22.899
mean I don't know she didn't say you're

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:25.809
killing it's kind of like bad words for

00:31:22.899 --> 00:31:27.639
a doctor I suppose but um she seems

00:31:25.809 --> 00:31:29.830
stoked about it so I'm gonna just you

00:31:27.639 --> 00:31:32.830
know she's the one with the MD so I'm

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:34.090
gonna rely on her but yeah like I just

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:35.860
say I didn't get nine hours of sleep

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:37.419
last night I'm a little under rested by

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:41.409
my own standards were feeling productive

00:31:37.419 --> 00:31:43.960
at the very least also like the hush is

00:31:41.409 --> 00:31:46.480
eating it here I really thought there

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:48.279
was probably about a 10% chance we were

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:52.510
going to win this run the fact that we

00:31:48.279 --> 00:31:54.010
managed to to get a d4 after a reroll

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:56.760
basically ruined our run is hilarious

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:56.760
and sure

00:31:57.090 --> 00:32:03.880
we we could have tried to go for peak

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:06.490
Zane and stuck with the run that was

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:08.500
actually just trash but we found a way

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:10.900
out that's legitimate as far as I'm

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:12.790
concerned did these tractor beam shots

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:15.390
are hilarious and we're going to go

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:17.830
really go Cathedral because I fight

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:20.800
delirium enough on dailies at this point

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:25.410
that I feel I don't I don't see a need

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:27.790
to force ourselves to fight delirium at

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:29.530
least once or twice a week which we're

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:32.200
trying to get there on dailies at least

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:34.870
so I'm not sweating and this turned out

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:37.750
to be like a good run is this run worthy

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:41.830
of being our ultimate run with addy for

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:45.429
I absolutely think so you recognize that

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:49.350
we have Libra and all of our stats are

00:32:45.429 --> 00:32:51.670
so good that we have 24 damage that's

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:54.210
ridiculous that never happens and then

00:32:51.670 --> 00:33:01.030
on top of that we got booger tears and

00:32:54.210 --> 00:33:04.809
we're gummy so like we're firing 300

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:07.300
shots per minute here half of them are

00:33:04.809 --> 00:33:10.240
sticking to enemies and doing 24 damage

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:12.160
per tick like it's this is absurd

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:13.870
especially considering where this run

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:16.750
looked like it was headed you know less

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:19.240
than 10 minutes ago it's just

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:22.900
ridiculously so we just actually melted

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:25.030
Isaac sure it's not you know every shot

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:26.980
is a sad bomb that summons 12 sad bombs

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:28.480
that I'll have you know Tammy's head pop

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:31.660
out of them but it's it's very good

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:34.050
though all right what do we get here

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:37.090
friends till the end walking on sunshine

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:42.070
amnesia and a health downgrade not the

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:44.590
best trip the loop is lovely I think

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:46.690
we'll take ship the loop and then scrub

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:50.620
everything else there actually got a

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:52.059
nice luck upgrade and we asked for

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:53.830
shoopdawhoop earlier I still think soup

00:33:52.059 --> 00:33:55.870
the whoop is like a top class item for

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:57.460
us because it'll generate a bunch of

00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:59.830
flies for us we might as well take

00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:05.500
Scorpio this just ended up being like a

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:07.100
really really feel good run yeah why not

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:09.300
dude

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:10.620
we're going to pick up a lot of good

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.660
stuff here as a result of this I can

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:14.730
feel it already

00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:16.050
yeah like not really though but this is

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:18.930
going to help our tea array potentially

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:23.400
or not and I guess we'll take magic

00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:25.020
fingers with us and you will become

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.340
intimately familiar with the sound of my

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:31.110
space bar item as I go with that not

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:33.240
that but it is getting the job done here

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:37.710
we got many different ways to accomplish

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:42.510
our objectives like this this run I hope

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:46.590
I named it in such a way that it that is

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:47.970
in keeping with the theme because it

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:52.170
really was a run where we're there were

00:34:47.970 --> 00:34:54.140
many different ways to win and this we

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:57.300
saw that earlier with Midas touch and

00:34:54.140 --> 00:35:00.240
then we saw a Midas touch plus Whore of

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:03.780
Babylon plus you know bumbo plus blah

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:05.730
blah blah but we also saw it in like a

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:07.590
literal way once we got the v4 and it

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:10.080
saved us from the debt that we pretty

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:12.480
much deserved as a result of our Braves

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:19.020
and re-roll culture at the office here

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:21.030
of my closet and overall honestly this

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:24.900
run has me feeling even more jazzed

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:27.960
about my Isaac play like we're in a

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:29.910
great spot 11 wins in a row this one was

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:30.840
