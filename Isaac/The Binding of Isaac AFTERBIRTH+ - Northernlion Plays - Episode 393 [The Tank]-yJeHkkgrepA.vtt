##

00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.200
everybody welcome banker online please

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.140
abiding live contra plus I haven't

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.840
played in like several days to kind of

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.190
get this backlog down a little bit

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.099
because it has gotten to the point where

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.049
it's ridiculous like I've weird so tanky

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.279
right now others let's eat I'm not sure

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:24.060
if you can even play along with us here

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:26.250
but um I looked at whenever I upload I

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.539
made my videos essentially oh my god our

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.189
speed is 0.25

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.960
I named our videos based on the day that

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.790
they're completed so an Isaac episode

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.690
will be called like after birth plus you

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.309
know July whatever 2017 and I say that

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.590
knowing it's August right now I might

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:49.050
have a backlog but it's not that large

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:52.680
that we're still in July here it was I

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.039
mean it is August now and the one that I

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.500
uploaded real-time yesterday was like

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.809
July 22nd and I was like oh my god this

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.400
is getting absurd it's the muscle memory

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.740
dude from heaven done for Isaac episodes

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.729
a day for like a million years that now

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.860
I'm I don't know what to do with myself

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.159
don't let's look at some doing more

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.040
streams but does the Isaac time is just

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.680
like it is incalculable I'm not

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.630
complaining at all I'm just saying it's

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.740
again I'm starting every episode by

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.110
talking about how it's a good adjustment

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.400
period but I digress so we're going to

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.720
continue kind of working our way through

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.740
the challenges here because I think it

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.450
will enrich our other runs in order to

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.790
have all the rooms including the ones

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.729
that are not necessarily that amazing

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.070
there's also some of these challenges

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.000
give us items like I know that deaths

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.590
touch is created from one of these from

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.299
one of these challenges if I remember

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:57.799
correctly watch that one I've poisoned a

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.880
spectral Ghost which is news to me I

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.890
didn't know the one could do this but

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.210
I'm I'm happy it worked out like that we

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.799
actually got pretty lucky to get Bob's

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.540
curse right off the bat because it does

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.899
give us a little bit more hurtin power

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.489
to use against these awful awful enemies

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.940
sorting the enemies might not be that

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.830
bad

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.970
you know the haunt at this point if we

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.220
can't fight him we got bigger problems

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.989
but we we have such low speed that's ten

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.459
times worse than our damage not being

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.489
that amazing right now is the fact that

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.739
our speed is just awful so anything at

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.599
all that can give us more speed is

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.430
incredibly important right now keep in

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.530
mind we're not going to be getting item

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.180
rooms on this challenge so I did to the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.470
best of my knowledge anyway we're not

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.580
going to be getting item rooms so it

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.959
really is important for us to not lose

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.810
our chance at a deal with the devil

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.750
because we could make 0.25 speed work

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.379
for ourselves if we at least get like a

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.519
little bit of bonus damage if we can

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.050
walk into a room and like murder

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.300
everything pretty quickly that would

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:02.209
help or we could get like 12 speed

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:06.870
upgrades because good god this is like

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:08.430
really really really slow right now I'm

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.930
actually like going back to the

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.060
challenges has made me feel a lot better

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.659
about my Isaac play in general because

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.790
I'm like man I was diced to be really

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.170
good at this game for a time I can't

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.670
believe that when rebirth came out I

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.230
mean we went through slumps as well but

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.840
I can't believe that when rebirth came

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.970
out I only lost one challenge maybe a

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.640
few challenges I've already lost one

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.489
challenge were on challenge 5 I've gone

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.060
soft you know back in the day it was

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:38.430
like oh you will take that for now back

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.290
in the day we were you know hardened

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.360
steel now I'm the you know getting a

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.909
little mentally pudgy here in my

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.290
advanced Isaac age I'm going to try it I

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.599
probably shouldn't but I'm going to try

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:54.209
it

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:56.550
not great super not worth it but at this

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.110
point like and

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.080
the thing is we should be pretty

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.700
unlikely to die for quite some time this

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.580
is definitely a situation where like

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.200
when it rains it pours so for right now

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.900
we should have basically no problem

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.460
surviving but once we start to lose HP I

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.740
think it'll all come crashing down

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:18.400
pretty quickly so wow that was really

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:22.290
good it's important to keep ourselves

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.640
going here keep ourselves above water

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.950
I'm of two minds about that we'll think

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.660
about that

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.940
battery is not worth much but I like a

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.560
three cent item it's a lovers card and

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.510
not worth anything right now maybe in

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.760
the future we'll blow that up definitely

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.240
take champion belt so that raises our

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:48.000
damage actually fairly considerably and

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:50.650
I think we're less likely to need the

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.930
extra uses of young heart than we are to

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:57.850
enjoy golden chest so it's kind of like

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.990
entire variability whichever one of

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.450
these would actually work the thing is

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:05.740
triple-a battery is worth nothing for us

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:07.600
if we never use young hearts and the

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.700
lockpick is worth nothing for us if we

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.169
never encounter golden chest so I know

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.570
we've already encountered two but that

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.669
doesn't the first rule of science you

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.310
know past returns are not indicative of

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:21.100
future returns and by science I mean our

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.840
slash Wall Street bets a subreddit I

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.250
read despite not being in the market for

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.310
whatever reason so we get it tears up

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.080
rate which is important

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.640
we basically need deals with the devil

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.960
so I will take Whore of Babylon despite

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.180
the fact that it's probably never going

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.650
to benefit us and I will take a

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.550
contractor and below despite the fact

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.500
that I don't know if they could

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:42.120
conceivably like possibly benefit us

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.660
even in under the best of circumstances

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.690
there we go

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.490
we did get a golden chest now still no

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.169
speed upgrade but now we actually have a

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.120
way out if we can get Abaddon which

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:55.840
thankfully is somehow found its way back

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.669
into my brain and I think I forgot the

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.950
name of her like a week if we can get

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:01.240
Abaddon we get horn Babylon it'll give

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.530
us a speed upgrade I don't know if

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:07.140
there's any items that are actually

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.140
speed multipliers maybe maybe not

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.890
but if I can get something that like

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.170
quadruples my speed that and dust takes

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:18.080
us to like an average start that would

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.160
be good maybe maybe not again I don't

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.110
know that's they should really shouldn't

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.700
call this game The Binding of Isaac it's

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.610
a stupid name apparently it's based on

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.570
an old book called like some Biblos

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:30.080
they should've just called it maybe

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:33.080
maybe not this year just called it 50/50

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.640
like either you win or you don't and I

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.120
don't think there's any other media

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.460
properties called 50/50 I think it's a

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.780
completely original idea that definitely

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.000
would not be infringing upon the rights

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.920
of you know Miramax pictures or anything

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.540
like that so it should be completely

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:52.430
fine is no there's no way that 50/50 was

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.740
made by Miramax because Miramax stopped

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:57.170
existing when the weinstein company came

00:06:54.740 --> 00:07:00.200
into existence so now after I kill lust

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:06.080
and get the syringe I'm going to go look

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:10.180
who made 50 50 50 50 movie 2011 film

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:13.160
give it a second production company

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:18.400
mandate pictures and distributed by

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:20.810
Summit Entertainment way off dude

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.580
production company Point gray it's an

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.340
american film production company founded

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.960
by Seth Rogen it's named after

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:31.040
Vancouver's Point Grey secondary school

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:34.610
I didn't know that point gray is like

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:37.070
one of the most help

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:40.240
that's like irrelevant there is one of

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:43.130
the most affluent areas in Vancouver

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:45.050
which probably as a result makes it one

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.390
of the most affluent areas in Canada I

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:51.890
suppose but it's like a lovely

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:54.680
neighborhood I would love to be like

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:57.650
dang old Point Grey ruining the culture

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.990
of the city but I can't deny even if

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:01.790
they're $11 I love savory Belgian

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:05.750
waffles okay maybe I'm part of the

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:07.760
problem a Belgian waffle with some

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:09.690
smoked salmon on it it just tickles my

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.670
fancy

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:14.340
please get out of here that makes me a

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:17.580
traitor of the proletariat then so be it

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:19.340
but I didn't invent human tastebuds okay

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:22.050
look at this flanking maneuver here I

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:24.990
didn't program the human brain and say

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:27.000
hey you know be sweet if we made it so

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:29.520
that any combination of like fried

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:35.190
batter and sugar was the most delicious

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:36.750
thing in the world I know whenever but

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:40.310
whenever people talk about like gene

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:42.510
therapy it always goes into a dystopian

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:43.710
Bend and I can understand why people

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:45.480
would think that because you know

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.100
diversity is human beings is one of the

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.230
things that gives us strength you know

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:51.860
on a literal level genetic diversity

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:54.740
protects us from a variety of diseases

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:56.880
avoiding monoculture you know it helps

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:58.230
avoid the idea that humans could

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.740
eventually become like the Irish potato

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:05.610
blight which would relatively be bad I

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:07.050
think however at the same time if we

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:09.960
could get like some gene therapy that

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:11.940
was like alright human brain no longer

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.220
do you think that kettle cooked potato

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.260
chips are the most important food for

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:19.320
your existence like if we could just

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:21.360
gene Maude in the ability for the

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:24.000
healthiest foods to taste delicious and

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.170
I by the way people are going to be like

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.200
NL if you cook them right they are

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:30.600
delicious I agree you watch an NL SS

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.370
ever I'm the dude who's like Pro kale

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.830
everybody else is like it's like even a

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:37.500
garbage bag I will willingly sacrifice

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:40.320
french fries for like a kale salad edit

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:42.030
at a store and I'm between that and the

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.740
savory Belgian waffles comment I'm

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:45.060
really alienating a lot of my fan base

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.170
here potentially I'm just saying I know

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.740
when it's done right it could be

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:53.010
delicious but like even when chocolate

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:54.810
is done wrong it's pretty good even when

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:56.610
potato chips are bad my brain is like

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:59.160
continue to eat them I already went off

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:01.680
on this tangent recently like popcorn

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.980
man I will just eat infinite popcorn

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:08.790
even if it sucks I will eat it until

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:10.920
like my body explodes that sounds like

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:15.150
it would be romantic if it wasn't so

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:17.430
gross but no it's human brain is like

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:18.760
you know a easily digestible

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:22.120
high-calorie Guk OH

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:24.730
sign me up we need the gene ma the human

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:30.550
brain so it's like yo water tastes like

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:34.900
dr. pepper and chocolate tastes like

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:38.710
poison or we could learn responsibility

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:40.360
and self-control but dude why do we need

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:43.480
responsibility in self-control we have

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:50.670
science now did you hear the sound that

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:50.670
that guy made guru some patron stuff I

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:55.420
don't know man

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:57.040
that's I mean that's the honest answer I

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.030
don't know how I feel about gene modding

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.060
I don't know how I feel about

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:03.630
genetically modified foods

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:06.400
it's a hot-button issue to some extent

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:09.640
but like everything is genetically

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:13.870
modified we're genetically modified you

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:15.520
know our parents didn't just probably

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:18.130
make a baby with the first person they

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.140
saw they went I don't know something my

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:21.490
brain is telling me this guy's genes

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:26.380
look like the right way to go and they

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:27.820
went for it you know isn't that genetic

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:31.210
modification it's alright am I making

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:33.400
myself look ignorant potentially I guess

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:35.140
I just I as long as we get into

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:38.470
controversial subjects I dispute the

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:41.440
notion that people sometimes seem to

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:44.290
hold that like of Eugene mods of you

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:46.150
know capsicum all of a sudden you're

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:49.030
going to like eat it and grow an eighth

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:50.320
limb or something like that something

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:52.120
something this is where you do the

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.860
anecdote about the Cavendish banana and

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:56.110
how bananas in the wild actually taste

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.790
like garbage and then we genetically

00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:00.640
modified our own banana that tastes

00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:02.230
delicious and now you know atheists it's

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:05.020
the Atheist nightmare cuz it fits into

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:06.790
the person's hand and as a pull-tab you

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:09.190
know 100% this that was really just an

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:10.570
anecdote for Nick exclusively anyway I

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:15.220
don't know how we got off on this pseudo

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:16.720
science topic for anyone that's like in

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.730
high school right now having a

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.830
bachelor's degree in any science I just

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:22.210
want you to know this is

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:24.370
self-deprecating but having a bachelor's

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:26.770
degree in any science gives you about

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:28.259
enough information to be dangerous and

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:30.749
that's about it

00:12:28.259 --> 00:12:33.839
- just enough information to make

00:12:30.749 --> 00:12:35.699
yourself look like a learning idiot but

00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:39.029
without having any actual real skill

00:12:35.699 --> 00:12:41.749
associated with it so yeah I wouldn't

00:12:39.029 --> 00:12:45.929
I'm not going to lean too far back on my

00:12:41.749 --> 00:12:50.910
on my biology degree there okay so now I

00:12:45.929 --> 00:12:52.289
kind of wish that we had gone with that

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:53.369
we've gone with triple-a battery because

00:12:52.289 --> 00:12:56.970
Krampus has head is going to work like

00:12:53.369 --> 00:12:59.639
gangbusters for us but I'm pretty sure

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:02.879
that we have actually won this run quite

00:12:59.639 --> 00:13:12.449
easily right now it's my guess at least

00:13:02.879 --> 00:13:16.529
I really feel like I I get I get roasted

00:13:12.449 --> 00:13:18.149
sometimes in chat one of my favorite

00:13:16.529 --> 00:13:20.429
expressions so that sounds very

00:13:18.149 --> 00:13:23.789
pretentious but one of my favorite

00:13:20.429 --> 00:13:25.859
expressions is I don't know I wish we as

00:13:23.789 --> 00:13:29.369
a society were more okay with like not

00:13:25.859 --> 00:13:31.499
knowing things everybody myself included

00:13:29.369 --> 00:13:33.209
to some extent you know as a tendency to

00:13:31.499 --> 00:13:34.980
pretend to be an authority and have an

00:13:33.209 --> 00:13:36.889
opinion on everything you know what's

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:39.359
your opinion on you know a highly

00:13:36.889 --> 00:13:40.889
specific issue that requires a lot of

00:13:39.359 --> 00:13:42.839
experience and meesh knowledge to

00:13:40.889 --> 00:13:44.339
understand I'm for it or I'm against it

00:13:42.839 --> 00:13:47.879
you know everything is a political issue

00:13:44.339 --> 00:13:50.519
in this day and age Thank You infamy for

00:13:47.879 --> 00:13:52.619
saving me for my self there I'm a big

00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:56.189
proponent of I don't know and I dispute

00:13:52.619 --> 00:13:58.259
the idea that no I dispute the idea that

00:13:56.189 --> 00:14:00.209
saying I don't know makes you ignorant I

00:13:58.259 --> 00:14:03.829
actually think it makes you very wise if

00:14:00.209 --> 00:14:03.829
I may to my own horn a little bit

00:14:03.859 --> 00:14:09.720
because it's honest you know to say that

00:14:06.119 --> 00:14:11.069
you don't know something the most honest

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.269
thing in the world it's like you know

00:14:11.069 --> 00:14:16.350
why don't we leave that to the people

00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:20.339
who understand it so I always feel like

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:23.249
I am a an NHL hockey fan I like the

00:14:20.339 --> 00:14:26.459
Vancouver Canucks mostly due to locality

00:14:23.249 --> 00:14:27.989
and I have a very arbitrary set of rules

00:14:26.459 --> 00:14:32.899
for following sports teams that I that

00:14:27.989 --> 00:14:35.669
will detail duskily if you have any

00:14:32.899 --> 00:14:38.510
legitimate geographical connection by

00:14:35.669 --> 00:14:40.760
the way this is all meant in farce but

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:42.589
if you have any legitimate geographical

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:45.529
connection to a city you're allowed to

00:14:42.589 --> 00:14:46.820
root for a team and that means including

00:14:45.529 --> 00:14:47.839
I might be going to get the eternal

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.639
heart because this is the end of the run

00:14:47.839 --> 00:14:51.699
so I don't think it actually provides us

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:56.329
with extra HP until we get down to the

00:14:51.699 --> 00:14:57.380
one full heart damage floors by the way

00:14:56.329 --> 00:14:58.399
we'll do another challenge over the

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.600
course of this video because this one's

00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:02.500
going to be over in like no time flat

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.639
here if you have a legitimate

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:07.220
geographical connection to a city you

00:15:04.639 --> 00:15:09.139
can route for that sports team of course

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.519
you might say I can refer whatever

00:15:09.139 --> 00:15:13.699
sports you might want that's correct

00:15:10.519 --> 00:15:15.290
but this is without derision this is it

00:15:13.699 --> 00:15:17.410
makes it justifiable is what I'm trying

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.560
to say if you're from Boston

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:19.459
congratulations

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.800
you can root for the New England

00:15:19.459 --> 00:15:23.870
Patriots I know they're incredibly

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.699
successful but if you're from if you're

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.959
from Massachusetts you can root for the

00:15:25.699 --> 00:15:29.389
New England Patriots if you're from the

00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:33.380
Northeast in general I think you can you

00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:34.519
know Maine Connecticut etc etc and New

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.720
England I should say if you're from New

00:15:34.519 --> 00:15:37.310
England you can root for the New England

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.380
Patriots even though they've done

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:40.790
amazing Saints or from Chicago you can

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:42.800
root for the Chicago Blackhawks you can

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:44.269
root for the Cubs you might be like a

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.709
little bit of a bandwagon fan if you

00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:48.199
only got into it recently but you know

00:15:45.709 --> 00:15:50.420
what sports rely on turning bandwagon

00:15:48.199 --> 00:15:52.010
fans in the real fans and said at some

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:56.079
point everybody had to start from zero

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:59.180
nobody was born a baseball fan you know

00:15:56.079 --> 00:16:00.740
your grandfather showed it to you his

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.060
great-grandfather was there when

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:06.260
baseball was invented it's like a

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:08.060
tesseract from the Avengers anyway long

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:12.260
story short baseball is an infinity

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:12.889
stone long story short what kind of like

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:16.279
that actually

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:21.319
that's like rule number one rule number

00:16:16.279 --> 00:16:25.370
two and now they get more I wouldn't say

00:16:21.319 --> 00:16:27.139
abstract but more arbitrary if you don't

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:29.209
have you're not in the geographical

00:16:27.139 --> 00:16:32.630
region of a team you have two choices

00:16:29.209 --> 00:16:34.459
you can either root for the closest

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:37.430
geographical team or you can root for

00:16:34.459 --> 00:16:38.990
their biggest rival but there's a subset

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.550
of rules that is you can't root for a

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:43.550
team that's won the championship in the

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:45.560
last three years and I'm not again you

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:49.040
can do whatever you want however if

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:50.839
you're from Southern California and

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.980
you're like I'm going to root for the

00:16:50.839 --> 00:16:54.290
Pittsburgh Penguins

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:55.970
they won last year that's not okay and

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:57.620
by that's not okay I mean that's

00:16:55.970 --> 00:17:00.530
completely okay this is a trivial issue

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:01.670
but at the same time you should accept

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:03.770
that you're going to catch some plaque

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:06.260
over it and it's there is what other oh

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:08.300
I really like the fact that they'll

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:10.010
their jerseys are in the richest turn oh

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.900
you like the fact they won last year

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:13.430
that's fine it is more fun to root for a

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:15.770
winner take it from somebody who's

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:17.690
rooting for the team that came third

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:20.810
last last year in second laughs this

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:24.200
year you know I'm holding out for the

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:26.660
bright spots those are the big rules you

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:28.640
know there has to be some otherwise I I

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:30.950
think you're allowed to root for anybody

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.540
if you're from Los Angeles I think it's

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:35.480
okay for you to root for the Buffalo

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:37.160
Sabres but they have to be garbage right

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.780
now if you're if you're cheering for a

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.520
team that's not in your geographical

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:43.040
area you got to get in on the ground

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.940
floor you know because we all have and

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.230
we're just going to do another challenge

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:47.570
what do we even unlock for this

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:49.820
hopefully it's not garbage Oh on suits

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:51.470
that's pretty good all right so that's

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.960
one challenge done here and then we'll

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:55.460
do solar system solar system is very

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.740
scary if I remember correctly this is

00:17:55.460 --> 00:18:00.710
like orbitals but we can't shoot yeah

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:03.140
this is my kind of run we also have

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:05.690
Beelzebub we do have Beelzebub which

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:06.890
didn't exist when rebirth came out I

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:10.760
think so this challenge might actually

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:13.010
be slightly easier now but I thought

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:16.090
that was an after birth edition but

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:20.630
anyway haddon fresh out the kitchen I

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:22.010
only say this because I mean first stuff

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:24.350
I guess I'm kind of a jerk when it comes

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:26.690
to this sort of stuff but yeah everybody

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:29.980
has like I grew up in Canada so when

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:33.110
people root for like NFL teams you know

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:34.700
1997 I don't really watch NFL 1998 I'm

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:36.920
the biggest fan of the Green Bay Packers

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:38.810
that's ever existed I think it's kind of

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:41.150
I think you've got a buy low sell high

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:43.430
so like if you're looking for an NHL

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:44.990
team to support right now there's

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:46.430
several that I would recommend you get

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.220
in on the ground floor it's the same and

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:50.840
if you if you find yourself disagreeing

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:53.030
the number one way that I could flip it

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:55.760
around on North America is that in North

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:59.020
America people only root for like eight

00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:00.440
soccer teams Manchester United

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.870
Manchester City

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:06.050
Chelsea Liverpool and then if you're a

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:08.330
hipster you root for Tottenham and you

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:10.730
go oh oh why do you why do you cheer for

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:12.770
Tottenham Hotspur oh well you know what

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:14.150
really like the set no you like the fact

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:15.200
that they weren't one of the big four at

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:16.520
the time that you started following

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.200
soccer so it made you look like you had

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:20.330
more street cred that's fine okay we've

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.620
all got our reasons if you're if you

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:23.540
have a legitimate reason to cheer for

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:27.650
them that's also fine as well then

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:29.450
beyond that Real Madrid Barcelona the

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:31.970
average North American soccer fan has

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:33.910
not heard of any team in the French

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:36.530
league including Paris saint-germain

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:38.570
they have not heard of any team in the

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:39.680
Dutch league they probably call it Ajax

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:42.820
not IX

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:45.140
I'm just letting you know this is true

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:47.270
I'm now looking down on these people

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:48.710
when I started watching soccer I've

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:51.650
routed from Manchester City it's like

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:53.510
actually the scummiest team to root for

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:56.420
in 2010 because they essentially got

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:57.890
bought and then like bought their way to

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.870
a championship and everyone was like

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:02.930
you're a bandwagon fan and I'm like no

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:05.390
but I'm also not from England so it was

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:07.880
kind of hard to choose a team if I'm

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:10.390
waking up at you know 6 a.m. local time

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:14.660
to watch a sport I want to see some wins

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:16.370
anyway I digress these are the arbitrary

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:18.020
rules that govern my life that's why I

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:19.940
always have a grocery store anecdote

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:21.950
because I I always expect people to

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:25.100
follow my own arbitrary rules that are

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:28.850
inherently meritless but when they don't

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:30.350
I get I get fake outraged and then you

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:35.540
know try to tell those stories on the

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:37.370
show so let's like walk it through with

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.000
a thought experiment you're a small town

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:39.770
boy

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.060
living in a lonely world you took them

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:47.240
in that train going anywhere you're from

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:50.330
you know Glendale Arizona you should

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:51.590
root for the Arizona coyotes you're

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:56.510
getting in on the ground floor because

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:58.340
they kind of suck they're the local team

00:20:56.510 --> 00:21:00.650
to you they're kind of underdogs you

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:02.000
have basically you created plausible

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:03.590
plausible deniability

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.240
there's no reason anyone would ever

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:09.380
assume that you're just glory hunting

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:09.890
you should not root for the Anaheim

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.530
Ducks

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:14.810
they're a divisional rival you would be

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:16.450
accused of glory on without a doubt you

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:23.320
got no unless you have like

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:25.210
then I'll accepted and of course I'll

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:27.460
accept it no matter what because the end

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:30.400
of this story is that this anecdote is

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:31.510
going nowhere and you're entitled to do

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.780
whatever you want because it's your time

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:36.280
and money but in my world you would at

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:43.170
least have to answer for your crimes

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:43.170
until you admitted that get out of here

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:50.290
it's like bear teddy bear taffy roots

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:51.480
for the New England Patriots he has his

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:54.310
reasons

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:56.200
but he lives closer to Seattle now so I

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:59.770
understand understand where he's at he

00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:02.470
grew up in the Massachusetts region so

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:05.440
he has an excuse but I am kind of like

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:09.280
hey dog you know you move this area you

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:10.510
should start cheering for CL not saying

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:13.840
that something's going to happen to you

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:15.940
I don't even watch football but except

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:21.220
for like the Super Bowl because you know

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:23.170
great excuse to eat ribs belly button

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:25.240
dude I'm stoked a speed upgrades

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:27.040
important you this run is going totally

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.600
fine by the way but anything could

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:33.040
happen at any given time to throw it off

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:34.630
the rails so I'm slightly perturbed this

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:39.940
one going to mom's heart is also

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:46.810
hilarious because I not quite as strong

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:49.420
as the last run in concept alone anyway

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:51.430
I know you're probably all a North

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:53.020
American talking about soccer aka

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:55.840
football I'm not going to get into the I

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:57.400
can't have the is it called soccer or

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.510
football argument anymore call it

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.910
whatever you want is getting as

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:03.250
exhausted as the like is exha sandwich

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:05.530
joke and I brought it upon myself but

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:06.970
regardless I just can't do it anymore we

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:09.040
call it two different things I call it

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:10.810
Paris you call it pari that's fine you

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:14.250
know we got to learn to work together on

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:14.250
this on this pale blue dot

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:26.980
excuse me sir don't like that you do

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:29.440
that all right where we at on this run

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:32.560
well we're actually in like a completely

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:36.940
okay spot to be honest with you I don't

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:38.380
really want more HP or speed I would

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.970
take either of them or both of them in

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:42.640
the case of a blood bag we don't need

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:45.370
them we could use the IV bag to get a

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:47.530
little bit of a little bit of protection

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:49.060
you know create that artificial period

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:52.840
of invincibility and then our orbitals

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:54.940
we can use more risk-free but I'm mostly

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:57.400
interested at this point in grabbing

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:59.590
this money and then we can use the money

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:03.100
to hopefully make our life easier on the

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:07.060
shop we really just want I mean to be

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:08.260
honest more orbitals because mmm I like

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:11.710
this a lot actually

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:13.060
we need more orbitals I don't want to

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:14.470
buy champions belt because I don't even

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:16.420
think champions belt does anything for

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:18.490
us it might make sister Maggie do

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:20.790
slightly more damage but I am using

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:23.230
sister Maggie right now instead

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:24.430
something like sac dagger from a deal

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:26.620
with the devil year would be 10 out of

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:30.520
10 and I still want to thank SAC dagger

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:32.050
plus IV bag is the win so if we the

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.570
worst case scenario is we get enough

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:36.370
money to buy something at slightly

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:37.810
increased risk to ourselves by playing

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:40.300
both of these blood banks a little bit

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:41.890
more the best case scenario sac dagger

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:45.490
deal with the devil or from the fall and

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:47.830
we get Zach dagger followed by getting

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:52.600
IV bag from this blood bank situation

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:54.220
here we do have bombs as well so I don't

00:24:52.600 --> 00:25:00.970
know I'm a holding down the fire button

00:24:54.220 --> 00:25:04.500
like it actually matters but oh come on

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:04.500
his face was up

00:25:04.979 --> 00:25:09.519
this hurts me deep in my soul it is

00:25:08.229 --> 00:25:13.749
weren't at the right spot to get rotated

00:25:09.519 --> 00:25:15.429
upon whatever I'm not going to say it

00:25:13.749 --> 00:25:18.519
was worth it but it could have gone

00:25:15.429 --> 00:25:20.440
worse okay that one was the example of

00:25:18.519 --> 00:25:23.379
it going worse we could use this

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.999
placentas fine here um and I know

00:25:23.379 --> 00:25:26.440
honestly both of these are extremely

00:25:24.999 --> 00:25:29.769
good that might have just given us the

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:31.539
wind by itself we have battery charges

00:25:29.769 --> 00:25:34.179
back there as well and we do have

00:25:31.539 --> 00:25:37.840
battery charges back there all right so

00:25:34.179 --> 00:25:39.549
the big play here is there anything else

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:41.200
left in this room

00:25:39.549 --> 00:25:42.940
I mean champion belt we can buy a

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.289
champion belt we do have Steam sale I

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:47.399
don't know if it's ever going to come in

00:25:44.289 --> 00:25:53.169
handy for us we could buy it and then

00:25:47.399 --> 00:25:57.399
give this bad boy right here nice okay

00:25:53.169 --> 00:25:59.830
don't take it yet that's exactly what

00:25:57.399 --> 00:26:04.090
we're looking for so check this hot

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:09.159
action you that now the the Satanic

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:13.409
Bible is also extremely valuable but I

00:26:09.159 --> 00:26:16.809
don't know if it's as valuable as

00:26:13.409 --> 00:26:18.849
properly using IV bag as ridiculous as

00:26:16.809 --> 00:26:21.099
that might sound IV bag opens up the

00:26:18.849 --> 00:26:21.940
door for us to deal a bunch of damage

00:26:21.099 --> 00:26:25.840
risk-free

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:28.389
I think satanic Bibles probably like it

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:30.309
it's the lower standard deviation safer

00:26:28.389 --> 00:26:32.229
choice an IV bag is like the shoot for

00:26:30.309 --> 00:26:35.409
the fences choice so I mean again we've

00:26:32.229 --> 00:26:37.389
already done these all once before we

00:26:35.409 --> 00:26:42.009
might as well go for the the swing for

00:26:37.389 --> 00:26:43.899
the fences choice especially with

00:26:42.009 --> 00:26:48.359
placenta I think it it works nicely

00:26:43.899 --> 00:26:52.330
potentially all right that was easy uh

00:26:48.359 --> 00:26:54.429
we might as well I mean we're going very

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:55.840
quickly here we might as well crank on

00:26:54.429 --> 00:26:58.419
this a little bit hope for some lucky

00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:01.149
pennies nothing grab this get the heck

00:26:58.419 --> 00:27:02.609
out of town still waiting on one more

00:27:01.149 --> 00:27:04.690
orbital to show up but this is

00:27:02.609 --> 00:27:06.820
absolutely fine in and of itself I'm

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:09.429
going to grab champion belt the idea

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:11.710
being that if we ever get any way to

00:27:09.429 --> 00:27:13.479
shoot or any familiar like an incubus

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:15.580
for example that shoots then this will

00:27:13.479 --> 00:27:17.620
be well worth it but apart from that

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:19.420
still very good I think we're going to

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:24.310
get this challenge done we've got the

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:27.120
tools to make it plausible now I'm a shy

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:30.040
away a little bit from using IV bag in

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:32.530
not guaranteed situations like not

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:35.140
situations where we have HP all around

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:36.550
us basically on this floor but once we

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:40.240
get down to the womb it's going to be

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:44.010
like 10 out of 10 for us to for us to

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:44.010
use IV bag as much as possible I think

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:52.320
and I'm actually like over the moon

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:55.510
because I have a great excuse to use

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:57.610
that sucks I have a great excuse to use

00:27:55.510 --> 00:28:01.690
our orbitals aggressively what is the

00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:03.580
great excuse the great excuse is there's

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:05.230
no other option literally unless we want

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:07.000
to use sister Maggie to deal all of our

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:09.750
damage which sounds like a waking

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.310
nightmare of the most high proportion

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:14.290
basically $0.07 speed upgrade via

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:15.490
trinkets melter we might as well buy

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:18.040
blue mat because we're full of money

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:22.530
here and we can always get more puberty

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:22.530
pills still fine nothing wrong with it

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:28.810
might as well take a second trinket I

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:32.530
mean that's what we signed up for here

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:34.300
oh yeah just walk right into the fire

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:38.110
there it seems like a particularly

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:41.200
shrewd investment so I'm just trying at

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:45.180
the present moment to use IV bag anytime

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:45.180
it seems like we could be hit

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:48.309
[Music]

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:54.490
that worked out really really well

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:55.780
actually I would love to get like gimpy

00:28:54.490 --> 00:29:01.630
or something like that in here

00:28:55.780 --> 00:29:05.110
all right not going to happen rotate

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:06.520
dude I'd freaking dare you no rotation

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:08.350
necessary it's a lump of coal does

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:10.120
nothing going down to the next four

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:11.980
still get a long road ahead of us here

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:15.390
along I mean diamond even described the

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:15.390
road as winding

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:24.480
what's your favorite movie trilogy look

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:29.520
I'm just using this as a pretense for a

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:34.230
bit I really like seven eight crazy

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:35.610
nights and nine weeks thanks I thought

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:38.850
it was super weird how they went from

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:41.910
like a gritty you know police thriller

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:43.680
to an animated Adam Sandler driven

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:45.900
Christmas movie I mean you don't see

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:48.720
that kind of risk-taking in art that

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:50.700
much these days so I was I was really

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:54.600
proud of the happy madison corporation

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:57.590
for doing that i thought it was a bold

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.590
artistic choice

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:08.220
gotta think like there's got to be a a

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.110
better example than that and be a

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:12.480
tangent that we can spin off from that

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:14.790
that isn't just about not liking Adam

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:18.330
Sandler movies which is played out at

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:20.580
this present point okay stop stop the IV

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:23.820
bag damages is irrelevant that's is I

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:26.910
mean it's good actually because

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:29.360
everybody knows that Adam Sandler movies

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:32.130
are not the highbrow comedies and I

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:33.630
hated Adam saying this is the most

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:35.820
hipster thing I've said in a while even

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:38.310
including the Belgian waffles thing I've

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:41.310
made a Adam Sandler movies since I was a

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:44.160
young snob you know I don't like 50

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:46.140
first dates I don't like little Nicki

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.880
there were people hating those movies

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:50.190
when they came out I was one of them

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:52.800
I'll admit that recently it's gotten

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:56.940
worse partly because I've gotten older

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:58.680
but anyway regardless that we got to be

00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:02.070
a little careful here we have to be a

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:05.220
little careful here I said put that IV

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:06.360
bag on ice for a bit but I also you know

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:09.720
as I've gotten older I've actually

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:10.680
gotten less snobby or at least I'm still

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.990
snobby

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:14.430
but I don't push my snobbishness on

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:16.080
other people the way that I did when I

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:18.750
was you know a teenager basically

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:19.920
because I had nothing better to do now

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:21.120
and I'm not saying you know if you're a

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.590
teenager you got nothing better to do

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.630
but I definitely had nothing better to I

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:27.150
was an only child well you know my

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:29.310
school didn't offer AP or IB classes

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:30.510
just going to school coming home and

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:35.730
then

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:38.140
reading Rotten Tomatoes feizi enough oh

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:39.790
so we have done this before like we've

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:43.090
cheesed our whole run before by doing

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:46.180
this I'm gonna do it again maybe they

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:50.260
fixed it and by fixed it I mean ruined

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:52.090
it I don't know what happened there I

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:54.010
had to try though you know you got a

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:57.190
swing for the fences on a run like this

00:31:54.010 --> 00:32:01.590
so I don't really know what what we got

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:04.090
or lost I did not need to buy a bomb I

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:05.500
mean we have the ability to fly

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:07.780
we got great damage we've got much more

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:10.630
speed much more HP I guess we should get

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:14.710
familiars we did lose Steam sale in the

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:22.090
process which thinks but try to become

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:25.360
guppy perhaps sure I mean this seems

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:26.290
acceptable to me I think I still think

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.090
we're gonna win this one it's actually

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:32.320
great that they don't allow you to break

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:37.390
your game by accidentally re rolling

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:42.040
your whole run into into garbage so I am

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:43.810
happy with that but at the same time I

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:50.550
was kind of hoping to reroll out of my

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:55.570
blindness and be okay there dude I'm a

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:57.610
little bummed we didn't get BFF because

00:32:55.570 --> 00:33:00.430
these enemies are taken for freaking

00:32:57.610 --> 00:33:02.500
ever to kill can we hold two trinkets we

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:05.160
cannot I'd rather have some lifesteal

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:05.160
just in case

00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:15.519
really all we got to do we did lose IV

00:33:12.549 --> 00:33:19.080
bag so I did you know I worked fairly

00:33:15.519 --> 00:33:21.309
hard in videogame terms at least to get

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:22.690
that kind of wind condition and then

00:33:21.309 --> 00:33:24.399
I've squandered it but I've squandered

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:26.559
it wilfully in the name of entertainment

00:33:24.399 --> 00:33:28.749
which i think is really a great metaphor

00:33:26.559 --> 00:33:33.730
for my life squandered wilfully in the

00:33:28.749 --> 00:33:35.980
name of entertainment that's one of

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:39.429
those books you see on Amazon and it's

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:41.019
like a dollar and you go oh you know I

00:33:39.429 --> 00:33:42.999
was wondering if this book was good

00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:44.619
normally a book that cost a dollar would

00:33:42.999 --> 00:33:47.710
entice me but the fact that this book is

00:33:44.619 --> 00:33:51.190
a dollar at full price kind of tells me

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:52.749
everything I need to know books are kind

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:55.119
of like food in that sense if you see

00:33:52.749 --> 00:33:56.919
like you know oh Dracula's on sale for a

00:33:55.119 --> 00:33:59.169
dollar you're like yeah no kidding Bram

00:33:56.919 --> 00:34:00.909
Stoker already made his money if you see

00:33:59.169 --> 00:34:02.739
a book come out and it's a dollar that's

00:34:00.909 --> 00:34:05.980
like finding out hotdogs that cost 30

00:34:02.739 --> 00:34:08.109
cents you're like I don't know like on

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:09.099
the one hand it's real cheap what's the

00:34:08.109 --> 00:34:11.260
worst that could happen

00:34:09.099 --> 00:34:14.169
on the other hand do I really want to

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:18.730
tempt fate like that so give me the

00:34:14.169 --> 00:34:26.649
polaroid please and Dead Sea Scrolls not

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:29.819
worth it what do you got for me no not

00:34:26.649 --> 00:34:35.589
necessary no no these are all

00:34:29.819 --> 00:34:38.169
justifiable to skip not good enough like

00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:40.960
there is a minimum price that you'd feel

00:34:38.169 --> 00:34:42.190
comfy a maximum price I told his horse

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:43.809
anecdote on the analyst says I don't

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:45.460
know why I keep getting roasted for it I

00:34:43.809 --> 00:34:47.440
was at a grocery store I wanted some

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:49.569
chicken breast I went to the meat

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:51.760
section there were six chicken breasts I

00:34:49.569 --> 00:34:53.919
love you the price $48 I said no I

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:55.569
bought cans of chickpeas instead when

00:34:53.919 --> 00:34:57.099
borderline vegetarian for because I'm

00:34:55.569 --> 00:34:58.869
not paying for you as I was six chicken

00:34:57.099 --> 00:35:00.700
breasts that's crazy now everybody in

00:34:58.869 --> 00:35:02.770
twitch chat is like Oh remember that

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:05.770
time NL paid $48 for chicken breast

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:07.180
that's literally the exact opposite of

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:11.020
what happened over the course of the

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:12.910
story I'm being slandered or in print if

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:16.270
libel according to Jay jonah Jameson in

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:19.420
spider-man 1 but anyway the point is I

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:22.720
didn't buy those chicken breasts however

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:24.760
that's the maximum price if I went to a

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:28.420
grocery store and six chicken breasts

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:30.279
were like 75 cents I would say hey

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:31.569
there's a mistake with the price and

00:35:30.279 --> 00:35:33.099
they'd say no that's the price they are

00:35:31.569 --> 00:35:36.819
and I'd say okay I'm not going to buy

00:35:33.099 --> 00:35:40.029
them that's too cheap for chicken it's

00:35:36.819 --> 00:35:42.190
scary you you're scaring people away

00:35:40.029 --> 00:35:45.609
with them cheap it is like it shouldn't

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:49.809
be able to be sold that cheap when I

00:35:45.609 --> 00:35:53.019
worked in in South Korea my knowledge of

00:35:49.809 --> 00:35:56.079
Korean as a language was very very small

00:35:53.019 --> 00:35:58.240
and a highly-specialized would be an

00:35:56.079 --> 00:36:00.339
incredibly polite way to put it I knew

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:02.529
how to ask where the bathroom was I knew

00:36:00.339 --> 00:36:04.779
I knew how to do it if I knew a noun

00:36:02.529 --> 00:36:06.910
I could ask where it was Oh Shelia da a

00:36:04.779 --> 00:36:08.859
Burger King Oh da au jus say oh you know

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:10.900
you say hey where's the Burger King you

00:36:08.859 --> 00:36:14.529
know as long as you know the word you're

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:18.640
good I also knew one joke in Korean and

00:36:14.529 --> 00:36:19.710
it's a what is the vampires favorite

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:22.210
thing to drink in the morning

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:23.500
kopi now if you don't know what that

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:27.549
means

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:28.809
it kopi is Korean for coffee so it's

00:36:27.549 --> 00:36:29.829
what vampires like to drink in the

00:36:28.809 --> 00:36:31.299
morning because it's what everybody

00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:34.930
likes is drink in the morning but it's

00:36:31.299 --> 00:36:38.049
also a pun because kopi is knows blood

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:40.029
so it's like a not a double entendre but

00:36:38.049 --> 00:36:43.000
it's a little bit of wordplay there now

00:36:40.029 --> 00:36:46.450
you look that joke absolutely killed

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.920
with like five to ten year olds I'm

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:50.039
telling you straight up that was like

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:53.289
their favorite thing in the whole world

00:36:50.039 --> 00:36:56.380
this is a great potential situation for

00:36:53.289 --> 00:36:59.950
us here however beyond that I didn't

00:36:56.380 --> 00:37:05.049
really Black Lotus not bad I didn't

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:06.430
really learn how to survive too much so

00:37:05.049 --> 00:37:10.869
I ended up eating that like a lot of the

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:14.230
same restaurants and I found this it's

00:37:10.869 --> 00:37:16.210
like a food stall that was close to my

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:18.970
apartment at the time and they served

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:21.700
fried chicken in a cup like popcorn

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:24.130
chicken style in a sauce it was a dollar

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:25.660
for a cup of chicken and he might be

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:28.839
thinking of course it's dollar it's

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:30.520
Korea that's you know ignorant it's a

00:37:28.839 --> 00:37:32.290
first world country

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:34.510
stuff is I mean it was a little cheaper

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:36.940
there to eat out but it wasn't like oh

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:39.250
yeah you won like a whole you know

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:41.890
Chilean seabass that'll be ten cents

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:45.370
like the prices were not absurdly cheap

00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:48.670
anyway the point is I was stoked I was

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:50.290
like look at this delicious meats for a

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:53.800
dollar plus I'm supporting a local

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:57.310
business and I had a one-on-one student

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:58.450
who was particularly you know like great

00:37:57.310 --> 00:38:00.190
at English would just be the way to

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:02.740
describe she was like fluent at English

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:05.170
so most of our lessons were just like

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:06.970
you know sharing anecdotes and then like

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:09.160
mild corrections to grammar and stuff

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:10.570
like that so I was like hey check it out

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:11.620
I've been eating this food what's it

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:14.230
called and she's like that's called

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:16.930
dakgangjeong and I was like alright now

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:19.450
when I go to the food stall I can say

00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:21.640
that instead of just pointing at it and

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:25.360
then like them laughing at me because

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:26.770
I'm a piece of garbage but and then she

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:31.000
was like by the way don't eat that

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:34.000
because it's probably pigeon that was

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.410
that was a sobering moment for me for

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.510
one because I was like first pigeon

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:39.370
tastes pretty good and I guess I mean

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:41.710
Who am I to look down on eating pigeon

00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:43.060
is a kind of meat like I did I've been

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:45.010
eating chicken my whole life maybe

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:46.980
pigeon is you know I'm just holding a

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:49.870
bias against it that I shouldn't but

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:52.150
yeah that was the I was a story of how I

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:54.580
probably ate like a lot of pigeon maybe

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:56.470
I mention she was also like 13 so she

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:57.940
might not have known really what she was

00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:59.830
talking about but I am inclined to trust

00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:02.620
her considering she lived there and I

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:06.040
was just a tourist right I'm just a

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:09.390
tourist and life is a night man same

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:15.460
thing like used to buy like these fried

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:16.780
meat on a stick items and she told me

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:19.450
don't eat those either it's probably

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:21.490
some kind of garbage meat basically this

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:23.350
student of mine was the reason I ended

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:25.780
up not contracting some kind of terrible

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:27.280
parasite when I lived in Korea not

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:29.290
because it's dirty country but because

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:32.680
the chose to live it like eat at the

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:33.400
dirtiest places one time these things

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:35.200
they're called

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:37.800
PO Jung mantras which are basically like

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:40.140
food tents at the side of the road

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:41.190
these to eat this food one near my

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:42.570
apartment all the time it's called oh

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:45.480
dang it's a steamed fish cake is

00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:47.760
delicious it like 30 cents a skewer so

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:50.490
you know for like a couple of bucks you

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:52.020
can get a delicious high-protein meal

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:54.630
kind of take part in the local culture

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:56.010
you know it feels good one time I sat

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:57.630
down in one there was an old older

00:39:56.010 --> 00:40:00.660
Korean man next to me starts talking to

00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:03.560
me in Korean not a wise move on his part

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:06.170
but you know very congenial of him

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:07.650
regardless he leaves and he gestures

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:09.870
understanding that I have understood

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:12.630
nothing of what he said up to this point

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:14.190
he's like hey you can eat my food and I

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:16.380
like looked at the lady running the cart

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:17.820
I was like I made a gesture that in my

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:19.950
head was like is this guy saying I could

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:22.950
eat his food and she was like yeah and I

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:26.250
ate it and I was like this is real bad

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:29.760
so I asked her what it was she said it

00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:31.650

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:34.320

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:41.040

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:48.060
favorite meal on earth but I don't know

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:51.720
the pork foot just tasted like plaster

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:54.270
to me we have beaten solar system this

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:56.040

00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:57.450
