##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.840
everybody welcome back to northern land

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.629
please abiding mines gantry plus we've

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.340
been driven play all right we may be no

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.259
God don't give me the keeper right well

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:17.400
okay it's apollyon again crazy talk but

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:19.109
user cqd six to eight 4k six with soy

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.199
milk right off the bat so it's gonna be

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.160
one of these huh sure I could have

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.689
voided it but where's the fun in that

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.630
sure I could have waited to see if I got

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.850
something that made soy milk work and

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.620
then picked up a soy milk after where's

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.750
the fun in that I like chew morning

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.700
myself into this unfortunate situation

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.379
instead either way maybe we survived you

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.170
know there but for the grace of whatever

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:50.280
deity you choose to believe in or

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.920
support on our last run we did get res

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.340
by guppies collar twice it's not like we

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.710
got res six times you know isn't 25%

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.289
chance of being Reds twice so we didn't

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.199
win the lottery we just got a little

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.100
lucky come Oh what is up buddy oh no

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.150
baby what is you doing this cats out of

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.619
control wonder what it's like when

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.970
you're a cat and you get that that

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.490
feeling you know if you've never owned

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:23.189
cats there's like once per day roughly

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.150
they just start running around like they

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.650
jumping on everything running from one

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.659
side of the apartment to the other of

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.880
the house you know whatever container

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.890
the cat has chosen to live in and don't

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.220
get it twisted you didn't choose the cat

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.220
shows

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.800
when it's just like a like an over waves

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.960
like hunger it's an overwhelming need to

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.450
just run and scratch up our hardwood and

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.050
probably lose the pet deposit that we

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.000
put on this apartment I don't know maybe

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.930
we'll see we'll take it up when we move

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.770
out either way what am i hoping for a

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.020
year it's easy dude Libra in an item

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.850
room is a game winner we have that soy

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.740
milk Libra a couple of times it's the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.640
dream synergy and it has happened

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.740
there's always the chance that with the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.720
most recent booster back and patch maybe

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.920
they took soy milk out of the special

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.140
items honestly that's pretty good and

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.940
they put it in its own like normal pool

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.470
or not its own pool but a normal pool

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.470
but probably not if we're being honest

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:36.190
so I would still expect to have a little

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:39.620
bit of a hard time finding yeah finding

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:43.550
big items as a result of the fact that

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.640
we have seen an item that sort of thinks

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:53.110
but we took anyway um these guys are

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:58.459
nasty dude no okay well I mean I

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:02.480
genuinely tried on that one XJ wtk to 8

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:06.260
B obviously that's a big loss I kind of

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.850
want you to just murder me I'm kind of

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.310
sick of dealing with enemies this is a

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.840
very simple of luxury I'm sick of

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.940
dealing enemies would just rush us down

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.630
dealing with enemies I should say on

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.209
that room mil the decision that we I

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.310
think we're dead no we're not dead

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:28.250
the decision that we made that got us

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:29.540
killed was not playing badly on that

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.980
room like honestly I thought we dodged

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.930
pretty well in that room okay don't make

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.110
this a three death video it was taking

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.530
soy milk but that's where I find solace

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.299
honestly because I want to be the guy

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.970
who takes oink in his first item room

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:47.420
there's no there's no pleasure well this

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.440
pleasure to some extent the luck and

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.800
range upgrade

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.209
there's no danger in just being like ok

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.159
that's soy milk

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.709
a fun item that I won't take cuz I'm

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.790
lettin Isaac adult I don't have fun in

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.150
Isaac anymore

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.420
I'm just clapping bangers from the blue

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:11.329
line scoring 50 goals of season you know

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:13.609
Dany Heatley I want to be the guy who

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.170
takes bad fun items and tries to make

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.820
them work because if we had won that run

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:21.350
it would have been worth 10 wins in my

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.100
world so life goes on I'm not too salty

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:30.680
about it

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:33.110
I do wish big million laughs girls oh

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.180
okay this is like we're in some

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:39.289
full-blown is an L okay territory I

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.550
don't really have an excuse for that one

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:44.030
I mean I do have an excuse but I don't

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.560
want to say the excuses that we got hit

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.039
by a champion I'm like a

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:52.039
one-in-a-million shot but now this is

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.840
you know I take pleasure in having lost

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:56.270
the streak and then getting another loss

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.909
directly after it okay but like these

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.840
dodges are they brain this is so weird

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:04.400
to me because they're just like my

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.740
identity and Isaac is going through such

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:13.280
ups and downs like my consistency is at

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:15.830
an all-time low first off did I get like

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.360
a static champion belt that applies to

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.590
every single run that I do in this game

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.580
at this point or something because I'm

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:26.840
losing my freakin mind

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.409
there's a million champions however what

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.810
was I going to say

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:32.570
I forgot oh I've been doing if you

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.580
ignore a couple of recent dailies on the

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:38.449
most recent of all dailies I've been

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:41.030
doing fine a really pre well top 250 top

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.289
100 you know cup of goose cup of Cris as

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.090
Dan says I don't really know what that

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:44.740
means but I'll defend of the death is

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.900
right to say it

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.699
three cents okay not that valuable and

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.159
then I come over here and I'm like Judas

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:54.349
the character I played 250 times still

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:57.229
illiterate until I'm dead you know where

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:59.330
does that come from I don't know it's a

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:00.979
lack of focus a little bit of you know

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.690
clumping variance or something like that

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:07.130
giving me these mad champions this run

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.770
though I can feel it coming

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:13.570
tonight Oh Lord we got it the pressure

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:15.500
is on though because when you die early

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.450
you're like well it's not going to be a

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.860
great episode for gameplay so I really

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:24.500
got to bring the heat in the commentary

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:26.510
so uh oh jeez what it got him okay let's

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:30.050
move on now I'm not going to sweat that

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:35.210
too much you know losing a two streak is

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:38.900
effectively worth zero so you're never

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:43.040
supposed to like do that but I'm going

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:44.570
to anyway because if we if we can't win

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.160
the run on the first crack we might as

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.530
well embrace the same right so now I

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.230
don't know whether we sucked up the d6

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:53.750
or book of sin I am mad we sort of saw

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:56.570
things manifest there we sucked up the

00:06:53.750 --> 00:07:02.090
d6 it turned into the book of sin and

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:04.670
then we sucked that up too so I will

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:07.580
know when we use void if it gives us a

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:10.430
consumable then we have a book of sin as

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.320
well as the d6 presumably so I might

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:18.440
just use it just to confirm or deny that

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:25.100
we're in that position dubious start to

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:28.220
these runs dude yeah we don't want this

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.900
anyway so it got rear old we did not get

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.250
it consumable but we did get a luck and

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:38.360
damage upgrade I don't know where we're

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:41.860
at here I'm trying to I guess we suck

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:46.190
the item as we reroll it is my current

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:49.070
interpretation so like there let's let's

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.540
walk it through step by step we had torn

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:56.000
way no we didn't have torn photo we had

00:07:50.540 --> 00:08:01.190
the match book he's freaking guys man we

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.350
had the match book we sucked it up it

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:06.380
rear old it but sucked it up

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:08.630
simultaneously it rear old it into torn

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:11.180
photo but we didn't suck up torn photo

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:16.460
we sucked up matchbook I think like the

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:19.580
d6 effect we're not going to know how

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:20.310
the d6 affect way not well maybe that's

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.270
correct

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:24.300
I don't think we're going to know how

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:26.610
the d6 effect works until we use it on a

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:29.970
new space bar item like the only thing

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:31.560
we view what a shot from this guy the

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:34.230
only thing we've used the d6 on is

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:38.010
itself from a space bar item perspective

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:41.100
so I want to like you know get a book

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:42.300
and then reroll it as we suck it up and

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.680
see what happens see if we get the

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.300
effect of the book the other thing is we

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:54.240
should know like immediately whether or

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:56.400
not we do so yeah feeling like I've lost

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:59.490
my Isaac mojo on this run to some extent

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.080
but you know in a way it's good not that

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:04.020
we've lost our mojo but that we have a

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:07.650
baseline of badness as long as I don't

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:10.650
lose three runs in the same video it

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:14.940
can't be as bad as that Judas run that

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:16.260
Judas video I should say okay we found

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:19.860
the secret room which is incredible

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:24.410
but we did see there that we sucked up

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:28.110
doctors remote which means that the d6

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:29.850
only rerolls it after we suck it up I

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:31.140
was really hoping we'd suck up the space

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.760
bar item re-roll it and if it's a

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:38.340
passive we get a stat bonus but that's a

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:42.240
little unrealistic as opposed well it is

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:44.900
only monstro it's all right MA I'm only

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.900
monstro

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.720
we're not going to be able to take too

00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:55.760
many deals of the devil you know there's

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.760
a narrow slice of deals with the devil

00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:01.860
that can work for us right now obviously

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:04.550
if you got like mom's knife or brimstone

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:07.950
we probably all those are 2h or sorry -

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:10.050
too hard deal so we might not be able to

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:11.730
but let's see what we get here you can

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:14.670
just like drop a battery charge that'd

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:16.620
be pretty good for me so I could you

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:18.720
know continue to probably self-sabotage

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.399
with this void item here right no deal

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.430
with the devil that's right

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:25.230
I made some poor decisions with respect

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:26.640
to damage earlier okay so let's play the

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.620
rest of the floor as if we're still

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.790
going to you know get a deal with the

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.500
devil on the next floor which means are

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:34.860
going to come in here I'm going to play

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:36.779
this twice I'm going to play it one more

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.970
time as I want to get to 15 cents this

00:10:36.779 --> 00:10:40.410
also allows us to get into the okay it

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.850
also allows us to get into the boss trap

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:46.140
room have a gamble on you we got one

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:47.760
luck my favorite NOS song and then the

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:53.940
idea was we hope to get a key there we

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:56.720
didn't that's okay then got this looking

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:59.190
for red hearts pennies not bad

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:02.579
we're going to come in here when I pop

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:11.160
this range down obviously not what I was

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:16.110
hoping for gurgling first think you stay

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:21.480
away from the red chest until you kill

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:23.820
gurgling 'he's he killed gurglings see

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.140
that's prequel means bringing it back

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.670
here pretty much single-handedly

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:31.079
responsible for the rise of that

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:31.500
subreddit mmm a surprise but a welcome

00:11:31.079 --> 00:11:39.120
one

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:41.430
okay let's go it's just pin we're alive

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.949
but you know do we deserve to be is that

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:45.839
the question if so who answers we want

00:11:43.949 --> 00:11:47.190
to suck that up but in order to suck it

00:11:45.839 --> 00:11:48.899
up we probably need to get a key from

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:52.190
finishing this so that we can get into

00:11:48.899 --> 00:11:52.190
our shop

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:05.600
not gonna happen

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:07.460
okay well we've already been to our

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.420
secret room we're taking away too much

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:13.270
time here by the way

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:16.220
one bomb is not enough to get through

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:17.240
the spirit hearts that are necessary or

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.650
sorry the tinted rocks that are

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.970
necessary to get to that tinted rock in

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:21.710
the bathrooms we play this two more

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:23.930
times we blow this up we're looking for

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:27.500
a key we didn't get a key

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:31.640
we got another penny as bad we're moving

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:33.170
on and at least some things have worked

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.180
out for us on this floor you know we've

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:40.820
lived because the grace of those spirit

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:42.200
hearts that showed up so lucky yes we've

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:44.810
got a 100% deal with the devil chance

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:47.830
for now and we do have doctors remotes

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:53.620
sucked up but that's not a good reason

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:53.620
to use the void there's a key of course

00:12:55.390 --> 00:13:04.550
one so there was a key that showed up at

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:10.610
the least important opportunity then

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:14.090
world what jeez Louise hear this see

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:15.920
this is how I know that like you hear

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:18.290
your voice and I mean this is the fact

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.910
but you hear your voice differently than

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:21.080
other people here due to the fact that

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:26.420
you're hearing it like through the bones

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:29.570
in your skull because my crash test

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:32.030
dummies impression in my head sounds a

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:33.890
hundred percent perfect and then people

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:36.340
go that impressions pretty bad and I go

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:42.920
well on the other hand it's perfect and

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:48.910
you're wrong clock in now there was a

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:51.590
real Jim he would not because Sidney

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:53.540
smart as Austin says it's a little more

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:54.920
of a Randy Newman I don't even know like

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.840
it's not like I'm a hundred years old

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.280
but I don't know people even know the

00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.290
crash test dummies that well anymore

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:02.120
they were a huge band there's I believe

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:03.620
they're from Manitoba Canada

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.390
and I say I believe because I want to

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.650
you know gloss over the fact that of

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:08.450
course I read that on their Wikipedia

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:12.350
page like less than two months ago but

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:23.680
you know they were very famous for that

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:26.300
song once there was an X that

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:34.130
idiosyncrasies made it do this weird

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:37.460
thing Y and then Z know is drama drama

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:40.880
this is the hook mm-hmm you know that's

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:43.070
the you could write your own verse

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:48.050
generator pretty easily I feel just like

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:49.550
a mad libs page or something also if

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:52.850
you're like I don't know that song well

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:56.000
have you seen Dumb and Dumber they got a

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:58.460
song on that soundtrack to Jane Gothel

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.490
Peter Pumpkinhead

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:03.500
fan fan and fan and fan and fan and fan

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.550
him you know how I know that it's in

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.440
that movie because I've seen it a

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:08.510
hundred times because Jim Carrey's in it

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:10.040
another that movies basically Canadian

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:12.110
as far as I'm concerned it was made in

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:14.030
America with an American crew Jeff

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:15.620
Daniels is American but Jim Carrey and

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:21.040
the crash test dummies really were the

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:21.040
two big unifying factors of that film

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:30.399
okay

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:31.529
I mean like this run is not that bad but

00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:34.420
Oh

00:15:31.529 --> 00:15:36.490
first off I'm eating crap on like all

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:44.709
these situations here which is mostly my

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:47.250
own fault but secondly okay like look at

00:15:44.709 --> 00:15:49.149
our item tracker admittedly I sucked up

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:51.579
items which is why they're not in the

00:15:49.149 --> 00:15:55.230
item tracker and one of those actually

00:15:51.579 --> 00:16:03.190
led to a damage upgrade which is awesome

00:15:55.230 --> 00:16:12.970
look at the speed on this guy he can't

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:14.410
be stopped that was madness like I know

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:17.199
that we've just compromised our deal

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:23.019
with the devil again but did you see the

00:16:17.199 --> 00:16:28.360
speed on that individual I have one

00:16:23.019 --> 00:16:30.399
speed that's not that bad this guy was

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:35.110
South Beach bringing the heat Miami by

00:16:30.399 --> 00:16:37.509
Will Smith okay we got one fine just

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:39.519
work our way out of this look on a

00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:41.170
statistical basis this run doesn't look

00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:43.449
that bad but we're 11 minutes on the

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:48.699
flooded caves one I would say that sort

00:16:43.449 --> 00:16:50.680
of thing is bad baby so we have to go

00:16:48.699 --> 00:16:53.380
back because oh no wait it's not that

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:55.149
far thankfully but you know where we're

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:59.680
really feeling the burn now is like all

00:16:55.149 --> 00:17:03.220
those oh my god Liberty Cap you're the

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:05.860
greatest double our rate of fire to take

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:10.539
one damage off that's a freakin monkeys

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:12.959
paws situation I can live with should

00:17:10.539 --> 00:17:16.270
never play chicken with these guys but

00:17:12.959 --> 00:17:22.600
no chicken tonight with my popcorn no

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:24.069
chicken tonight the mod stream like this

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:27.910
is how you should know that this runs

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:35.850
fudged up in like every which way

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:35.850
oh my god

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:53.950
okay we've lived we got a half red heart

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:55.510
life is like a box of chocolates my

00:17:53.950 --> 00:18:00.070
momma told me go to school get my

00:17:55.510 --> 00:18:02.110
doctorate something something sensible

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:04.290
you can profit with but still supported

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:14.500
me when I did the opposite

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:16.630
Kanye West again good work I got to be

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:18.460
quiet like I'm realizing that my

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:20.020
incredibly cogent and hilarious

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:23.220
commentary might be the reason I'm like

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:29.050
losing focus here in some situations

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:30.100
let's go Pokemon's is okay I mean

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:30.640
there's a lot of stuff in there that's

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:34.240
interesting

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:38.200
you take the quarter for certain we have

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:40.510
a bet Harry charge if we have a battery

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.370
charge you might as well just in we can

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:45.670
get a battery charge I think we should

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:48.580
embrace tranquility here what I mean by

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:50.350
that is by the omega penny

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:55.330
I'm calling it the Omega penny again by

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:57.430
the way screw you buddy by the Omega

00:18:55.330 --> 00:19:00.010
penny and then try to use the D six

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:01.810
Omega penny void combo to I don't know I

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:05.340
feel like it might rip a hole in the

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:12.490
fabric of the space-time continuum but I

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:15.280
need to do it nonetheless I don't really

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:16.390
understand how it's going to work but

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.190
I'm going to choose not to worry about

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:21.610
it and just focus on the stat upgrades

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:25.560
that I'm hoping to achieve and about

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:28.270
pokey mans as well because I wanted I

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:32.350
wanted to and I don't think he trusts in

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:35.740
my self-righteous suicide I cry when

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:37.690
angels deserve to die oh jeez okay so

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:44.260
did we didn't get any stat upgrades at

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:48.310
all there but we should have the Omega

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:51.570
penny aka the crooked penny in our void

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:55.240
like stored in our void item right now

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:58.270
which is you know scary but also pretty

00:19:55.240 --> 00:20:00.280
dope it's one of the most powerful space

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:00.850
bar items if you know the odds are in

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.040
your favor

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:06.520
I'm excited that's just what we needed

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:09.940
before this boss fight so we're about

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:13.920
four minutes late leaving this floor not

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:13.920
a great sign from being honest

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:22.120
once there was an Isaac run I thought I

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:27.880
would do a quick one just before I

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:30.850
streamed in when my stats were garbage

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:33.880
I realized that I'd be late and get

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:43.180
yelled at by Chad I'm excited too soon

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:50.410
what what am I supposed to do he's too

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:52.300
fast come on

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:53.410
36 percent chance to deal with the devil

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:57.160
brimstone

00:20:53.410 --> 00:21:08.830
come on nanny-state give me a job

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:12.100
I'm ready he's done it we need it and

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:14.440
then you know embrace the absurdity just

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:16.090
go for it dude we got our HP back

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.770
we got a rate of fire increase and

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:19.690
didn't lose damage rate of fire increase

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:22.050
speed and lucky increase no damage

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:24.460
downgrade I'll take it

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:28.330
so like the run is still not very good

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:30.160
but rotten baby is a huge help and our

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:33.040
speed upgrade gives us a fighting chance

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:39.190
of actually dodging enemies that rush us

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:41.800
down okay but like kind of squander it

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:45.060
oh I'm excited carries over floor to

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.060
floor so that's pretty good

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:52.030
good thing I'm drowsy is a corresponding

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:53.350
pill with the same effect but in a

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:54.880
positive direction for us like I'm

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:56.380
always getting these I'm drowsy pills

00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:00.520
and being like thank God I got I'm

00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:05.460
drowsy it's such a good pill anyway

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:09.990
we're on one HP so that's terrifying

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:09.990
never should have come in that direction

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:15.820
never should have spent my keys either

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:17.770
on a room that just contained trinkets

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:19.270
like I don't think we need champion belt

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:22.320
I think the champions have been belted

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:22.320
enough for one day

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:29.440
Liberty caps good was there anything

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:32.470
else in there that could have saved this

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:34.270
no okay well we just got to play well

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:39.970
it's reassuring but also terrifying

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:41.230
based on our performance thus far there

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:42.670
you go now that you've cleared it's like

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:45.250
a freaking Rubik's Cube you know we

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:46.690
solved the one corner the rest of it

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:52.120
just falls into place we just got to do

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:54.420
the right algorithm here good stuff now

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:58.840
give me some red hearts or a key

00:22:54.420 --> 00:23:04.120
mr.bad room bring me a key bring me a

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:06.910
key Wong's there was a key that showed

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:12.700
up that an opportune time then won me

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:14.560
the game coos okay nothing huh well

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:16.410
smart decision or at least lucky

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:18.730
decision to come to the item room here

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:21.160
all right item room come to the big room

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:25.420
here because the big room has thankfully

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:32.290
given me a very fairly predictable set

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:35.340
of enemies that are easy to kill and a

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:35.340
pill we can't do anything with

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:57.940
who exploding enemies huh no the worst

00:23:55.510 --> 00:24:00.370
part about it is that like every single

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:02.880
one of these has an excuse that my first

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:05.350
instinct is to fall back on but I won't

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:08.020
share in the picked up a soy milk second

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:10.179
one we just got hit third one very

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:14.350
understanded I mean we're 18 minutes on

00:24:10.179 --> 00:24:16.120
the caves too but good lord man they

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:18.550
like amp up the champions in the game

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:20.140
prick they recently added more hoppers

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:21.220
