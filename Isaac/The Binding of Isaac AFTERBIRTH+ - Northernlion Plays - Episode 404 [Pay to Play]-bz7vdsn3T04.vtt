##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.270
everybody welcome back to northernlion

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.589
plays The Binding of Isaac Ashford plus

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.089
we did the speed challenge on the last

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.649
episode it made me want to die and then

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.590
fulfilled my wish we're gonna do blue

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.320
bomber instead which is bomb synergies

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.480
plus bomber boy no no bomber boy it's

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.310
blue baby and a bunch of bomb synergies

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.080
oh and we can't shoot but we're not hurt

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.210
by our own bombs because of pyromaniac

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.220
that's right okay well this one only

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.830
well actually goes quite far it goes we

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.669
don't need that it goes all the way to

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.170
[Music]

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.800
Sheol was going to say the Cathedral

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.690
that would have been incorrect I'm not

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.370
sure if our damage stat matters like

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.340
actually at all here we probably are

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.469
like very set for life on this one I

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.600
guess the idea is they give you brother

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.550
Bobby because some enemies will be like

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.530
away from you they'll be like behind a

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.420
gap or something like that so it does

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.980
make sense to give you some range means

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.140
to hit enemies but for now this is a lot

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.969
of damage I imagine we will hate

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.090
ourselves on rooms where we have to hit

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.979
something that's far away but we could

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.070
also just maybe bomb our way out of most

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.930
of those rooms to begin with so now this

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.360
is what I'm talking about maybe a little

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.799
bit easy in the whole scheme of things

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:23.909
but the speed challenge is like a cosmic

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:26.070
torture from another realm so this one

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.670
being a little bit fun I don't think

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.290
it's a sin my wife feels like when you

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.640
say that you got to put like baby on the

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.320
end of it I don't feel like it's a sin

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.070
baby trying to trick the game into I

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.490
don't even want to know where the

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.030
connotations of that one we're going do

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.390
this

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.659
we got 39 cents we're gonna have 44

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.240
cents in Amir's in our head we did have

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:56.369
44 cents but what's in your head in your

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:59.100
head zombie blue bomber blew babe eh eh

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.649
eh I'm not going to continue I thought

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:07.439
about it but seems like a poor idea I

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:09.869
don't even think we can use

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.420
the potato peeler but I'll buy it to see

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.980
if we can we cannot we'd have to respawn

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.550
as somebody else to get value out of

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.940
that little stinky but I'll survive I

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.980
think our next play and honestly like

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.810
this should be a pretty easy win

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.209
considering the circumstances by the way

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.860
we will learn to probably hate the fact

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.450
that we can't shoot like in the early

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.970
game it seems awesome you're like oh why

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.440
would I ever need to shoot I got bombs

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:39.120
not the truth is usually you'll reach a

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.610
point on the game at which your shots

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.290
would do more damage than your bombs

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.370
probably are not quite there yet given

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.780
the items that we've gotten but by the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.840
time we get up to the Cathedral we might

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.730
be feeling a little bit differently

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.349
magic mush potentially lovely

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.700
I appreciate the other stats at least

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.440
and you know what I appreciate getting

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.860
the familiar here as well what we are

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.319
probably going to do is use our permit

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.579
cards to avoid boss rush get an item I'm

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.440
going to use it right now actually to

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.599
save us some HP and hope we get another

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.160
teleport card later but if we could if

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.100
we could find a way out of boss rush I

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:20.370
would also be for that

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:25.109
I don't think becoming guppy matters at

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.700
all so I'm going to go with black powder

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.260
which just gives us one other like

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.569
alternative means with which to deal

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.819
damage and if it works lovely if we

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.739
never use it less lovely but not

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:39.060
necessarily a bad thing I didn't realize

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.230
you were on my side to be honestly we

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.200
might be done with this for in like two

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.769
minutes I'm fine with seven seals little

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.019
harbingers I think that well not the

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.060
greatest item in the game any other

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.290
means of doing damage to an enemy is

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.250
probably something we're interested in

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.790
right now that doesn't really help and

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.200
we'll move on

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.870
three minutes in were three floors deep

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.520
probably slowed it down a little bit

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:08.940
we're going a little too fast

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:11.390
I'm a little bit if I'm being honest

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.650
with you I'm a little bummed out because

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.390
the truth of the matter is the run that

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.520
we have right now mind you we would

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.010
never have this this early on it on a

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.230
different challenge but this run right

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.090
here is so well suited to being a decent

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.340
crack at winning the speed challenge

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.810
that I'm you'll forgive me I think after

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.520
the last episode for being a little

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:34.680
upset but of course unlimited bombs that

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.680
don't hurt us is a huge advantage in any

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:41.040
situation but like for even even the

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:46.110
bomb items accepted from our present

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:48.360
situation this is like a good setup that

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.990
we would certainly like have at least an

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.930
okay chance of succeeding on so I'm only

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.850
mildly bummed but I would be lying if I

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.330
said I weren't at least mildly bombs

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.980
bombs our key is you might think I'm

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.830
happy with it but I actually would

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:08.820
prefer to have more bombs and the main

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:12.780
reason there is I think with mr. Megas

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:17.640
we might want other bombs like I'm not

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:19.740
sure if we get the value out of out of

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.480
mr. mega with our kamikaze bombs we

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.320
probably do now that I think about it a

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:28.320
little bit more closely but we might not

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.270
what okay I'm dumb I thought I could

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.650
pseudo heard myself and then walk across

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.450
but of course if we don't take damage

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.000
we're not actually being hurt it's not

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:42.840
quite an IV bag situation so that was a

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:45.030
bit of a whiff but we made up for it

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.430
here on sous - a hearts - of Hearts is

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.500
sadly meaningless on Susan's worth quite

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.210
a lot ahead of Krampus I thought about

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.640
taking but it eliminates like our best

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:58.080
way of dealing damage so I will probably

00:05:52.640 --> 00:06:03.180
instead just not do this similarly we

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:05.730
can't cheat the system by using bombs

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.740
like IV bag to try to get into the curse

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:10.140
room without taking damage that's only

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.200
going to lead to despair

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:15.300
and not just pay it's not a joke about

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:20.820
these nuts is what I'm trying to convey

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:22.410
here two keys to room I think we should

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.420
reroll both we're looking for spirit

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.400
hearts like almost exclusively we don't

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.320
need keys we don't need money

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.800
we need spirit hearts for survival

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.690
purposes oh you moron

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.720
this is fine this is fine just keep

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:40.470
yourself you know blow up the the

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:42.390
extraneous kind of elements here another

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.830
teleport card is very nice just have a

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:47.790
little bit more patience with this one

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:52.680
and then don't be afraid to buy spirit

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:55.560
hearts from shops we can still go to a

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.760
curse room and save ourselves from some

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.470
strife but I don't think that's the

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.320
right play right now we're going to save

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:04.410
the Hermit card so I don't feel bad

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:07.170
about using the world card several

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:09.900
batteries like a lot of batteries if

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:13.350
only we'd gotten a library instead of a

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.880
two-room would have been a positive

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.680
change but the thing about having

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.350
unlimited bombs that we really should be

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.570
able to create spirit hearts all the

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:23.520
time not all the time but like if we

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:25.800
ever come across a tempted rock we can

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.300
blow it up we can blow up every skull we

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.010
could blow up mushrooms but we probably

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:33.060
shouldn't because they have poisoned us

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:35.520
in the past here ace of clubs empress

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.560
neither really too valuable

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.270
with a luck status zero I don't have

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.860
high hopes here but those hopes have

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.810
already been exceeded if I'm being

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.150
honest with you

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:47.250
stars card is a strictly worse version

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.560
of the Hermit on this run and honestly I

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:54.420
respect that you gave me what I wanted

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:57.030
and then we we got out by another spirit

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:59.310
heart and we will buy mom's tea and

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:03.210
honestly buddy in a box is pretty okay

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:05.010
but I'm not going to not going to worry

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:06.630
too much about I'm not going to lose any

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:08.400
sleep over not picking up buddy in a box

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.900
on this one we tried to make buddy in a

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:13.020
box work on the Speed Challenge it

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:16.230
almost what is this room oh my lord I

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:19.710
think this is new it's a tough spike

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:22.259
room at least on first glance

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:27.000
we almost made it happen I thought the

00:08:22.259 --> 00:08:31.320
the buddy in a box speed combo so we've

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.479
got creepy bombs now might as well throw

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.520
those down and we've got enough speed

00:08:33.479 --> 00:08:37.919
especially with the tractor beam here to

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:42.029
have a chance to at least make the

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:44.190
occasional black powder work and the

00:08:42.029 --> 00:08:45.420
harbingers are actually crushing it

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:50.940
right now shouldn't I walk over the

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:53.330
creep that was fine we got a deal with

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:56.730
the devil we probably did not deserve

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:59.330
well I will do this I don't think any

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:02.459
stat increase could conceivably be worth

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:04.709
giving up that much of our relative

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:06.209
amount of HP but things are looking

00:09:04.709 --> 00:09:08.400
strong let's be honest we're on

00:09:06.209 --> 00:09:12.050
necropolis 2 8 minutes into a run unless

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:16.440
our HP gives out like words relatively

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:24.390
set here the rooms like this can be can

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:26.400
be a problem 1.2 speed not really enough

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:28.620
to just say like black powder is 10 out

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:32.279
of 10 here in a spirit are nonetheless

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:36.330
so what's the in my dream world what's

00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:39.209
the payout here well we go to boss rush

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:41.430
boss rush gives us dark bum and then we

00:09:39.209 --> 00:09:44.490
just teleport away you can start to see

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:46.650
a little bit of the unhappiness or

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:50.250
discontented miss creeping in here like

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:51.480
not every enemy is dying in one hit and

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:54.560
when we're talking about bombs that

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.560
makes me a very sad boy

00:09:55.610 --> 00:10:03.950
give me some give me some teleports so

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:06.500
we can expedite the the discontented

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:09.980
miss give me some spirit hearts so I

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:14.589
guess we're gonna teleport into the shop

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:14.589
regardless anyway this room could be big

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:21.980
in pretty much any sense of the word if

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:23.899
we're not careful too hard it's just so

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.880
satisfying when you blow up a skull and

00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:27.950
it doesn't turn into it or so you blow

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.450
up one of the skulls on the ground and

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:33.740
it doesn't turn into a turret it's like

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:35.420
the world's your oyster I'm still I'm

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.230
waiting for the other foot to drop other

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.899
shoe to drop

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:40.459
I don't know the expression I sort of

00:10:38.899 --> 00:10:42.529
don't understand it what is like you

00:10:40.459 --> 00:10:44.240
someone just went up for a sweet jump

00:10:42.529 --> 00:10:45.649
ball and then you're waiting for their

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:50.990
other sneaker to hit the ground to know

00:10:45.649 --> 00:10:53.029
you're safe now I'm waiting for the

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:56.660
challenge to screw me because I'm coming

00:10:53.029 --> 00:10:57.980
fresh off the speed challenge we're not

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:01.250
going to open that yet we don't have the

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:02.779
money to buy much anyway but you know

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:04.730
it's like if your midterm was really

00:11:02.779 --> 00:11:06.560
hard and then the final exam seems too

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:08.690
easy something just isn't quite right

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:12.579
like I find myself unsettled right now

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:16.360
waiting for the I'm waiting for my man

00:11:12.579 --> 00:11:16.360
$26 in my hand

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:27.870
which in 1964 was actually like a lot

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.260
but anyway thank you seven doesn't

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.250
matter

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:33.690
grab this invincibility is important

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:39.840
normally you'd probably be a cricket's

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:41.700
head boy here Craig its body I mean this

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.260
isn't a normal situation but we're going

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.090
to go for it anyway because the rest of

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.650
the items suck we don't want the clicker

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.180
even though it could transform us into

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:49.350
not blue baby that's not worth that much

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.750
right now

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:53.910
we don't want mom's bra because it's

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:55.620
going to replace kamikaze backstab just

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.910
sucks especially if we can shoot we

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:59.220
might as well go over something that you

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:00.720
know lowers our tear cap even if it's

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:05.910
not going to be that useful for us to

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:10.040
lower our tear cap and then we're just

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:13.740
going to stack these up let's try this

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:15.300
that was well worth it grab this and get

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.610
the heck out of here sure I'll tell you

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:21.450
what maybe like because the case to be

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:24.030
made for kamikaze kamikaze car battery I

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:25.680
mean but I think we're good I think we

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:30.180
got we got very little to complain about

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:31.800
right now again our tiers upgrade

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:34.050
doesn't really affect things too much in

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:37.500
the positive direction for us but all

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:40.860
the other items were just kind of maybe

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:42.960
quite literally useless so now like dude

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:47.580
I've got to be honest with you I'm like

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:50.250
an old dog in these Isak episodes you

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:52.790
pretty much could not pay me enough to

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:55.770
do these rooms there's just no point

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:57.980
save your frustration for the speed

00:12:55.770 --> 00:13:00.450
challenge put your sorries in a sack

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:02.280
we'll get through blue bomber easily

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:04.010
we'll we'll get challenge three up and

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:06.690
running over the course of this episode

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:09.180
and we got a lot less to worry about in

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:13.320
that regard like why would I waste my

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:14.970
time fighting all these enemies that you

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:20.190
know they have the audacity to try to

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:24.930
dodge a god like me instead as long as

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:26.990
we're paying attention we can finish

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:29.310
this off pretty quickly no tinted rocks

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:30.750
and you know the challenges are all

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:32.880
about using the advantages that have

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:35.600
been given to you this is an advantage

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.600
that's been given

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.790
roll with it

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:44.100
enjoy it because you may never see it

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:45.420
again I can't believe meanwhile of

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:50.610
course I was actually fighting that

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:54.920
enemy for no reason just work your way

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:56.700
over to the exit don't thank you

00:13:54.920 --> 00:14:05.420
probably could have killed him in like

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:08.970
two hits but so be it and we've done it

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:11.640
got mom's heart I'm not going to fight

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:14.870
hush because that sounds like probably

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:17.220
we will die and I will hate myself for

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:19.080
needlessly creating that situation was

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:21.450
it pestilence creating the creeper is it

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.700
like when I use kamikaze it somehow

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:27.750
creates creep as well I don't think

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:31.740
that's the case I'm very glad I have the

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:34.680
harbingers right now doing a great job

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:37.350
of not forcing me to get right next to

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:39.720
the boss I feel that the devil is going

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:41.730
to be pretty special with a luck stat of

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:45.750
zero you can't convince me to roll gimpy

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:48.330
here instead all right it's not the

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:55.130
cathedral it's Sheol I even said Sheol

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:57.600
like ten times okay start by going up

00:14:55.130 --> 00:15:00.060
against basic enemies we might as well

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:03.060
clear the room like these guys are

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:06.330
pretty easy there might be like the only

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:07.740
enemy in the game that's easier to kill

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:09.450
by getting right up in their face with

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:11.040
the bomb well that's just clearly false

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:15.210
but on the other hand what I was trying

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:18.450
to suggest was like oh okay don't don't

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:20.670
throw it don't throw it all I'm trying

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:23.490
to suggest is that sometimes you fight

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:25.350
those guys and they are real jerks

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:27.420
because they just move away from your

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:29.280
shots

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:31.170
there's a genuine chance we'll die here

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:33.420
but I'm we're going to try to avoid it

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:39.750
as you might expect and the easiest way

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:42.210
to avoid it is straight up if you think

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:46.350
you're going to get hit no that won't

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:48.030
know why I always think like I gotta

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:50.130
I've got the perfect play if I'm about

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:59.100
to take damage I'll just use kamikaze it

00:15:50.130 --> 00:16:06.590
does not work like that our damage stat

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:10.770
is pretty great so the flies from like

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:12.870
from conquest here are excellent we're

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:14.670
about to win all right I mean that was

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:16.140
pretty easy it took us like 15 minutes

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:17.250
I'm glad we're done with it though

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.740
because it was starting to get to the

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:22.260
point where I was scared and golden

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:25.340
bombs are well worth the time investment

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:28.170
they're good okay hopefully one we can a

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:30.360
little bit more of a commentary focus

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:32.970
pay to play I think is a every door cost

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:34.560
you a penny and you get money equals

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:38.730
power so every room we actually get a

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:40.500
little weaker on this run which is the

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:42.600
opposite of how things normally go we

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.220
start with Oh sack of pennies as well

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:48.120
okay so we start with sack of pennies

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:50.670
and money equals power on suits on a

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:54.540
later floor strikes me as like

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:55.590
potentially a 10 out of 10 so we're just

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.790
going to make sure we're going in the

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:58.920
right direction I don't really want to

00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:01.890
spend money on the shop I guess we

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:04.890
should check just for the idea that on

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:07.079
me two of diamonds two hours a two of

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:12.089
diamonds would have been like an 11 out

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:14.370
of 10 but we still got some decent work

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:16.140
done here going through secret rooms

00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:18.420
doesn't cost us money and actually in

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:20.790
this case gave us quite a lot so no

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:22.230
complaints I do wonder what happened if

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:27.089
you just run out of money I guess you

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:30.060
just sit on a room forever we're looking

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:33.050
for piggy bank and we're really anything

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:35.220
that gives us money when we get hit

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:38.340
eliminates the central concern of this

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:40.060
run and then hopefully also helps us

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:44.290
into a situation in which week

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:46.120
and continue to keep as much money as

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:49.570
possible not just to open doors but so

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:50.740
that we can actually like keep money

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:53.020
equals power functioning because

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:55.290
starting 26.4 damages is a really

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:57.580
luxurious position to be in

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:59.770
it's like being born to like the

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:01.450
Vanderbilt family or something you know

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:04.030
you got to you got to work pretty hard

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:05.320
to get infected by that affluenza to the

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:08.050
point where it actually affects you

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:09.940
imagine boy seems totally fine here a

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:12.400
luck upgrade would be a little bit more

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:14.560
enduring but still a little bit of money

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:19.600
that at least pays for us to go to the

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:26.350
next floor still not the right time for

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:30.310
answers kind of hoping we do come across

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:33.330
a an arcade with the blood bank small

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:36.520
rock please that's still good still good

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:39.460
a small rock with the sorry a blood bank

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:41.380
would be a good opportunity for us to

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:48.370
get a speed upgrade a health upgrade and

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:51.190
keep our money functioning Converter is

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:53.230
not worth it is the spirit hard worth it

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:55.570
potentially but I don't really want to

00:18:53.230 --> 00:19:01.330
spend if we don't have to go secret room

00:18:55.570 --> 00:19:03.610
hopefully and no bombs but enough money

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:04.600
you're not going to explode right you

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:05.680
kind of look like you're going to

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:11.770
explode but I don't think you're going

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:14.260
to explode and there's no item rooms on

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:15.850
this one oh there is hopefully a blood

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:18.630
bank I'm spending a penny to get into an

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:22.660
arcade at the best the best of time so

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:24.280
no blood bank huh I shouldn't complain

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:27.490
about getting three cents from a room

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:29.230
but that room it could have been so much

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:35.410
more it could have been like clay Aikens

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:39.750
lead single coming hot off of his second

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:39.750
place finish on American Idol season two

00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:47.389
coming hot off of clay Aikens finish as

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:51.840
congressman-elect for the second

00:19:49.739 --> 00:19:53.639
district of South Carolina he is the

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.289
congressman now is he a congressman for

00:19:53.639 --> 00:20:00.659
the second District of South Carolina

00:19:55.289 --> 00:20:03.539
I do not know who would have thought you

00:20:00.659 --> 00:20:06.659
know I'm going to go lose American Idol

00:20:03.539 --> 00:20:09.149
to kick-start my political career what a

00:20:06.659 --> 00:20:11.220
world were living in I mean this was a

00:20:09.149 --> 00:20:16.849
little while ago I'm dating myself a

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:19.169
little bit I wish now you should be done

00:20:16.849 --> 00:20:22.019
you guys can just keep walking into the

00:20:19.169 --> 00:20:23.249
fire for all I care and give me a great

00:20:22.019 --> 00:20:25.169
deal with the devil that gives me an

00:20:23.249 --> 00:20:32.330
easy win and I'll pay you Tuesday for a

00:20:25.169 --> 00:20:32.330
hamburger today I will come on come on

00:20:34.099 --> 00:20:39.059
we got a deal with the devil we have to

00:20:36.389 --> 00:20:41.340
pay to go to it I'm sorry I thought this

00:20:39.059 --> 00:20:43.619
was America we got the mark though which

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.879
is exquisite damage is going up there

00:20:43.619 --> 00:20:46.349
hopefully that will compensate for any

00:20:44.879 --> 00:20:49.849
like damage downgrades you might get

00:20:46.349 --> 00:20:49.849
from not getting money in the future

00:20:49.879 --> 00:20:55.950
and we'll move along here so follow dude

00:20:54.479 --> 00:20:58.070
it's actually been so long since we had

00:20:55.950 --> 00:21:03.570
piercing shot now we're probably

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:04.859
interested in the future to use this on

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.799
Sue's room pretty quickly because what

00:21:04.859 --> 00:21:09.989
if we get a better room for the future

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:11.460
the only thing I will say is that what's

00:21:09.989 --> 00:21:12.539
the point of using the on soos room

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.629
right now these floors are still

00:21:12.539 --> 00:21:17.009
relatively small this was the greatest

00:21:14.629 --> 00:21:18.690
curse room I've ever seen in my adult

00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:20.249
life what about that curse room that

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:25.440
gave you a three guppy items are gonna

00:21:20.249 --> 00:21:27.359
ask no curse room whoo that was the 10

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:29.190
and a 10 right there we needed that and

00:21:27.359 --> 00:21:33.359
we received it luck luck luck no luck

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:36.769
but 59 cents so I think this challenge

00:21:33.359 --> 00:21:41.609
run is really oh we got the dream item

00:21:36.769 --> 00:21:43.200
small rock or lucky Rock this run is

00:21:41.609 --> 00:21:45.370
about two things one is divorcing

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:47.380
yourself from the chance of

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:49.570
running out of money so you can't open

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:51.010
rooms and then not being as beholden to

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:52.150
the amount of money that you do have I

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:54.640
don't think we're going to get it into

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:59.470
bombs but we're definitely going to get

00:21:54.640 --> 00:22:00.820
it into moms the the other thing is just

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:05.050
making a run that's strong enough to

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:06.910
beat the you know the length of the run

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:08.050
without having to rely on the damage for

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:09.970
money equals power and we've got a

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:12.400
pretty good job of both right now I mean

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:15.400
our trinket means that every bomb we get

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:17.620
is going to give us I mean even this one

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.850
it cost us five cents sure but if we put

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.740
it in the right spot it should give us

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:22.120
more than five cents back we could even

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:24.730
go back to the room on which we got it

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:26.920
and probably it'll work out for us here

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:31.600
but I'm going to try to continue to move

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:33.430
forwards so all of this combined means

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.950
we're in a really really good spot right

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:37.540
now I would still love to trade away

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:40.180
more of our red hearts because I'm

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:42.010
sadistic but I also have you know high

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:46.570
hopes for our chances here see this is a

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:51.670
great spot to use our bomb put it here

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:53.170
we're going to get like seven tents we

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:54.970
got eight and then we got the chance

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:57.430
which gave us another one no bombs back

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:59.340
but again you know you're you're smart

00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:02.040
people you can look at that trade and

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:04.480
realize that that turned out to be good

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:06.430
mind you I'm kind of asking you to pat

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.780
me on the back for buying a single bomb

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:10.060
at a shop when we have like the best

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:12.760
bomb related trinkets so don't don't

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:15.820
fall victim to my game here it's another

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:16.660
good one right here I'll use a key it's

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.110
not like we're using it for anything

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:19.480
else

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:23.610
that hurts but you also gave me three

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:26.770
cents back so I I lose for that one but

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:28.000
not buy as much as you would think you

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:31.240
can't fire me I quit

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.310
exactly I always wondered what that is

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:36.850
supposed to mean

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:39.520
like you can't fire me I quit it's

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:40.840
obvious I'm not having a revelation here

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.900
but either way you're going to lose your

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:45.970
job but if there's some kind of like I

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:47.560
would rather be fired is what I guess

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:48.640
what I'm trying to say not because I

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:51.090
don't want to be seen as a quitter but

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:53.500
if you're like hey I'm firing you

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:57.160
there's always the chance I could spin

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:58.570
that into some sort of lawsuit I live in

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:02.019
North America after all

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:07.679
naturally to me 5050 oh they still won't

00:24:02.019 --> 00:24:10.330
let us in if I quit I feel like I'm

00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:13.240
giving up the right to eventually have

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:15.429
you give me something to sue you for if

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:19.840
anything if they go you're fired what

00:24:15.429 --> 00:24:22.149
you should do is like trip over a wet

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:23.830
floor sign and then like dip your hands

00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:25.059
in a pot of boiling oil or something

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:26.860
like that on the way down and then

00:24:25.059 --> 00:24:28.179
you'll be like you can't fire me or I'll

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:30.669
sue you for everything you've got that's

00:24:28.179 --> 00:24:32.159
my secret defraud the justice system

00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:35.919
look I didn't say it in such

00:24:32.159 --> 00:24:37.870
black-and-white legal terms that's

00:24:35.919 --> 00:24:40.629
that's that's you making that assumption

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:47.830
well this removes all the temptation to

00:24:40.629 --> 00:24:50.200
use use the on sue serene on this floor

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:51.970
and the more the merrier the longer that

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:54.549
on Sue's ruined last probably the better

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:57.159
it is for me unless we get to the floor

00:24:54.549 --> 00:25:02.049
we want to use it on and then it has

00:24:57.159 --> 00:25:05.590
curse with a loss to begin with why are

00:25:02.049 --> 00:25:08.649
we getting money when we get hit is that

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:12.059
just how this run works and I haven't

00:25:08.649 --> 00:25:15.000
paid attention it's like

00:25:12.059 --> 00:25:16.710
certainly

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.600
piggy bank does that but we don't have

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:22.010
piggy bank there's trinkets that do that

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:25.830
but we didn't swallow like swallow penny

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:29.610
that was pretty dumb didn't we now I

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:34.620
would remember I think something that

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:37.170
that important happening maybe it's just

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:42.410
like hard-coded into the run as a way to

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:46.590
get more money fairly easily grab this

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:48.090
grab this grab this should go to the

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:50.250
second secret room you never know this

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:51.960
is where we use our bombs you never know

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:52.980
what you're going to get there and

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:59.850
you'll never shine if you don't glow

00:25:52.980 --> 00:26:07.170
very good no boss

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:08.700
I think we're probably at the point oh

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:10.410
well we're gonna leave this floor as

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:11.970
quickly as we can but we're probably at

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:13.950
the point where we're like I can

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:15.240
actually buy things from the shop and

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:18.360
they don't have to be things that just

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:19.590
give me more money so if you reach that

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.990
point on this run I think you're pretty

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:24.030
much good to go what's the challenge

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:25.350
where you actually like lose HP every

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:27.990
time you go through the door that's the

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:29.480
one that scares me more or Babylon I

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:32.460
think it's a big positive because I am

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:34.980
interested in giving up all my red

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:37.500
hearts if possible so I'm going to pop

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:40.650
on Zeus here I have a very simple reason

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:42.630
for doing so I think that I might be

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:46.350
able to find a chance to teleport out of

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:49.110
boss rush so let's use on suits on a

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:53.700
floor where we're not going to waste it

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:57.950
now this is not a necessary room paper

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.950
itself but no need

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:03.380
8.6 - damage is pretty good I think if

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:06.289
we could just get permanent or Babylon

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:08.570
state we can like we're absolved from

00:27:06.289 --> 00:27:15.020
all of our damage related not even like

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:17.360
concerns but like mild anxieties and a

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:21.470
check and I think that that's actually

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:24.830
of worthy purchase but I am a little

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:27.080
disappointed no no no no no no oh we can

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:29.360
old - yes yes yes yes yes

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.799
I think the sun card is the worthy

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.270
purchase it's not what I was looking for

00:27:30.799 --> 00:27:34.760
I was hoping to get a way to get out of

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:36.710
boss rush but maybe this is you know

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:43.809
it's got a plan for all of us

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:47.539
Edmunds got a plan for all of us trust

00:27:43.809 --> 00:27:49.429
in the many-sided god that's right - v6

00:27:47.539 --> 00:27:52.159
we can't get to that

00:27:49.429 --> 00:27:53.600
so our but I thought we were one floor

00:27:52.159 --> 00:27:55.130
deeper than we were even better that

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.600
means we get we use Don's who said

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:58.190
exactly the right time in spite of

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.990
having like terrible methodology for

00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:02.419
which we are doing so little Gish is

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:03.970
like inconsequential but I'll take any

00:28:02.419 --> 00:28:07.100
3% chance

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:14.500
3% any 33% chance at a deal with the

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:20.630
devil give me nine lives

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:24.169
guppies head Guppies tail that's the

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:25.669
dream combination we can take all three

00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:27.080
without dying once we'll be on all

00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:30.049
spirit hearts activate Whore of Babylon

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:32.120
and stop this challenge to make up for

00:28:30.049 --> 00:28:34.610
the damage psychologically that was done

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:37.460
to me via the Speed Challenge okay no

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:38.450
deal with the devil that's good that

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:40.190
just means we're just gonna have twice

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:43.720
as good of a deal on this floor it's

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:43.720
science don't try to disprove it

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:51.770
science can never be disproven that's

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:55.910
the spirit of it actually and now I know

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:58.820
okay I'll have you know I possess an

00:28:55.910 --> 00:29:01.299
undergraduate degree in biology it

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:05.090
qualifies me for many things including

00:29:01.299 --> 00:29:11.780
working as a lab technician we're also

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:14.990
getting a master's in biology which

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:18.230
would qualify me to TA your freshman

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:24.500
biology 101 class or get a PhD in

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:29.210
biology which would okay I'm done

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:32.110
talking smack about academia I like

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:35.840
academia it's a fun word to say

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:39.559
so Horeb Avalon is finally active dude

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:43.820
IV bag is actually perfect it's a great

00:29:39.559 --> 00:29:45.260
choice for us on this run get that

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:47.150
damage up there via money equals power

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:50.150
and what do we have right now 10.25

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:54.470
damage could use a rate of fire increase

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:56.150
and also some means to replenish our red

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:58.429
hearts on the regular would be good but

00:29:56.150 --> 00:30:00.530
I've got the utmost faith in this run

00:29:58.429 --> 00:30:03.559
right now hey I might even do boss rush

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:05.120
for the fun of it probably not but I

00:30:03.559 --> 00:30:10.250
could see a world in which that wouldn't

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:12.650
be a too outrageous so we are in a

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:14.870
slightly weird spot in that I always

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:19.190
want to keep Whore of Babylon active but

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:21.740
I don't want to be so overly aggressive

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:23.270
with I yeah like for example that was

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.950
dumb I don't want to be so overly

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:27.409
aggressive with IV bag that I put myself

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:29.240
in a bad spot for survivals sake which

00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:31.909
is actually pretty much where we exist

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:34.669
right now so I think we're just going to

00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:37.580
take this opportunity to hopefully stat

00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:41.929
up a little bit get some HP back Steven

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:44.450
is a great damage upgrade only 0.68 here

00:30:41.929 --> 00:30:46.539
for some reason maybe because it's a

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:49.840
multiplayer why call it that a

00:30:46.539 --> 00:30:49.840
multiplier and

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:56.029
money equals power is also a multiplier

00:30:53.399 --> 00:31:02.130
why do you say it like that a multiplier

00:30:56.029 --> 00:31:05.340
when you hearts do thank you when you

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:09.120
use it it's a for every every penny you

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:10.980
get multiplies a number by one point

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.990
zero for something way no no no you've

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:15.059
got this completely backwards look just

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:21.570
don't try to work your brain too hard

00:31:15.059 --> 00:31:23.370
right now apparently it's broken we're

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:26.549
going to lose her Babylon but it's not

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:28.049
that much damage in fact it was a little

00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:30.059
silly of me to suggest that that was

00:31:28.049 --> 00:31:32.759
even relevant to be honest with you

00:31:30.059 --> 00:31:33.990
because we still have after getting

00:31:32.759 --> 00:31:36.750
Steven at least you still have 10 point

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:39.149
whatever damage basically we have Whore

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:40.500
of Babylon stats prior to getting Steven

00:31:39.149 --> 00:31:45.360
but we have the benefit of having some

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:47.100
extra HP along with it so we should not

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:49.139
find ourselves in too difficult of a

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:50.700
spot right now does that mean we won't

00:31:49.139 --> 00:31:55.200
find ourselves in too difficult of a

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:58.830
spot sadly no but this run is quite good

00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:01.919
all we need really at this point is is

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:05.250
patience and and to play pretty well or

00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:06.629
at least like at average level but

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:08.399
something that would really really help

00:32:06.629 --> 00:32:10.230
me out would be a single tears upgrade I

00:32:08.399 --> 00:32:11.940
mean would it kill you you've done grave

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:13.769
stuff for us in a damaged apartment and

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:15.240
I'll never take that away from you but I

00:32:13.769 --> 00:32:16.740
would love to be able to put out the

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:20.070
amount of damage that we're putting out

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:22.049
but at a faster pace I mean I recognize

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:23.460
you you can't always get what you want

00:32:22.049 --> 00:32:25.200
and you know beggars can't be choosers

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:27.029
and you know what have you done for me

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.340
lately and other such pithy expressions

00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:32.279
yet at the same time I would very much

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:35.399
enjoy having the ability to shoot faster

00:32:32.279 --> 00:32:36.960
than we did six floors ago you know it's

00:32:35.399 --> 00:32:39.720
like I've gotten four promotions but I'm

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:42.120
still driving in 1998 Toyota Celica sure

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:44.129
it's a reliable automobile but at least

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:47.570
let me upgrade to the Corolla they don't

00:32:44.129 --> 00:32:47.570
even make the Celica anymore

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:55.150
the other thing is by using IV bag we

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:57.460
are getting luck upgrades so I'm very

00:32:55.150 --> 00:33:00.299
much for that should we activate Whore

00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:06.150
of Babylon permanently I'm going to say

00:33:00.299 --> 00:33:08.919
yes what's the reason for that I'm

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:11.710
stupid sometimes is the reason for that

00:33:08.919 --> 00:33:17.710
none of this is really worth it without

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:20.590
an ability to get out so we're going to

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:22.210
bounce I think we should still be fine

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:24.850
I'm getting weird deja vu for some

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:28.830
reason like this run feels very similar

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:31.450
to a run that I had in after birth plus

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:34.059
you're gonna think that I'm mistreating

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:36.720
this cat he's just a me our okay he

00:33:34.059 --> 00:33:36.720
loves to meow

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:49.380
stay cool here I can't let him into the

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.150
room because let me here's the cycle of

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:52.740
letting this cat into your room he comes

00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:54.900
in and he's all cute and he's like I'm

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:56.700
just gonna sleep here and then he gets

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:58.050
like rattled by something and then he

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.940
goes and tries to jump behind the

00:33:58.050 --> 00:34:01.470
computer no matter how many times that

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:03.240
try to classically condition this cat

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:05.880
not to jump behind the computer it's

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:07.890
like a perfect Ruka size and the perfect

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:09.540
Ruka temperature so he's like you don't

00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:11.340
understand why are you trying to keep me

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:12.750
from my home this is where I want to

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.920
live and I say you can't live there's

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:17.040
electricity there there's ventilation

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:19.110
you know you're causing problems this is

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:21.300
my office he goes you don't understand

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:24.000
this is my this is my house I live here

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:27.420
it's not your house it's not even my

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.860
house we pay rent here it's an

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:31.020
investment property but someone I've

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:32.370
never met okay we don't I don't care

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:35.070
about that part right there there is a

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:38.450
spirit heart in here somewhere it is

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:45.500
locked betwixt a cluster of rocks

00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:45.500
we have no bombs no bombs

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:54.290
judgment judgment day that was garbage

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:57.740
day but for some reason I made it about

00:34:54.290 --> 00:35:00.850
Terminator 2 and that's okay we're

00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:06.320
getting money back a judgement card is a

00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:10.520
great thing if we're not at all worried

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:12.590
about our money situation which i think

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:15.800
is a fair description but it would also

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:20.240
give us HP in all likelihood and we

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:25.430
don't really want HP right now because

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:29.000
it would ruin for a babylon and also

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:32.810
whole i hate you also permanent polaroid

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.160
invincibility so if i get hit by the

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:35.870
spikes again we're going to be in a

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:39.550
tough spot because i think we'll be at

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:41.900
half of a heart at that point but it's i

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:44.540
actually i love the design of Mama

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:48.230
Gertie I think the attacks are kind of

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:50.300
nonsense because if you can't if you can

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:51.860
fly the spikes are meaningless if you

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:53.480
can't fly it's nearly impossible to

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:55.640
dodge them is thanks for the damage

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.720
upgrade I greatly appreciate it head

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.130
down to the next floor where we have a

00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:00.290
little bit more awareness of what our HP

00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:02.450
looks like hopefully there we are one

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:04.280
and a half I think we go for it maybe

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:08.060
maybe the HP is important enough to

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:11.740
justify it we're playing it very close

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:11.740
to both both of these challenges so far

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:15.980
credit card very good on a floor in

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:17.930
which we have a seventy two point five

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:20.900
percent chance of a deal with the devil

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:23.870
and we will either have that 72% chance

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:25.400
or we'll die so I think we're we're

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:27.530
going to hope that we have that 72%

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.850
chance and I will take that Rouen whore

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:32.840
Babylon and permanent polar

00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:35.990
invincibility for a chance to have a

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:37.760
little bit more survival here this cat

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:41.150
is like throwing himself against the

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:43.490
door I can't let you in right now

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:46.790
because you go behind the computer I

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:48.950
understand you like there's a got a

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:52.220
brain the size of like an acorn and I

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:54.859
don't say that to be dismissive you know

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:57.890
you don't possess the the capabilities

00:36:54.859 --> 00:37:01.010
of concrete reasoning to the same extent

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:02.930
as human beings and being said if you

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:05.450
stop going by in the computer I can let

00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:07.060
you into the office I help I'll even let

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:10.250
you into the office after this episode

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:12.470
even though I probably shouldn't and

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:13.400
I'll go Ruka don't get behind the

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:17.840
computer going to get behind the

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:20.210
computer I know you you're my son you

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:21.680
got to demonstrate your ability to not

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:23.800
get behind the computer and then I'll

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:30.320
you know Bob's your uncle

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:36.170
okay use a bomb here nokton use a bomb

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:37.790
here something not greed well we could

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:40.070
use the money yeah well you got another

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:41.510
tricky mom's heart fight here this time

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:43.250
we're going to the cathedral afterwards

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:47.090
let's just hope that there is an

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:49.490
afterwards almost like in terms of the

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:51.770
conditions for the fight almost a carbon

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:56.450
copy like we get we have the ability to

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:58.790
get hit once and once alone we do have a

00:37:56.450 --> 00:38:01.160
ranged attack this time which gives us

00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:03.859
like a pretty huge advantage compared to

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:05.900
where we were last time great shots by

00:38:03.859 --> 00:38:07.940
the way like mom's heart did some of my

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:09.140
work for me there but I'm still pretty

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:11.240
pleased with the way that went down

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:13.190
little Gish is doing work as well I

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:16.580
haven't really given little Gish the

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:17.810
credit of deserves so far how we didn't

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:22.760
get hit there trust me

00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:24.170
I'm with you I thought we were dusted so

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:26.750
I think we probably have like about a

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:30.520
60% chance to win I think we probably

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:30.520
have about a 40% chance to win

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:34.240
regardless

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:42.550
if we get a good deal with the devil

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:43.900
let's crank that up this is not a good

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:48.130
deal with the devil right now but well

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:50.560
it's not bad it's not what we're looking

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:52.540
for so we'll do this we're definitely

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:53.140
not going to fight hush I'll tell you

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:57.190
that much

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:58.750
we definitely should have and oh it's

00:38:57.190 --> 00:39:00.640
gone I was going to say we definitely

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:02.770
should have shot the fires to make spear

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:07.869
at odds but we didn't so this is really

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:14.880
now a race against time not really worth

00:39:07.869 --> 00:39:17.770
it probably not not a game saver I

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:19.030
almost in my head I almost wanted to

00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:19.660
give up there I was like oh this room's

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:21.730
too tough

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:26.950
these enemies they fire too quickly I'm

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:28.810
glad we didn't I filled myself some

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:35.470
mental fortitude that guy could have hit

00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:37.450
me easily we can beat this floor without

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:38.980
taking damage I would prefer to get a

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:45.990
spirit heart but we can beat this floor

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:45.990
without taking damage this is our moment

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:51.280
that's it that's probably the wind right

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:53.550
there now I'm not going to say that we

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:55.600
deserve a lot of credit for it because

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:57.670
we did kind of put ourselves in this

00:39:55.600 --> 00:40:01.900
position in the first place but still

00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:03.130
that was a huge moment for us to pull it

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:05.140
all together there we still only have

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:06.670
one end well we have two hits now that

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:09.820
we can say well no we can literally take

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:15.700
one hit and live so we got a long way to

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:17.380
go in terms of like feeling safe but so

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:19.450
we're looking for secret rooms that gave

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:21.040
us curse room access we're looking for

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:24.400
low-percentage spirit arts and we got

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:26.680
one which is quite generous honestly and

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:28.570
then apart from this we're just staying

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:32.230
as far away from any enemies as we can

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:35.830
and letting flies and also our fairly

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:38.440
excellent damage carry us here and we're

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:40.620
hoping to avoid as many BS attacks as is

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:43.710
possible

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:46.600
whenever applicable which is not always

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:47.650
the easiest thing in the world I think

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:50.770
we're going to pull it together again

00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:53.170
not really a tough challenge but we made

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:56.920
it tough by way of our way of our

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:58.630
actions we lost one we can still get hit

00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:02.410
once without dying these guys are a

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:05.830
little tricky well you made me look like

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:07.690
a fool they're ok we can't get hit at

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:10.990
all but at least we lived long enough to

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:15.900
get to this point this would be a nice

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:19.990
heart I don't know if that protects us

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:21.070
so phase 1 is what it is phase 2 is the

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:24.600
one where you want to watch out if we

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:24.600
can get to phase 3 I like our odds

00:41:33.059 --> 00:41:39.369
remember there's like a little bit of

00:41:34.959 --> 00:41:41.619
curve on these and the slow is almost

00:41:39.369 --> 00:41:43.119
like it's a double-edged sword

00:41:41.619 --> 00:41:48.130
sometimes it's good sometimes it's bad

00:41:43.119 --> 00:41:51.390
right now the cricket body shots are the

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:51.390
worst ones though whoo

00:41:51.869 --> 00:41:57.249
little touchy

00:41:53.589 --> 00:42:00.900
oh we are now on half a heart Thank You

00:41:57.249 --> 00:42:04.630
eternal heart for giving us a chance

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:06.279
and thank you us for looking for that

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:08.349
it's our life don't let them spot any

00:42:06.279 --> 00:42:11.009
more Angel fetuses dude no okay I almost

00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:11.009
walked right into it

00:42:11.099 --> 00:42:21.009
wrong corner

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:24.130
now we might / should be okay I think

00:42:21.009 --> 00:42:26.410
it's BS that he gets to attack that's 1

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:31.329
million percent because our rate of fire

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:32.829
sucks if our rate of fire is any better

00:42:31.329 --> 00:42:34.690
this dude is not going to have any

00:42:32.829 --> 00:42:36.579
chance to do the second wave of attacks

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:37.959
and the second wave of attacks is the

00:42:36.579 --> 00:42:41.609
only thing that gives him like any

00:42:37.959 --> 00:42:44.979
chance of hitting be honest with you

00:42:41.609 --> 00:42:48.359
because this pattern is like we got this

00:42:44.979 --> 00:42:48.359
sorted 10 out of 10 right now

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:04.540
okay also turned out to be very tricky

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:06.849
but there you go thanks for watching two

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:07.930
