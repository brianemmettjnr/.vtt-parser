##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.049
everybody welcome a clan please binding

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.750
of issac a pulse we're into it daily

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.460
today I know isn't that weird I've been

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.870
absent from dailies for a while now just

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.670
figuring out what we're gonna do to

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.799
Isaac I figure when I feel like playing

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.049
a daily let's just s'matter it in there

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.900
as always some people say no daily some

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.279
people say all dailies and a very very

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.990
large majority of people are somewhere

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.500
in between that are like I just I like

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.439
it all

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.760
me too today's daily is Isaac it goes

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.320
all the way to the end so it seems like

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.070
we picked a good one no seems to look

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.160
for 51,000 is 67,000 on the top and

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.739
they're just an XL it's not an XL it's a

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.090
burning basement so I am I'm eager to

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.100
see how this goes but yeah we're still

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.789
figuring out how we're going to approach

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.160
the I mean inevitability of one Isaac a

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.879
day I think oh that's that explains the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.070
scores that we've got on today's run

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.750
please resist the notion I'm asking you

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.109
as a fellow human being resist the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.149
notion to be like oh no mom's knife Daly

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.579
it's the worst of all possible worlds

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.629
I'm going to endeavor to entertain you I

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.150
promise you that

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.540
I'm tain your latest dancer I'm here to

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.409
entertain you and then you say no tane I

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.000
can get into and scene yeah it says I

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.950
had no foreknowledge of this daily

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.680
honestly just got lucky that one of the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.659
best items that exists in Isaac at all

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.229
is right here definitely should not have

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:29.220
taken the coin purse that's on me burp

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:32.189
which gives us a verb to X X lacks pills

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.340
148 our energy okay so we convert a

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:40.110
48-hour energy is it worth it

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:44.280
should I burp it I analyze and then

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:49.259
choose to revert it is it worth it

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.689
should a verb fit I look at all evidence

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.850
and rework it it's like a you know I'm

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.770
just trying I'm doing my darndest here I

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.060
figure we should go for this here why

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.530
not maybe there'll be something there we

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.719
could always reroll it if there is there

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.710
is not so obviously we'll be moving on

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:07.229
could have found a second secret room

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.780
instead but coulda shoulda woulda dude

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.930
coulda shoulda and or woulda so we have

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.909
a verb and we have a

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.530
okay that's what we want so we can bring

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:16.730
a 48-hour energy down to the next floor

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.859
I do wish we had a better chance to

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.540
maybe find an arcade or something like

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:25.519
that but that's fine but also love to

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.049
get a spirit heart but you know with

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.370
mom's knife from our first item room you

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.859
should be in a very very good spot to

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.799
just roll nicely here Butterbean dude

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:36.349
you could not have constructed an easier

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.480
stitching situation that's what I say I

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.109
say sitchin an easier situation get away

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.180
from here don't really care about

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:46.489
doctors remotes as you might expect down

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.349
as a secret room though and we rear old

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.209
doctors remotely get leo which is

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.430
actually Taurus okay we got to think

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.290
about that I figured you know we

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.939
probably messed up we didn't use our

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.530
reroll where we were supposed to on the

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.269
last floor and where we were supposed to

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.219
in all likelihood dude thank you for the

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.919
half spirit heart where we were supposed

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:06.109
to in all likelihood was probably on

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:09.379
mom's coin purse so instead we mixed it

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:11.299
up and we tried to leverage that right

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:14.750
down here but we haven't gotten anything

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:19.879
that is better than Virgo I'd say might

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:22.340
as well go to the shop did see a good

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.409
see a spirit arc did see a nine-volt

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.949
would be interested in maybe keeping

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:28.849
those under the right circumstances but

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:30.049
certainly got a little bit of time

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.389
before we need to think about that is

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.970
this a new like room archetype I don't

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:38.810
think I've ever seen

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:40.549
dangerous Baum room before we should

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.810
actually take this just in case we get a

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.829
deal with the devil I mean just things

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.019
are going to start to move very very

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:48.340
fast in all likelihood we don't need

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.340
these they can only hurt us

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:59.310
what if they explode my barrel friends

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:05.790
they will leave me low on the

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:08.730
leaderboard in me and I think I'd rather

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.230
what was back here I can't remember I'm

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.420
happy with Guppies collar you know the

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.940
idea is that we could turn it into a

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.880
full copy we might not even benefit that

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.260
much from a full guppy but perhaps where

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.079
I'm likely to get another reroll anyway

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.300
so what do we have in here Taurus with

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.880
mom's knife is really good if we can get

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.470
a speed upgrade from some other avenue

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.130
of course at the present moment I don't

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:35.370
think that's too likely but we'll uh

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.419
we'll sort it out at some point all

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.180
right I think we're going to re-roll

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.919
Taurus the other option we take tours

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.630
and hope to reroll into a speed upgrade

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.180
but I think that's probably unlikely

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.340
this should take us into the mod or the

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.680
boss trap room took us into the second

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.970
secret room where we might get lucky you

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.010
were still way ahead of schedule and

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:57.270
let's be honest we're not competing with

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:59.880
these people on me 9 volt gives you a

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.860
guaranteed charge we might want to just

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.349
give this a shot here but we're not

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.000
competing with these people that are on

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:07.860
the top of the leaderboards on skill

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.270
alone we got to find some kind of you

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.430
know weird seam if we're going to make

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.250
this happen but let's go keep this we

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:17.820
got golden keys dude ruin bag might

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:22.080
actually be a rarity creating rune bag

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:24.139
out of this run did not seem like an

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.310
easy task so now we're looking for like

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:29.370
okay I would like to hit them for one

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.889
but now we're looking for a bloody not

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.849
bloody penny blank card and in a year a

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:39.599
rune would be killer for us so we want

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:44.970
to get second secret room I mean money

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:47.340
should be very easy to come by so I

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:50.010
think we start with that probably just

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.050
go straight down you might want to pick

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.260
up old bandage in this scenario weirdly

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.669
enough but let's start by reroll in this

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.380
became blood rights which is garbage but

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:01.240
you know taking more items out of the

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.380
pool I suppose so

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.080
considering that we're fairly unlikely

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.720
to get a reroll to begin with and were

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.610
destined genuinely Activision Bungie

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:15.220
destined to be so far ahead of schedule

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:16.419
here we might as well go back here and

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.430
give this a little bit more of a try

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.630
that's going to be ahead of schedule

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.960
let's spend some time is what I'm trying

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:25.410
to say here so go for broke here open

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.699
for an old bandage play did not get one

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.910
what do you got for me dude you got

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:33.789
something it's got a key

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:36.490
see you Luton I'm going to go a little

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:38.949
little deeper on this one got one cent

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.539
don't appreciate that and go a little

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:41.680
deeper

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:44.409
thanks old Vantage I really appreciate

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.060
it you're too good to me we don't have a

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:50.080
guaranteed respawn so we gotta you know

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:52.599
be afraid honestly take that

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.159
what's the you know our game plan here

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:55.360
actually though well I mean if this guy

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:56.800
doesn't pay out we got to blow up

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.470
something and play the other things so

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.880
and I blow up this and go for the HP

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.530
upgrade out of the judgment I suppose

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.370
and honestly it seems like it's going to

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.960
work out pretty well

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.400
wouldn't mind buying another spirit

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:11.320
heart from the shop to leave here as

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:12.909
well but oh dude I just looked at my

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.270
pants I got a freaking a hole in the

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:18.130
crotch looking like a fool of my pants

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:21.699
on the ground now I don't know I will

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:23.110
buy it just to be safe that's like the

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:24.490
worst feeling because now I got to think

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.110
oh my god how long have I been wearing

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:28.270
these pants without realizing there's a

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.130
hole in the crotch and nobody told me I

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.960
got to go through like my entire Mark

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.940
Zuckerberg social network and be like

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:37.590
nobody had the respect to tell me that

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:42.370
there was a hole in my jeans right there

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:44.219
I'm not trying to this is not meant to

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:46.840
be machismo or anything like that

00:07:44.219 --> 00:07:48.580
why do pants and I'm looking at you Tom

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.560
oh because you're looking at me why do

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.870
pants always tear the crotch I guess

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:57.699
it's a seam it's it's a natural part

00:07:52.870 --> 00:08:00.880
that was bad it's a natural tear point I

00:07:57.699 --> 00:08:03.969
suppose but why always on the crotch

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.409
dude why can't we make pants that don't

00:08:03.969 --> 00:08:07.419
have a seam at the crotch and instead

00:08:05.409 --> 00:08:09.400
they have a seam at like you know your

00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:11.199
guess there is kind of like a seam at

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.360
the knee but you get what I mean like

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:15.990
move the crotch seam to the knee make my

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.990
life easier

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:23.690
strikes me is a little too convenient

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:26.720
anyway I got to remember to throw these

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:28.220
out it's not like me being a snob like I

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.500
don't know how to stitch actually I'll

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:32.720
just I mean this is not me being sexist

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.760
either I'll just pass him to Kate Kate's

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:38.360
got the she's got the sewing skills

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:41.000
let's moon it up here we certainly can

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.560
open golden chests because we have a 2

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.750
is fades back there somewhere we don't

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.850
want to miss Vause rush we also like on

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:49.340
a daily don't hate me because I'm right

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.830
here on a daily you don't want to reroll

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.990
your mom's knife run really all we gain

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:57.890
out of that is sure I get like one Zane

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:59.900
point come on give me bad guys man we

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:02.930
get one Zane point and then we rank

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.310
poorly and I can't win for losing in

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.630
that situation I get these tweets you

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.130
know what happened on today's daily I

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:09.860
played it straight by the book and got a

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:12.650
million times more points than you lives

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:14.120
you know congratulations I'm playing a

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:16.370
different game here I got a different

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:19.720
set of standards I've got to think about

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:22.550
that like a speed upgrade is actually

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:27.790
potentially interesting but maybe not

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:27.790
quite interesting enough to settle for

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:34.040
maybe I don't know it's kind of cool

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:35.990
I'll take experiment II nothing wrong

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:39.500
with that we got to damage downgrade but

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:43.580
speed and tears up so honestly like I'll

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:47.300
live with it I'm not super pleased with

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:49.220
the the use of the two of spades ever

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.560
the idea is that I you know I hope we

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:54.920
get blank card Yara anyway and then we

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:56.360
just have control over unlimited

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.880
consumables to begin with so please

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:05.120
thank you grab this we're going for it

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:09.100
yeah smart plays big plays the Sun I

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.100
mean I do I do like it

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.940
actually completely fine by me it's not

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.080
like I was going to go for the double

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.670
reroll there you know again we've got

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.830
unlimited consumables here I'd have to

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:21.640
be some kind of silly dude to go for

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:22.780
that I think mmm

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.800
I don't know I'm happy with counterfeit

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:26.050
penny here we're really just like

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:28.450
keeping ourselves alive is a big one and

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:29.530
then embracing the rune meta but

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:30.880
although apparently it never gives me

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:34.000
two guys you know I'm not mad or

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.920
anything disappointed and I think we got

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.540
the tools to have a good run here

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:40.120
swallowed penny which is actually

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:42.160
counterfeit penny which is actually

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.410
crooked penny which is actually a mega

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.270
penny which is actually dad's lost coin

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.630
they all the same icon don't even start

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:52.530
with me

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:56.110
it's like halitosis moldy bread

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:58.960
halitosis moldy bread halitosis moldy

00:10:56.110 --> 00:11:04.450
bread halitosis thoses moldy bread in

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:06.070
them okay it sort of works from the Six

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:10.960
Flags commercial I can't it's been a

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:12.580
while we need to go over 2.5 damage at

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.060
some point in the future that would be

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:16.210
nice

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:19.360
oh the Gaza route thanks you too good to

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:22.030
me doesn't seem like we missed to too

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.650
much yeah we're going to go for broke

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:26.740
here we're still like ahead of schedule

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:29.290
again believe it or not so we want to

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:30.700
get probably everything here like I'm

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:32.020
willing to pay for everything here

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.580
that's no problem and all we maybe

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:35.760
should have tried to double that I'm

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:39.220
happy with where we're at okay so um

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:42.100
take it take it I think it's 48-hour

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:44.020
energy this let's go for a doubling

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:46.750
that's fine dude that's actually

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:48.760
completely fine he says well clenching

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:52.660
and unclenching his fist to get his

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:54.580
blood pressure down I got to be honest

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:55.900
it might surprise you think NL's kind of

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.420
a carefree guy except Murray plays

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:59.800
player unknowns battlegrounds I do at

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.000
least according to my doctor I've never

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.160
looked at the records myself but

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.310
according to my doctor I've got the

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:08.620
normal or the high side of normal blood

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:13.360
pressure and it's a scary thought you

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:15.490
know as a as a 28 year old it would be

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.900
like high blood pressure but my

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:20.440
characteristically happy-go-lucky

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:22.390
attitude I'm not sure probably lifestyle

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.930
factors do spend a lot of time sitting

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:27.370
down in a chair trying to work on that

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:28.750
hoping to work on that trying might be a

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:30.280
little bit of a stretch but I'm sure we

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.640
can all relate to that some things in

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.640
our lives

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:38.980
could be genetic I got no idea but you

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:44.320
know I got a I got to stop getting mad

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:47.410
at Isaac it's the thing I'm always like

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:50.290
just so furious this game isn't that

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:53.260
wasn't that perthro nominee Isaac as me

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:54.370
happy-go-lucky dude it's everything

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.650
outside it's all the deli counter

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:58.630
interactions like I'm I'm killing myself

00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:00.280
slowly by worrying about Emily

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:04.060
pastrami's people are ordering how many

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:04.630
post Ramos actually one slice is a post

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:09.490
Rama

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:12.640
multiple slices are pastrami I uh murd

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:15.640
in Milan once interned at a gelato shop

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:17.770
and that's just the way she goes nobody

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:21.970
you can use that voice and then put a

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:26.950
Canadian ism like a back home Canadian

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:30.820
ism in there so 2.5 damage mom's knife

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:32.020
is hilarious but also horrible but it's

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.880
all worth it if our experimental

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:36.250
treatment comes through into a spun

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.510
transformation eventually and again I

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:40.660
can't stress this enough we're going to

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:43.080
be ahead of schedule but you know this

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:45.700
is the blood pressure things like my

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:48.880
cautionary tale for you like I haven't

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:50.740
been the dust yet hopefully I got be

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.930
nice to have like another infinity years

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:55.390
left in me I was such a stupid bit of

00:13:52.930 --> 00:14:00.340
damage there but it worked out oh my god

00:13:55.390 --> 00:14:00.910
I think that was good for my blood

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.740
pressure

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:04.450
but here's it's a cautionary tale for

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:09.400
you you know even if you're on the young

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:11.320
side or you know get in there but oh I

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:15.160
didn't mean to buy it work that's fine

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:16.960
he's done it the free battery gives us

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.610
another sweet chance as well we don't

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.620
really care to get like another pH do

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:22.930
you set up out of this but we'll take

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:27.310
the battery and then like bomb our way

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:29.190
through here try to double it I mean why

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:31.420
not I don't really want starter deck

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:34.150
which is not starter deck but the other

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:35.140
one it has a moving box dude that was

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:37.089
not

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:40.779
sensible so you should have two

00:14:37.089 --> 00:14:42.910
judgments now we copied the judgment

00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:44.649
from earlier that's right okay so I

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:46.120
don't know give you some of this I can't

00:14:44.649 --> 00:14:48.610
spend forever in here but I can at least

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.769
give you a little little attempt all

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:53.820
dude it's fun okay so the spawn is going

00:14:50.769 --> 00:14:53.820
to be amazing for us

00:14:54.209 --> 00:14:59.500
speed up also good dry one hangry and

00:14:57.399 --> 00:15:06.490
what else was down here to hang commands

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:10.720
okay by the battery and just go for it

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:12.790
oh he's actually done it so we certainly

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:17.649
want two of Hearts that's still moving

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:22.170
box right that's not buddy in a box so

00:15:17.649 --> 00:15:26.470
just well done well done

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:28.899
something's wrong hangman hangman it's

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:30.209
still sort of working but we should

00:15:28.899 --> 00:15:38.079
speed up if possible

00:15:30.209 --> 00:15:39.880
dude I let me out dota 2 to the Pacific

00:15:38.079 --> 00:15:41.350
okay I mean there's a stopwatch I don't

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:44.140
see a battery charge in here so I'm just

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:45.730
going to dust it I do see a battery

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:47.110
charge but don't care all right we got

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:49.630
to go like this is getting a little

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:51.220
silly we've got a lot of great stuff out

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:53.350
of that shop I mean the doubling is just

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:56.920
never stopped but we still got to stay

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:59.740
on pace so we got magic mush and spun

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:01.480
our damage has actually gone up like six

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:05.620
points since the last time we had to do

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:07.420
any damage so I'm loving life we've got

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.550
to go back for that because that again a

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:11.589
year a rune with blank card is like my

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:13.089
dream even if swallowed penny which is

00:16:11.589 --> 00:16:18.519
actually crooked penny has done some

00:16:13.089 --> 00:16:23.800
amazing stuff for us so far I want black

00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:28.329
candle no more curses forever goggle

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:30.060
eyes sleep I'm like trying to swear

00:16:28.329 --> 00:16:35.910
without swearing Oh

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:35.910
Halla pineal chips that's okay Darcy

00:16:39.069 --> 00:16:43.249
you know we should have just taken it it

00:16:41.569 --> 00:16:45.649
would have got enough to zero luck but

00:16:43.249 --> 00:16:47.299
you gotta roll the dice sometimes you're

00:16:45.649 --> 00:16:49.699
going to Vegas on just here for those

00:16:47.299 --> 00:16:51.589
buffets nah we're rolling the dice like

00:16:49.699 --> 00:16:55.189
this is getting rolled no doubt the only

00:16:51.589 --> 00:16:59.359
time I would ever want bozo is if you're

00:16:55.189 --> 00:17:02.419
going to give me like eight of them yeah

00:16:59.359 --> 00:17:04.730
good get cranked on didn't even need to

00:17:02.419 --> 00:17:07.579
waste my time with riffraff like that I

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:09.919
wouldn't mind some HP upgrades straight

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:13.429
up though we're like we're going to the

00:17:09.919 --> 00:17:15.079
shop and by going to the shop I meant to

00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:16.819
say boss rush but I think my

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:18.019
subconscious actually hooked me up for

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:19.669
once instead of just making me look like

00:17:18.019 --> 00:17:22.120
a moron by saying the wrong thing now

00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:27.379
I'm like yeah we should go to the shop

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:29.139
I've got 31 cents in uh and a buttload

00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:31.129
of cutlery

00:17:29.139 --> 00:17:32.509
what is that supposed to mean it was

00:17:31.129 --> 00:17:33.590
meant to be a Hot Fuzz reference but

00:17:32.509 --> 00:17:35.870
it's been a long time since I've seen

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:38.179
the movie so I don't I don't remember

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:47.090
believe it's when he's fighting sandor

00:17:38.179 --> 00:17:52.750
clegane excuse me sir would like very

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:54.440
much to get a teleport card now wait

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:56.149
Blackhearts we don't care about a

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:59.779
teleport card take a key and call me in

00:17:56.149 --> 00:18:03.470
the morning let's freakin go blue map

00:17:59.779 --> 00:18:05.690
here a font let's go take your spear in

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:07.909
hard I tried to go for an extra doubling

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:10.789
just to be a chicken smarmy but it

00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:12.049
didn't work okay getting a little too

00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:13.669
Mimi you're getting a little too Mimi

00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:15.889
right off the cut we don't care about

00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:17.600
that we don't really care about that but

00:18:15.889 --> 00:18:18.710
we'll take it none the less so we're

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:22.009
trying to get out of this floor now

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:23.330
pretty quickly like we if steamrolled it

00:18:22.009 --> 00:18:24.950
we got nothing to worry about

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:26.419
you know what counterfeit pennies great

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:27.830
but we probably want a hairpin just so

00:18:26.419 --> 00:18:31.460
we can always have doublings at the

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:34.100
ready and we still do have a bead on a

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:38.360
gummi dream but the mark was well worth

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:40.909
taking a shot at here her throw was not

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:42.470
but we got to go a little bit faster we

00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:44.629
should be at like thirteen fourteen

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:46.490
thousand for the next floor leaves us

00:18:44.629 --> 00:18:48.110
completely in line with where we'd

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:48.970
normally expect to be for boss rush

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:51.820
would you know good

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:53.679
future potential hush again should be

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:56.110
basically automatic like at onceá

00:18:53.679 --> 00:18:58.960
I don't see a way that we don't make the

00:18:56.110 --> 00:19:02.020
hush fight work for us unless we don't

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.400
make it in time which is plausible but

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:05.289
unlikely we also have a deal with the

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:07.450
devil and well deal with the devil

00:19:05.289 --> 00:19:10.780
chance and straight-up Krampus should go

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:12.520
down in like half a second so if we have

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:14.789
to fight Krampus it's actually no

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.789
problem

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:19.090
all right good stuff good stuff

00:19:17.409 --> 00:19:22.419
I think we've we've struck a good

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:24.700
balance between like leveraging our

00:19:22.419 --> 00:19:26.169
advantages without costing ourselves too

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:30.250
too much here so we probably do want

00:19:26.169 --> 00:19:31.539
that let's freaking go those bad damage

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:32.110
but the pills have to be good so there

00:19:31.539 --> 00:19:36.850
we go

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:38.890
we don't need to use at all but Cracker

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:42.640
Jacks gives us a trinket gives us a

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:44.860
trinket non-stop reroll machines let's

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.270
get out of here okay we got two and a

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:48.370
half minutes to make it the boss rush

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:49.690
and I know that simultaneously this is

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:50.860
what some people love about dailies and

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:53.409
what some people don't like is if they

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:57.340
end up being focused on the commentary

00:19:53.409 --> 00:19:58.960
and oftentimes say me and not not zany

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:01.299
no more mechanically driven but that's

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.679
why I like them on occasion you know I

00:20:01.299 --> 00:20:05.770
think that that might be a happy medium

00:20:02.679 --> 00:20:07.150
is of course I could say like let's only

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:08.799
do them when we've been told that

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:13.210
they're good but I'd rather not leave

00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:16.179
myself you know at the will of the of

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:22.120
the dice rolls like that whoo peep this

00:20:16.179 --> 00:20:25.350
first I'd rather I'd rather go for you

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.350
know just when it feels right

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:33.830
seems more more sensible of an approach

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:36.280
to me but you know again I'm all ears

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:38.900
I'm eager to hear what people are saying

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:41.330
we got so much time now I was a little

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.680
probably overly cautious about getting

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:46.220
down here in time we shouldn't have too

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:48.980
much to worry about lots of pills of phd

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:51.890
pretty flies great drowsy useful later

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:53.720
but we need ierra range ups fine luck op

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:55.340
is fantastic we're actually in above

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:58.310
zero luck you know what give me another

00:20:55.340 --> 00:21:02.210
luck of 48-hour energy

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:03.560
speed-up relax okay

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:05.150
are we going to be able to make it to

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:09.770
the item room I've got nothing but faith

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:12.410
if I ever had faith I've got it right

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:14.180
now don't need the keys probably should

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:16.070
go back now we will go back for the key

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.600
will kill mom in two seconds

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:20.510
we'll get guppy on the deal with the

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:26.470
devil get into boss rush and be loving

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:34.880
life I think this is not necessary same

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:36.350
same same don't same don't okay well if

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.360
we're stuck with that let's double it

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:39.890
okay that's fine you might think this is

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.240
actually like Oh what is he doing he's

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:43.310
going he's out of control

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:48.140
quite the opposite I think if we don't

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:49.370
really like an item why would we why

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:52.540
would we take it it's just negative

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:54.950
points for us yeah we got yaar let's go

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:56.780
so you know if we get like a Harlequin

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:58.100
baby that doesn't add or take anything

00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:00.380
away from the run we should just stick

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:01.850
with what we got and I'm working out

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:05.510
obviously you want Polaroid this is a

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:09.200
good chance here wafer is so good I

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:13.370
don't want to risk it but you gotta pa

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:16.210
rt why so obviously like wafer big

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:22.310
chubby and then what do we want to halos

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:24.770
probably right every box rush there's a

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:30.680
halo in the top-left corner should I

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:33.500
pick it up two times I'm not aware of

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:37.270
stacking implications of attributes that

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.270
I can't believe what I find

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:48.170
he was well tell you what let's take one

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:54.110
try to double the rest again no that's

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:56.320
fine that's fine obviously like a second

00:22:54.110 --> 00:23:02.420
wafer wouldn't do anything for us but I

00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:06.170
was hoping for more big Chubby's we

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:10.100
shouldn't touch a was just like algae's

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:12.250
is what we like here yeah wait a minute

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:18.290
where's my era

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:20.530
it's got to be around here it's not that

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:25.250
big of a deal but I'm still mad I

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:27.169
totally turned my era oh well I think I

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:29.270
got it back but I'm pretty sure I turned

00:23:27.169 --> 00:23:32.150
my era into a single penny with

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:34.669
swallowed penny I mean we got roon bag

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:37.549
and again as a daily so like you know

00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:41.090
there's there's a chance it doesn't

00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:42.679
matter that much but except for points

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:47.929
but dude that would have been it would

00:23:42.679 --> 00:23:51.290
have been at least a modest bummer I I

00:23:47.929 --> 00:23:53.530
call absolute nonsense on that that

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:57.860
Damon take it back take the damage back

00:23:53.530 --> 00:24:00.080
it's not fair we should obviously get

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:03.440
like zero damage penalty from this point

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:06.020
onwards gosh that's good stuff I don't

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:07.970
really know how you hit 67,000 points on

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:11.299
a daily I'm assuming that that might

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:13.580
involve breaking it and honestly I play

00:24:11.299 --> 00:24:14.990
by the rules so I don't know if I'm the

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.640
right guy for the job here

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:19.760
could I get into the 50s I have had

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:22.610
50,000 dailies before some of them even

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.480
have 50,000 points on them get it

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:27.200
because he's been playing this game

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:29.350
since he was merely a young adult yeah

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.220
but you know what so has LeBron James

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:32.570
I'm not taking that

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:36.190
give me a per throw I don't want that

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:36.190
trash get that trash out of here

00:24:41.399 --> 00:24:47.320
too many Aries alright we're just gonna

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:49.090
take a yeah dust it all take the arrow

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.860
down that's fine by me that's fine by me

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:52.630
so how we doing on the daily front here

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:54.429
well I'm assuming mom's knife in the

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:55.870
first item room probably not going to be

00:24:54.429 --> 00:24:58.299
too many people that are you know

00:24:55.870 --> 00:25:01.990
looking at today's daily going did

00:24:58.299 --> 00:25:03.760
pretty badly at the same time I think

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:06.549
we're taking a very unique path here

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.990
much like the developers of Counter

00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:14.679
Strike global Offensive I think we're

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:17.200
taking a hidden path eager to see how it

00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:20.409
how it manifests for us as the game

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:30.309
progresses dude I ain't about that you

00:25:20.409 --> 00:25:31.779
know one HP up lifestyle you got to give

00:25:30.309 --> 00:25:35.200
me a little more than that that's not

00:25:31.779 --> 00:25:36.580
enough I will take succubus right off

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:39.549
the bat just kidding I'm going to double

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:41.799
it okay to sucky buzzes tell you what

00:25:39.549 --> 00:25:46.120
let's take one and be happy and then try

00:25:41.799 --> 00:25:48.789
to double it again and then we'll take

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.700
another three succubus is you're saying

00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:52.929
let's stop three is enough no it's not

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:55.539
okay should have gone for three but you

00:25:52.929 --> 00:25:57.220
know what two is really good as well my

00:25:55.539 --> 00:26:00.640
year is gone again I should have held

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:02.169
the era when I did that yes stupid still

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.520
though two sake busses going in

00:26:02.169 --> 00:26:04.929
different directions I mean I'll be

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.159
honest with you all I can think about is

00:26:04.929 --> 00:26:10.029
how sweet it would have been if we got

00:26:06.159 --> 00:26:11.500
in a third one but to suck buddies

00:26:10.029 --> 00:26:13.960
probably not a good way to phrase that

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:15.460
to people who I respect a great deal

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:19.380
helped me out a lot on this run thanks a

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:23.080
lot do we get the damage boost times -

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:27.730
no I think we might get a slight extra

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:30.669
bonus but it's not like we get times two

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:33.010
and then times 2 again still it was

00:26:30.669 --> 00:26:35.220
worth the attempt like without a doubt

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:38.140
in my mind it was worth the attempt

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:42.190
because it works we doubled it we just

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:44.260
we failed it tripling it but we were

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:47.500
minimizing our risk on every roll which

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:49.640
i think was also a very wise idea by my

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:54.770
standards at least so let's blow that

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:56.330
slow this phrasing yeah why not I can

00:26:54.770 --> 00:27:00.800
push a spirit heart out I don't think it

00:26:56.330 --> 00:27:06.080
matters too much and alrighty daddy

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:08.210
longlegs no deal now that hurts me deep

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:11.620
in my soul I think that's hoggle Oz I'm

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:14.780
going to double he's done it

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:17.570
modest damage upgrades both times why

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:20.500
not again it's kind of like if we don't

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:22.790
want it or if it gets

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:25.520
skunked instead of doubling I'm still

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:28.880
happy because that means we're not going

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:30.110
to be tempted to like waste points but

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:33.260
if we get two of them yeah I'm going to

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:34.850
take both of them if there's no plethora

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:37.400
of rerolls around this dailies actually

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:40.160
turned out really fun considering it

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:41.630
started a little weirdly like mom's

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:44.570
knife right off the bat is really just

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:45.680
like half the people are going to tune

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:47.360
out right away they're going to be like

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:49.400
the easiest win of all time but you know

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:51.680
what if it's going to be an easy win I'm

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:56.480
happy for the daily because the daily

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:59.930
means we got some extra like emerging

00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:02.270
gameplay of will he or won't he rank

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:04.400
well I don't know top thirty is probably

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:05.930
unrealistic I haven't taken much stupid

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.270
damage but I've taken more damage than I

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:12.890
should have taken it's fairly

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:16.010
indisputable in my opinion and probably

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:18.700
I've made some not that intelligent

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:21.050
decisions over the course of this run

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:22.640
definitely sometimes I've tried to

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:24.560
double when I shouldn't have definitely

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:25.790
left some consumables on the ground you

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:29.060
know those could come back to hurt me

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:31.310
points wives here but keep in mind you

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:32.420
know we we had to go fast there were

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:35.810
some times where things got a little

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:38.300
dicey here and we got fairly lucky to

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:42.410
get out of it this stuff is tough hear

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:45.560
me out here I think I'm going to take

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:47.810
algae's because it's going to lower my

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:48.920
damage against the hush like it's going

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:53.540
to lower the amount of damage I take

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:55.340
against the hush and then my thinking is

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.820
there's a decent chance for us to get a

00:28:55.340 --> 00:29:02.750
yera

00:28:55.820 --> 00:29:03.350
anyway so we might as well like we got

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:05.030
one full

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:07.850
fluor on the cathedral left to get the

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:09.220
arrows what I'm getting at so if we can

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:12.880
make that happen

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:12.880
can't be that bad

00:29:13.309 --> 00:29:25.309
if we make it happen will you finally be

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:28.789
proud of me and dan perks doesn't work

00:29:25.309 --> 00:29:32.870
with the wafer

00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:37.730
unfortunately mmm but the wafers I wish

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:39.590
it did but it doesn't this was

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:41.059
guaranteed I think you've got a chance

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:42.440
it like you got to take Guppies tail

00:29:41.059 --> 00:29:45.650
it's not like it's a big ask for us

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:48.350
right now so this will take us to the

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:49.580
30s presumably 31,000 we're giving a

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:50.059
little bonus from beating this guy as

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:53.600
well

00:29:50.059 --> 00:29:58.039
unicorn stumped mr. mega is probably the

00:29:53.600 --> 00:30:01.070
big one there um deep pockets well it's

00:29:58.039 --> 00:30:08.450
crack on these sadly looks like kind of

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:11.840
a below average bloom I'd say take all

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:13.610
the consumables okay deep pockets will

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:16.970
allow us to hold two cards so I think

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:19.070
that's worth it by itself and the other

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:22.070
pill was a power pill dude sure I'll

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:24.470
take it I think five cents for two bombs

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:26.990
now that was a bad deal okay

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:29.960
could have fooled me just to be on the

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:34.010
safe side I'm going to take the spirit

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:35.600
heart maybe that was a good deal I don't

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:37.640
know I don't think we care about

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.470
doubling like I'll just take the bombs

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:43.370
there's no doubles here that makes sense

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:46.730
to me because we we don't want or at

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:48.860
least can't use all the items so plush

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:54.710
fights should be like the last difficult

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:57.980
thing on this run the last most

00:30:54.710 --> 00:31:02.330
difficult thing on this run but you know

00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:05.409
double succubus helping out knives no

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:05.409
slouch to begin with

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:16.940
I'm hoping that we can get like

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:18.590
near-constant succubus coverage and if

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:21.100
we can make that happen again it can't

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:21.100
be that bad

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:31.460
I'm thinking you know you probably pop

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:37.340
power pill or algae's once we get down

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:39.290
to the continuum shots and then try to

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:43.460
save the other one for like when he does

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:49.220
the beams the thing about the beams is

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:51.490
that you want those to finish as quickly

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:51.490
as possible

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:56.390
not because of the risk of them hitting

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:58.940
you but because the only way to stop the

00:31:56.390 --> 00:32:05.360
beams once he starts is to kill him so

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:06.440
oh it's like home din right on me I

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:09.760
really didn't think it had the

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.760
trajectory necessary

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:17.780
camp popping it better safe than sorry

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:19.550
damage penalty does matter thanks for

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:23.480
the demon hearts I really appreciate it

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:27.470
I forgot that's pretty relevant algae's

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:30.260
tends to last quite a while when I think

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:32.120
of value I can't help but smile what

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:34.340
your steel can't faze me your poopy

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:35.990
Dookie baby I don't want some groupie

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:38.870
hoochie who only wants my gravy

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:39.380
that's David Faustino from married with

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:42.340
children

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:45.140
aka Bud Bundy doing his rap career I

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:48.830
believe it's called David Faustino I

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:50.450
told you sorry had to sell it so rough

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:53.990
but when you're in the industry you go

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:56.500
through this stuff now we don't want to

00:32:53.990 --> 00:33:00.500
go that way we want to go this way

00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:05.240
alright so 50,000 not realistic can I

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:10.880
get a tome Oh bless Tomo okay he wants

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:12.920
to pretend that he doesn't know me might

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:15.680
be one of my favorite rap lyrics of all

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:18.320
time just because of how like really it

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:19.580
is I don't want no groupie hoochie who

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.560
only wants my gravy

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:24.560
did you actually I think that he's

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:27.710
talking about is money but when you say

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:29.300
gravy in like the mating context it

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:32.630
really does make a sound David like

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:38.030
you're talking about your your ejaculate

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:39.590
effectively so and we should I wish

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:41.180
you'd rethought those lyrics is all I'll

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:42.950
say about that but you know your

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.640
illustrious rap career speaks for itself

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:51.260
so what do I know

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:56.180
a was does nothing I'm not I'm actually

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:59.090
am looking to explore everything there's

00:33:56.180 --> 00:34:02.480
no reason I can see not to explore

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:03.920
everything sure we probably want to you

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.960
know kill Isaac first just because we're

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:07.100
here but if we want to get fifty

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:11.169
thousand on this run it's going to

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:11.169
require I think it's going to require

00:34:12.490 --> 00:34:16.460
getting like the maximum points out of

00:34:15.169 --> 00:34:20.660
basically like every conceivable

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:24.800
opportunity I still think it is probably

00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:25.850
better to go just down to the chest two

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:33.050
different reasons

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:35.840
oh yeah one of them is that we case it's

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:37.820
not 100% obvious usually tend to take at

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:42.350
least a little bit of damage against the

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:44.690
Delirium fight because it's annoying so

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:48.740
that's not going to do us any favors the

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:50.720
other one is that I really think that it

00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:52.160
actually is just point wise it's

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:57.770
probably a little bit better from an

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:59.030
exploration standpoint got a loved one

00:34:57.770 --> 00:35:00.440
hundred and fifty points thrown in for

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:04.430
no reason here we gotta check this for

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:09.560
the guppy chance no doubt and I think we

00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:12.950
just use algae's on the way out unless

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:16.790
we get power kill no we use algae's on

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:20.260
the way out just because there's no

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:22.430
reason not to and it's guaranteed damage

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:24.200
probably we're unlikely to take damage

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:25.640
from any non guaranteed source for the

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:27.110
rest of the game not to be cocky it's

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:30.370
just you know we got mom's knife and

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:33.320
we're crushing it on sous is also fine

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:36.200
believe that makes angel deals better or

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:39.290
at least more valuable in one way or the

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:41.180
other just blow this up get it out of

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:46.730
your get that trash out give me some

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:48.290
luck nothing okay well I've got a mini

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:49.970
boss and then we're out we could get

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:53.570
nine lives from a mini boss if we get

00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:56.690
super lucky and this is the boss wow it

00:35:53.570 --> 00:36:01.880
worked so here's what you do you grab

00:35:56.690 --> 00:36:06.890
that become guppy blow that up oh now

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:10.640
we're talking throw down a freaking now

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:13.610
don't pick up perthro pick up this pick

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:14.780
up this you got to take per throw as per

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:17.600
throw then we got the other one is it

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:19.580
not algae's what do we have per throat -

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:23.840
gasps okay so I wanted like the guy's

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:26.360
gone the guys should be on the ground

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:28.650
per throw - Goss so drop the guys take

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:33.990
on since that's fine then

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:35.280
I wanted to believe that was convoluted

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:37.850
I was just trying to get more spirit

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.850
arts out of it

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:49.500
algae is in and zoo I'll do

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:52.140
oh let's go okay we got five keys 37,000

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:54.180
there is no way we're hitting 50 here

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:57.300
it's just not conceivable unless we find

00:36:54.180 --> 00:37:01.260
a huge path here so I think you don't

00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:04.520
even open those yet I've got to get the

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:08.640
full five lakh now you got to get the

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:10.170
full charge first and then you think

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:13.170
about it you just go for it

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:18.480
or do you you try to make something even

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:24.500
greater happen here's the thing start

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:24.500
with the opening and then if it's trash

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:32.700
/ throw like I want that / throw the

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.750
rest okay Booker tears I don't think

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.400
we'll do anything for us sadly

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:37.620
everything else get that trash out of

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:40.160
here as good honestly I didn't want to

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:40.160
see it anymore

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:46.049
I think we needed to take mysterious

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.609
liquid like we shouldn't take things

00:37:46.049 --> 00:37:49.589
that have no benefit for us anymore

00:37:47.609 --> 00:37:51.869
that's just what it comes down to my

00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:57.720
friends is that everything's gonna be

00:37:51.869 --> 00:38:06.299
fine fine fine cuz I had a good daily

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:07.920
run and I'm looking at rank 129 Alanis

00:38:06.299 --> 00:38:12.750
Morissette Alanis Jagged Little Pill

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:14.369
today's required listening professor

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:16.319
that was required listening three days

00:38:14.369 --> 00:38:24.210
ago yo shut up that means no homework

00:38:16.319 --> 00:38:26.369
dude there's all I was getting accused

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:29.130
of being that kid which I dislike I had

00:38:26.369 --> 00:38:32.700
I was not a socialite in high school but

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:34.530
I had enough social know-how to not be

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:36.510
that kid you know everyone's like I

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:38.250
never you the guy in school who when the

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:39.690
teacher accidentally forgot to assign

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:43.020
homework you always put up your hand and

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:45.059
say miss Jenkins what's the homework for

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:47.579
tonight no I was not dick I was also mad

00:38:45.059 --> 00:38:48.540
at that kid in high school I was working

00:38:47.579 --> 00:38:50.490
my butt off dude

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:54.230
I was always happy to you know when they

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:54.230
forgot to assign homework that's on them

00:38:56.150 --> 00:39:00.869
nah ain't worth it in my opinion all

00:38:59.549 --> 00:39:02.970
right so where were you sitting on

00:39:00.869 --> 00:39:07.650
today's run you do get a point bonus for

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:09.480
beating Isaac or sorry blue baby so we

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:11.250
should get another couple thousand when

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:15.390
we finish this run we didn't take very

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:18.589
much damage over the whole entire run so

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:18.589
I'm liking that as well

00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:25.109
pins

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:28.010
I think pins and needles here I got the

00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:28.010
needles you got the pins

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:37.220
I'm thinking we could finish at the high

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:40.040
40s but probably realistically mid 40s a

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:41.930
little bit more of a an honest and and

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:46.100
fair interpretation of what our score

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:49.550
might be I'm looking for like Luke

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:50.360
basically right now on come on nice okay

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:55.910
so then what do you do

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:56.450
gara gara and then double it you got to

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:59.330
go for it

00:39:56.450 --> 00:40:03.620
oh that one I'm sorry Tomo I woke you up

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:05.420
with my indignation there but I was

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:06.680
actually like we're going to get eight

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:09.320
items it's the only way that it could

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:13.850
conceivably go hello

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:17.920
tomo my old friends how do you get your

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:23.420
neck to bend so you can lick your own

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:29.540
shoulder blades parents started buying

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:33.580
razor blades because the scooters are so

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:37.460
dangerous in the wrong hands

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:39.560
like dance or do 96 that's not too bad

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:42.080
fun daily today Tom well don't you think
