00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.360
and everybody welcome back to her on the

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.879
line please abiding by zagat redd+ Ruben

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.589
thorn decent stuff on this new save file

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.970
although also losing on occasion some

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.870
people have asked me to turn the sound

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.740
up so I am going to do that and uh you

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.340
know what we need

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.070
I loves run I can't do the Yas voice as

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:25.529
well as Dan can yes

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.760
d 6c m CX ck what a season this one in

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.470
case that isn't abundantly clear you

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.369
know what let's be a little aggressive

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.670
be e a little aggressive I don't really

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.649
want the two extra cents from it but we

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.420
might as well try to leverage the fact

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.860
that we want to die in respond as

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.059
Lazarus and try to get something out of

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.980
it especially because it's a little bit

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.110
of a shorter run I'm trying to take a

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.329
little bit more of a risky approach a

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.140
little bit more of a high yield and

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:55.800
high-risk strategy because otherwise you

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.350
know it shouldn't be that much of a

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.640
challenge to beat mom's heart although

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.859
hilariously we have been having a pretty

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.100
bad track record of dying on like the

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.990
third floor lately but anyway it ebbs

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.110
and flows you know I treat Isaac like I

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.710
treat some why not

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.360
why not it actually lowered our damage

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.060
and speed and increased our range

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.420
you can't really ask for a worse

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.030
possible setup than that took away two

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.369
valuable stats maybe even critical stats

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.650
and gave us a stat that is borderline

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.210
meaningless but hey you know the idea is

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.439
that maybe at some point we'll come

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.040
across something that gives us like a

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:40.740
crazy range upgrade and the cruising

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:46.770
range upgrade this range upgrade Libre

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.189
it balances this range look that's not

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.439
bad

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.340
that was that was a pretty decent joke

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:56.909
there I thought greens Ranger green took

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.549
it to critical to critical to me anyway

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.950
plain Isaac it added some flows it ebbs

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.829
and flows like study habits like a diet

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.090
it ebbs and flows like the waves of the

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.209
tides I don't really know a lot about

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.709
you know marine behavior was going to

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.019
say biology but that's not what that is

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:21.819
money please i want to buy champion

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:23.469
belts okay we're not going to be able to

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.090
buy old lucky towles appeared in the

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:28.870
basement we're not going to be able to

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.639
buy champion belt at least not yet we

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.760
might get pageant boy but it's pretty

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:37.329
unlikely there are a few ways that we

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.209
could try to tip the we can try to tip

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:45.340
the scales in our favor here some what

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:47.109
that giving it the easy one is you blow

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.939
up all you can't get to that chest

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:50.709
okay well then not so easy one is we

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.150
find a second secret room there's a

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.359
bunch of red hearts in it theoretically

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.700
we step on a bunch of spikes and try to

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:59.019
get more payouts from the self sacrifice

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.790
room without accidentally sending

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.549
ourselves to a floor that we have no

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.120
chance of surviving right now mission

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.519
failed

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.930
so we'll blow this up as well and now we

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.700
have enough to get champion belt and

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.340
here's like the final step of the plan

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.290
is is champion belt actually going to do

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:19.090
anything for us what's it going to do

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:21.849
with with Libra and the answer is it's

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.949
kind of like an okay all stats upgrade

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.829
except for piers for whatever reason so

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:29.590
um I would prefer to have gotten a

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.569
little but it has a non laborat version

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.419
of it without a doubt but it is what it

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.919
is so we save a bomb for now of course

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:38.079
we could just go to the self sacrifice

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:39.519
room and you know lose our lives that

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:44.889
way this will give us the extra damage

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:46.959
modifier as Lazarus as las try to think

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:52.449
sometimes lessons more right I was going

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:54.220
laugh sometimes they get not angry

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:56.019
messages but people go please stop

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.090
saying this dead meme it's all over my

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:01.299
high school and I can't escape it yo I'm

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:05.319
not in high school okay so I don't watch

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.489
witches of waverly place I'm an adult as

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.840
far as I'm concerned if you're in high

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.669
school right now that's your fault why

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.329
didn't you think about that before you

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:17.259
you know we're born 12 years after me

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:18.820
idiot I'm just going to blow myself up

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:20.950
here we got a spear at our back that way

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.070
we get here so lemonparty that's fine

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.240
this is actually like a really really

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.970
good all stats I've gray

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.500
we got 1.47 damage out of it and all of

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.900
our other stats went up including our

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.900
tears which actually went up by a by two

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:45.330
Libre balances like a pendulum do

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:48.430
Lazarus rank gives you tears up to

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:52.509
damage is multiplying speed is real

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:57.940
great you got a beat mom's hot before

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:59.590
you're too late sort of worked okay

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.409
where are we going on this one

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.060
we should probably knock out our whole

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:06.940
deal with the devil situation I mean

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.110
it's our everybody it goes why don't you

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.680
just wait for the first deal with the

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.360
devil to die as Lazarus so that you can

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.789
you know get two birds stoned at once I

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.530
I do agree with that methodology in a

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:20.860
perfect world if you could guarantee

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:23.169
yourself a deal with the devil that

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.380
allowed you to lose enough HP to die I

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.940
totally get you but enough times have

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.620
happened where I've been burned trying

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.020
to do that that I prefer to just take

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.909
the certainty and get them you know

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.860
collect on that Lazarus HP as soon as

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:38.229
possible or the Lazarus bonus as soon as

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.229
possible not HP it's the inverse of HP

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:43.599
but because otherwise you know you pick

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:44.949
up a couple of HP upgrades and all of a

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:47.020
sudden you don't want to kill yourself

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:48.840
to respond as regular Lazarus or respond

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.669
Lazarus whatever you want to call them

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.810
we're going to take the too hard deal if

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:56.949
you're just a shadow this is like

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:58.840
amazing although will be dark Judas so

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:00.699
as a result we won't be Lazarus anymore

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.949
and that won't count as doing Lazarus

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:04.630
stuff and I think we've already respond

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:07.240
as dark Judas once so as much as you're

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.729
going to hate this and and you have a

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.560
good reason to I'm going to stay as

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:15.729
Lazarus for now and try to keep it going

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:18.340
this way it's the mistake I made many

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:21.449
many times my first run through the save

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:24.159
file and I by the way if we respawn as

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:26.770
yeah they're sorry if we respond as dude

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:29.289
as I'm okay with it

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.729
it'll give us a chance to win and we're

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:32.259
only going to use that respond if we're

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:33.820
going to die in the first place so I

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:35.919
just I want to point out that I think

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.630
this is one of those rare situations in

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:42.450
which we

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:44.070
actually do not want to become dark

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.950
judas immediately even though there was

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:48.120
another deal on the deal with the devil

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.830
most of the time that's going to be the

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.460
right decision this time I don't think

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:55.650
so unfortunately so this and this too

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.330
more spirit hearts we definitely do not

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.820
need to go buy a spirit are from our

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:02.880
shop like we're just going to move on

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:05.240
and honestly let's go keep it at least

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.040
honestly our staffs have been good are

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:13.140
not been good our stats are good

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:14.610
we have no bombs so I am feeling like

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.050
we're in a positive situation you're a

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.940
little less positive now that I walked

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.590
over a spike for no reason but this is a

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.410
good Lazarus run with again out of jail

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:24.630
free card is dark Judas if we want it

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:30.060
these are good things yeah that's you

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:30.450
yeah that's you yeah I'm saying four

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:35.670
times

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:39.350
nope two times I'm not a big double or

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:41.730
nothing sort of guy I don't you never

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:45.900
want to double or nothing in my opinion

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:48.840
I think it's it is always waited in the

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.700
side of nothing it's the same as the

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.470
roulette principle why would you ever do

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.660
double or nothing you went from nothing

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:59.100
to infinity times more than nothing and

00:07:54.660 --> 00:08:01.080
now you're risking going from infinity

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.090
times more than nothing the two times

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.440
infinity more than nothing with the

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:06.360
chance to go back to nothing

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:11.810
look this sounds confusing but I always

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:11.810
look at risk in a relative fashion I

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:16.680
suppose I don't know what I'm talking

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:24.180
about anymore it was not a very cogent

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:26.370
point okay actually we can make good

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.990
stuff happen with IV bag if nothing else

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:30.060
hopefully oh I shouldn't pick that up

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:32.280
yet but if nothing else hopefully this

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:34.310
gives us the ability to donate enough

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.539
money to get to our second shop upgrade

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:38.789
one of the sore spots is doing a new

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:43.260
save files our shop is very weak right

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:45.500
now or at least not very robust right

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.500
now

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:54.340
dang easy money our luck stat is still

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:56.320
zero so we're in the interest of working

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.850
on that we have a real donation machine

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.140
so we're trying to get to 50 and then

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:00.940
we'll see how things look there's

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:03.310
options has appeared in the basement

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:13.690
that's a start I'm going to buy the

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:15.070
spirit heart exquisite now let's stop

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:18.640
taking damage because again it's

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:19.990
unbecoming of a young lady such as

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.170
yourself and now why are you taking

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:24.730
damage in this situation it's a bad look

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.980
it's a Brad look and I'm not talking

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:30.430
about

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:32.110
Angelina's ex-husband what's going on

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:38.950
with those two anyway I really hope they

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:41.230
can work it I don't know what it's like

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:42.460
to be like a mega celebrity I'm saying

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:47.230
that mostly it's a rhetorical question

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:50.350
because as we all know I already am but

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:52.030
to be like really good at acting to be

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:54.460
like yeah I'm Brad Pitt I'm famous for

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:55.300
playing other people in an affable

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:58.210
fashion

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:59.620
I mean if we've already got deal with

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:03.490
the devil precedent we might as well go

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:06.190
for it I think and then just like have

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:08.350
the press follow you around like you go

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:10.120
to a Booster Juice or something like

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:12.070
that and the paparazzi is outside like

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:14.740
hey Brad what's up how's your divorce

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:19.800
Bradley I get that it's a small price to

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:22.450
pay necessarily for you know being

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:25.180
fabulously wealthy people always act

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:28.720
like famous uh you know that was go fame

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:30.760
and fortune fortune is probably pretty

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.970
sweet for the most part I know Master P

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:36.910
said more money more problems but you

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:38.560
know Master P isn't on food stamps I'm

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:40.510
assuming so I'm not sure that he can

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:43.420
necessarily be considered an authority

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:45.730
on that again more money different

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:48.580
problems I'm sure Lou the Bank of Canada

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:50.320
raised interest rates 0.25 percent what

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:52.950
does this mean for my but really leaning

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.610
hard into the mouth accent there but

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:57.010
anyway

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:59.279
the point is I'm going to explore this

00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:02.470
why not

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:03.910
the point is fortune I'm not sure if

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.700
that is great I'm sure Brad Pitt would

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:08.140
be like you know he'd like to go to the

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.490
Jew go-juice there's a lot of different

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:14.050
juice chains up here I'm sure you'd like

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:15.550
to go to the I've run out of juice

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:17.230
chains however I didn't sure he'd love

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:19.329
to go to the auras Orange Julius without

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.890
being asked about how like you know he

00:11:19.329 --> 00:11:22.120
and the love of his life of God in the

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:24.790
divorce you know

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:27.130
that's rough imagine if you know you

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:30.279
were just famous for a day on like one

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:33.790
of the worst days of your life hey Dave

00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:35.529
Ryan remember that time when you went to

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:36.940
get off the school bus and your bus

00:11:35.529 --> 00:11:38.529
drivers say to have a good time in

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.730
University and you said you too and then

00:11:38.529 --> 00:11:41.440
you felt really bad about it how did

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:44.140
that make you feel didn't make me feel

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:49.570
good you know they're they're human

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:50.910
beings very strange we live in a strange

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:54.550
world dude

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:57.670
I'm lucky enough that I've never had

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:59.550
that happen I've never had people like

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:01.329
follow me around and ask me questions

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:02.829
occasionally you'll need people and they

00:12:01.329 --> 00:12:04.300
go what were you thinking an episode

00:12:02.829 --> 00:12:05.440
blank of The Binding of Isaac and you

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:08.500
just had to level if I'm going to be

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:10.240
like record a lot of Isaac episodes not

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:13.829
every single one of them is necessarily

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:16.089
a winner but I'm doing my best here and

00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:17.079
you know I make some boneheaded

00:12:16.089 --> 00:12:19.120
decisions but when you're doing

00:12:17.079 --> 00:12:21.670
commentary at the same time it's a it's

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.899
tough it's tough sometimes at least it's

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:24.730
not like it's you know like being a

00:12:22.899 --> 00:12:26.520
rocket surgeon or something like that

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:30.490
but you get the idea

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:33.610
sort of $0.29 I will admit we're a

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:35.829
little slow for my tastes I would like

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:37.390
to go a little bit faster even though

00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:39.100
damn baby I can't do it that fast but I

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:40.449
know somebody who can we do have a Libra

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:43.449
keep that in mind as you pick up a big

00:12:40.449 --> 00:12:45.850
speed upgrade here yeah it turns out

00:12:43.449 --> 00:12:48.010
that's not really that big of a deal hey

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:50.230
uh game designers you still paying

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:52.750
attention to this game why does range

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:55.990
have such an outrageously high cap on it

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:57.730
I feel like you should be able to get

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:59.949
higher than two speed if you can get to

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:01.839
like ninety nine range I'm just throwing

00:12:59.949 --> 00:13:04.870
that out there as a as a cause for

00:13:01.839 --> 00:13:06.430
potential rebalancing I don't know if

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.139
you even want to get the three speed

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.999
consider

00:13:07.139 --> 00:13:14.639
how fast to speed already is I'm just

00:13:08.999 --> 00:13:16.350
saying you know Libra pretty soon is

00:13:14.639 --> 00:13:17.699
going to stop giving us speed upgrades

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:19.139
pretty soon it's going to stop giving us

00:13:17.699 --> 00:13:21.199
tears upgrades but it'll give us range

00:13:19.139 --> 00:13:23.519
upgrades until the end of frickin time

00:13:21.199 --> 00:13:26.879
is this really the world that we want to

00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:33.329
leave our children a world with endless

00:13:26.879 --> 00:13:34.949
range upgrades but no damage my opponent

00:13:33.329 --> 00:13:38.459
would have you believe yes okay what do

00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:44.189
we have here uh we'll buy a map we

00:13:38.459 --> 00:13:45.929
should have a lot of money so well you

00:13:44.189 --> 00:13:49.859
know I'm just going to hurt myself today

00:13:45.929 --> 00:13:51.389
to see if I still feel and grab this and

00:13:49.859 --> 00:13:54.959
then get a free shop item

00:13:51.389 --> 00:13:58.439
wow that's garbage um alright let's keep

00:13:54.959 --> 00:14:06.509
moving on then goodbye that shop it's

00:13:58.439 --> 00:14:14.459
been it has sucked all your items work

00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:16.980
really mmm the radio edited version of

00:14:14.459 --> 00:14:19.139
my parody version of goodbye stranger by

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:22.769
Supertramp goodbye bad shop

00:14:19.139 --> 00:14:30.889
it's not for me make mole donations in

00:14:22.769 --> 00:14:30.889
Sydney cream lovers card is money but

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:35.309
it's not my ideal choice here we're

00:14:33.809 --> 00:14:37.110
looking for I mean I know we just got a

00:14:35.309 --> 00:14:38.429
deal with the devil but you know let's

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:41.129
level with each other here we're all

00:14:38.429 --> 00:14:43.679
adults here you know in the eyes of each

00:14:41.129 --> 00:14:49.649
other in the eyes of an angel fly away

00:14:43.679 --> 00:14:54.720
from here the last deal of devil was

00:14:49.649 --> 00:14:56.429
like actually trash so I don't exactly

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.259
feel like we just want to have enough

00:14:56.429 --> 00:14:59.399
money for an arcade in the future even

00:14:58.259 --> 00:15:01.619
though there was one on this floor we're

00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:04.649
trying to make pace here as well and I'm

00:15:01.619 --> 00:15:08.279
not talking about salsa um keep going

00:15:04.649 --> 00:15:10.859
this way it's a decent laz run the siren

00:15:08.279 --> 00:15:11.879
song of dark Judas is calling to me but

00:15:10.859 --> 00:15:16.889
I have to remember we have to be

00:15:11.879 --> 00:15:18.720
slightly progress oriented here we've

00:15:16.889 --> 00:15:21.449
got some big advantages already like

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:24.720
good decent rate of

00:15:21.449 --> 00:15:26.100
Eyre although the longer it goes on the

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:29.489
less decent it gets you know you got

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:31.829
inflation in Isaac and you know seven

00:15:29.489 --> 00:15:35.609
rate of fire is going to get you a long

00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:36.959
way when you're in this game is version

00:15:35.609 --> 00:15:38.220
of middle school but in a high school

00:15:36.959 --> 00:15:39.389
you got to work a little harder in

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.369
college you got to work a little harder

00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:45.869
in the real world got to work even

00:15:41.369 --> 00:15:47.040
harder than that so we need up this

00:15:45.869 --> 00:15:49.829
pierce data we're going to find

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:53.579
ourselves just slowly but surely being

00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:56.970
outpaced by the game trying to think of

00:15:53.579 --> 00:16:00.089
this any way that we can up our tear

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:03.509
stat without being subjected to the like

00:16:00.089 --> 00:16:08.639
Libra Astro penalty and I'm not sure if

00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:11.600
there is 15 cents well we don't

00:16:08.639 --> 00:16:14.189
definitely like do not care about a

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.989
remote dirts your detonator it's not

00:16:14.189 --> 00:16:20.220
necessarily bad but it's not really what

00:16:15.989 --> 00:16:21.689
we want right now either stead we'll

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:25.259
just keep donating because the faster we

00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:30.899
can get this bad boy to a fully expanded

00:16:25.259 --> 00:16:34.649
shop the happier I'm going to be he

00:16:30.899 --> 00:16:38.220
walked no no no no wait wait something

00:16:34.649 --> 00:16:40.919
isn't right here that guy walked you saw

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:44.249
the look in his eyes he walked over the

00:16:40.919 --> 00:16:46.889
gap to get to me how is this like the

00:16:44.249 --> 00:16:49.529
third new thing I've noticed on this

00:16:46.889 --> 00:16:52.309
save file how is it conceivable that I

00:16:49.529 --> 00:16:54.839
didn't know that there were otherworldly

00:16:52.309 --> 00:16:59.850
you know champions that could actually

00:16:54.839 --> 00:17:03.929
walk on water here not technically water

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:05.909
but you know you know what I mean she

00:17:03.929 --> 00:17:07.829
was teaching me something new all right

00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:10.139
so ten out of ten upgrades obviously you

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:15.360
know the basics brimstone mom's knife

00:17:10.139 --> 00:17:17.399
here's one that's a slightly less common

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.630
soymilk you're probably aware of it but

00:17:17.399 --> 00:17:20.689
maybe you'd forgotten there is there

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:23.730
neglected to remember to put it more

00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:24.209
diplomatically soymilk would be ten out

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:27.750
of ten

00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:29.460
I do love having a tough love it would

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:33.410
be nice if we could get tough love with

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:35.960
more luck as well but the easiest

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:37.820
way forward for us as well with IV bag

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.410
might actually be right we ought to do

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.990
that in the opposite direction might

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:44.720
actually be money equals power it's

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:48.470
definitely not - IV bags but we'll swap

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:55.180
because old and busted Thank You new

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:59.470
hotness okay it's weird I just I feel

00:17:55.180 --> 00:18:02.480
most Isaac runs are like a having a

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:04.610
normal RPG character you know you level

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:06.410
different stats at different times it's

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:09.050
like owning a golf course I guess you

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:10.880
know every single hole requires its own

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:12.530
maintenance but you could have like an

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.640
18 toll that's amazing in a first hole

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:16.580
that's terrible this is the worst

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:18.980
analogy I've ever made but a Libra run

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:20.870
is like filling a swimming pool we just

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:23.270
need more water everything's coming up

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:28.070
at roughly the same pace dude okay

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:30.200
gimpy + Libra could be really good sorry

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:37.220
gimpy + IV bag could be really good is

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:38.600
what I mean yeah annoying but we still

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.400
got our spirit heart back at least one

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.420
of them yeah so you know it's like

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.100
filling a swimming pool

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.930
you can't just fill the deep end at

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:47.180
least not without any kind of special

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:48.710
things from a store that's probably

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.090
going to charge you an exorbitant amount

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:52.310
of money because let's be honest if you

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:53.450
own a pool you can afford it

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:58.700
or you should have thought of that

00:18:53.450 --> 00:19:00.650
before you got the pool maybe it's just

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.600
me and maybe she's born with it maybe

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:04.160
it's mabeline there's like some

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:07.190
exorbitant things you can have in a

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:10.880
house a lot of them do not interest me

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:13.490
at all like I have no interest in owning

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:15.140
a pool I don't know if it's I had

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:18.130
friends when I was growing up that had

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:20.990
pools I actually and this is not

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:23.120
braggadocious because we're not friends

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:26.960
anymore but I had a friend in eighth

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:29.660
grade who his family was like extremely

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:34.160
affluent to the point that he had like

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:35.990
the kind of bedroom that every kid in

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:37.520
seventh and eighth grade wants what

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:40.730
should never have it had like a

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:42.800
ping-pong table a pinball machine a

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:44.540
big-screen TV at the time even though it

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:46.610
probably looks hilariously antiquated if

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:48.620
I were to look at it now an indoor

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:50.690
Poole not in his room but like just

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:52.820
outside of his room and it was a big

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:55.070
indoor pool - it was like I'm not saying

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:58.190
Olympic size but it was not like a six

00:19:55.070 --> 00:20:01.850
foot diameter pool it was like a pool

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:06.080
anyway I should see what that guy's up

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:07.490
to either way I have no interest in the

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:09.770
pool I don't want a house with an

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:13.940
elevator I don't want a house with a

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:15.590
secret passage maybe that's maybe I'm

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:19.340
too boring I don't know but you need

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:21.169
like a you need a boring person in every

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.460
couple or and I'm not going to say

00:20:21.169 --> 00:20:23.600
boring because that's offensive to me

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.040
and my people what I'm going to say is

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:28.429
you need a sensible person in every

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:29.840
couple because I feel like my wife is

00:20:28.429 --> 00:20:31.429
like that'd be really cool if we had a

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:33.860
secret passage and I'm like yeah well

00:20:31.429 --> 00:20:35.690
who's going to win the pipes burst in

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.100
the secret passage who's going to fix it

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:38.809
is going to be me it's like when your

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.820
three-year-old wants it that's a little

00:20:38.809 --> 00:20:42.980
insulting but like when your child wants

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:45.770
a dog and you nearly long and I end up

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:49.390
you know taking care of this dog you got

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:49.390
to give them the chance I guess still

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:57.470
but anyway the point is I've already

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:59.690
been here wait so not worth it I don't

00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:01.910
want any is it your house is a money pit

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:04.690
to begin with mostly but not money but I

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:06.790
mean it's potentially a sound investment

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:10.400
depending on where you live I suppose

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:12.559
but and how much capital you have access

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.900
to but anyway I digress I know I don't

00:21:12.559 --> 00:21:16.580
want to add anything that adds trouble

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.700
like I don't even want a lawn I don't

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:24.830
know a Liz when I grew up I had a lawn

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:27.110
100% of the time sure until I was until

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:28.760
I was 17 and I went away to college I

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:31.400
always had along and you know what that

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:34.790
meant it's just a source of stress that

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:35.900
I have no patience for you have a lawn

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.530
you look out of your window it looks

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.510
nice

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:39.919
there you go full stop if your lawns big

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:42.140
enough for your yard is big enough you

00:21:39.919 --> 00:21:44.240
know you you can play in it or you can

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:46.580
sit in it your kids complain etcetera

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:48.799
etcetera doesn't interest me because

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:50.840
then you got to mow the lawn like once a

00:21:48.799 --> 00:21:53.030
week you might say oh that doesn't seem

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.470
like it's that big of a deal but why mow

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:57.140
the lawn if you don't have to or in

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:59.030
parts of Canada you know you know why

00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:00.350
shovel shoes shovel snow if you don't

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:03.200
have to you don't shovel your lawn

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:06.830
but you know I don't even want a yard

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:10.760
for these exact reasons cover the yard

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:12.710
and concrete I also don't want to invite

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:14.980
you know neighbors with too much time on

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:19.160
their hands to judge me for my lawn care

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:25.280
apparently like in my parents town

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:28.400
there's a pesticides ban Oh steam has

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:32.030
finished downloading the end is nigh the

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:33.380
time is now I am excited to play that I

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:35.480
was supposed to be playing it right now

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:37.850
on stream but the Steam download servers

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.500
went down for like an hour at the most

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:42.950
inopportune time you could possibly

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:46.400
expect anyway apparently there's a

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:48.140
pesticides ban in in my hometown my

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.120
parents said that there are people we

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:52.610
can't make boss rush who actually like

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:54.289
wait until they buy pesticides in the US

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:55.789
I don't know if it counts of smuggling

00:22:54.289 --> 00:22:58.549
but they like take them back into Canada

00:22:55.789 --> 00:23:00.320
and then under the cover of darkness use

00:22:58.549 --> 00:23:02.120
the pesticides at a time when they're

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:05.630
like less likely to be caught you

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:09.650
understand how absurd that is that

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:11.750
people you because you want your lawn to

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:14.210
look nice you're putting poison on the

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:16.820
ground that requires you to become like

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:19.240
an international criminal that's why I

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:22.330
don't want a lawn is because it turns

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:26.179
sensible people ridiculous that's

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:27.679
actually eight pay grades above the

00:23:26.179 --> 00:23:29.480
absurdity that I can deal with I always

00:23:27.679 --> 00:23:31.190
see these commercials it's like hey

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:33.770
Derrick how did you make your lawn grow

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:36.110
so nice and it always shows like one

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:37.700
poor guy there's always like four kinds

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:39.799
of husbands and commercials one of them

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:41.990
is the husband who's like can't do

00:23:39.799 --> 00:23:43.700
anything right he's usually a little on

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:46.309
the chubby side and you know when they

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:48.289
show him doing lawn work he's always

00:23:46.309 --> 00:23:50.240
like on his hands and knees for I spent

00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:51.620
the whole weekend pulling out weeds and

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.320
they just sprouted up again and then

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:56.419
there's always like just a cut below the

00:23:54.320 --> 00:24:00.049
attractiveness level required to be in

00:23:56.419 --> 00:24:02.000
like a TV show I'm sorry to say if

00:24:00.049 --> 00:24:04.370
that's the way showbiz works a lot of

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.950
the time probably I mean I don't know

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:08.179
YouTube is the great equalizer there get

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:09.650
really good average youtuber you're

00:24:08.179 --> 00:24:11.120
looking at them right now in your mind's

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:14.990
eye at least

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:16.580
that's not a secret room uh he's always

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:18.920
like why just use Scotts Turf Builder

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:21.680
and you know in 15 seconds it makes it

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:23.270
perfect how about hey John I judge you

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.650
by the character or the strength of your

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:27.320
character instead of the quality of your

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:28.910
lawn because this isn't a weird Stepford

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:32.390
Wives sort of situation

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:35.750
Loki's horns invasion I'm not saying by

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:38.450
the way that I don't understand the

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:40.670
purpose of lawn care lawns are like

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:43.250
eyebrows you know I don't notice them

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:44.960
but apparently a lot of people care

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:47.179
about them a lot and admire them if

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:50.960
you're into gardening for sure yard work

00:24:47.179 --> 00:24:53.630
I actually think I don't get it but I

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:56.240
sort of get it because I was similar

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:57.950
with running people go man running sucks

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.960
and I was like yeah running sucked for

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:02.450
like six months when I was doing is like

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:04.280
three years ago now for like six months

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:05.900
when I was just getting started but then

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:08.690
once I got into it I looked forward to

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:10.550
it every day was like a nice little 90

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:13.429
minute meditation was just me and a

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:16.520
podcast doing something productive that

00:25:13.429 --> 00:25:18.440
also was very good for me on a mental

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.940
level it was therapeutic in a genuine

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.850
level and I think gardening and yard

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:24.559
work can be that for a lot of people I

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:26.929
guess I because it's like a living

00:25:24.559 --> 00:25:29.179
Tamagotchi right you're like I am

00:25:26.929 --> 00:25:30.950
responsible for these plants and these

00:25:29.179 --> 00:25:33.200
plants are life even if it's not

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:35.390
sentient I think I understand it on that

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.940
level at least but I don't I don't

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:40.340
respect like lawn care marketing which

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:42.860
is always like ooh there's always like

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:45.260
an undertone of adulteries like you know

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:47.840
Jim's wife isn't happy that the lawn

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:51.200
doesn't look nice maybe she's going to

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:52.520
take it out on Jim by inciting a sexual

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:55.910
jealousy or something there's always a

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:57.740
little sinister undertone in not just

00:25:55.910 --> 00:26:00.770
lawn care advertisements but in a lot of

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:03.770
advertisements you know that like

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:05.809
laundry detergent advertisements flip it

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:07.850
the other way it's always like hey mom's

00:26:05.809 --> 00:26:09.380
your kid has grass stains because

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:11.120
they're a kid and they play outside and

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:13.850
they fall down from time to time having

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:15.320
fun all the other parents are judging

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:17.930
you

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:19.790
are they I don't know if they are like

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:21.440
maybe they should set this should be an

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:23.390
ad for that that's like hey stop judging

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:26.210
other parents with the kids have grass

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:28.340
stains on their clothes mom's busy at

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.870
the office you know earning the kind of

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:32.150
equity to pay for today's college

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:34.340
tuition rates she does have time to use

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:35.840
18 different kinds of detergent first

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.970
you put in the clothes then you do a pre

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:40.760
rinse then you put on the you know the

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:42.110
all-in-one detergent booster then you

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.450
put in the detergent and then all you

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:46.390
didn't separate those whites from the

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:49.370
colors and all of a sudden you've got

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:51.440
your laundry's all pink now and you know

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:53.300
your husband's looking at his secretary

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.710
with a lustful eye because she did her

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:58.310
kids don't have grass stains on their

00:26:54.710 --> 00:27:02.690
knees in all praise on on human

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:06.290
insecurities Axe body spray is another

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:10.250
one but we you know we don't have to get

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:12.590
into that I think we're about to win we

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:14.210
might have to go to Sheol but this has

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:16.550
been a good run one way or the other

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:18.530
sometimes this gives us Sheol access it

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:20.360
did give a shellac so we learn our

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:21.710
lesson from last time let me go over

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:27.080
your Skype for seconds we are cutting it

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:31.090
close I just got to go don't get they

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:31.090
don't like begotten baby

00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:37.490
all right

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:47.970
Shoal nobody knows the show laughs see I

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:49.500
always want you to know and it's very

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:51.120
self-serving for me to say this as well

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:53.370
but I'm on your side

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:56.130
many people think that I'm Pro corporate

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:59.309
and to some extent I think on the

00:27:56.130 --> 00:28:01.260
YouTube gaming side I am and I don't

00:27:59.309 --> 00:28:06.120
necessarily think it's like just because

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:08.450
I have done like the lightest form of

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:11.159
game development work conceivable but

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:14.549
you know I recognize that I'm in an

00:28:11.159 --> 00:28:15.960
extraordinarily privileged position even

00:28:14.549 --> 00:28:18.030
relative to other people in the gaming

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:19.980
industry like a lot of these game

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:22.919
developers they basically get in their

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:25.530
office and for two years or more they

00:28:22.919 --> 00:28:27.270
work on a game that's all they do that's

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:29.520
their job there I really hope this game

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:32.850
does well they work on it you know five

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:35.789
thousand hours it's absurd and then I

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:37.500
play it for 45 minutes and I go I don't

00:28:35.789 --> 00:28:39.090
really like it and I don't think I

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.679
should be under an obligation to like

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:44.159
you know every game that I play of

00:28:40.679 --> 00:28:46.230
course but I'm just saying like there's

00:28:44.159 --> 00:28:48.120
a huge like disproportionate amount of

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:50.429
time investment there I put in five

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:52.530
thousand hours myself but it's more it's

00:28:50.429 --> 00:28:53.429
not creating a single product judging

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.990
other people's products and hopefully

00:28:53.429 --> 00:28:59.220
creating an entertaining stream as well

00:28:54.990 --> 00:29:00.659
but so I do things that I err on more of

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:02.220
the side where people are like why

00:29:00.659 --> 00:29:04.860
doesn't this game work like this I'm

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:07.860
like well it's not plausible and they go

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:09.210
yeah but just do it you know so I have a

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:11.730
little bit more sympathy although still

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:12.809
not a ton like dude so many games say

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:14.450
they have online multiplayer and the

00:29:12.809 --> 00:29:18.090
online multiplayer just doesn't work

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:20.770
that bothers me but anyway

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:22.660
why is everything got to cost money of

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:24.190
dude we might die and respondents are

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.390
Judas here now that that would be the

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:28.390
worst thing I don't remember if we

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:33.010
actually completed our Judith's Scholl

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:35.080
trip so this would be a this would be a

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:37.810
surprise perhaps that we were able to

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:42.130
succeed in that department but I'm very

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:44.620
like I'm a surprisingly counterculture

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:46.210
when it comes to most consumer goods you

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:48.550
might be surprised maybe not quite at

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:50.050
the robber level of like or the NIC

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:52.090
level of like why can people buy

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:54.550
property isn't doesn't that belong to

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:59.710
the earth but you know I don't

00:29:54.550 --> 00:30:02.080
understand fabric softener even though I

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:06.190
buy it from time to time I don't

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:07.390
understand a lot of things anyway that

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:08.980
that should really just be how I end

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:10.900
every episode I don't understand a lot

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:12.160
of things we're done here broken onyx

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.360
appeared in the basement thanks for
