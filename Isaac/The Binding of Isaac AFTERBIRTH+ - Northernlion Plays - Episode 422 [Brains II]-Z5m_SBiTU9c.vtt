00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.069
everybody welcome back to room Lyon

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.680
plays the binding of issac after it plus

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.679
no we don't want to do a dang ol normal

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.799
run cuz we'll never be no I'm okay we're

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:18.810
on brains and we've been making amazing

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.590
time hmm lately brains is a bit of a

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.250
tough one

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.230
I remember we ruined head trauma for

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.300
ourselves and then beat it on the the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.199
subsequent go around like three or four

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.870
days ago but what happened with our

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:40.980
first brains run because in my head in

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:45.059
my head zombies zombie zombie eh eh now

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.399
we might have also squandered a decent

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.649
attempt at this one but I don't recall

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:58.789
for certain so I got to think about this

00:00:51.649 --> 00:01:01.469
we have no means of ever shooting tears

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:05.189
I'm like what happens you get in that

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:13.409
situation an orbital is an 11 out of 10

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:15.900
item what else what else could we

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.990
conceivably pick up that would have a

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:23.549
good chance at like really leveling the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.850
playing field in our direction bead FF

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.659
is on the list surely as an item that

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.670
like if it all worked out right you know

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.130
it's gonna make us kill enemies twice as

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.990
quickly or at least in twice as many

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.610
twice as few shots I should say half as

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.930
many shots it's probably a less

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.860
ambiguous way to phrase that

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.439
apart from that we used to really got a

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.009
stack up a bunch of HP I guess there's

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.509
no items on this run I think we're about

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.810
to find out if I'm an idiot or not when

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.340
we head down to the next floor but is

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.490
there really nothing more than it's just

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:06.119
stompy bad speed Oh also your blue baby

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:08.849
combined with you can't shoot it all

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.400
it's tough man that's a tough challenge

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.780
I know you're probably saying no kid and

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.350
remember like you failed it the first

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.300
time

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:20.880
yeah but like this is a tough challenge

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:27.360
it's like Lilith but all your little

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:30.930
children explode still trying to figure

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.880
out like I guess a much better space bar

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.060
item even something like the nail albeit

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.380
Book of Revelations fits equally well in

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.000
fact the Book of Revelations is a lot

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.810
better because we could use the orbital

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.610
that we get from it as well but it might

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.860
seem boring but it would also definitely

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.450
get the job done or at least have a

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.970
better chance to as a result of the

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.130
extra HP we'd pull away from it but sac

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.630
Dagger it would be really good

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:00.150
not a spacebar item but useful

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:02.250
nonetheless from that I'm kind of at a

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.660
loss Satanic Bible you might be noticing

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.160
a theme kind of running through these

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:11.100
items but running down a theme never

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:16.110
would've come to me working on a

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:18.540
challenge run running might as well

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.580
check right cuz I figured like a spirit

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.900
heart might be worth purchasing

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.690
nonetheless hmm it's it's a troubling

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.400
situation whenever I look at a run and I

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.890
say to myself self what's the best way

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.960
of making this run working myself looks

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.900
at the running goes you got to play well

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.530
that's where we find ourselves in a in a

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.530
tricky spot

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:48.489
good dangerous worked out though and at

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:50.110
the Ghazwan is actually I don't want to

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:54.909
overstate it cuz it could be worth

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:56.769
nothing it's an excellent dodge but it

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.260
could be worth everything

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.670
if this to Gaza ruin allows us to take a

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:06.220
deal with the devil that completely

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:07.930
changes the way the run works so I just

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.280
was just gonna say ideally we'll just

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.540
smack him down here actually it all

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.970
worked out anyway cuz we got the halo

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.959
and a spirit art along with it you get

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:22.180
dark bum since we're blue baby I can't

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:26.410
imagine not wanting dark bum here take

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:29.470
one to Gaza own I got a look to see if

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.620
there's an item room I really would hope

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.090
that we would have seen one by now but

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.590
okay there are no item rooms I should

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.479
just remember I mean I haven't done that

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.610
it wasn't that long ago that I first did

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:42.610
the challenge but this is actually like

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.099
an okay situation I think we effectively

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.139
have four spirit arts and dark bomb

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:50.490
grabbing up extra red hearts of making

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:52.990
more is a potential wind condition we're

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.340
really stuck in the sense that we still

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.130
haven't okay that actually helps

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.510
assuming that it this still works for us

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.880
where where we're stuck is that we have

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.729
no way to ever deal damage that's not

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.310
related to Bob's brain but that has now

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:09.970
changed the fact that we have spiders

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:12.039
not necessarily a super duper reliable

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.570
source of dealing damage and our damage

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.010
itself does not really lend itself to

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.770
high damage spiders of the present

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.110
moment moreover as we continue adding

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.479
caveat on top of caveat here I don't

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.729
necessarily think that we can afford to

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.770
build our run around spiders in the

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.270
hopes of just them crushing enemies

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:33.849
because they deal a hundred damage each

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:36.699
but we want it's nonetheless because

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:40.210
it's a way to hurt enemies that doesn't

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:41.740
rely on Bob's brain which is basically

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.409
like if we got any chance of winning

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:48.280
this run it comes down to not being

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:53.020
forced to use Bob's brain forever so the

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:54.030
other way is to just get them bunch of

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.410
spirit hearts by

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:01.860
bumm but that's not really like optimal

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:03.810
because we're still gonna take 300 years

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.750
to kill any enemies we come across but I

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.670
think we're okay at least I don't feel

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.260
like we're too far off of the win here

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.910
this isn't one of those challenges where

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.920
I think you just pick up one item and go

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:17.190
oh we won you know this is one of the

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.740
challenges where you kind of got to work

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.530
within the confines of the of the

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.270
constraints here

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.550
well gamble on I should go back for that

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:30.000
obviously oh I just I was like I'll just

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:32.040
give myself a little moment up here so I

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.450
can get a good line of sight

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.500
big mistake apparently more money

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:40.550
wouldn't be the worst thing in the world

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.990
either so we could buy spirit hearts I

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.300
would prefer if that weren't the only

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.160
way out you know it might be a game

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.080
winner as well as little brim and it's

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:54.170
kind of like a recurring theme in and of

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:54.170
itself here but not quite yet right yeah

00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:02.970
kind of a recurring theme but little

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:08.940
brim would be maybe enough to win it all

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:12.090
by its lonesome that was a tinted rock I

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:15.330
actually had no idea please feel excuse

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.800
me I'm begging you for an orbital here I

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.390
also I feel like I have to check the

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.500
shops maybe we'll get a shopkeeper we

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.540
can blow up and get something good out

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.430
of it

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.950
very least I got a 2% extra deal with

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.140
the devil chance we got all three Bob's

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:30.960
brains

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:40.560
it's a tough boss I'm kind of begging

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:42.300
you nice for a little bit of luck here

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.980
like I want to encounter an orbital I'm

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.480
not sure how we're gonna do it sach

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:48.930
dagger on a deal with the devil I guess

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:52.680
we say we got katadyn tails it's good is

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:54.060
it what we need no but it is good we

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.500
also got another spear and art out of it

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.420
we're still holding that the Gaza rune

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:59.070
and we got a very good chance at a deal

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.900
with the devil on this floor a floor

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:02.490
that by all accounts shouldn't really be

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.790
harder than the one we just surmounted

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.790
so

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:09.380
think well I would not say by any

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:13.160
stretch that the world is our oyster

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:17.720
right now but maybe the world is like

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:20.870
our mollusk the world is our clam strip

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:23.660
something along those lines if we could

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:27.040
just get like if every floor you got one

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:29.750
more Bob's brain this challenge would be

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.890
a little bit more plausible and I'm not

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:36.560
saying that's what they should have gone

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:38.030
for we're kind of like just caught

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.270
between a rock and a hard place though

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:44.960
because we we don't have a ton of HP our

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:46.880
damage is our best stat probably but

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:52.040
what does that mean when we don't do any

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:53.750
damage anyway our spiders are unreliable

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.750
unfortunately but I'm still happy to

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:59.530
have them are you a wizard thankfully is

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:03.050
irrelevant so you know this it's not all

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:06.440
negatives here yeah I was probably not

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:09.650
my finest moment and dark bum paid out

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:15.110
with a spider look I got enough of my

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:17.060
own kind attempting to feed this cursed

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:19.250
room given the the conditions that we

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.780
find ourselves in right now almost seems

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:24.620
like an appropriate course of action I'm

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:26.120
gonna say no for now well thank you but

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.040
I'm gonna try to see if there's a curse

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:31.340
room secret room sort of setup and it

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.750
appears that there is not and there's no

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:35.150
secret room there either

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:36.860
all right we've gotten zero money since

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:38.870
the last floor which if nothing else is

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.490
like the thing that kind of choose me up

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:43.300
the most like it's supposed to be one of

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:44.930
the most prolific resources that we have

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:47.170
what we asked for

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:49.640
I can stop complaining Satanic Bible

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:52.700
spirit hearts once every six rooms or

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:55.930
less okay okay demon hearts actually

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.930
that was stupid

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:03.830
also valuable although I'm loathe to

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:06.050
admit it as another alternative way to

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:11.300
deal damage to enemies I hope we don't

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:13.340
have to resort to this but if we do it's

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:20.210
not false to say you can always crash

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:23.360
into enemies take out a whole room with

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:24.710
a single demon heart it's almost like a

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:29.240
built-in once every six rooms

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:33.650
Necronomicon sort of situation in fact

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:35.630
it might literally be that the only like

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:37.490
the major annoys I shouldn't say only

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:40.400
annoys the major annoyance is waiting

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:42.080
for all of these Bob's brains to respawn

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:45.050
lock upgrade is very good I think we

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:49.730
should check but I wasn't thrilled about

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:52.790
checking oh it's all slowly like really

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:53.590
really really really slowly starting to

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:55.940
come together

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:58.700
we still got to play well but we got two

00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:04.220
different means of generating HP that in

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:07.130
and of itself is really important if we

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:10.240
could just get an orbital I'd be like

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.240
over the moon dude

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:22.010
like this is the worst now we actually

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:28.040
have some alternate kind of like pseudo

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:36.890
wind conditions for example for example

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:38.900
if I could pick up well first time if I

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:40.280
could pick up a faster respawn on Bob's

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:42.140
brain so I could actually fight these

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:46.430
enemies no if I could pick up nuns have

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:49.880
it you know it just greatly reduces our

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:51.740
ability to die because this room in and

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:55.850
of itself is a challenge and I just like

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:57.800
resent it to the highest order please

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:59.450
just make like some give me like two red

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.950
hearts for beating this room because

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:03.050
this is like you're making this game

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:05.210
look like a worse rogue light than it is

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:07.220
don't walk into that that could have

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:09.140
been a catastrophe and then of course

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:11.360
I've got like my own impatience to thank

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:14.060
for a lot of these situations that are

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:16.220
fraught with danger why not wait for all

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:18.260
Bob's brains to respawn well that could

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:22.910
take an extra two seconds I know that's

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:24.470
I am me so I know I know to thine own

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:28.310
self be true and all that I'm just

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:32.210
saying it burns me more often than I'd

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:34.550
like to admit good well done

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:36.290
oK we've still got enough to take a deal

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:38.450
and we still have the guys which is the

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:41.480
other important aspect there yeah

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:43.310
there's no one I I maintain some of

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:47.060
these rooms with the wrong combination

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:49.310
items you just can't not take damage

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.630
which I emphasize the double negative

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.610
cuz I want you to feel uncomfortable

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:55.990
listening to it as I feel uncomfortable

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:55.990
trying to dodge these enemies right now

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:01.280
okay well I should have waited but I

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:05.740
have to up anyway

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:09.320
so this is the right time for like

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:12.230
world-changing deal with the devil we

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:14.180
got the HP sorted as best as we can

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:18.080
reasonably assume that our HP will ever

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:20.440
be sorted on a run like this what do we

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.440
need now

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:26.300
essentially like almost any alternative

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:28.700
source of dealing damage nice okay

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:31.930
that's one spirit heart if if everything

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.930
goes right right there

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:36.890
go for a dark bomb don't let me stop you

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:38.240
get some extra damage which I was

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:39.500
excited about until I remembered it

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:43.279
means nothing for us except for our

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:45.200
spiders and then we get rotten baby and

00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:47.360
of these two items I'm just gonna pop

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.220
the guys right now to simplify things of

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:52.760
these two items I think they're both

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:59.019
useful I think you got to go rotten baby

00:13:52.760 --> 00:14:01.399
because it's extra damage so although I

00:13:59.019 --> 00:14:03.260
although I wish that I could have taken

00:14:01.399 --> 00:14:05.959
both then if we'd played a little better

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:07.550
perhaps we could have I think we should

00:14:05.959 --> 00:14:11.050
be stoked that we didn't quite get like

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:13.940
the world-changing item that I wanted

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:16.070
but we're still moving upwards and

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:18.110
onwards here I gotta say as well by the

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:20.899
way we're kind of taking things a little

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:22.640
faster than I expected given you know

00:14:20.899 --> 00:14:24.500
it's not the easiest challenge in the in

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:30.310
the challenge handbook and yet here we

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:30.310
are kind of cooking with gas

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.990
[Music]

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:36.330
so you got to keep shooting

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:37.980
unfortunately because we need to we need

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:40.200
to shoot for the Flies to exist but I'm

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:42.120
looking for cards cards and black cards

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:44.580
like the world card I think it's totally

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:47.130
ok to use right now not not so good that

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:48.720
you'd want to save it forever and with

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:51.390
these pills some of them we might no

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:53.190
bombs our key tears down tears down is

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:56.300
irrelevant I guess there is a bonus here

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:59.130
bombs are key we might want to pop but

00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:02.310
it's not strictly necessary immediately

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:04.620
and look at this we ended that was a

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:06.210
terrible way to approach him however we

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:10.650
can still deal damage without having

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:13.160
Bob's brain it's incredibly slow but it

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:13.160
does exist

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:22.620
all right on our shop more options it's

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:23.940
like there's options you can't go with

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.950
it you got to shoot for something a

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.740
little better in this situation like no

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:33.210
item rooms means we don't take that

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:37.350
can't take that bombs our key taro cloth

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:39.450
could be tempting but I think you really

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:41.400
just even pokey man's could have been

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:43.980
fine there but that you got to go for

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:47.160
something like next level and we didn't

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:49.890
get it and that's rough but life goes on

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:52.530
well buy up the spirit hearts and move

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:53.490
onwards could have gone for a couple of

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:55.260
things in there and I really in

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:57.870
hindsight I think that pokey man's might

00:15:55.260 --> 00:16:00.900
have been the end game pick up poke a go

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:04.710
whatever the item is called I always

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:06.630
have a look a cognitive virus with with

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:08.430
that item where I never respect it for

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:09.900
being that good but especially on a run

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:11.480
like this where our means of dealing

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:15.060
damage are so limited I should have

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:17.459
probably gone for it but hey let's focus

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:19.410
on the positive here we just picked up

00:16:17.459 --> 00:16:22.760
an orbital assuming we survive this

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:22.760
fight we just picked up an orbital

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:29.510
it's looking very strongly like we will

00:16:26.149 --> 00:16:30.950
live that was not the right way to

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:33.050
approach the end of that fight but

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:35.540
that's okay all right so an orbital is

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:38.089
scary but also completely doable like

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:39.829
I'm starting to see the seams of this

00:16:38.089 --> 00:16:44.329
run and how we're like conducting a

00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:46.010
symphony right now enemies with creep

00:16:44.329 --> 00:16:47.540
are a bad way to conduct a symphony we

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:53.870
should not approach a symphony like that

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:55.220
a demon's hearts surprising so I

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.480
actually took a look at our trinket to

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:58.820
see if our trinket was causing that

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:02.480
probably not you know what we're not

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:06.530
using bombs for too much here might as

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:09.970
well see if we can get super lucky I

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:09.970
don't have a key

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:18.800
got one spirit harder to that I I

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.240
actually believe like fully in our

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:25.400
ability to win this right now

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:28.100
I should probably recognize the the

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.810
trade in myself that tends to make it

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:31.580
more likely for me to lose if I'm using

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:36.670
an orbital instead of just using you

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:40.580
know our Edmund gifted talents here but

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:43.550
truth be told I I think the orbital is

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:50.750
like on 11 out of 10 here I think it

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:53.240
saves us a great deal of anguish all

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:55.820
these items are the trinkets rather are

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:57.590
pretty much garbage right now um that

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.300
was fantastic though if you could just

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:00.980
pick that up please thank you I do want

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:03.590
a key I would like to go to the shop I

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:06.160
don't anticipate the shop being very

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:06.160
useful

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:19.600
and in fact it could just be greed we

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:24.520
might never get a chance to know

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:25.930
regardless temperance pretty bad and I

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.760
gotta be honest with you a curse of the

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:29.590
unknown makes me pretty unhappy okay

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:33.190
good you didn't walk on the spikes that

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:37.500
time that's a big positive live bomb

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:37.500
gone through one series of dead ends

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:48.700
little tight in there see this tough

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:50.530
situation there because we can't really

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:52.390
take the shot try to get enough money to

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:54.070
make this happen it's probably not gonna

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:56.560
work but we might as well shoot for it

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:57.760
I think we're I'm trying to be very

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.880
delicate here because we're in this

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:01.990
fragile state right now I think this run

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:05.080
could go either way

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:06.670
I think we've we've hit the first point

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:09.460
on this run like the inflection point

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:11.620
where that we have now made it more

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:14.590
likely that we're going to win than lose

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:18.000
I think and I really don't want to throw

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:20.500
that away but more so than I think

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:25.570
almost any other run we've done it

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:28.440
depends on us not throwing that's a very

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:28.440
daunting thing

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:37.480
the mom fight is a pretty huge milestone

00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:40.240
for that

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:42.580
another key but you know what I think

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:45.010
we're really too interested in the shop

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:48.970
even though I've touched on that as like

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:52.530
a potential sort of like endgame bastion

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:55.539
of endgame items I think we're ready

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:58.240
especially if we can beat the odds get a

00:19:55.539 --> 00:20:00.130
deal with the devil here not

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.640
accidentally give away more of our HP

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:02.640
than we should

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:08.980
nice not worth it at all

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:10.990
even though it would give us bookworm

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.820
that means it would give us nothing and

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:15.039
piercing shots black hole you know

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:19.510
there's a case not good enough case

00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:21.220
though alright so we have an 8 HP and

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:23.010
permanent polaroid invincibility so

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:25.720
there's actually like quite a lot of

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:30.250
potential value there pheromones and bad

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:33.309
gas this one goes all the way it's with

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:37.990
us till the end of the line I don't like

00:20:33.309 --> 00:20:39.220
that but I do like that at least it's

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:43.330
giving us the option of going to the

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:45.100
chest keep rotting baby firing stay away

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:46.990
from these enemies because now we're

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:51.520
playing for keeps you know enemies do

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:53.740
double damage but I don't think we're

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.900
too far away from like an unmistakeable

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:59.730
win I'm just trying to think of what

00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:03.280
like specifically would fit the bill

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:06.419
because although I am a youtuber I'd

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:10.179
like to back up my case with evidence

00:21:06.419 --> 00:21:11.620
instead of just relying on a willing

00:21:10.179 --> 00:21:13.090
audience to tell me that I'm always

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:14.799
right in spite of the fact that I'm

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:16.510
talking out of my butt that's not a sub

00:21:14.799 --> 00:21:20.080
tweet at anybody in particular it's like

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:21.940
a super tweet of my whole industry and I

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:24.520
can feel it sometimes happening in

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:26.320
myself as well you know I I've

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:30.370
cultivated deliberately ridiculous

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:31.960
opinions for humors sake on the NLA

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:35.650
assessment and some people are like NL's

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:37.299
right anybody who thinks a spinach goes

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:40.419
on a pizza should be killed I'm like

00:21:37.299 --> 00:21:41.950
okay let's you're supposed to be the

00:21:40.419 --> 00:21:44.260
anti strong man you're supposed to keep

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:45.970
me you're supposed to keep me honest

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:48.160
here not just buying to my nonsense

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:50.950
I don't know what I'm talking about 99%

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:53.350
of the time I was in school and I

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:57.910
graduated and I came on to YouTube

00:21:53.350 --> 00:22:01.210
my mind is a slurry is atrophied you

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:03.280
think I'm sharp because I I watch listen

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:04.930
and the you know imbibe sharp media

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:07.680
that's not the case it's an on the

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:10.150
shoulders of giants sort of situation

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:12.280
but I maintain that you can trust me on

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:15.250
some level because I know that I'm

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:17.920
stupid and that separates me again not

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:19.840
to annoy anybody that separates me to

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:25.540
some extent from some of my peers not

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:27.460
all my peers but I guess I'm also one of

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.720
those people who I'm always wary when

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:31.270
people agree with me if someone

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:33.310
disagrees with me I'm like I disagree

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:34.930
with you and there's some conflict there

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:36.490
but at the same time I know you're being

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:41.500
honest if you agree with me I'm like

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:42.880
what's this guy trying to do trying to

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.890
get on my good side or something

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:48.190
it's a Nate Lee suspicious which is also

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:51.220
probably telling of my own personal

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:52.000
foibles but I digress this floor has

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:55.360
gone very well

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.010
I need Rodney Bay a baby to a grow thank

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.180
you

00:22:56.010 --> 00:23:01.210
those shots are not to an insignificant

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:04.630
damage you got all three Bob's brains in

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:08.320
there Rawdon baby keep it up dude

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:10.120
orbital is saving us big time here that

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:12.580
was bad but we will finish the fight

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:15.270
anyway and we beat the odds on a deal

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:19.170
with the devil good shrink it please

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:22.090
Keynes I could be good could be useless

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:25.120
the guys is worth using once for certain

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:27.700
um I mean we should cuz we're gonna get

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:29.590
back to full HP anyway but it wasn't

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:33.550
like a 10 out of 10 I think instead of

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:35.140
Keynes I was sorry instead of you know

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:36.730
we can keep Keynes iets sorry what's

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.800
this The Fool instead of the fool we're

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:40.000
gonna roll the gas okay down to the next

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:44.320
floor we've only got a few more floors

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:47.470
to go I don't know if I would reroll my

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:48.999
old run here given a choice seems a

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:54.459
little scary right

00:23:48.999 --> 00:23:57.159
how did it not get that open Oh huge

00:23:54.459 --> 00:23:59.679
okay we can fly it's not quite the same

00:23:57.159 --> 00:24:02.859
as a speed upgrade but it's real nice

00:23:59.679 --> 00:24:04.809
it's a lot of luck upgrades so I'm gonna

00:24:02.859 --> 00:24:07.809
start popping spirit or demon hearts

00:24:04.809 --> 00:24:09.689
because why not

00:24:07.809 --> 00:24:14.289
okay don't do that though that's very

00:24:09.689 --> 00:24:15.969
stupid there is a why not the why not is

00:24:14.289 --> 00:24:20.049
you might want to just save a charge so

00:24:15.969 --> 00:24:21.759
you can use it later but we're almost in

00:24:20.049 --> 00:24:23.019
like fast and loose territory I think

00:24:21.759 --> 00:24:27.219
and the more demon arts we have stacked

00:24:23.019 --> 00:24:31.689
up we're making maximal use of our Book

00:24:27.219 --> 00:24:33.969
of Satan Satanic Bible here and then on

00:24:31.689 --> 00:24:35.679
top of that you know these are gonna be

00:24:33.969 --> 00:24:37.689
very advantageous for us if we get hit

00:24:35.679 --> 00:24:40.779
anyway so the more of those we got in

00:24:37.689 --> 00:24:43.749
the in the stack the faster they'll pop

00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:45.789
and do damage to rooms that could save

00:24:43.749 --> 00:24:48.399
us from taking more damage cumulatively

00:24:45.789 --> 00:24:50.919
so I think there's a there's an

00:24:48.399 --> 00:24:53.739
analytical Kay a case to be made for the

00:24:50.919 --> 00:24:55.779
way they were handling things anyway I'm

00:24:53.739 --> 00:25:00.939
gonna leave the red hearts on the ground

00:24:55.779 --> 00:25:03.519
cuz I actually feel like our demon

00:25:00.939 --> 00:25:05.589
judgments or sorry dark bums kind of got

00:25:03.519 --> 00:25:12.239
it sorted out already doesn't really

00:25:05.589 --> 00:25:14.229
need my support Wow a little offended

00:25:12.239 --> 00:25:16.569
the only reason I came down here with

00:25:14.229 --> 00:25:20.619
power pill in the hopes of like crushed

00:25:16.569 --> 00:25:22.319
in some of these enemies cuz obviously

00:25:20.619 --> 00:25:24.879
like long term you want to keep the gods

00:25:22.319 --> 00:25:28.019
we got a power pill against it sure I'll

00:25:24.879 --> 00:25:28.019
meet you halfway then

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:38.630
we got a spirit heart out of it we're

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:41.090
making great time now I got to be honest

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:43.430
with you if you think that I would fight

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:45.410
hush on this run thank you because that

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:47.990
means you have a very positive opinion

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:50.000
of me and that's incredibly silly in

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:52.070
this situation maybe long-term that's a

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.940
good thing but like dude there's no way

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:57.800
no way on planet Earth I would fight

00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:02.000
hush on this run you got to be off your

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:06.620
Gor this run is getting put into the

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:10.850
banks as soon as it's done any bank I'm

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:15.800
talking Fannie Mae I'm talking agent

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:19.310
Cody I'm talking g-unit member Lloyd you

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:20.930
know whatever Bank you can find it will

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:26.260
store the results of this run if it's a

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:29.060
W really beating the odds on these deals

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:31.520
you actually you're gonna think that I'm

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:34.640
stupid but I'm actually not as stupid as

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:37.310
you think I am but possibly a genius if

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:40.040
you take nine lives as a forced blue

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:43.760
baby you go down to one red heart I wish

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:46.790
it were not true yet sadly here we are

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:52.190
and I promise you the thought crossed my

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:55.880
mind because in in normal circumstances

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:57.830
that would have given us one red heart

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.450
and preserved all of our spirit hearts

00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:04.130
but this is not a normal circumstance

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:06.140
and we would have been very very sad

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:09.470
after we saw the results of that

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:11.330
encounter so I'm not I'm not suggesting

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:14.330
I'm like some kind of mad genius for our

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:15.920
play they're just that we made the right

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:22.190
decision despite it probably looking a

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:25.590
little off that's good stay strong you

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:29.710
got lots of HP here

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:31.870
no speed that's very slowly crushing me

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:35.710
here but ok that's not the right way to

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:37.330
handle that the fire is is doing work

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:39.550
enemies get poison they have a chance to

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:41.710
give you spirit hearts it helps out if

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:43.390
you want to give me HP that's perfect

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:45.940
because the HP manifested spirit arts

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:48.970
anyway by the way like dude we're at for

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:51.450
luck if / when we make it to the chest I

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:53.710
got high hopes health up wonderful

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:55.750
infested nothing wrong with it I'm gonna

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:57.760
pop the gauze that's a little bit of a

00:27:55.750 --> 00:28:02.170
risk but I'm drowsy is really good

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:04.210
against the late game bosses so I try to

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:06.190
use it whenever I can but it's rare that

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:07.240
I get like an I'm drowsy pill early and

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:09.190
then get another one later

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:12.429
so think at this point we can go lucky

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:14.080
so for another one luck the idea being

00:28:12.429 --> 00:28:16.750
that we'll probably get a

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:18.760
disproportionate amount of luck of chess

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:21.940
as a result of that one luck upgrades so

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:27.090
I'm feeling very very positive right now

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:27.090
land these and then pay attention

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:33.880
probably should not have done that even

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:36.520
though it worked out for us it's likely

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:38.320
a very mature approach the situation is

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:40.740
that sure it worked out for us but it

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:46.120
was probably a little silly

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:47.890
now just land the brain here keep firing

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:49.960
in bombs these shots are a little

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:56.050
tougher to dodge up close and personal

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:58.380
so just try to land the brains it's

00:28:56.050 --> 00:29:02.110
gonna hurt yeah no way out of that one

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:05.650
with 0.9 speed anyway so you're done and

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:07.390
we are actually completely stacked on HP

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:11.200
so we'll head down to the next floor oh

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:15.580
I think we're truckin dude we've made a

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:18.429
great amount of progress on these recent

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:20.590
ones Midas touch is a potentially

00:29:18.429 --> 00:29:24.910
beautiful way to deal damage here and a

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:26.920
speed upgrade is so good so here's what

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:30.370
I'm thinking is you just crush enemies

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:33.240
get permanent polaroid invincibility you

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:36.900
get a chance as a result of the virus to

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:38.460
you know just style on them and the more

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:40.680
money you have the more damage you do

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:42.750
with Midas touch anyway so maybe like

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:45.840
every other room we kind of try a Midas

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:47.580
touch sort of set up here like this room

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:51.080
we got Bob's brains right off the bat

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:51.080
and of course anytime we get a hit

00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:57.460
[Music]

00:29:55.630 --> 00:30:02.140
I think this is just we have like the

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:09.130
sirens song of impatience right now try

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:11.050
not to fall victim to that play it right

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:13.600
you might get hit some of these rooms

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:15.100
are tough dude it's the end game I'm

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:18.130
hopeful we'll get some more items in the

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:19.660
process as well but we don't I don't

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:21.310
think we need to be as clever as I'm

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:24.160
trying to be I guess is what I'm trying

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:28.060
to say right now so just handle normal

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:30.190
rooms handle them normally this room is

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:32.020
not normal this room is too annoying I

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:35.920
feel pretty lucky we managed to get out

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:38.290
of that this room is normal don't forget

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:39.940
you got 22 bombs we got lots of

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:41.920
alternative sources of dealing damage

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:43.690
plus these enemies they stand close

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.100
together you know there then when they

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:46.630
go out it's a dinner for two

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:48.550
so one bomb should be enough they'll

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:50.130
just split it down the middle save money

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:52.720
put it towards the honeymoon

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:56.470
that wasn't a menacing implication I'm

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:58.690
suggesting they're in love you big it on

00:30:56.470 --> 00:31:02.650
soos does nothing but not without the

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:04.980
guys at least because we have curse of

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:04.980
the lost

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:12.989
stop

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:12.989
[Music]

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:18.850
oh that was not smart it's okay you're

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.650
still doing well

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:28.870
little Gish too slow enemies it's like a

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:30.400
little portable I'm drowsy pill and then

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:31.840
just stay as far away from like

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:34.900
literally everything on the map as you

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:36.730
can technology I think that's only gonna

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:38.470
punish us we're still not gonna be able

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:45.640
to shoot and it's gonna lower our damage

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:48.340
so if we don't want to acquiesce it that

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:56.020
is not my bomb and our HP is doing fine

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:58.300
okay we are actually set second virus

00:31:56.020 --> 00:32:01.770
probably won't trigger spun and in fact

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.770
it didn't do anything unfortunately but

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:08.590
I'm starting to believe in the power of

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:09.340
the novel strat here I'm also starting

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:10.870
to believe that I'm going through

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:12.990
puberty again based on the fact that my

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:18.790
voice just cracked for the first time in

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:21.300
like 15 years but I ran the map there I

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:25.679
think it's correct

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:25.679
give me those demon hearts there we go

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:34.790
big chubby is actually really good from

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:34.790
a damage standpoint

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:39.420
[Music]

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:44.650
actually no I keep I always get it

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:47.460
confused with the little monstro little

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:49.870
monstro is like a ten out of ten

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:54.190
I'll never insult that oh we are

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:55.780
actually 1 million percent set so just

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:57.600
be smart because I don't want to do this

00:32:55.780 --> 00:33:00.430
whole challenge again because it's like

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:03.130
really really tough we got lucky on this

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:06.460
one but land your Bob's brains in there

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:08.680
and then just go to town and then get

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:10.600
out you know why why give him free

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:16.140
damage that he doesn't deserve then land

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:21.520
your Bob's brains and then get in there

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:22.990
and he's done ok always a tricky

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.550
challenge but we are off to the races

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:26.350
