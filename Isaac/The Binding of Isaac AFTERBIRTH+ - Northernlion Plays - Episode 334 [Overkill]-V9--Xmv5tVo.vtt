00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.410
hey everybody welcome back to Norton

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.950
land please for finding Isaac after with

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:12.300
plus what can I say we've had like a

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:18.150
spate of 45 minutes while like 30 minute

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:21.869
runs really and even this 1 X 6 7 s HX z

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.890
7 great rate of fire awful damage just

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.000
terrible speed is not amazing either but

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.760
we're starting with a little bit of

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.160
extra HP on account of mr. Dahle and we

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.469
have static tears so I'm not expecting

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.050
like static tears to make up for our

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.030
pretty abysmal damage right now but what

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.960
I will say is that we can use it as kind

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.910
of like an analogue to having a huge

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.460
hitbox I mean I guess is what it mostly

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.800
comes down to that's actually the speed

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.110
upgrade there is really nice basically

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.030
if we aim to miss and we shoot fast

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.430
enough we kind of get like a weird sort

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.969
of piercing shots thing going on that is

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.710
actually beyond half-decent it's going

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.689
to make up for the fact of some extent

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.130
that we've got relatively poor damage

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.330
right now I think and then hopefully

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.280
we'll just get great damage in the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.340
future and you know the world's our

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.340
oyster

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.870
I don't know that expression must come

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.970
from like the 1930s because nowadays

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.700
people are all like I don't like seafood

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.260
taste those seafood

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.000
back in the day people are like yeah

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.440
dude an oyster it's like all your

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.390
nutrition right there and it tastes like

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.210
the ocean something I've never seen but

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.210
have only heard tell of in legends

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.910
piercing shots I think is the biggest

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.660
get here obviously we have a chance to

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.520
get Steven which would be nice we have a

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.950
much higher chance to get little Steven

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.790
we know waited by the way that we tend

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.260
to do this fight and neither of those

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.050
are going to be ten out of ten

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.270
although regular Steven is always like a

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.610
much stronger damage upgrade than I ever

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.820
give it credit for

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.770
little Steven is like just okay regular

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.030
Steven I always go like ah you know

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.709
those six of one half a dozen or the

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.160
other but really like regular Steven is

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.690
pretty demonstrably better anyway it

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.580
don't matter we're moving on here with

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.810
little Steven doing a little extra bonus

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:24.150
stuff for us here if we don't start to

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.269
pop somewhere on this floor or next

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.030
floor really is the fair one then I'll

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:34.100
start to get a little anxious not quite

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.480
nervous not quite you know scared

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.630
because I never scared

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:44.010
except when I'm watching the babadook

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:46.769
because that dude is frightening but we

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.110
got a little bit of time to make the to

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.910
make the run pop still and it's very

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.470
easy because our rate of fire is already

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.810
great well good

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.709
all we need is damage so if we can just

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.360
get a damage up like it's a big get but

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:05.900
straight up a crickets head by itself

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:08.700
takes us to at least temporary greatness

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.760
magic mush temporary greatness you know

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.070
we got a lot of a lot of outs so if

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.110
you're like acid I don't think it does

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.880
much for us I know you're going to be

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.720
saying well what about the situation in

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.090
which it destroys a rock and thus allows

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.920
your static tears to survive longer yeah

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.010
how much longer like a quarter of a

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.590
second it's

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.280
not bad necessarily it's just I don't

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.900
think it's going to be very valuable in

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.120
fact I would be surprised if it even

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.140
creates noticeable value but we've got

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.540
to deal with the devil here and we've

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.430
got one read hard to to work with it and

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.430
if we have to we can always pop

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.160
Pandora's box which I think on this

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.540
floor just gives me consumables I don't

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.860
think it gives me spirit hearts there we

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.230
go we got a damage up we're up to

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.799
basically five and then this will take

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.819
us to the Whore of Babylon state whoa

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:01.019
there we go yeah it takes us to the

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:04.989
Whore of Babylon state so now we've got

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:09.220
really really good stats actually wait a

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:11.319
minute yo little Stevens tears are

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:19.539
affected by static tears that's kind of

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:21.340
cool so that should be three spirit

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.080
hearts for us now I got to think about

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.150
it because if I use Pandora's Box I can

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.810
get a bomb and possibly open up you know

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.280
a crawl space here if I don't use

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.380
Pandora's Box I could use it on the next

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.169
floor which is way more valuable so I

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.660
think I'm just going to buy a bomb and

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.340
then crack into the the floor this way

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.289
and hope that the crawl space is worth

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.520
it but in the end of its not it's not a

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:47.560
huge loss we got enough money to I'll

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.120
pay for the bomb we got more than enough

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.330
money to pay for the bomb and we got

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.979
some bombs so in the end I think that

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.150
basically worked out so then we're going

00:04:53.979 --> 00:05:00.490
to come back and we're going to drop our

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:02.770
bomb back here we got a spear and iron

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:06.580
out of that and you know I would like to

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.500
get mom's key here ventricle raiser is

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.210
also cool and I think going to hang on

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.860
to Pandora's box I don't care about

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.740
getting a free deal with the angel as

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.510
much but I'd rather turn it into an item

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.979
than just a few consumables so we'll use

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:22.599
it immediately on the next floor and

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:24.729
then we have an open space bar slot to

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:30.400
basically choose whatever we want if we

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:31.240
find it mom's coin purse is not really

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.639
what we're hoping for

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.740
tella pills dude that took me to an

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.570
error room I would have been an unhappy

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.379
camper but we do have blank card access

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:43.509
now on blank cards nice

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:46.749
you know it's better than Blankman

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:49.240
starring Damon Wayans from the early

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:52.259
1990s and I say that I'll admit to you

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:56.259
straight up I have not seen Blankman

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:59.110
you know it's a movie that came out when

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:00.490
I was like 6 and you know when you're 6

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.960
your parents don't want you to watch a

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.169
movie like Blankman because they're like

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.520
yeah you know it might be like a poop

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.279
joke in it or something like that you

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.949
might show his testicles you not gonna

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:13.449
let you see Blankman I feel like you

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:16.569
know if you're growing up these days

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:17.889
like let's say you're 15 you don't know

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:19.330
how good you got it with respect to

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:21.129
superhero movies you know what I had

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.559
when I was well when I was 15 minute we

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:26.050
had spider-man 2 and x-men 2 two of the

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:29.949
grapes but like those were aberrations

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:31.749
at the time when I was like you know

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:39.580
what let's go for it let's go full

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:41.289
shovel bill when I was like like six we

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.589
had the Rockets here which still people

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:46.569
that they go like they ruined it but it

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:48.249
should have been good or like it could

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:50.050
have been like a franchise but that

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:54.009
didn't exist as much back then we had

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:56.139
like the Phantom starring Billy Zane we

00:06:54.009 --> 00:07:00.449
have the shadow I think it I think that

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:04.270
was Alec Baldwin playing a superhero and

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:05.860
then like I pretend Burton's Batman as

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.559
well but like all I'm trying to say is

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:11.529
that it wasn't the same like these days

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:13.270
like cats I feel like an old man when I

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:16.300
watch like Captain America Civil War

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:18.399
seeing like the dawn of like the first

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.830
steam engine that's ever existed on

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:24.159
planet earth and I'm like I never

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:26.919
thought they'd get it done the best it's

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:29.680
actually did it good on you like I'm

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:33.669
proud of mankind right and then other

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:35.860
people are like well that doesn't really

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:37.559
talk about the data as themes and the

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.379
Marvel you know I'm like you don't

00:07:37.559 --> 00:07:42.490
understand some starring Billy Zane

00:07:40.379 --> 00:07:45.219
you've got all of your favorite

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:46.289
superheroes getting together to fight

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:49.900
crime and not saying you should be

00:07:46.289 --> 00:07:52.060
non-critical I'm just saying like it

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:55.270
you know you're you're the guy you're me

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:57.850
getting on an airplane in 2016 being

00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:00.490
like all it's one of those it's the it's

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:02.680
a 737 I thought we'd be on the 787

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:05.199
dreamliner and I'd have the you know

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:07.360
custom tin window shades instead I got a

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:10.570
deal with you know the pulldown ones you

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:13.380
know when I when it comes to the

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:15.490
superhero movies in the dude who's like

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.690
I'm not sure this thing is going to get

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.370
off the ground because that seems

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:22.600
unfathomable to Miami and Earth all

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:24.490
brain I don't feel that way about

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.789
airplanes like every time I get on an

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:30.550
airplane it like it's very naive but

00:08:27.789 --> 00:08:33.010
you'd like look at the wings and be like

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.700
yeah those look good enough like I'm

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:37.779
good

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:39.010
oh yes sir you you ding to the the light

00:08:37.779 --> 00:08:41.500
at the top is there anything that you'd

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:44.470
like uh ma'am Naropa doesn't notice this

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:46.630
I know you're on this airplane uh you

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:48.459
know 70 hours a week and this is the

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:50.500
second time I've ever flown anywhere in

00:08:48.459 --> 00:08:51.760
my entire life but that's AB that

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.470
weightings got a little tape on are you

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.350
sure it's air worthy like they kicked me

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:57.400
out the airplane in 2017 they punch me

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:58.270
in the face and then kick me off the

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:03.880
airplane ha ha

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:05.290
timely jokes get on the plane smell like

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.540
there could be a fuel leak on this

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:10.240
airplane anybody else just sir anyone

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:11.890
else smell industrial lubricant just

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.230
throwing out like the flight attendants

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:15.880
in my head what is the flight attendants

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:17.380
are just like they've gotten noseblind

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.320
to the airplane and I'm the only

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:22.420
rational person on the airplane that's

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:25.209
like kind of smells like there's

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:27.550
something burning here's and I think it

00:09:25.209 --> 00:09:28.620
might be the rolls-royce twin-turbo

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:31.420
engine over there

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:36.339
good way to get yourself brought into

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:39.370
secondary so epic foetus is like a

00:09:36.339 --> 00:09:43.510
guaranteed win but it's also kind of

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:44.529
lame because I if we have sad bombs I

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:46.420
think it would be fun

00:09:44.529 --> 00:09:48.430
but we don't have sad bombs so I think

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:50.830
would be a little lame to just go from

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:52.990
like sweet electric-fence thing that we

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:54.160
got going on here to like we don't need

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.839
that anymore instead of just going to

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.270
drop nuclear missiles on them all from

00:09:55.839 --> 00:09:59.830
10,000 feet up in the sky so we're going

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:02.410
to take a look what we got for now

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:04.000
because it's good enough and it's also

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:06.180
entertaining and that's all I can ask

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.180
for

00:10:06.779 --> 00:10:17.110
that's so yeah that's I'm not saying you

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:19.060
should be non-critical I'm just saying

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:21.220
it I maybe I'm in the ideal situation

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:22.750
because I can enjoy them being

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.980
non-critical because of the fact that I

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:28.570
lived through some that were kind of

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:33.810
like not very good you know I was a kid

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:36.459
we were like hey Daredevils not awful

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:38.230
screw UNL the Netflix original series

00:10:36.459 --> 00:10:39.490
Daredevils legs no not the Netflix

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:42.329
original series they're though I mean

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:46.420
the Ben Affleck 2002 film daredevil Oh

00:10:42.329 --> 00:10:50.230
carry on and carry on then as if nothing

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:54.810
really matters the other thing is like

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:57.550
I'm not old at all I'm old in like a

00:10:54.810 --> 00:11:02.220
like a three-year-old sense yeah you're

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:06.370
old you're like 70 you know but I'm like

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:08.470
by rational measures I'm not old but I

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:10.690
am old enough to have reached the level

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:12.490
where I don't feel good come forward

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.899
obviously taking the wafer but where I

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:17.620
don't feel good complaining about

00:11:13.899 --> 00:11:20.649
anything because it's now one science

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:23.740
fiction level ahead of where things were

00:11:20.649 --> 00:11:25.630
when I was growing up and I don't just

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:28.630
mean like everyone always goes for the

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:31.360
obvious slow no sulphuric tears oh no

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:33.610
baby what is you eroding everyone always

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.470
goes for the obvious like you've got in

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:37.029
your pocket of computer more powerful

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:39.970
than the most powerful supercomputer in

00:11:37.029 --> 00:11:42.670
1998 and I'm like yeah okay it's not

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:44.199
like I'm doing protein folding on it

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:46.149
I've just gold new Twitter here's a

00:11:44.199 --> 00:11:49.029
picture of some dude being a jerk on the

00:11:46.149 --> 00:11:50.860
escalator thank God I got a

00:11:49.029 --> 00:11:53.380
supercomputer like I mean that's all so

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:55.149
futuristic but not what I'm going for

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:58.089
here's a little slice of life for you

00:11:55.149 --> 00:12:00.430
you want to watch your favorite episode

00:11:58.089 --> 00:12:03.930
of The Simpsons 23 short films about

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:06.910
Springfield what do you do in the year

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:09.850
2017 oh well recently FX played all of

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:11.620
the Simpsons and then they had them on

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:12.100
demand online so I can just grab them

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.389
there

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:19.540
you know sorry and as incorrect in 1998

00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:20.440
what you do is basically let's be honest

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.089
what you're gonna do is type it into

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.680
Google and then you're going to find a a

00:12:22.089 --> 00:12:25.029
site that doesn't look like it's going

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.290
to give you malware probably and you

00:12:25.029 --> 00:12:27.850
going to watch it I don't know if

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:31.630
they're on Hulu or anything at this

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:34.209
point but if they are even better well

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:37.540
yeah what you do in 1998 Hey

00:12:34.209 --> 00:12:40.029
The Simpsons is on 4 to 5 p.m. every day

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:41.019
after I get home from school they always

00:12:40.029 --> 00:12:43.720
play two reruns

00:12:41.019 --> 00:12:45.759
maybe if I watch for enough days in a

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:48.160
row they'll play 23 short films about

00:12:45.759 --> 00:12:49.630
Springfield oh but wait northernlion

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:52.230
you're forgetting about the amazing

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:55.480
invention of the television guidebook

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:58.240
where everybody submitted their listings

00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:00.850
to a company that collated them and then

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:03.069
printed them in just like every single

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:05.139
one of those was like 1/8 of a tree

00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:08.170
which means that over the course of two

00:13:05.139 --> 00:13:10.930
months every human household in the

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:12.790
country was responsible for a tree being

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:15.639
ripped from this earth to print off a

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:18.490
bunch of stuff for people then Oh make

00:13:15.639 --> 00:13:19.959
sure to watch tune in to Fox on Thursday

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:21.939
they're gonna be playing 23 short films

00:13:19.959 --> 00:13:26.439
about Springfield that's a great episode

00:13:21.939 --> 00:13:28.029
you know netflix says actually it

00:13:26.439 --> 00:13:30.689
spoiled me to the point that I think I

00:13:28.029 --> 00:13:35.410
have ruined myself to some extent I

00:13:30.689 --> 00:13:37.329
watched a 2010 Korean film a couple

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:38.829
nights ago called I saw the devil now

00:13:37.329 --> 00:13:40.899
many people are going to ask me what I

00:13:38.829 --> 00:13:41.500
thought of this film I did not enjoy it

00:13:40.899 --> 00:13:45.269
very much

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:47.800
and I understand that it is well liked I

00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:50.019
tend to agree with critics most of the

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:52.540
time I got to be honest about halfway

00:13:50.019 --> 00:13:54.120
through this movie I win this is

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:56.500
ridiculous

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.569
maybe I'm missing the point I understand

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:00.430
it he's a bit of an absurdist director

00:13:58.569 --> 00:14:03.009
for anyway that's that's beside the

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:06.670
point the point is I had the luxury of

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:07.899
finding it googling it to determine if

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:09.850
it was any good because I don't trust

00:14:07.899 --> 00:14:12.970
Netflix and star ratings to begin with

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:15.790
and then say I was good and I'll watch

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:17.889
it instantly watched it fully like

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:19.660
localized with subtitles and then at the

00:14:17.889 --> 00:14:21.639
end had the luxury to be like I didn't

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:24.790
enjoy it that much if then it come out

00:14:21.639 --> 00:14:26.290
in like the year 1995

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:29.110
so if you wanted to watch that movie

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:31.060
you'd have to go to like you have to go

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:32.680
from my hometown to Toronto and there

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:34.420
would be like two video stores I'll go

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.910
to the cool video store they have eight

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:39.130
foreign films there and then you talk to

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:42.310
the guy on the other no in Korean it's

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:43.690
called like a yogi oh and then you'd be

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:45.280
like oh you're talking about this yeah

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:49.570
and then you'd get it and you'd rent it

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:53.620
it would be like nine dollars beyond VHS

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:55.420
and beef and translated by like someone

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:58.780
who didn't quite get the localization

00:14:55.420 --> 00:15:00.490
right put the tape in the tape deck it's

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:02.950
not even rewind it plays the ending

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:06.340
first in y'all come on

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:10.540
you know I guess this is becoming like I

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:12.070
get it times change but you you will if

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.690
you're not there you will appreciate it

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:16.690
one day is all I'm saying

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:20.200
and then people said that to me and I

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:22.180
went yeah whatever grandpa satellite TVs

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:24.250
only going to satellite TVs always going

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:28.000
to be around and they botched the joke a

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:29.770
little bit but you get the idea that's

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.950
why I laugh when people are like you

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:35.320
know YouTube's going to be around in

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:37.120
like sixty years like I don't see why

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:41.440
you tubing can't be a 60-year career

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:44.110
well I think you could have like you

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:46.120
know the genesis of a 60-year career or

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:49.660
you know 40 year career let's say to be

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:51.400
less absurd 60 your career is like it's

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.750
almost worse than a 40 year career it's

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:56.760
like I I can't get out

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:58.710
I gotta retire at some point right but

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:01.870
you know I think you could lay the

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:09.670
groundwork for one for certain but you

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:11.770
know 60 years ago was 1957 1957 wouldn't

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:16.630
when we think of 1957 what do you think

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:19.870
of yeah that's right malt shops hey

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:21.310
honey how's your malt shop doing I don't

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:24.540
know babe seems to have been killed

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:27.070
dully by the disco era like times change

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:30.400
can't always rely on things to be the

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:32.020
same that's why you got a you know

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.300
appreciate what you got while you got it

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:37.570
you know one day listen to the BG Studio

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:38.200
54 my girl likes to party all the time

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:39.610
party

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.860
the time party all the time that's like

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:45.580
for mixed decades but you get the idea

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:51.160
next thing you know you know so it's all

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:56.170
up in smoke the day the music died and

00:16:51.160 --> 00:17:01.540
they're singing bang bang Saturday Night

00:16:56.170 --> 00:17:04.089
Live Dana coming Michael Myers Adam

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:06.850
Sandler claves you think you guys don't

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:08.199
remember Clive from yeah okay so we're

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:10.120
like moving on here we're doing fire

00:17:08.199 --> 00:17:15.040
where I had a schedule the stats are

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:19.839
good except lock which is terrible it's

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:21.850
nice you know it's nice noticing that

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:23.650
times have changed a lot in a way that

00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:25.540
at least like technologically I think is

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:27.730
very much for the better at least for

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:29.740
the convenience of mankind because when

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:32.080
you notice that point it's like you've

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:34.660
taken the derivative of the human

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:36.520
progress and you're going wow the rate

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:38.260
of change of human progress is out of

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:41.470
control it makes you feel like anything

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:42.730
is possible and then you know you go on

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:45.250
the internet and you're like there's

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:47.290
they announced the electric car a year

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:51.960
ago but it's not out yet what gives

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:54.850
science and know takes time I suppose

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:57.880
change the world be the sunlight in your

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:59.800
universe as eric clapton said you would

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:02.380
think my love will give me that's like

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.760
two veiled references to John Travolta

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:06.540
films in one day

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:11.380
let's build I guess more just an overt

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:14.380
maybe youth change whatever happened to

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:16.980
that song you know what actually I was

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:19.360
thinking today Kate and I had a rare

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:21.880
afternoon excursion out of our apartment

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.770
so we had a radio on it was playing it

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:27.490
was primetime radio so was playing all

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:29.530
the hits that's right smooth by Carlos

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:32.980
Santana featuring Rob Thomas and I

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:35.830
remembered vividly you know what take

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:38.950
tell appeal skip lost rush I remember

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:41.410
vividly having a conversation with not a

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:43.330
friend of mine an acquaintance this is

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:45.430
important because I'm actually the jerk

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:48.220
in this situation an acquaintance of

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:50.680
mine around the year you know 1999-2000

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:52.870
and I'm not talking about a gorilla song

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:57.390
whose definitive version was on the

00:18:52.870 --> 00:19:01.840
opening cutscene of FIFA 2002 anyway a

00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:05.080
song was all the rage back in like

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:06.580
seventh grade summer right and we were

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.680
talking about it for some reason as

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:11.140
school boys are want to do we're like

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:12.880
man and you know smooth it's such a good

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:15.610
song yes probably like as good as the

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.870
Beatles right yeah and then it is even

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:19.330
better than the Velvet Underground &amp;

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:24.070
Nico yeah definitely see like we were

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:25.780
pretty smart and there was a boy in our

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:27.280
group who's like I don't really like

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:29.620
that song that much and we were like

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:34.510
what is wrong with you

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:38.290
how can a living breathing human stand

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:40.390
before me and not like smooth the

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:42.490
greatest song ever written and I'm not

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:44.590
saying I ostracized him as a result of

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:45.970
this but I definitely like in my head I

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:48.160
think something switched him it's like

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:49.780
this guy's not it's not quite right if

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.750
he doesn't like smooth that's a very

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:56.010
like unusual position to hold for a

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:58.360
human being I don't like oxygen right

00:19:56.010 --> 00:20:01.420
you have to remember I was 10

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:04.690
you know maybe 11 so you know my second

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:06.520
favorite song ever was probably like the

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:09.150
Legend of Zelda theme not there's

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:12.250
anything wrong with that

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:16.360
and then I thought I thought about that

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:17.950
today and I was like man there's no like

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:22.780
no good deed goes unpunished

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:25.240
cuz I saw his trash sorry Rob that is

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:28.900
not not Rob alpaca Patrol I'm talking

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:31.360
Rob et Rob Thomas that's on garbage it's

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:35.050
like what is these Rob Thomas puts on a

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:37.090
weird like gambit accent for half the

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:39.520
song and I mean the guitar work is fine

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:44.740
but it's like who cares I'll run around

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:49.260
I'm Brown it doesn't matter and that kid

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:53.290
paid a small social price as a pariah

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:54.730
for being right that day I'm and I don't

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:56.830
remember his name or otherwise I'd

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:59.080
pretend to say that I'm going to contact

00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:00.670
him and apologize he'd probably be like

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.560
yeah and you know I forgot about that

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:04.860
day after

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:09.020
it's been 20 years Oh

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:12.150
Tec X what it's gonna ruin static tears

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:13.320
but it's Tec X it's going to ruin static

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:17.760
here so I'm just going to work towards

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:20.370
Beelzebub instead because I'm I want to

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.290
make static tears pop and with the

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:25.350
pencil we have some cool static tier

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:28.080
effects so I'm just killing these

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:32.460
enemies because then we can just leave

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:34.890
anyway anyway that was my side that came

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:36.090
back to me vividly today when that song

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:37.860
came on the radio it's not the first

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:39.600
time I've heard it in like you know 10

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:41.730
years the song still plays all the time

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:45.420
it's one of those radio stations they're

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:47.880
like we play all the hits mostly we

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:50.010
played four songs and then in between

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:54.270
those four songs we play one song you

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:58.950
really liked from 2001 well something

00:21:54.270 --> 00:22:00.720
else to get me through this laughs baby

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:03.930
you know it's like the perfectly

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:06.540
engineered radio station to offend no

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:08.720
one which is fine there's nothing wrong

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:15.630
with that

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:18.650
where's my key piece but anyway so

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:21.690
mostly I end up going like I was like I

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:25.410
always internally I have like a bangers

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:26.010
per hour rating system for four radio

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:28.590
stations

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:30.500
did I leave no wait I just did that

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:32.610
floor that's that's right

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:35.340
so like if I'm listening to like a

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:38.700
classic rock like the best of the 80's

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:42.420
90's radio station and they play alive

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:45.150
by Pearl Jam you know over killed by men

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:47.220
at work follow it up with like Peter

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:49.740
Gabriel's sledgehammer I'm like this is

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:52.560
a this is a straight-up 15 bangers per

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:55.140
hour it's like 90% of the songs they're

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:57.420
putting up there I hit no doubt this

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:59.400
place it's probably like a four bangers

00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:01.650
per hour once every 15 minutes I go

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:04.230
that's a banger it's not just the old

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:05.580
jams I'll be straight up with you you

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:11.280
know I know that Justin Bieber is not a

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:14.310
popular artist I like sorry I think I

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:15.810
think that's a genuine classic pop

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:19.350
banger in the MA

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:21.360
Nerra I'm not saying it's you know a

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:24.570
day-in-the-life by the Beatles but as

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:26.850
far as like pop songs go I'm like that

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:30.270
one's up there it says within its

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:32.550
contemporary you know era I think that's

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:35.040
up there occasionally they play that

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:37.160
Bruno Mars song that's what I like and I

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:40.860
go you know what that is what I like

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:43.890
what a what a pleasant song with a funky

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:45.930
beat that doesn't offend me by being you

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:47.970
know too experimental you know it's just

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:54.300
like a nice little Bruno Mars just

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:55.950
something it's just so likable but God

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:58.890
the edges round it off but it's still

00:23:55.950 --> 00:24:02.730
like pretty nice and that is what I like

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:06.990
but then they also do a lot of like like

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:11.250
I just I can't I don't know why I just I

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:14.640
can't hear any more Shawn Mendes another

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:16.260
good old Canadian Canadian or does he

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:18.900
just play in Toronto I don't know it's

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:24.230
either I can't hear it anymore it's

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:27.660
killing me on the inside let me out wait

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:29.160
Shawn Mendes I'm seeing I'm getting

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:34.070
confused here which one goes at this

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:38.550
good she got me shook that's Shawn

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:43.500
Desman that's it yeah yeah it was Sam

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:45.000
Sam Mendes directed that movie that

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.710
movie you know Best Picture winner

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.700
American Beauty one of my favorite

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:51.900
movies ever yeah that one why'd you put

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:57.000
on this accent I don't know it just

00:24:51.900 --> 00:25:00.080
really like American Beauty hey I'm

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.300
directing here okay we do want that I

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:08.880
don't think we're at bookworm levels of

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:10.590
greatness yet I mean I keep using the

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:13.470
shovel you're just giving the appearance

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:15.770
you've lost control of your shovel usage

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:15.770
share

00:25:16.129 --> 00:25:19.679
hating on somebody for their musical

00:25:18.269 --> 00:25:24.529
tastes is actually like the dumbest

00:25:19.679 --> 00:25:24.529
thing in the world but you know I just I

00:25:24.559 --> 00:25:30.659
like what I like the classic rock radio

00:25:28.559 --> 00:25:32.609
station is where I belong to my natural

00:25:30.659 --> 00:25:35.729
it's my resting state it's my have my

00:25:32.609 --> 00:25:38.009
natural habitat played some of the songs

00:25:35.729 --> 00:25:40.049
in rock band which you know on a weird

00:25:38.009 --> 00:25:41.969
level is like I have a more intimate

00:25:40.049 --> 00:25:43.950
relationship with a song now because I

00:25:41.969 --> 00:25:51.059
have seated in the Guitar Hero 2 you

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:52.769
know it's my natural resting state we

00:25:51.059 --> 00:25:54.659
can move onwards though we're about to

00:25:52.769 --> 00:25:59.489
move onwards in a big way to begin with

00:25:54.659 --> 00:26:03.019
here all of these runs recently have

00:25:59.489 --> 00:26:06.440
been fast and I don't think that it's me

00:26:03.019 --> 00:26:09.629
being like we got to crank it out like

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:12.359
everyone in 10 shots we get this

00:26:09.629 --> 00:26:13.349
ridiculous static to your pencil shot

00:26:12.359 --> 00:26:16.649
have you seen it

00:26:13.349 --> 00:26:18.239
like what am I supposed to do to slow

00:26:16.649 --> 00:26:21.320
down a run in which we shoot out a

00:26:18.239 --> 00:26:25.349
concentrated like Tesla coil of energy

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:27.089
every 4 seconds I don't I feel like it's

00:26:25.349 --> 00:26:29.029
a fallacy for me to be like we should

00:26:27.089 --> 00:26:32.940
slow it down

00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:36.479
an emperor card on the womb one that's

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:39.839
just science that's just when you use it

00:26:36.479 --> 00:26:43.109
I wonder on because I believe the sharp

00:26:39.839 --> 00:26:44.999
pencil is once every once every 10 shots

00:26:43.109 --> 00:26:47.159
how does that work with triple shot is

00:26:44.999 --> 00:26:49.469
it once every 10 shots still like once

00:26:47.159 --> 00:26:52.829
every 10 times you fire or is it like

00:26:49.469 --> 00:26:54.929
once every you know three or four with

00:26:52.829 --> 00:26:56.459
them remainder or something we should

00:26:54.929 --> 00:26:59.219
just test this okay so this one might

00:26:56.459 --> 00:27:05.629
fire no this one might fire yeah okay so

00:26:59.219 --> 00:27:09.469
one two three four five once every five

00:27:05.629 --> 00:27:12.529
well that wasn't in my hypothesis at all

00:27:09.469 --> 00:27:16.309
so we should really go one two three

00:27:12.529 --> 00:27:22.310
four and then walk into this room

00:27:16.309 --> 00:27:24.660
good one two three four

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:25.980
yeah I don't know if that's worth if the

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:28.440
juice is worth the squeeze on that

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:31.470
little attempted strategy there but you

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:33.570
know what Christians we're using our

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:37.890
noggin and that's important in this day

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:39.780
and age still trying to learn a thing or

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:46.860
two and innovate in Isaac as well you

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:48.780
know it does mean we should probably

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:50.190
fire when there's no enemies on the

00:27:48.780 --> 00:28:01.500
screen as long as we're not doing

00:27:50.190 --> 00:28:04.110
anything else you know kind of slowed

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:06.570
down in terms of our our pace though

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:09.590
like speed is one thing that's a literal

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:13.410
stat I'm talking about pace right now

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:15.810
no tinted rocks the pace of this run is

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:18.930
just not as fast as I would have

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:20.190
expected given how quickly it started to

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:30.390
pop but I'm also playing way too

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:34.170
aggressively not well like ever a smart

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:37.890
move I should be talking about like the

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:40.110
meta factor the streak actually getting

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:40.950
over triple digits for the first time in

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:43.230
like a month

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:45.690
we've been through I wouldn't say like

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:48.080
some turbulent times and eyes because

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:50.490
that implies that you know there's oh

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:53.430
you know there's been behind the scenes

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:55.250
turmoil but no we really just like there

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:58.200
was a stretch where we played badly

00:28:55.250 --> 00:29:00.810
doubtlessly and then there was the

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:03.930
occasional like really bad seed that has

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:05.610
just thrown a monkey wrench into our

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:12.380
plans but apart from that like it's been

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:12.380
relatively decent play hello what's up

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:16.690
there's leftover pizza in the

00:29:15.929 --> 00:29:20.049
refrigerator

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:20.049
[Music]

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:25.880
you see that's some men are from Mars

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:28.500
Women are from Venus stuff right there

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:33.870
because that's Christmas for me cold

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:36.030
pizza in the refrigerator there's

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:49.169
there's did you say this poop on the

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:51.030
floor like cat poop what well I use do I

00:29:49.169 --> 00:29:53.910
look like a cat to you you think I left

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:59.570
the cat poop on the ground I'd be

00:29:53.910 --> 00:30:02.549
surprised where is it ah yeah that's me

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:09.480
sometimes I just decide I'll just go

00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:10.940
here and clean it up later oh it's

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:24.150
definitely me

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:29.130
I'm a known small pooper see the thing

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:30.780
is cats are wild animals you try to take

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:32.520
them into the modern era hear you say

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:34.230
pooping this box full of sand and they

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:37.320
go that seems sweet but every once in a

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:39.960
while they don't they don't quite have

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:41.160
it going on anymore they forget our

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:47.549
speed is good enough to go for this

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:50.580
what's it actually like 0% bothers me I

00:30:47.549 --> 00:30:53.700
don't know like some people think it

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:55.620
grossed out by it I don't know if it's

00:30:53.700 --> 00:31:02.580
from doing biology labs in college but

00:30:55.620 --> 00:31:06.260
like I have no visceral reaction to like

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:06.260
fecal matter or vomit anymore

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:11.680
not into it not not my idea of a good

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:13.390
time like I definitely rather just

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:15.400
record another Isaac episode immediately

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:18.490
and go you know I have a nice little

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:23.980
stinky interlude of picking up these you

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:27.150
know detritus but there's not really a

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:30.670
major concern for me for the most part

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:32.380
so like people are sometimes when they

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:33.730
talk about like to parents they talk

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:35.350
about what it's like to have a kid and

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:37.300
they're like literally change diapers

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:39.340
yeah nobody wants to change diapers I'm

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.630
sure but like should be way more

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:43.300
concerned about the other unpleasant

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:46.570
parts of having a child like you know

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:49.570
spending I don't know tens of thousands

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:50.920
of dollars on them probably

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:53.440
substantially more than that depending

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:56.350
on where you live but like that's the

00:31:53.440 --> 00:32:00.090
real unpleasant part it's not changing

00:31:56.350 --> 00:32:00.090
the undies and signing the checks my man

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:07.000
this is actually like one of the it's a

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:08.920
surprise to me as well don't get me

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.390
wrong we got to focus here though dude

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:12.460
I'm glad we didn't go with tech X

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:14.320
because we could have balled out of

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:15.910
control and it would have been it would

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:18.130
have looked cool but it would have been

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:20.200
so say me and instead we got this cool

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:21.700
static to your run where I learned that

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:23.800
like the weight of the tears work with a

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:26.020
pencil and static tears is really nice

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:28.300
it creates like a cool weird little cone

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:30.430
or fishing net of electricity that

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.840
scales with your damage so we learned

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:33.340
something and hey thanks for watching I

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.900
