##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.819
everybody let's go I've been very kind

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.940
to us lately on these Eton run so we're

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.599
due for a garbage one ooh careful what

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.420
you wish for

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.580
stats are okay item is dangerous hey

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.440
actually the the metronomes dangerous

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.750
potentially good but dangerous and the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.090
spider bite is actually solid but 2.83

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.100
damage is bad a trait of fire is great

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:30.240
1.0 through speed is good enough in our

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:31.949
seat is TV 6 X 8 0 C 0 last run started

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.860
in in actually a position that was a

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:40.110
little similar to this one and ended up

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.450
balling out of control due to like a

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.950
well-timed monstros long brimstone oh by

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.620
the way we have the relic

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.780
you know lusty blood etc etc we ended up

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.700
popping off oh I didn't think we'd get

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.960
around that corner there yeah we ended

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.670
up popping off on that run and I hope

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.449
that we end up having a similar sort of

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:01.890
thing happen this time but we're also I

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.930
do sort of this is self inflating I want

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.280
a difficult run and the reason I want a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.580
difficult run oh good we got the belly

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.229
button for one room that should be

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.240
helpful the reason I want a difficult

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:19.409
run is because it looks good to be

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.229
honest with you what do I didn't even

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.030
see ahead of the keeper it looks good to

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.439
win that run when you win a run that

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.210
everybody expects you to win everyone

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.750
goes yeah of course you want and that's

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.920
fair

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.479
there's there's an element of fairness

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.710
there at least I don't choose the items

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.780
that we get but when the items are good

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.040
and you win you know it's like the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.590
Golden State Warriors I don't follow

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.049
basketball but I follow stats to some

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.200
extent and before the NBA's NBA season

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.750
everyone was like closely a 99% chances

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.369
even kick the blade it introduced better

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.399
to it or do the Cleveland Cavaliers

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.630
against the Golden State Warriors and

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.920
then it was the Cleveland Cavaliers

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.600
against the Golden State Warriors nobody

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.399
went like a good job you made the finals

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.200
everyone was like you know

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.759
congratulations you fulfilled the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.759
expectations that were set for you

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.650
I really thought we can make it through

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.299
there but with one bomb we should be

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.119
able to access the tempted rock we are

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.980
in kind of a not amazing

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.390
we at Ludo there at the end but we're in

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.870
kind of a not amazing situation

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.690
damage-wise metronome is rarely going to

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.510
be able to be relied upon to fix that

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.830
for us but I will say I'm happy to have

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.420
Ludo for this room because it gives me a

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.910
good opportunity to just you know chew

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.170
up these poops and go there any extra

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.459
money for us might like outside chance

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:41.970
we're able to make the shop worthwhile

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:41.970
now extremely outside shams nothing ooh

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:49.330
you know what if you're going to be

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.580
committed to Zayn you got to respect the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:57.160
metronome it just is what it is

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:58.780
basically the metronome is a same once

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.870
every two rooms we'll get a random item

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.470
rarely is it going to be anything to be

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.329
honest with you I don't want the secret

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.070
room I want this rarely is it going to

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.410
be worthwhile but in the situations in

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.950
which it is worthwhile I'm going to be

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.810
stoked like for example right now very

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.400
very nice damage upgrade that coincides

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.769
with us getting small rock as well which

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.299
is the speed downgrade that we can

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.299
afford but would prefer not to

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.810
and there you know honestly them taken

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.010
care of so no problems I'm just going to

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.600
add down to the next floor and be very

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.850
happy with the way this floor went with

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.230
the exception of HP's in a dicey spot so

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.640
you know what that's a good thing it

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.500
keeps us on our toes here we've been

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.330
we've been itching to have that happen

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.280
recently ten cents means we don't the

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.390
chute poop just the same way that love

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.940
means never having to say you're sorry

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.950
it can be in conception on this room I

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.310
can't think of more of a tease of an

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.200
item right now came being conception we

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.810
got hit enough times to kill us would

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.480
also give us greatness here why don't we

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.070
have oh because we have a pinky I didn't

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.990
even notice I was I just saw enemies

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.550
getting poisoned and of course my first

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.230
instinct was not to look at my trinket

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.180
but rather to go oh I guess the

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.740
metronome carries a passive you know 1

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.960
in 10 chance to shoot a poison fear

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.900
effect that's my own personal foible

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.660
there but I was also hopeful like I've

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.270
gotten trained by the virus to be like

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.590
if I see an enemy getting poisoned

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.700
serpents kiss does this too then there's

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.760
a chance that they're going to give us a

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.550
black card obviously not the case in

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.100
this situation but that's fine I will

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.250
take the eternal heart if strictly

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.920
necessary as soon as we need it but as

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.690
of right now I'd rather keep it back

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.690
there to preserve the chance of a given

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:50.520
of something worthwhile so what happens

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:53.610
there I got blue candle and as a result

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.230
got nothing oh don't hate me because I'm

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.450
right here you've got to take mom's

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.950
knife you're on one and a half HP with

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.560
no guarantee of ever getting stuff in

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.980
the future absolutely you take mom's

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.050
knife in that situation and we'll try to

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.840
build synergies around it but a deal

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.930
with the devil mom's life is one thing a

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.130
mom's knife in which you know it might

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.750
make the difference between success and

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.240
failure is another thing altogether look

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.970
at that basically over the course of

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.890
like three rooms we went from danger

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.700
Will Robinson

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:29.400
you know then a Dae Sheldon The Big Bang

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.930
Theory to actually being in a great spot

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.580
you know what we tried it now we're

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.690
going to buy it came being conception

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:39.270
good item not really incredible for us

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.880
right now but of course has the

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.920
potential

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.990
get there in the future so next step in

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.550
our plan is just not forgetting about

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:50.260
the eternal heart back there which is

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:55.750
extremely valuable but this run really

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:58.420
went from zero to sixty like as quickly

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.760
as a run possibly can short of getting

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:03.700
like all of the guppy items

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.130
consecutively this is like again you

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.080
almost have to put yourself in a intern

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.600
apologetic like I'm sorry sort of

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.710
standpoint oh and then the arcade was

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.960
right next to us not that we would have

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.220
played it with just spirit arts anyway

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.280
but if we'd found this earlier we could

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:20.410
have had 15 cents easily we still

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.090
probably could but I just blow up our

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.620
donation machine like that's what the

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.970
donation machine at nine hundred and

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.970
eighty cents that's what it's there for

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:34.630
we've already proven we can get it back

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:40.870
you know I guess we might as well look

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:42.280
for like some invincibility it's not

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.530
like the metronome was doing too much

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:47.260
else for us right now

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:50.620
you know ensures chew a month one penny

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.730
makes it all worthwhile I was just

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.980
joking at that point it would have

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:57.070
required a nickel or something because

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:59.700
that was just a little cost prohibitive

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:03.730
from our precious life force kind of

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:05.290
angle really is my brain is broken and

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:09.900
cannot find a shop maybe on the left

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.900
here yeah definitely on the left here

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.630
mom's purse is more fun like the

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:18.130
stopwatch I you know what I'm an idiot

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.200
because the stopwatch is a speed upgrade

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:26.080
now and maybe has been for a hundred

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:27.700
years you wouldn't you did six cents you

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.910
know what you learn something new every

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.790
day

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.900
for example I've lived that we I've

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.000
learned that we live in a cold in

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.170
emotionless universe apparently where

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.370
they won't let me get this one extra

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.380
pain you get a speed upgrade I mean I

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:40.900
mind you I'm at one point one two speeds

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:43.710
so it's not that bad I'm somewhat

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:46.300
worried that that would have killed us

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:50.200
we did have and it looked like we had

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.310
enough I think but and if the item had

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.680
been better I might have been more

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:56.889
tempted to give it a shot but

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:59.320
with negative 0.98 luck I don't see the

00:07:56.889 --> 00:08:01.660
the role of making gimpy attempting to

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.880
make gimpy work here and hilariously it

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.500
worked for us immediately so it just

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:10.979
goes to show you you know the more you

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:14.789
know the less you know people roasted

00:08:10.979 --> 00:08:18.340
george w bush for saying this quote and

00:08:14.789 --> 00:08:21.400
i'm paraphrasing and certainly you know

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:23.320
i grew up as a canadian during the bush

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.840
administration without making it

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.910
political I was 16 years old in 2004 you

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.010
can probably guess what the general

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:31.570
discourse was and in our neighborhood

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:34.209
and that my circle of friends around

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:37.469
2004 but the point is I always thought

00:08:34.209 --> 00:08:40.270
that despite being in eloquent he got

00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:45.070
unjustly roasted sometimes for quotes

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:48.250
that are actually they sound idiotic but

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:52.089
have some truth behind them for example

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:56.380
when he said you know there's known

00:08:52.089 --> 00:08:58.089
unknowns and unknown unknowns that is

00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:01.420
it's a ridiculous statement because it

00:08:58.089 --> 00:09:03.279
sounds silly but it's actually like one

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:05.709
of the smartest freakin things you could

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:06.940
ever say what he's admitting is that

00:09:05.709 --> 00:09:08.890
there's things that we know that we

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:11.830
don't know and then there's things that

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:14.080
we don't we can't even conceive of not

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:18.040
knowing yet you know you for example

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:20.230
like you know oh we can not know you

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:23.350
know the exact position of something in

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:24.700
the celestial map but know that it's

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:27.370
there because of the way that it affects

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:29.470
you know like light bends around it on

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:30.970
on a telescope or something like that

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:34.440
you go okay well there has to be

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:36.850
something of this mass here what we

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.959
understand example of a known unknown we

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:39.430
don't know what's there but there must

00:09:37.959 --> 00:09:42.790
be something there that we can derive

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:46.420
that you know we can deduce that and an

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:49.570
unknown unknown is like you know what

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:50.980
planet is life on if there is life on

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:54.459
another planet except for Earth you know

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:56.260
we can't even conceive of that at the

00:09:54.459 --> 00:09:57.790
present moment dude I don't know the

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.550
metronome I'm just going to be honest we

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:00.860
kind of sting

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.810
I don't understand it I'm gonna take

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:05.630
cramp as I said now don't think this is

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:07.640
me glorifying the Bush administration at

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:09.769
all I keep the show apolitical because

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.560
I'm I'm ignorant of it but I understand

00:10:09.769 --> 00:10:14.680
just think this as like this is my way

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.810
of saying like I'm not saying I'm

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:19.850
vilifying it or glorifying it but of all

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.930
the things exhibit the lasting legacy of

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:23.899
george w bush's

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:26.240
well i mean obviously not just this but

00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:28.370
people i mean i guess i'm just trying to

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:31.430
say that I always thought despite being

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:33.610
mildly and eloquent a lot of his sound

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:36.709
bites that he got made fun of for are

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:38.329
not necessarily incorrect and known

00:10:36.709 --> 00:10:40.839
unknowns thing was the one that bothered

00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:42.800
me the most because it was like I

00:10:40.839 --> 00:10:44.630
actually agree with that a hundred

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.190
percent but maybe I'm paraphrasing the

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:49.220
quote to make it a little better in my

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:53.089
mind as well also like you know you

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:54.440
can't say this as a politician but you

00:10:53.089 --> 00:10:56.149
said you know a dictatorship would be

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.160
alright as long as I was a dictator I

00:10:56.149 --> 00:11:00.560
think I was just sort of a funny quote

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.269
that has sinister connotations because

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.510
of the era in which it was stated but at

00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:06.800
the same time you know having any of us

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:10.220
thought the same thing that'd be like

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.149
man not always but every once in a while

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.860
you're like things will be so much

00:11:11.149 --> 00:11:18.140
better for me if I was running this show

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:19.910
like there's another this show is in

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:23.779
danger of becoming political at this

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:28.010
point but it's mostly just I find the

00:11:23.779 --> 00:11:30.290
context interesting Rahm Emanuel had a

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:31.790
quote like two years ago I'm basically

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.950
taking this wholesale from the hardcore

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:38.209
history podcast it's that it's something

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:40.339
you can't say but also has like you know

00:11:38.209 --> 00:11:43.220
it's not necessarily a bad quote where

00:11:40.339 --> 00:11:44.870
he said you never let a good catastrophe

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:47.620
er never let a good crisis go to waste

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:49.579
and you know what he's saying is if

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.199
something happens that allows you to

00:11:49.579 --> 00:11:52.430
push your agenda you should take

00:11:51.199 --> 00:11:54.440
advantage of it from a political

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.730
standpoint obviously is the kind of

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.500
thing that happens all the time but it's

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:59.990
just it's a terrible thing to say

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.940
overtly but it you know pulls back the

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:02.779
veil of of what's happening behind the

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.570
scenes

00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:07.160
you know that's originally I thought

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.690
that was like a Julius Caesar quote or

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.580
something

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:11.890
originally let me you know what that's a

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:15.750
good time to Google that never let a

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:15.750
good crisis go to waste

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:23.080
who said no crisis should go to waste

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:26.080
Winston Churchill that's right was

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:31.150
either her Julius Caesar or Winston

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:33.130
Churchill all right and again this was

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:35.020
not in the interest of making the show

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:37.270
political rather just it was making the

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:39.490
show have something to do with politics

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:43.300
for once which is just interesting for

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:45.520
me from a context sort of standpoint I

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:47.200
want to look up the known unknowns focus

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:53.110
maybe I'm not giving it the disservice

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:55.210
it deserves known unknowns quote there

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:58.480
are no no oh it's Donald Rumsfeld as

00:12:55.210 --> 00:13:00.280
well it's not George W Bush reports that

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.450
say something hasn't happened are always

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.550
interesting to me because as we know

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:05.350
there are known knowns the things we

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:07.240
know we know we also know there are

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:09.010
known unknowns that is to say we know

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.930
there are some things we do not know but

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:12.850
there are also unknown unknowns the ones

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.870
we don't know we don't know and if one

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:15.520
looks throughout the history of our

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:17.580
country and other free countries it's

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:21.730
the latter category that tends to be

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:25.330
difficult ones to that phrase although

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:27.610
perhaps used to push an agenda is I

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.720
think technically true but I might be in

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.680
over my head at this point I'm just

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:35.320
looking at it from a linguistic

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:36.820
standpoint and I guess like putting it

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.680
through like a scientific lens as well

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.940
that's a really interesting quote to

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:43.380
think about I'm pulling back the the

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:45.610
ironic veil of northernlion right now

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:47.740
and now it's like people are going to be

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:51.580
like NL's personal hero is Donald

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:55.300
Rumsfeld absolutely not true my personal

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:57.880
hero was Sam Raimi as long as you

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:59.350
ignored 2007 and just like pretend that

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:01.180
spider-man 3 doesn't exist instead

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:05.880
imagine that he just went straight from

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:05.880
like spider-man 2 to drag me to hell

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:11.080
admittedly it's a little bit of verbal

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.430
spaghetti but at the same time I can't

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.780
find my way out of this topic of

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:16.990
conversation when I talk about verbal

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:18.339
spaghetti anyway there's something we

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:24.029
can all get behind

00:14:18.339 --> 00:14:26.649
Ligeti except for me I feel like I

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:30.009
spaghetti is a more divisive topic than

00:14:26.649 --> 00:14:36.339
the merit of that quote and the reason

00:14:30.009 --> 00:14:37.449
is the reason is everybody loves

00:14:36.339 --> 00:14:38.319
spaghetti except me and I don't

00:14:37.449 --> 00:14:43.509
understand it

00:14:38.319 --> 00:14:45.790
I think I've just never had masterpiece

00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:47.769
theater level ten out of ten spaghetti

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:49.629
please give me a spirit heart I really

00:14:47.769 --> 00:14:53.790
could use it at this point in my life

00:14:49.629 --> 00:14:57.089
I'll take a steam sale but I haven't

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:58.410
you've witnessed a serious evolution of

00:14:57.089 --> 00:15:00.550
northernlion

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:03.970
if you've been watching these videos for

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:06.160
long enough you know back in 2012 the

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:08.230
2011 let's say when these videos for

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:12.779
Isaak first started I had probably

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:18.249
consumed pasta a little dicey there

00:15:12.779 --> 00:15:22.029
maybe like less than a dozen times in my

00:15:18.249 --> 00:15:24.759
adult life sincerely and I'm like I

00:15:22.029 --> 00:15:26.439
don't like spaghetti it mostly came from

00:15:24.759 --> 00:15:28.660
a place of ignorance I really didn't

00:15:26.439 --> 00:15:30.610
like pasta that much and I still did

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:32.170
this day almost always prefer other

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:35.980
carbohydrates but I have eaten a lot

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:38.290
more pasta now my wife enjoys Italian

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.790
food so if it's a special occasion

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:43.209
sometimes we'll go to a nice Italian

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:45.399
restaurant and that involves pasta

00:15:43.209 --> 00:15:46.629
showing up sometimes you know and then I

00:15:45.399 --> 00:15:50.410
you didn't I go that's actually pretty

00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:52.929
good and even at home like make like a

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:54.370
sausage penne or a chicken Francois or

00:15:52.929 --> 00:15:56.470
chicken Francaise I don't know I think

00:15:54.370 --> 00:16:00.009
we I think we've Canadian eyes chicken

00:15:56.470 --> 00:16:02.410
Francois up here or chicken Francaise to

00:16:00.009 --> 00:16:07.540
make a chicken Francois but anyway I'm

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:11.259
very into those I love ravioli I love

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:13.179
you know penne linguini spaghettini the

00:16:11.259 --> 00:16:15.279
weird like North Italian

00:16:13.179 --> 00:16:18.490
irregular pasta that I can never

00:16:15.279 --> 00:16:20.949
remember the name of but I'm just silly

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:22.449
even a little lasagna which you

00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:24.850
shouldn't strike you as too surprised

00:16:22.449 --> 00:16:26.500
because I know it's beloved but for me

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:28.809
lasagna was like the hurdle I was like I

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:30.519
really get it's like a weird deep-dish

00:16:28.809 --> 00:16:32.019
Pizza sort of thing that I don't fully

00:16:30.519 --> 00:16:32.529
understand but I've gotten over and

00:16:32.019 --> 00:16:33.730
there's been

00:16:32.529 --> 00:16:36.639
Nani's that I've had where I'm like this

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:39.999
is pretty great at least we got secret

00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:42.490
room access here but spaghetti I've

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:46.810
never had like a ten out of ten

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:51.069
spaghetti and we still have no you know

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:54.399
what check it out that was so not worth

00:16:51.069 --> 00:16:56.699
it but also hilarious I've never had I

00:16:54.399 --> 00:17:02.350
think a ten out of ten spaghetti that

00:16:56.699 --> 00:17:05.110
made me respect the pasta I think I

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:07.419
missed out on the childhood of spaghetti

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:09.339
where you eat a lot of it and then you

00:17:07.419 --> 00:17:11.020
come to like enjoy the taste of it even

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:12.640
if it's not ten out of ten so you oh

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:14.199
this is like I'm not trying to say that

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.880
your love of spaghetti is a lie if you

00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:17.319
love spaghetti rather what I'm saying is

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.850
if you eat a lot of something you become

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:21.429
familiar with it you become able to

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:24.760
recognize the good stuff which I can't

00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:26.350
really so I might just be deadened with

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.990
respect to my senses when it comes to

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:30.549
spaghetti which would be a dang shame

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:32.080
there's no question about it okay we got

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:36.549
to get five cents back here come on come

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:38.250
on come on let's freakin go take the map

00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:41.200
go along with that

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:42.880
and as a result of missing out on that I

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:45.159
think that I've left myself like

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.720
basically my spaghetti senses are

00:17:45.159 --> 00:17:51.730
deadened I can't I can't respect

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:54.010
spaghetti I wish I could maybe one day

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:56.620
I'll get there that'll be the the cruel

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:58.780
joke of nature is that I'll have a son

00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:02.830
he'll look exactly like my hero Donald

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:05.289
Rumsfeld and then every meal will be

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:07.390
like cook me spaghetti and I'm like son

00:18:05.289 --> 00:18:09.039
you're not you know to stand on Allan or

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:10.960
cook the noodles for can I just make you

00:18:09.039 --> 00:18:13.510
sick can't just make you a mother sauce

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:15.429
instead can I just make you a chili

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:18.370
Chili's kind of like spaghetti with no

00:18:15.429 --> 00:18:21.789
noodles there would be noodles no I want

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:27.450
spaghetti all right Donald you're gonna

00:18:21.789 --> 00:18:31.030
have a spaghetti I'm sorry Christopher

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:33.520
okay this is a weird episode man this is

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:34.750
normally your your like and now could

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.430
you get to the point where you say like

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:38.080
hey your brains fried from recording so

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:39.250
much Isaac and this is going to be the

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:42.100
last episode of the day because you're

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:43.690
broken not this is like the third Isaac

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:47.320
episode of what promises to be a long

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:51.910
day recording Isaac so we're off the

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:55.390
freakin rails already praised you know

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:57.790
the 2004 era Bush administration no like

00:18:55.390 --> 00:19:00.280
did it we're making it a joke at this

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:05.080
point but all I'm saying is for all the

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:08.350
things to roast them over that quote it

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:09.880
makes me mad because even if I don't

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:12.400
understand it like please don't talk

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:16.170
about this again I feel like the quote

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:20.410
makes sense maybe it was used to justify

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:24.309
something that doesn't make sense but I

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:29.140
think if we forget who said it and we

00:19:24.309 --> 00:19:31.179
just go you know look you talk about the

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:32.170
concept of unknown unknowns and known

00:19:31.179 --> 00:19:36.570
unknowns

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:38.950
I actually feel there's a nugget of

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:41.800
self-awareness in there that I respect a

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:44.940
lot it's like the spirit of Sciences is

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:47.020
known unknowns and unknown unknowns

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.910
there's things that we don't know that

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:50.500
we can actively you know structure

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:53.230
experiments are trying to find out why

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:54.730
don't I say we as if you know me and the

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:56.920
other scientists they just invite me

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:59.050
along because I'm a preternatural talent

00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:00.340
but you know they you can structure

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:01.570
experiments to try to find out stuff

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.980
about other stuff that we can't even

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:05.170
conceive of yet of course now the

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:07.179
justification was not used for a magical

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:10.750
like you know human nature sort of thing

00:20:07.179 --> 00:20:12.700
but even at the time I was like the

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:17.890
quote strikes me as not being as

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:19.929
roustabout but again it comes down to

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:21.940
both sides as well like the whole Howard

00:20:19.929 --> 00:20:26.890
Dean thing is I oh my god Lee Howard

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:29.530
Dean got torn apart in the media because

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:30.910
he got excited he won a primary and then

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:32.260
we're and we're gonna go to Idaho we're

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:33.700
gonna go to Colorado I'm never gonna go

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:36.790
to Washington take back the White House

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:38.600
woo you know he made them Italy so my

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:43.399
man it's a weird sound

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:50.570
don't get me wrong but you know this a

00:20:43.399 --> 00:20:52.820
different era I see the reason I don't

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:54.769
like Howard Dean is gone on record many

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:56.389
times saying to first names

00:20:54.769 --> 00:20:58.870
can't trust anybody with two first names

00:20:56.389 --> 00:20:58.870
ooh

00:20:58.909 --> 00:21:04.190
we don't have Gympie this read hard

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:06.529
please give me a spirit heart out of it

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:13.490
I mean we got to be a little cautious

00:21:06.529 --> 00:21:15.889
here no doubt apparently my idea of

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:18.860
caution is giving up like half my HP to

00:21:15.889 --> 00:21:25.159
that situation right there but what do

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:30.259
you got for me okay I mean this is like

00:21:25.159 --> 00:21:32.269
I've created this monster but the the

00:21:30.259 --> 00:21:36.519
general gist of this is that I probably

00:21:32.269 --> 00:21:39.559
should not have to worry about our HP

00:21:36.519 --> 00:21:44.389
like a couple of waves deep here watch

00:21:39.559 --> 00:21:51.830
out for enemies that shoot beams and

00:21:44.389 --> 00:21:55.000
apart from that stay far far away wait

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:55.000
for red hearts to drop

00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:02.980
this is our nightmares an enemy that

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:05.730
shoots beams Wow combined with an enemy

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.730
that disappears

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.270
he's done it

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:32.320
just waiting on these red hearts dude we

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.760
got 1.02 luck I don't believe the game

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:44.220
will allow us to never get another

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:47.350
consumable but I'm like honestly very

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:50.380
frightened about this situation but it's

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:54.160
so obviously like a net positive in the

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:56.200
long term if we can just get a spirit

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.360
hard to keep ourselves alive or even

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.760
some red hearts to keep ourselves alive

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:03.400
for the time being like it's actually

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:06.240
like tech X is a ten out of ten pickup

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:08.830
the only reason it's dicey is because I

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:12.430
mean the obvious sight thing okay two

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:14.140
enemies would shoot beams as well the

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:18.010
only reason is dicey at all is because

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:20.230
of the the lack of HP that it's left us

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:24.970
with you know in them in the present

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:26.470
moment we can get to spirit art so this

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:33.340
goes from like a three out of ten

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:35.830
survivability to a ten out of ten what

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:37.420
are you I'm you look stronger always put

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:40.470
on like a Robert Redford voice for that

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:44.530
I don't understand first off because

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:46.710
that's just like American right uncle

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:46.710
voice

00:23:53.260 --> 00:24:01.040
American great-uncle my favorite Kanye

00:23:55.640 --> 00:24:05.960
West song mmm take me to Cusco I wanna

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:09.250
eat buffet I really want to let you read

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:15.559
you will take me far away from here

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:17.210
American uncle to see that is more

00:24:15.559 --> 00:24:19.160
impressive than you would expect because

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:21.049
it's got heard American girl like four

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:24.110
times in my entire life believe it or

00:24:21.049 --> 00:24:28.610
not I know it's a very popular song or

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:32.630
was eight years ago and one of those

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:36.309
times was Dan Gees lling doing it at

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:42.040
karaoke so not necessarily

00:24:36.309 --> 00:24:45.350
representative of the of the song

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:48.140
completely not that I would do any

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:49.669
better I'm just saying dude I need no

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:55.220
consumables huh that's the kind of boss

00:24:49.669 --> 00:25:00.820
freshness is going to be we've been hit

00:24:55.220 --> 00:25:06.230
once which is completely acceptable if

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:09.380
we just hadn't gone down like 0hp dare I

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:11.210
suggest like that we deserve more credit

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:12.890
for playing a video game certainly

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:17.720
that's an absurd thing to begin with

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:19.820
here but like we had no reason to double

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.440
down on making this already incredibly

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:24.169
strong run any stronger

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:25.850
I've done it for entertainments sake and

00:25:24.169 --> 00:25:31.100
it may come back to bite me in the butt

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:35.080
so again I'm not saying like oh you guys

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:39.230
you know you owe me all I'm saying is

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:45.470
recognize that this is a bit of an

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:47.780
exceptional scenario and I sincerely

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:51.049
can't believe we've got no consumables

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:54.260
we did all of boss rush and got no heart

00:25:51.049 --> 00:26:00.110
it's really really bad because it means

00:25:54.260 --> 00:26:02.929
if we get a hit once we'll die so the

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:05.830
boss fights are probably two are like

00:26:02.929 --> 00:26:12.049
lower right here

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:16.159
we gotta like try to bomb our way

00:26:12.049 --> 00:26:20.179
through know so we got to do the big

00:26:16.159 --> 00:26:21.739
room I'll be straight up with you I'm

00:26:20.179 --> 00:26:24.049
like 50/50 we're going to die on this

00:26:21.739 --> 00:26:35.389
floor if we don't die on this floor we

00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:38.539
will probably win the run but like I

00:26:35.389 --> 00:26:41.590
have never seen or at least recently

00:26:38.539 --> 00:26:44.989
have not seen a run be so uncooperative

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:48.559
the most common consumable has not shown

00:26:44.989 --> 00:26:59.450
up given like 18 opportunities so black

00:26:48.559 --> 00:27:03.350
room is fantastic come on come on come

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:04.730
on though that was actually frightening

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:09.830
so that you know what good learning

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:14.299
lessons don't don't take these enemies

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:14.960
for granted dude I know you're going to

00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:19.450
hook me up

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:19.450
you can't not hook me up

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:26.490
can't be a bad it can't be bailed bad

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:29.580
bill at this point we should go back

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:30.150
hopefully not a greed fight didn't mean

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:35.400
to be here

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:37.980
oh I've squandered this there a second

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.659
one there is we've made through the hard

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:42.059
part

00:27:38.659 --> 00:27:44.600
it's a greed fight dude I'm being

00:27:42.059 --> 00:27:47.460
straight up with you this run is cruel

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:55.110
thank you we need it that's not for you

00:27:47.460 --> 00:28:09.419
not yet one of these days but not right

00:27:55.110 --> 00:28:11.159
now he deflected off the edge if I may

00:28:09.419 --> 00:28:14.010
take the opportunity to complain about a

00:28:11.159 --> 00:28:19.850
run that has tech X and mom's knife do

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:22.320
want to point out we do have 3.75 damage

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:24.929
3.75 damage with mom's knife is not

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.279
equal to 3.75 damage without mom's knife

00:28:24.929 --> 00:28:28.200
it's like that you know

00:28:26.279 --> 00:28:30.659
oh my rate of fire is 20 but I have

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:32.640
chocolate milk you know it's still way

00:28:30.659 --> 00:28:35.580
way way better than normal but never at

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:38.610
4.18 this is well below average

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:41.429
mom's knife or not the fact that we can

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:45.779
spam these shots so quickly is worth a

00:28:41.429 --> 00:28:51.750
lot as well this will definitely not be

00:28:45.779 --> 00:28:54.000
a hush fight this gendron's going

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:55.740
straight up here and I'm still I mean I

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.809
did say if we live there's a great

00:28:55.740 --> 00:29:01.559
chance we're going to win the entire run

00:28:57.809 --> 00:29:03.659
and I still believe that but it's not

00:29:01.559 --> 00:29:06.480
like we we picked up a ton of help there

00:29:03.659 --> 00:29:07.980
I mean even the next red heart as far as

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.149
I'm concerned should go to me and then

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.500
at that point we'll start giving them

00:29:09.149 --> 00:29:11.850
back to dark bomb which which only

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.500
exists because it can be in conception

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:15.419
to begin with but it's like a rare

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:18.179
situation in which can be in conception

00:29:15.419 --> 00:29:21.620
into dark bomb is anything but like at

00:29:18.179 --> 00:29:21.620
least eight out of ten

00:29:23.899 --> 00:29:29.759
the room is actually really easy and I'm

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.929
saying that predominantly because I just

00:29:29.759 --> 00:29:31.889
made it through without getting hit

00:29:30.929 --> 00:29:36.210
otherwise they'll be singing a different

00:29:31.889 --> 00:29:37.019
tune with lyrics change to represent the

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:41.759
fact that we're playing The Binding of

00:29:37.019 --> 00:29:43.109
Isaac but I still think you know if you

00:29:41.759 --> 00:29:44.879
just sit back and take a second there

00:29:43.109 --> 00:29:46.769
that rooms not so bad we do have 1.5

00:29:44.879 --> 00:29:49.249
speed though it's a little bit on the

00:29:46.769 --> 00:29:52.889
lower side of speed it might be a

00:29:49.249 --> 00:29:59.460
different situation this is an asteroid

00:29:52.889 --> 00:30:01.289
I can't span the shots as often as you

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:03.359
think I'm not sure if it's like there's

00:30:01.289 --> 00:30:06.960
some kind of deleterious moms knife plus

00:30:03.359 --> 00:30:08.519
tech X thing going on but it's not as

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.989
easy as just tap shooting the tap

00:30:08.519 --> 00:30:12.269
shooting is not working we are rate of

00:30:09.989 --> 00:30:14.429
fire might be like slightly too slow it

00:30:12.269 --> 00:30:15.359
attacks you here but you're probably

00:30:14.429 --> 00:30:17.429
right if you're watching this you're

00:30:15.359 --> 00:30:21.389
going why is this dude not taking

00:30:17.429 --> 00:30:23.489
advantage of the fact that he has the

00:30:21.389 --> 00:30:26.849
ability to spam these tech X shots you

00:30:23.489 --> 00:30:28.289
are probably getting pretty close to the

00:30:26.849 --> 00:30:30.479
meat of the issue when it comes to our

00:30:28.289 --> 00:30:33.330
DPS I think the other part of the issue

00:30:30.479 --> 00:30:34.379
here is that well there's two parts one

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:35.669
is that we want to hey with mom's knife

00:30:34.379 --> 00:30:36.960
because it also does a lot of damage so

00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:38.789
if we can get the best of both worlds

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:41.570
it's good but the other part is just

00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:45.749
that our raw damage is kind of think

00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:48.749
it's like a Limburger that was the go to

00:30:45.749 --> 00:30:50.489
stink I was the go-to stinky cheese when

00:30:48.749 --> 00:30:52.469
I was a kid watching cartoons was it

00:30:50.489 --> 00:30:59.759
probably X tilde now back in the day was

00:30:52.469 --> 00:31:01.440
like lamb burger April all right we want

00:30:59.759 --> 00:31:03.809
a black rune everything get out of here

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:07.969
good damage up I mean we knew they were

00:31:03.809 --> 00:31:11.639
going to be stats up so it's nice but

00:31:07.969 --> 00:31:14.359
now 6.18 damage which is like almost

00:31:11.639 --> 00:31:14.359
pretty good

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:21.049
and again 6.18 damage with mom's knife

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:22.940
is like you know 15 damage without it

00:31:21.049 --> 00:31:26.899
it's a half heart so it belongs to me

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:33.019
and our boss fight is it seems to be in

00:31:26.899 --> 00:31:35.059
a pretty obvious location here just down

00:31:33.019 --> 00:31:37.309
at the bottom left this was such a weird

00:31:35.059 --> 00:31:40.580
run because I asked for a difficult run

00:31:37.309 --> 00:31:42.140
it didn't really deliver like that we

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:47.179
have two of the strongest items in the

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:49.010
game combined so like I'm not at all

00:31:47.179 --> 00:31:50.630
complaining plus we have our bomb one of

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:51.110
like the best defensive items in the

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:53.690
game

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:56.360
Bar None and yet still I find myself

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:58.850
being like why are we not steamrolling I

00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:02.090
think we just we had like deceptively

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:04.760
bad stats but the run was not bad I put

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:07.070
it in a bad spot I wouldn't say

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:10.159
intentionally but I put it in a bad spot

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:11.570
by taking tech X which we didn't need

00:32:10.159 --> 00:32:14.059
but it added a nice little like

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:15.590
long-range factor I just if you had told

00:32:14.059 --> 00:32:18.919
me that taking tech X would have meant

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:20.360
we'd never get a spirit heart again like

00:32:18.919 --> 00:32:21.950
if you told us I mean it's not like

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:24.620
there's causalities ever if you've told

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:26.090
us that after taking tech X we'd never

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:28.820
get another spirit heart I wouldn't have

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:31.909
taken I would have been justifiably

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:33.649
frightened and so it might not look like

00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:37.070
it but we did have to play relatively

00:32:33.649 --> 00:32:38.840
well to bring this run to what seemed to

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:41.860
be as obvious conclusion like it's

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.860
prophesied victory

00:32:43.659 --> 00:32:50.210
we might get a payout in fact I think

00:32:47.559 --> 00:32:52.220
we're essentially guaranteed to payout

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:54.649
might not be a spirit hard but the game

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:57.049
does to make a lot like to make a liar

00:32:54.649 --> 00:32:59.679
out of me why did that symptoms come out

00:32:57.049 --> 00:32:59.679
so strangely

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:06.640
dude this happened so frequently getting

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:08.890
Eden's blessing at the very end of a run

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:10.750
and it's so nice because now you go you

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:12.900
know what I'm excited for the next Eden

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:12.900
run

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:26.440
start with a little extra value and no

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:27.970
void another fast one but this one was

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.170
scary I hope you enjoyed it if you did
