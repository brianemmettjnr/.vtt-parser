##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.000
everybody welcome back it's the binding

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.540
of issac have you heard of this game

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.910
jeez came out of nowhere

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.250
six years ago and we're back we're

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.080
playing we did not just do an Iran

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.789
literally in the last run let's do the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.150
rare northernlion go check goes to check

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.800
this would be this episode right here

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.150
hey everybody welcome back and on the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.019
line plays The Binding of Isaac an

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.610
afterbirth plus we're playing pretty

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.250
well guys sounds like a frickin idiot

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.440
but we've also knows Judas laughter I

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.219
was two runs ago in which we had that

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:45.360
Eva anyway here's our seed FMF eh oh

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:49.250
just fudge my fudge and apple what did

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.140
you think I was going to say three l4g

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.539
you ever get 4G on your telephone these

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.030
days I don't the way I'm going with this

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:03.059
bit we have LTE like everywhere in

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.430
Vancouver when I went home a couple of

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.890
places I know it's the indignity but I

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.070
got 4G and I'm like why are these gifts

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.040
loading very slightly more slowly this

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:20.790
is an outrage of the highest order that

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:23.850
I can't possibly comprehend room I don't

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.560
know how long I think because you know I

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.299
think it's got a lot of mechanics to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.509
learn alright and a lot of it is like

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.490
edge case but now manushya like oh once

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.490
every 100 item rooms you get a choice of

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.610
items and once every 300 item rooms you

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.470
get two items guaranteed that I looked

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.270
at this and I said which one of these

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.530
two would I rather have when in reality

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.899
I should have looked at it and said

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.479
suite 2 items that are both kind of not

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.979
that good it might seem like I'm coming

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.549
across negatively here that's not my

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.670
intention you know I'm not intended to

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:01.110
be a negative person here when you get

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:04.799
two items I'll admit little Gertie is

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.090
not that bad shows off the physics

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.030
engine of the game to the highest

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.860
possible order obviously and beyond that

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.239
the run is actually fine because of you

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.250
know

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.629
first off two items even if they weren't

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.019
that good that's better than average and

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:19.430
oh I bet we can sneak that in there he

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:24.500
goes over top of the rocks we got a

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:26.719
spectral dirty dude that's actually like

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.569
probably not worth that much but still

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:31.040
interesting to think about on a room

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.950
like this normally you've got to you

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.230
know really get your hands dirty now

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.530
mind you the real problem is that dirty

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.340
does like next to no damage but oh we

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.159
almost had it

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:51.470
he's mad are you like sincerely I just

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:54.019
need you to actually murder anything at

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:58.219
all really okay you guys are all in a

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:00.109
line this is perfect just get low went

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:02.209
on the flow so let the kids know when I

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.790
bus parental discretion is a must that's

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.510
a little known from Straight Outta

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.519
Compton

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.269
it Straight Outta Compton so it's a

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.040
weird album because everybody remembers

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.560
you know the obvious ones off of it you

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.970
know forget the police come and straight

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.709
out the underground and then various

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.269
other lyrics I wouldn't deign to say on

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:25.909
the show okay I like that a lot I would

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:30.109
love to get some bombs here but it also

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:31.790
has like and of course F the police wait

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.199
sorry I'm thinking I'd said F the police

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.060
twice there's also straight out of

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:37.129
Compton in which again Ice Cube

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.680
threatens to eat a police officer which

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:41.810
is like a far cry from where he exists

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.239
in his career at this day and age in the

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.040
20 X Jump Street movies but anyway down

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.349
to the next floor there's also some

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.069
weird like late 80s early 90s like

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:54.939
salt-n-pepa's style dance club bangers

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:59.629
attempted on there is really like a

00:03:54.939 --> 00:04:01.250
strange menagerie of cultural aspects

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.599
from that time period anyway I don't

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.680
know I was like 2 when it came out so

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:08.239
what do I know about the time period

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.090
obviously we're going to be using a

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.889
razor blade now they've gotten a little

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.849
bit more HP the run is starting to pop I

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:18.560
never I think internalized that Eve has

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:21.079
2.63 damage if you don't get a Whore of

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.310
Babylon to pop it basically sets you

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:27.560
back like one

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.560
extra damage upgrade from where you

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.060
would like to go that's going to hurt

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:36.770
from where you would like to be most of

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:40.100
the time on a spawn is what I mean so it

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.690
would be swell if we could you know mix

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.610
this situation up a little bit it also

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.470
might be nice if we could get like a

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.730
single bomb I do want to use the razor

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.850
blade but I kind of want to save it

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:53.780
until a room that warranted and I think

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.160
this room warrants it if we play our

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.280
cards right we might be able to use High

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.250
Priestess to get that tinted rock but

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.720
there's also an explosive champion here

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.910
regardless so if we can just like kill

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.400
him last or at least kill him in a

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.100
productive fashion I'll be happy with

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.830
that come on

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.940
slicker we're not buying schedule or

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:19.160
anything like that but it's a weird

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:22.310
start just in terms of like oh my god

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:25.370
dead bird screwed me it's a weird start

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.200
just in terms of like the lack of pace

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.050
at which we can kill these enemies kind

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.440
of like a million percent my own fault

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:36.020
for starting at or keeping myself below

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:42.200
the Whore of Babylon state but so be an

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:44.480
acid baby merely okay anyway I thought

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.490
I'd I've been grasping at tangents here

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.480
I've been trying to figure out you know

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.580
what I'm going to talk about in these

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.800
episodes there's no planning surprise

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.480
surprise that goes into these Isaac

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.400
episodes I kind of like to figure it out

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.980
on the fly you know it's it's very much

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.140
like a the way I approach it from a

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.210
philosophical standpoint which is a word

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.470
that is way too large for the you know

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.960
manner of situation in which we're

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.300
discussing here let's go back for the

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.230
attempted rock um it's like a natural

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:14.090
organic conversation you know I like to

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:17.630
tease some threads out and then see how

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:20.780
they look and feel after after you talk

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.700
about them for a minute I went to the

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.080
movies last night this is a true story I

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.850
know it's hard to believe but I went to

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.830
the movies last night would you see

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.620
advanced screening of spider-man

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.000
homecoming nope not that important like

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.470
I'm not important enough to get the

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.720
radio station to give me free tickets to

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.110
that I promise you yeah we can make do

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.700
with take

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.930
it's not the way we should have done it

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.290
but it's not a huge deal and both of

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:44.570
these are great um obviously you saw a

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:47.600
baby driver right now I should've gotten

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.320
that I can fly after that no I didn't

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.610
see baby driver

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.710
Wonder Woman then you've been talking

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.030
about seeing it you know you said some

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.950
not so nice things about the DC

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.660
Cinematic Universe and now you're gonna

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.430
you know finally give them a chance nope

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.980
that's your assuming I'm a bigger person

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.540
than I actually am I saw guardians of

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.880
the galaxy to which has been in theaters

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:08.840
for like two months but we finally saw

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:11.270
it and we're kind of like I wouldn't say

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:14.180
we're Marvel super fans like sometimes I

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:16.010
go to the Marvel Studios subreddit which

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:19.580
is the subreddit for all things Marvel

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:21.530
and I go I don't know what these people

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:24.080
are talking about whenever any good news

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.170
happens everyone goes praise Feige and I

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.370
go alright so I know that he's like the

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:30.470
executive producer on these movies but I

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:32.720
didn't know he was like the brainchild

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:35.570
you know he's like the J Bennett from

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.430
the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot era of Wilco

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.460
see that's a reference that as I was

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:43.580
making it I was like this is not gonna

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:46.370
really be that universally understood

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:48.020
and that's my fault that should have

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:53.390
been a more accessible reference it's

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:55.430
like that one guy from The Hold Steady

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.420
with the moustache and then they left

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.250
the band they came out with another

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:00.350
album and you're like ass it's not quite

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:02.090
the same without the roar and piano

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:03.740
kicks that might even be less of an

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:07.970
accessible reference I'm sorry I'm

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:10.340
trying to work backwards here anyway but

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:12.140
I like the Marvel movies I also I

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.820
understand why people turn up their nose

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.560
of them because there's some extent

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:18.050
they're very safe but they're also like

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:24.410
I don't I kind of see the Marvel movies

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:26.930
as like a sports car is like I whenever

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:30.890
I watch it at this point and this is how

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:32.720
you know I'm too old to be into

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:35.330
superheroes I don't watch it and go like

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.070
oh I wonder how they're going to put fan

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:40.310
outs in this upcoming movie I watch this

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:42.770
and I go oh my god who were the project

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:46.250
managers on this because this is like a

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:47.990
four hundred million dollar project with

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.490
people who are at like the height of

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.680
their careers

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:53.870
like you're not we're not just talking I

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:56.540
think we can we can't get over there

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:57.830
wait a minute no I do have empty vessel

00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:00.080
I just need to lose HP to make it work

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:02.839
that's correct okay you know we're not

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:05.620
just talking actors talking special

00:09:02.839 --> 00:09:08.300
effects the agents of the actors

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:10.339
caterers you know working with the

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:13.750
people at the the studio Lots and stuff

00:09:10.339 --> 00:09:13.750
like there's a staggering amount of

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.350
administration that goes into making a

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:22.070
movie like this and then beyond that the

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:23.810
actual you know talent it's it's just a

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:25.520
staggering project to kind of conceive

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:27.770
of so I watch it and there's a scene

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.270
where there's like at this is not a

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:31.550
spoiler but the opening scene of the

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:34.070
movie is effectively like an action set

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:36.890
piece with the soundtrack from the 1970s

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:39.110
overtop of it and like the huge CGI

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:40.670
that's happening up close and personal

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:42.910
and then also more of it happening in

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:46.690
the background and how like this is like

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:49.899
incredible just on a logistics level

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:52.760
that you you basically spent like

00:09:49.899 --> 00:09:54.529
probably like 20 to 30 million dollars

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.540
well I don't know that let's be honest

00:09:54.529 --> 00:09:59.540
but you spent upwards of several million

00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:01.130
dollars on what is effectively like 90

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.110
seconds of entertainment that's

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:04.700
incredible

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:07.100
like and and also the movie itself was

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:10.040
pretty okay I got to be honest it's

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:14.870
probably the least I've enjoyed a Marvel

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:16.580
film people by the way I hate they say

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:19.550
it got to be honest before giving their

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:21.470
opinion it's not like you know I'm

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.490
assuming that I'm right I know a lot of

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:23.600
people really like guardians of the

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.220
galaxy too but a lot of people are the

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.870
same criticisms that I'm about to say

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:29.180
it's probably the least

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:34.730
I've enjoyed Marvel Studios films since

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:36.620
maybe I don't know like The Avengers 2

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:39.560
or Ant Man which I both also thought

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:42.589
were like pretty good but not certainly

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:44.360
not quite like Civil War level Logan

00:10:42.589 --> 00:10:48.140
level of course but anyway the point is

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:50.180
I thought it was pretty good but that's

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.860
about it I think I'm going to stick with

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.270
the razor blade because let's be honest

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.579
Krampus his head is just sort of boring

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:58.220
at this point but there's more to this

00:10:55.579 --> 00:11:00.709
theater story first off movies been in

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:03.200
theaters for like seven weeks we went

00:11:00.709 --> 00:11:04.820
inside 10/10 show

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.990
late although I guess you know school's

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.150
out and we live in a major city

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:10.430
relatively speaking

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:13.430
oh you think Vancouver's a major city

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:15.500
well I live in kowloon walled city in

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:18.220
downtown Hong Kong and I'm okay see like

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:20.690
I just I'm trying to nip the armchair

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:24.740
you know demographic studies in the back

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:26.290
here or in the but I should say theater

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.730
was packed

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:30.680
unbelievably packed even the people were

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:34.250
sitting in the front rows I was amazed

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:36.770
it was cheap night Tuesdays it only

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:39.410
costs you an arm to go see it wait let's

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:40.100
do that in the Jay Leno voice hey Kevin

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:42.380
do you hear that

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.550
they're instituting cheap nights at AMC

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.970
theaters across the country

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:48.710
oh yeah Jay yeah turns out if you want

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:52.240
to go see a movie on Tuesdays it'll just

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:56.200
cost you a leg a leg

00:11:52.240 --> 00:12:00.800
Alaura okay you get the idea

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:03.020
packed and then also I saw one of the

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.820
wives let me let me turn this into a bit

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.800
so I immediately when I walk into a

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.720
movie theater I look for my nemesis and

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.250
I found them but they weren't nemesis

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.280
they were nemesis because there were two

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:15.890
of them it was two guys and I'm gonna be

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:18.200
honest you look like oh my god Epps and

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:20.660
nasty I'm excited you look like my kind

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.160
of demographic like you you look like

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:24.860
there's a decent you probably don't

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:26.510
watch me but you probably look down on

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.790
people that watch markiplier that's what

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:30.320
I'm saying just from a from a numbers

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:32.180
standpoint you probably have absolutely

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.590
no idea who I am and that's fine but you

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.850
look like the kind of people who would

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:36.050
know something about what's going on

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.400
with YouTube you're the kind of people

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:37.760
would be like hey did you see like you

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.220
know

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:43.190
sips video last week and that's not

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:44.690
meant as a shot at all better content

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:46.880
creator than myself I'm not taking epic

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:48.650
fetus that's tempting

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.620
so if but if you do know who I am and

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:53.480
you hear this recognize that my entire

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:55.370
purpose in life is to turn social

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:57.380
slights that are minor into bits that

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.970
you know spin them out to be a little

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:00.980
bit more major so everybody gets their

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:03.650
turn on the guillotine no no one more so

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:04.820
than myself but anyway they were student

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:06.500
right next to us and when we were

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:08.560
walking up to get to our seats the Star

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:11.030
Wars Episode 8 trailer was playing and

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:14.210
as soon as the music went down and they

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:16.610
went hear the music or this is the the

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:20.720
Lucasfilm splash came up

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:23.420
and it goes very returned and they

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:25.760
really loudly went oh it's Spaceballs

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:28.640
too and then they laughed like beavis

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.980
and butt-head and then the other one

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.529
that was with him said may the Schwartz

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:36.110
be with you and I said to myself man you

00:13:33.529 --> 00:13:38.480
guys are way too much like me when I was

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:42.110
19 and as a result I hate you but those

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:43.850
guys ended up being like a mini-boss I

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:45.320
didn't even realize they'd watch the

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:46.550
movie relatively quietly they were

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:50.149
having a fun time and I don't begrudge

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:51.410
them their their nice date together see

00:13:50.149 --> 00:13:53.029
that was a joke that was steeped in

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:57.200
ignorance but at the same time it felt

00:13:53.029 --> 00:13:58.880
good to say ah now you can have a

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.500
mandate there's nothing special

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:04.240
governments get all the time apparently

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:07.880
but what I'm trying to say here is then

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:09.890
there's a lady dead center of the

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.450
theater Primo's seat right we got to

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:16.130
show up early so we can get those seats

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:20.810
she's on her cellular telephone during

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:21.800
the trailers not okay in my book but I'm

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:24.230
not a monster

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:26.420
I've recognized the trailers are not the

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:28.459
movie you might have some you know

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:31.880
circumstances in your life that warrants

00:14:28.459 --> 00:14:32.959
you being on the telephone for an extra

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.310
minute or two maybe you're like hey I

00:14:32.959 --> 00:14:35.810
got to go the movies starting like good

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:37.550
you know text me when you land or

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:39.350
something like that you know or you know

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:40.610
let me know what the doctor says you

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:44.079
know these are important texts that can

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:48.579
happen you like life finds away right

00:14:44.079 --> 00:14:51.709
Marvel Studios logo comes up lights dim

00:14:48.579 --> 00:14:53.420
cellular telephone still on you know the

00:14:51.709 --> 00:14:55.160
actors are engaged in a little bit of a

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.959
flashback scene we're two minutes into

00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:00.500
the movie cellular telephones still on

00:14:56.959 --> 00:15:05.480
like bright and in the middle of the

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:07.070
theater and then somebody just after on

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.050
the shoulders the guys got to the point

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:11.209
is like five minutes in the movie she's

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:13.339
like a 12 rose up for me I just want to

00:15:11.209 --> 00:15:17.120
point out it was not my responsibility

00:15:13.339 --> 00:15:20.120
somebody else was closer but oh that's

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:21.290
going to hurt somebody just tapped her

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:24.620
on the shoulder and I can only imagine

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:27.170
that they said are you out of your you

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:30.430
know F in mine just put the phone away

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:32.500
you psycho and then she put the phone

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:34.180
but she did look back after that as if

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:37.030
to be like I'm going to remember your

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:39.940
face honestly if we had thrown down in

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:42.880
that theater if we had been drafted into

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:43.660
the United Nations Army and they're like

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.760
hey we're going to ship you off to

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.470
Pyongyang right now I would have been

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.820
like I want that guy to be my commanding

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.530
officer I don't know

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:52.840
anybody else in this freaking theater

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:57.130
except for the Schwartz guys but at the

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:59.800
same time by the way clever joke Wow is

00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:01.150
in Star Wars like space balls I remember

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.440
the first time I heard that in the movie

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:04.450
space balls which was you know

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:06.490
deliberately designed to be a parody of

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:09.970
the Star Wars these various ism you know

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:11.680
everybody's aware of space balls now if

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.180
you had been like oh I hope Reb Browns

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.040
in this one I would have been like you

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:18.550
know what these are my people and then

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:20.800
also don't go for the long laugh like

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:23.680
you don't they yell your joke if your

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.970
jokes good just let it blossom there for

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.710
you and your friend you're there for

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:29.050
your friend okay you're not there to be

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:31.930
comedians for the whole theater again

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:32.650
this movie costs no no it's not

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:34.540
necessary

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:38.290
this movie costs like four hundred

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:39.760
million dollars to make how you paid $10

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:42.670
to be in here who do you think I'd

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:45.340
rather listen to the may the Schwartz be

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:48.130
with you guys or the you know the team

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:50.380
of writers who've gotten like 14

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:52.180
consecutive over 80 percents on Rotten

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:54.280
Tomatoes I'm not saying that necessarily

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.870
means they're the greatest filmmakers of

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:59.500
all time just said you know I didn't buy

00:16:55.870 --> 00:17:02.380
a ticket to to 19 year old dudes crack

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.730
jokes anyway but there's still only the

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.350
second where's people in the theater and

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:07.300
they seem to have a good time without

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:09.610
irritating anybody else which I

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:12.220
appreciate at least after the trailers

00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:13.330
in the trailers dude that's like the we

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:16.020
have this thing in Canada called the

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:18.700
young offenders act at least in Ontario

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:20.500
which is basically like as long as your

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.880
crimes not particularly heinous your

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.230
crimes like you know vandalism or

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.100
something like that or you know minor

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:29.380
assault if you're under the age of like

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:31.000
17 you can't be charged for it I don't

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:33.370
know if we should even take this HP at

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.370
this point but I'm gonna we still have

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:37.600
two point six three damage unfortunately

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:41.110
wait I still have razor blade why I've

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:42.270
gotten to off on this on this tangent

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:48.150
here

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:49.620
Wow what a bummer but the point is no I

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:52.830
don't have razor blade I got rid of it

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:55.050
for Gabby's head that's right the point

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:56.880
is that the trailers are the young

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:59.280
offenders act of the movie theater

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:02.040
behavior laws that I will plan if you

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.870
vote me in won't be eligible for 2020 so

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.400
maybe like twenty thirty for assuming we

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:07.380
don't end up on an odd year election

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.790
cycle for whatever reason twenty thirty

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:11.550
four and yes I am talking about the

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:13.830
American leadership after Canada takes

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:18.210
you over which any day now

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:20.070
but the point is if you're as long as

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:22.620
you're not yelling or like defecating

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:25.440
yourself during the trailers no problem

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.940
doesn't bother me once the movie starts

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.850
that's where we enter like you know

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:31.770
should be quiet as a mouse except it's a

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:33.900
laugh and even then you can't laugh too

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:38.700
loudly all right it's Skype corner what

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:41.490
do we got oh there tab he's talking

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:43.590
about dead cells so I don't know if I

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:46.710
it's not like it's sensitive information

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:48.480
but bear said he's had these like 15 to

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:51.090
20 minute dead cells episodes he's had

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.440
trouble posting because they're bad and

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.730
I'm not saying that because I think

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:57.270
they're bad I'm saying because he told

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:58.800
me that but I can relate to that I've

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:02.520
had a lot of dead cells episodes I had

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:04.920
to can because I did poorly but it's the

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.720
problem it's not it's not a huge problem

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.309
by the way terrible damage don't talk to

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.050
me or my damage ever again we're not

00:19:08.309 --> 00:19:11.309
taking that we got to get to the Whore

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:13.350
of Babylon state because it's getting

00:19:11.309 --> 00:19:15.150
ridiculous here somehow we're still

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:18.300
going to make boss rush whether or not

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:23.370
we want to is another thing that remains

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:24.870
to be seen and I mean that told me

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.820
everything I think I needed to know

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:28.880
about the straw there it didn't even

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:32.010
kill those flies in one hit so I'm not

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:35.040
interested although I do like it mostly

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:38.670
I don't think it's a huge problem with

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:39.929
dead cells game design but it well it is

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.250
a problem that tells us a problem with a

00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:44.400
lot of rogue lights let's put it that

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:46.920
way but you either like a lot of your

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.960
run success is based on how quickly you

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:50.760
can get decent equipment and the same

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.190
goes for Isaac you know most of the

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:56.600
losses that I get an Isaac are well yes

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:59.640
sure that horrifying room

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:01.380
and why not that horrifying room with

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.909
all the TNT that I guess you're just

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.710
supposed to walk directly straight down

00:20:02.909 --> 00:20:07.710
in as soon as you see it and then you

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:10.080
will not die which is very nice but then

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:15.289
it's like I firmly believe that in

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:15.289
almost every I succeed like literally in

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:21.840
99% of my succeeds there's a win nestled

00:20:19.169 --> 00:20:24.929
in there and probably even more than 99%

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:28.049
and I'm not using 99% as a shorthand I'm

00:20:24.929 --> 00:20:30.570
genuinely thinking like there might be

00:20:28.049 --> 00:20:33.000
one in a hundred Isaac runs that if you

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:34.080
got like God mode enabled you would get

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.669
to the end of the run and be like

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.669
there's no way you could win this one

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:48.029
occasional like super trainwreck happens

00:20:42.179 --> 00:20:51.809
admittedly well we might not make boss

00:20:48.029 --> 00:20:53.789
rush actually but the most of the losses

00:20:51.809 --> 00:20:55.679
that I have lately at least happened

00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:59.580
because we just don't get to that point

00:20:55.679 --> 00:21:02.159
fast enough I almost want to just take

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:04.080
blue candle because our damage is so bad

00:21:02.159 --> 00:21:05.340
we're going to get a deal with the devil

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:08.850
but if it's Krampus we could go like

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:10.169
three floors without without getting

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:11.820
another deal with the devil if we ever

00:21:10.169 --> 00:21:13.440
get one actually if we get Krampus right

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.210
here we're not guaranteed another deal

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.639
and then we need three hearts of deals

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:21.570
out of it anyway so I'm not going to say

00:21:17.639 --> 00:21:24.090
it's unlikely it'll happen but it is

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:25.289
potentially likely it won't happen but

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:27.269
he would some easements actually helped

00:21:25.289 --> 00:21:28.919
me out a great deal there but dead cells

00:21:27.269 --> 00:21:31.529
is exactly the same if you can get like

00:21:28.919 --> 00:21:33.360
a couple of early scrolls and give

00:21:31.529 --> 00:21:34.980
yourself HP upgrades and then you get

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:40.080
equipment that's not terrible you're

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:40.730
kind of off to the races but most of the

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:43.470
time anyway

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:45.659
I'm also far from a dead cells expert

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:47.309
but once we crack the code once we crack

00:21:45.659 --> 00:21:49.470
the code they released a new update that

00:21:47.309 --> 00:21:50.970
you know scramble the Enigma machine

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:52.500
again that's why you're not supposed to

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:53.990
let them know that you crack the code

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:57.029
haven't you seen the imitation game

00:21:53.990 --> 00:22:00.070
starring Marvel Studios own Benedict

00:21:57.029 --> 00:22:06.790
Cumberbatch great movie

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:09.400
oh this is really good okay so start

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:10.600
like this we're going to give up some

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:16.570
spirit hearts here and I think it's

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:20.010
totally worth it still totally worth it

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:20.010
especially with Nine Lives coming up

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:28.660
there we go

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:30.550
potato peeler so all right we're going

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:32.320
to miss basarov Basara stays open I

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:33.730
think we want to make sure that we're in

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.880
the Whore of Babylon state so first

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:41.680
we're going to take the nail and use it

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:43.930
and then we're going to take this know

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.040
the first thing to take this it's six of

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:46.630
one half a dozen of the other but we'll

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.340
take spirit hearts for this because then

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:52.090
it gives us an easy play a potato peeler

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:54.820
to get us to a second level of that then

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:56.890
I think we'll go with the nail boss rush

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:58.420
did not stay open I was incorrect but

00:22:56.890 --> 00:23:00.430
still an interesting turn of events

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.900
there sure we could have used potato

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:05.470
peeler a little bit more frequently if

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:07.120
we died a lot and I do like that but if

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:10.210
I have tricked you into thinking that

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:12.370
this run is great I have done myself a

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:17.260
disservice because it is still kind of a

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:18.940
little wonky not saying it's a loss it

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.920
actually looks more and more like a win

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:23.050
you know with each passing floor here

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.280
which is the way you want it but if

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:28.690
certainly I don't think it's a

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:32.170
guaranteed win we got six point two six

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:33.580
damage and like a quarter of our damage

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:38.370
upgrades are accounted for by the

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:38.370
freaking potato peeler of all things so

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:45.310
come on come on

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:48.040
well a spirit art pays for us to be here

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:51.310
at least and infested you know it gives

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:53.260
us a little bit of love I am I'm

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:56.830
somewhat passionate about movie theater

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:59.560
etiquette because there's no excuse

00:23:56.830 --> 00:24:01.210
there was an excuse when I was younger

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.860
not that I like I've always been pretty

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:04.480
well-behaved in theaters you know who

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:06.700
hasn't always been well-behaved in

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:10.300
theaters Michael al Fox I'm not going to

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:13.850
blow him up too much but he's been a

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:16.850
movie theater talker from time to time

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:19.280
situations movie theater talker and we

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:21.020
had to you know tap them on the shoulder

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.610
and be like yellow dude come on

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:24.260
you're gonna cause that reflects poorly

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:25.700
on all of us like you're judged as a

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:28.370
group if somebody in your group is

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:30.169
talking to you both people are going to

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:35.750
get judged and perhaps rightly so you

00:24:30.169 --> 00:24:39.289
know it keeps people in line anyway but

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:41.630
now you know movies come out digitally

00:24:39.289 --> 00:24:45.919
so quickly and there are other means to

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:48.110
watch them and also just like everybody

00:24:45.919 --> 00:24:50.570
knows that I don't know like every time

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:53.240
I see someone with their phone out

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:54.620
checking a text in the movie theater I'm

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.750
tempted to be well I'm not tempted

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:58.970
anymore because I'm older but you know

00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:01.909
I'd be like you know I'll blow up your

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:04.039
spot right now I'm a mid-tier youtuber I

00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:05.990
could get you judged in the court of

00:25:04.039 --> 00:25:08.360
public opinion the main thing stopping

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:10.429
me is that a that doesn't adhere to my

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:12.740
ideal of Justice which is you know

00:25:10.429 --> 00:25:14.690
you're innocent until proven guilty and

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:17.240
everybody deserves clemency and mercy up

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:19.789
to a point and the other one is that I

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:21.440
know as soon as I did that I would be

00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:23.360
the guy who's like put your phone away

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.260
and then they'd be like my mom's in the

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:27.500
hospital

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:28.760
dick it's just the 28th Marvel movie

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:33.020
that's come out this year what's so

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:35.480
important and I'd be like ok you know

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:37.370
what you got a good point I lost sight

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:40.159
of the more important things in life and

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:42.020
I apologized as a result of that it

00:25:40.159 --> 00:25:46.000
would it would reflect badly on me is

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:48.320
what I'm trying to say well dude we just

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.940
did not get a deal with the devil here

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.860
we're now I mean the speed upgrade is

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:53.809
fine six point two six damage is not

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:56.270
going to be anything to write home about

00:25:53.809 --> 00:25:58.220
the real danger of this run right now is

00:25:56.270 --> 00:26:03.980
that I'm so small thanks to these you

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:07.100
know meme pills that I can't easily see

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:09.230
when I take damage and as a result I

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:10.700
especially with curse of the unknown

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:13.030
like the ad on the last floor I had no

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:16.340
idea how much damage we have taken

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:17.510
anyway oh jeez like that was a bad

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.820
example because I shouldn't have been

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:23.080
there in the first place

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:23.080
thanks for the half spirit heart though

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:34.980
much appreciated but I don't I guess

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:38.290
it's like a rite of passage I feel like

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:39.490
how often if I'm going to make the

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:40.900
assumption and this is a broad

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:43.090
assumption but I'm gonna make the

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:44.230
assumption I am NOT that normal person

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:46.270
when it comes to this issue and you or

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:49.210
maybe a normal person that applies to

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:50.680
everybody listening to this how often do

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:52.030
you get annoyed with other patrons when

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:56.920
you go to a movie theater because for me

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:58.810
it's actually like I'd say at least 75%

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.280
of the time I leave the theater being

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:02.980
like the movie was good but some of the

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:05.620
people were jerks like the first it was

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:10.780
two years ago but we saw Mad Max and we

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:12.580
had assigned seats because they're you

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:15.160
know in the wall over got me so we win

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:16.810
we had assigned seats so you know the

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:19.390
whole point of having assigned seats is

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:22.210
if you're like me and you want to avoid

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:23.620
having to look for a seat you just get

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:26.440
an assigned seat and then you go this is

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:28.570
my seat I'm going to sit here and like

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:31.090
we sat down in our assigned seats and

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:32.560
then these people sat down next to us

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:34.270
and we're like is anybody sitting here

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:36.370
and we're like duh do you know a theater

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:37.390
you're in because this is assigned seats

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:38.860
and they're like you know well we'll

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:40.720
just wait and see if somebody comes here

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:42.790
because these seats are pretty good and

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:45.460
then they pull out like a bottle of wine

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:46.960
from their backpack and just start like

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:48.220
passing them back and forth between them

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.020
now I'm not going to say I'm a

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:51.400
completely innocent individual it may or

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:54.600
may not have done similar things during

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:56.650
this college days but on the other hand

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:58.510
you know wait till you're in your

00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:59.950
regular seats because then during the

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:02.800
trailers the people whose seats it were

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:04.060
who seats it was came back and we're

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:06.250
like hey those are our seats and they're

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:09.130
Oh Britt do we must do we misread our

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:11.770
ticket sorry oh you're here in 41 J you

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:13.390
know you get the idea I don't want any

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:15.670
of this who cares I don't really want to

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:19.630
fight hush with 4hp either that's like

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:21.910
the only way we could ruin this run so

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:26.080
that's one example but it's not it's not

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:29.920
that bad you know people always say like

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:33.100
I don't like to watch kids movies in the

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:35.440
theater because kids I don't like

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:36.620
watching movies with toddlers basically

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:41.870
I

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:44.030
finding dory opening day and that was a

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:48.200
very pleasant movie-going experience did

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:50.929
kids go like whoo you know yeah it's a

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:52.580
freakin kids movie it's like I want to

00:28:50.929 --> 00:28:54.350
go on the roller coaster but I don't

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:56.570
want anybody to shout I just want to

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:59.540
experience the thrill of the g-forces as

00:28:56.570 --> 00:29:01.309
the artist intended like that's snobby

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:04.280
and kind of ridiculous to me the worst

00:29:01.309 --> 00:29:06.020
people in theaters I'm saying this as

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:08.780
somebody who recently matriculated at

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:10.490
era well that's not true the worst

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:12.320
people in theaters are just jerks

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:15.980
I'm not going to ascribe an age group to

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:17.990
it but I will say the era in which most

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:20.090
of my friends were the most jerkish in

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:23.590
movie theaters was definitely like

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:25.970
between the ages of 18 and 25 and

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:28.250
alcohol may have been a factor in a lot

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:29.840
of those situations but now I live in

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:32.900
Vancouver so instead of alcohol it's

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:33.620
probably cannabis not there's anything

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:38.540
wrong with that

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:40.400
or either for that matter but I'll give

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:46.670
me a kid's movie with kids in the

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:48.290
theater over like a Marvel movie like

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:50.750
two days after opening night because if

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:52.610
you're packed and if you're in the movie

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:54.140
like you're full of the comic book fans

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:56.290
that are there they bought two tickets

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:59.540
in advance they woke up at like you know

00:29:56.290 --> 00:30:00.860
4:00 a.m. to line up for it that's a

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:03.470
cool experience that's a good

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:05.059
environment it's like being first in

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:06.440
line for pax or something like that I

00:30:05.059 --> 00:30:08.570
can understand that if you're into it

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.470
like three days later when people are

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:11.240
like I don't really care about

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:13.610
spider-man but let's go see spider-man

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:15.230
and then they start singing along with

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:20.120
the spider-man theme song or something

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:21.800
that get that out of here guess what I'm

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:25.840
getting at like a it's the same with

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:27.830
airplanes dude people always are like a

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.480
life's hard by the way you're supposed

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:32.260
to drop the left hand before you come

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:35.090
here that's my bad to an extreme degree

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:37.100
but I'm in full tangent mode because

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:40.100
we're gonna win this run fairly easily

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:41.809
so at this point it's like a you know

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:46.309
let's get over it by the way I am

00:30:41.809 --> 00:30:50.700
entering like the - realm clearly

00:30:46.309 --> 00:30:52.200
but just like a baby on the flight the

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:54.630
first couple of times I flew when there

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:57.270
was a baby behind me it's like oh there

00:30:54.630 --> 00:31:00.090
should be a special airline just for

00:30:57.270 --> 00:31:02.370
babies because I they cried for the

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:06.630
whole 45 minutes of my flight from

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:08.820
Burbank to Los Angeles it was crazy now

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:10.320
I'm like I have sympathy when I get our

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.820
sympathy for the mother because the

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.620
mother is like everybody on this flight

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:15.240
judging me for having a baby and I have

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.830
sympathy or that were the father for

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:21.480
that matter you know it shows my

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:22.740
antiquated ideals I guess then I also

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.450
have sympathy for the baby because the

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:26.490
baby is like I don't know anything and

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:29.340
like my ears are popping and I'm

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:31.830
traveling at 700 kilometers an hour

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.820
right now like baby's brain doesn't

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:35.460
understand what's going on there of

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:37.169
course it's going to cry some adults cry

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:40.860
on airplanes and they go like I don't

00:31:37.169 --> 00:31:43.799
want to be here you know I'm then it's

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:45.090
actually not me for once but well it

00:31:43.799 --> 00:31:48.390
depends you know if I'm watching Toy

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:50.429
Story 3 I'll consider it but the people

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:52.470
I get annoyed with on airplanes nowadays

00:31:50.429 --> 00:31:54.270
are adults who are like and there's no

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:57.720
rules in the sky I'm just going to take

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:59.520
my shoes off like on my flight to

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:01.679
Ontario i sat next to a dude who was

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:03.720
like 80 and it's not his fault he's 80

00:32:01.679 --> 00:32:05.520
but I was actually just amazed

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:07.860
first off shoes off the whole flight

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:09.690
okay I mean I don't I've talked about

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.559
this on the N LSS I don't respect that I

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:12.660
don't think you should have to wear a

00:32:10.559 --> 00:32:13.950
suit to fly but I think you should at

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:15.960
least keep your shoes on because it

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:17.910
traps the odor and if you go like oh my

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:21.240
feet don't stink then I'm like okay

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:23.460
first stuff probably wrong I say the

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.750
people in that most recent NLS s

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:26.460
discussion were like I don't brush my

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:29.280
teeth or my breath doesn't smell bad and

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:31.080
I'm like you should get like an

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:33.030
impartial observer to tell you that then

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:35.880
I'll believe you if I can hire an

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:37.919
arbiter then I will believe whatever

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:39.860
they say even if it flies in the face of

00:32:37.919 --> 00:32:45.000
like you know a hundred years of dental

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:46.410
hygiene advances but anyway plus it's

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.380
due is 80 everything smells when you're

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:51.390
80 I'm 28 some of my stuff starting to

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:53.730
smell and I'm like it shouldn't smell I

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:56.130
showered recently mother Nature doesn't

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:57.840
care okay it's just the way it is I had

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:59.720
to shave my ear here the other day

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:02.240
I'm 28 years old

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:05.600
give me some idea I looked in the mirror

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:08.450
and I was like I got like Woody Allen's

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:11.750
hair from Annie Hall coming out of my

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:13.759
ears anyway this is I digress shoes off

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:15.470
the whole flight for about an hour

00:33:13.759 --> 00:33:16.850
straight first off you look at the map

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:18.409
the whole flight I mean we don't have

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:20.149
time to go off on this tangent I don't

00:33:18.409 --> 00:33:22.759
like it though because it's like leaving

00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:25.009
the clock very visible the entire school

00:33:22.759 --> 00:33:26.690
day you want the clock to be invisible

00:33:25.009 --> 00:33:28.460
so who you forget about the passage of

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:30.559
time and thus it gives you the

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:32.929
perception of landing faster but in

00:33:30.559 --> 00:33:34.009
first off also two five hour flight dude

00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:36.529
you're just going to stare at the map

00:33:34.009 --> 00:33:39.350
for five hours regardless the second

00:33:36.529 --> 00:33:41.980
thing is at one point this man is like

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:45.889
an octogenarian septage anarion at best

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:48.409
he put his feet up on the seat the back

00:33:45.889 --> 00:33:50.450
of the seat that was in front of us like

00:33:48.409 --> 00:33:53.029
he was in stirrups at the gynecologists

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:56.690
office and then put his head between his

00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:59.120
knees I was like this is a yoga I guess

00:33:56.690 --> 00:34:02.899
he's just called a yogi at that point he

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:05.210
looked like a normal 80 year old he got

00:34:02.899 --> 00:34:06.799
into like the full Lotus pose I was a

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:09.679
bee spread himself open like a flower

00:34:06.799 --> 00:34:10.909
petal I was stunned but also at the same

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:14.599
time I was like you should know better

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:16.730
when a kid goes like mommy the airplane

00:34:14.599 --> 00:34:19.429
smells like fire I'm like that kids an

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:22.099
idiot I'm not if they took an adult

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:23.780
level IQ test they would get like double

00:34:22.099 --> 00:34:25.190
digits right I'm not trying to insult

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.480
them it's just you're all right it's

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:28.399
