00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.500
hey everybody welcome back Sydnor the

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.980
lion pls mining of eyes again with plus

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:13.049
last rotten and what can you say curse

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.740
of the blind brimstone guilt-free this I

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.470
mean

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.840
HP wives if you ignore the Hierophant

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:25.830
card a little bit of a dicey start ll v9

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:29.070
l sv f it's a bad grade in the set

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.960
reviews but either way damage is good

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.660
rate of fire is better than average luck

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.239
is good and speed is okay like this is

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.829
actually and we can't ignore the Europe

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.739
on card because we have the hero font

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:49.890
card so we'll take it of course and then

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:53.399
we have a choice I think this is going

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.289
to be a divisive opinion not to you know

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.510
overstate the importance of what is

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.370
essentially a decision in a video game

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.719
which in the whole scheme of things you

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.390
know if you've got two good decisions

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.100
you your two good options I should say

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.520
you live in the good life you know but I

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.810
think we will probably take a golden

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.640
teleporter I just think it's more

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:17.430
interesting than then Pandora's Box

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.110
Pandora's Box is also good but we'll

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.610
just we'll have to use it on this floor

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.070
if you want to take golden teleporters

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.390
so we honestly might as well golden

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.710
teleporter should allow us to get deals

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.420
with the devil we don't deserve air

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.430
rooms we don't deserve secret rooms we

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.900
don't deserve etcetera etc so you've got

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:38.040
another couple of spirit hearts out of

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:40.020
that the the smart money is not to get

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.899
tinted rocks and instead try to find

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.990
secret rooms so I actually like I think

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.759
I'm going to save all of our bombs for

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.110
now until we know where the highest

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.780
percentage chance of finding the secret

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.630
room is which we probably already can

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.380
infer but you know can't deduce with

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.000
pure logic for just a little bit here so

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.649
again this is how committed I am is that

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.600
I didn't want to use a bomb too

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.219
not our all it's gonna shoot it's gonna

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.179
shoot okay I didn't want to use a bomb

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:13.420
to get golden teleporter I figured it

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.190
was a smarter play just to sacrifice one

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.230
of our thankfully many spirit hearts to

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.090
get it sorted come on dude come on

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.440
though okay getting that is important

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.090
then we have enough keys and money to

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.200
get a battery charge from our shop

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.420
should one exist fighting the turd

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.099
Ling's right away so the way that golden

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.510
teleporter works and I'm saying this not

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.640
to because you know you know you're

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.579
going to be like I know though if you

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.549
had golden teleporter before don't

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.380
explain anything to me anymore okay I've

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.180
already heard it once in my young mind

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.090
is like a sponge that holds on to all

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:55.090
information infallibly the first time I

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:58.299
hear it you don't understand it has

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.769
basically a priority queue of secret or

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.989
special rooms I should say so if you

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.670
have not been to all of the regular

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.959
rooms that it takes you to the closest

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.670
regular room you haven't been to when

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.250
you use it if you have been to all the

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.620
regular rooms it takes you to a special

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.889
room you have not been to so for now it

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.470
would take us to the shop for example

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:19.540
now that we've been to the shop it'll

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.489
take us to one of the two secret rooms

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.489
and this is where things get a little

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:28.090
tricky cuz I'm got to try to find

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:33.150
ideally both secret rooms all that

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.150
stinks um okay

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.609
they could be a secret room that could

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.280
be a secret room this could also be a

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:44.829
secret route let's try here I just got a

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:48.099
feeling in my gut there we go that was

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:53.010
the regular secret room I'm losing my

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:56.889
mind okay then we should probably

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.870
teleport this is the second secret room

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:02.439
which has given us an eternal heart so

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.620
the next deal or the next teleportation

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:07.689
should be a deal with the devil

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.900
so before we pay for the battery charge

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:12.370
I want to go get some red hearts that we

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.669
can actually take a deal with the devil

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.829
a little cheaper and honestly I mean

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:20.349
this is golden teleporter for us right

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.139
now has essentially given us on HP

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:24.550
upgrade already plus the two spirit arts

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:29.770
from Pandora's box I'm going to count

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:32.259
them and then also deal with the devil

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:37.090
precedent for the cost of betrayal which

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:38.110
is not bad necessarily we knew we were

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.180
going to get a deal with a devil on the

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.740
next floor anyway but this way you know

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.060
we've at least started stacking up items

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.830
and it didn't even take us that long to

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.169
be honest with you so I think that this

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.840
is it's starting to demonstrate the true

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.270
power of this item and we got a ton of

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.340
keys like this run is looking completely

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.020
fine right now I really thought I could

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.840
make it in and out of there without

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.750
getting hit instead we took three hits

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.310
we were guaranteed to take two and

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:07.750
probably like a highly likely to take

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:10.330
three but still it hurts but either way

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.639
like the run is actually very very

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.990
strong right now relative to where we

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:17.289
are in the game it's not like you know

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.449
if they put me on the the dark room like

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:22.360
this the black lodge I wouldn't be

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:24.190
feeling that great about myself but you

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:31.539
know we're not on the black lodge are we

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:36.280
we're on the cellar I'm trying not to

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:38.740
get rattled but bad trip pickup comes

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.550
with me at the end of kind of a lean set

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:44.080
of rooms for us here so it's trying to

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.360
limit the amount of damage lost it's

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.120
tough because you know it's essentially

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.669
unpreventable

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.889
well if you want to ever take pills

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:53.120
you're going to have to acknowledge that

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.250
occasionally you're going to get a bad

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:59.479
trip pill that's going to make you an

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:01.490
unhappy camper but one way or the other

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:04.130
I'm going to find you I'm gonna get you

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.570
again gigantea it looks peep it we know

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.919
we have to go into that room regardless

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:12.729
if we want to use carefully if we want

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:15.169
to use a golden teleporter properly

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:17.300
golden teleporter also I just want to

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:20.030
point out guaranteed get out of jail

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.220
free card for boss rush guaranteed you

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:25.940
know I don't have to fight mob and boss

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.199
Trap rooms there's some positives we're

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.760
going to have to backtrack anyway we

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:33.139
might as well fight the boss now and see

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:35.000
if we get some like bonus let's go DPS

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:39.919
basically there's one growth hormones is

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.930
very nice right now you're going to

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:43.910
think that this is wrong and you might

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.910
be right but I don't think we should

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:50.870
take duality I'm going to take duality I

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:52.400
rethought it no but so why why not take

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.950
duality well I was like that just adds

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.940
one more special room that makes it

00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:00.889
harder for us to find a narrow room

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.300
because now on every floor there should

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:05.450
be a deal with the devil and a deal with

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.979
the angel I think unless it's like it I

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:09.560
guess it depends on the way that the

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:13.010
game is structured if the floors are

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:16.340
generated 100% at the time that you

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:19.060
enter the floor then there should be a

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:25.610
deal with the angel on every floor now

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:30.020
all that stunk if if instead it's like

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:33.139
hey once you beat the boss we've spawned

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.940
that was ridiculous he jumped he jumped

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:37.270
the length of the room I'm losing my

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.270
mind

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:45.320
I'll just important um we could use the

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:48.470
HP to to be honestly we played terribly

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:50.000
on this floor but I still disputed the

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:53.780
damage that was just done to me by that

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.370
spider is sensible yeah that HP is good

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.919
okay so we're back in the saddle again

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:59.280
here we need more money and we could use

00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:01.770
some bombs

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:05.040
more money so we can buy battery charges

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:06.390
and bombs so we can access secret rooms

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.220
because right now we just we're going to

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:10.560
get access to a secret room Wow

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:14.820
exquisite well with our spacebar item

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:17.070
slot crickets head dude somebody up

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:21.930
there likes me we might as well teleport

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:24.300
right now let's second secret room

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:29.270
access which is probably the better of

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:32.430
the options here two stone chests is a

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:36.990
decent Hall we're looking for I mean

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:39.030
ideally two battery charges enough money

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.860
to buy one battery charge and and maybe

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:43.469
bombs to access the second secret room

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:51.090
is also pretty good might be able to

00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:57.420
swing an air room still just careful

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:58.650
here another bomb okay so we got two

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.420
bombs and there's really only one

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:03.060
location to look for a secret room here

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.860
we are spending a lot of time but it

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.600
doesn't bother me it's time well spent

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:09.360
if it gives us an extra item could speed

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.220
us up in the future tell you what we can

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.190
use one bomb to look for a nickel and we

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:18.990
got it and we got another key out of it

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:21.450
as well which can be important there is

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:23.400
a battery charge and we can go hard on

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:27.560
our donation machine it's at max after

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.560
like years we finally got it back

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:37.080
well ph.d is still good even if it did

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:41.580
just give us I'm drowsy we get a narrow

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:46.589
room that strikes me as being pretty

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:48.839
horrible we've the opportunity to do

00:09:46.589 --> 00:09:52.589
like two mob trap rooms at once lovely

00:09:48.839 --> 00:09:57.260
okay so to blow that up well it did pay

00:09:52.589 --> 00:09:57.260
for itself come on

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:08.900
getting a little on the silly side here

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:11.510
got a lot of keys and an empress card

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:13.340
dude bit of a bummer on that one but

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.690
that's okay we're only a little bit

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:17.300
behind schedule and honestly doesn't

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:20.000
matter boss rush is not the focus of a

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:22.100
golden teleporter run or teleporter 2.0

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.740
the focus of a teleporter run like this

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.940
is to you know milk that item for all

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.620
it's worth and sometimes you can get

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.000
some good stuff out of it sometimes you

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.920
don't get good stuff out of it but it's

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.420
fun to use it regardless so it's pretty

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:36.260
much the principle reason I took it

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:38.180
anyway yeah that that one didn't

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.790
necessarily work out 100% but we did get

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:42.440
HP on the floor despite also throwing a

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.970
little bit of HP away I'm interested to

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:46.160
see how do allottee works for us in the

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:51.070
future and battery charges on the ground

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.070
are like a hundred percent excellent

00:10:54.280 --> 00:11:00.890
might be a little afraid though from the

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:03.500
perspective of like you know I'd like to

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:11.900
have more than one-and-a-half spirit

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:14.630
arts in one red heart but our stats are

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:16.630
great I mean 10 damage on the third

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:19.490
floor

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:21.290
can't complain got more battery charges

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:24.410
in there it's not really worth

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:25.400
teleporting right now but I'm going to

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:27.260
do it anyway because we're going to get

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.420
a charge before the boss regardless so

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:31.040
you just go in to your hope for spirit

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.530
hearts or demon hearts and that's how

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.940
that went down thankfully and then saves

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:40.960
us a little bit of time on the backtrack

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:40.960
as well help

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:45.980
anyway this run the the sane of the run

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:49.100
is overpowered the sane of the

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:52.580
commentary so far the thing is like you

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:54.830
know every episode internally you know

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:57.829
here at northernlion HQs the meet of 1.0

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:59.209
zane per hour threshold and sometimes

00:11:57.829 --> 00:12:00.519
that comes from the run and sometimes it

00:11:59.209 --> 00:12:02.810
comes from

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:04.459
we've got 12 keys let's go for luck

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:05.810
sometimes that comes from the run

00:12:04.459 --> 00:12:08.769
sometimes it comes from the commentary

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:11.240
this time it's coming from the run but

00:12:08.769 --> 00:12:14.120
this run really exemplifies what makes

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:15.649
Isaac such a fun game I think we one of

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.570
the things that makes Isaac such a fun

00:12:15.649 --> 00:12:20.000
game like I'm just I'm not ruffling any

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:22.160
feathers here at this point the core

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.410
gameplay loop of like running around and

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:27.620
dodging bullets that appear on the

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:29.839
screen is not really my central you know

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:32.899
enjoyment of Isaac it's much more than

00:12:29.839 --> 00:12:34.370
like slaw machine style like what's this

00:12:32.899 --> 00:12:38.600
run going to look like that happens

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:41.589
instead so I think in terms of like like

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:44.899
raw mechanical enjoyment solitude

00:12:41.589 --> 00:12:48.410
prognosis we had that last run as well

00:12:44.899 --> 00:12:50.180
so like life's been good in terms of raw

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:53.390
mechanical enjoyment like enter the

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:56.360
gungeon is a little bit more fun to play

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:57.680
I think the the moment-to-moment dodging

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.500
and shooting is more fun than than

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:02.000
denies again in dead cells like that

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:03.740
Symphony is a knife style combat is is

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.279
really awesome as well I think those

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:08.870
games have done a great job of

00:13:06.279 --> 00:13:11.089
innovating on the the formula that I

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.320
want to say Isaac is the first roguelike

00:13:11.089 --> 00:13:14.690
because obviously that's ignorance but

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.270
you know as the most popular roguelike I

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:18.470
think they've done a good job of

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:22.310
emulating that and iterating on that but

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:25.610
still no other game yet

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:28.610
that I've played has the same kind of

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:30.829
like diversity in terms of run character

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:32.180
not even just quality because like every

00:13:30.829 --> 00:13:33.529
run and every rogue light is a little

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:37.279
different some of them are a little

00:13:33.529 --> 00:13:39.110
Sammy I guess but most runs in a lot of

00:13:37.279 --> 00:13:40.160
rogue lights are little are different

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:42.410
from one another I'm just going to pop

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.649
it right off the bat dude what are you

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:47.810
doing with these items here the trash

00:13:44.649 --> 00:13:52.130
it's trash once upon a time you dressed

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:53.840
so plain em sister Maggie no on the

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:57.620
Deauville though

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:58.880
yeah okay I mean we might not get a deal

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.080
but if we get a deal we should go to the

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.160
deal with the angel and then we're

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:07.610
looking for secret rooms and get the

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:08.180
heck out of Dodge I have duality oh I

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:10.310
see

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:17.480
so we've already compromised duality by

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:19.370
using the Joker and the Cu not anti Bob

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:23.630
Dylan I actually saw Bob Dylan concert

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:26.060
once and you know blood on the tracks

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:27.740
and blonde on blonde and a highway 61

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.820
revisited or like three of my favorite

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.140
albums of all time I think I'm just

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:33.470
going to start we got enough battery

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:36.410
charges to just leverage this but I will

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:39.800
not mince words like the Bob Dylan

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:41.180
concert I saw was one of the worst live

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:46.040
shows I've ever seen in my whole life

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:47.330
and I'm not hating on the dude tickets

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:50.000
were not that expensive

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:51.589
they were like 85 bucks which in a

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.650
vacuum sounds like a lot but you're

00:14:51.589 --> 00:14:57.050
seeing like an actual legend of popular

00:14:54.650 --> 00:15:01.760
music that's not even close to hyperbole

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:04.280
but you know it's not that bad but the

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:07.280
other thing is the dude is like 85 years

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:09.950
old so you kind of I think you just got

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:12.100
to accept it that way I saw the show I

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:14.450
was like blue I hope he plays you know

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:17.890
tangled up in blue but now he's just

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:20.150
sort of very workman like do plays like

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:23.089
180 shows a year or something like that

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:24.650
so he just bangs out like you know hit

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:27.140
after hit and then he gets off the stage

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:29.270
there's no like they in 1960 me and June

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:32.020
get lovely you know not Joan Jett Joan

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:34.580
Baez you know it's really just like

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:41.900
that's just here so I don't get fine all

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:43.550
right so yeah I mean again not trying to

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:48.380
burst your bubble if you presently hold

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:51.320
tickets to see Bob Dylan but the show

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:52.819
was unremarkable enough that I'm still

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.769
like I mean I you know

00:15:52.819 --> 00:15:56.899
have to and take this from somebody for

00:15:54.769 --> 00:15:59.569
a while as a superfan it's not like I

00:15:56.899 --> 00:16:02.119
went to the concert and was like this

00:15:59.569 --> 00:16:05.179
guy's a fraud no I just I came back and

00:16:02.119 --> 00:16:07.129
I was like we just watched an 80 year

00:16:05.179 --> 00:16:12.079
old man sing some songs

00:16:07.129 --> 00:16:15.399
yes it sounds like really disrespectful

00:16:12.079 --> 00:16:19.039
hey what do you expect he's 80 years old

00:16:15.399 --> 00:16:21.679
you know if you go see like Beyonce yeah

00:16:19.039 --> 00:16:24.289
I'm expecting fireworks right this is

00:16:21.679 --> 00:16:25.059
Bob Dylan the man is born in the frickin

00:16:24.289 --> 00:16:29.869
20s

00:16:25.059 --> 00:16:33.879
we got a try Libre dude it's a huge

00:16:29.869 --> 00:16:33.879
damage downgrade I wouldn't dispute that

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:45.379
he's probably born in the 30s born in

00:16:39.559 --> 00:16:49.009
the 1930s he was born in the 1930s he

00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:50.809
was anyway that's that's my review of

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:53.679
the Bob Dylan concert which essentially

00:16:50.809 --> 00:17:02.479
just came down to that was Bob Dylan

00:16:53.679 --> 00:17:04.339
there is pretty much all it's about at

00:17:02.479 --> 00:17:10.549
that point so it's the end of the

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:12.529
anecdote please I want blood bag for HP

00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:14.480
but also for all stats and that's

00:17:12.529 --> 00:17:16.009
actually a pretty sizable all stats

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.809
upgrade anything that gives you one full

00:17:16.009 --> 00:17:20.750
rate of fire up when you have Libra I

00:17:17.809 --> 00:17:24.500
think it's fairly substantial weight

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:26.779
would pay attention to the yeah so I was

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.159
going to say pay attention to the secret

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:32.019
room access I actually didn't think

00:17:28.159 --> 00:17:35.830
about it but the dog tooth is like

00:17:32.019 --> 00:17:37.909
excellent when you have teleport 2.0

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:41.149
because it allows you to find these

00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:42.889
secret rooms easily which means that you

00:17:41.149 --> 00:17:44.659
can get to the air rooms more easily

00:17:42.889 --> 00:17:46.970
which means that you can get you know

00:17:44.659 --> 00:17:48.889
the double Ragman fights for free more

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:51.710
easily which means that you can get a

00:17:48.889 --> 00:17:57.350
key more easily so in the end it's all

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:58.879
gravy definitely sure why not that ended

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:00.860
up being a very very good shot for us

00:17:58.879 --> 00:18:02.179
there's zero chance of boss rush but I

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:05.000
kind of feel like that's the trade-off

00:18:02.179 --> 00:18:05.870
of teleport 2.0 like if you use it

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.910
properly you

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:09.830
you won't if you use it properly and

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:10.850
your goal is to get error rooms it's

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:13.340
going to be tough for you to make boss

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:15.110
rush work if you're using it as you know

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:24.320
free teleport cards dude

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:30.380
also pretty good so we're what what an

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:35.900
incredible look in room here literally

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:37.750
20 cents just kickin about sure I will

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.890
do this I don't need to fight you

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:42.650
it's a point I'm not going to pick up

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:45.020
the nickel we're kind of living in a

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:47.090
post-scarcity economy here in Isaac

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:49.550
because the donation machine and it

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:53.500
literally has been like two years but

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:56.600
the donation machine is actually back I

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:58.790
forgot about the constant struggle that

00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:00.620
it's been not struggle in my sense like

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:02.809
it was hard but you know struggle in the

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:04.970
sense of like we've been trying to get

00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:13.100
that back at 999 cents for quite a long

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:17.870
time now we've done it we've done it it

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:19.370
keeps the APM high I don't know I

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:21.830
haven't been to a concert in forever man

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:23.660
I think part of the problem is that I

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:27.470
grew up in a pretty small town it's a

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:32.660
town between like two major cities in

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:35.000
Canada not a full tears upgrade probably

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:36.380
cuz we're at the cap I guess but okay so

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.090
there's our deal with the devil and we

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.640
can definitely afford the mark and I

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:45.050
don't care about little delirium so I'll

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:48.200
take it but it was kind of like I get it

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:49.790
like if you're Bob Dylan and you're like

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:53.570
okay I've only got enough energy to

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:56.840
really bang out two shows this week are

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:59.690
you going to bang out Kingston Ontario

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.100
show or are you going to do Toronto

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.660
Montreal you're probably going to do

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:06.200
throttle Montreal right they're bigger

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:10.970
cities just a continually amazing haul

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:13.429
here from our arrow rooms anyway so the

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:16.120
same thing like I was a superfan like a

00:20:13.429 --> 00:20:19.520
Modest Mouse superfan and they played

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.800
just an awful no offense man because

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.300
this

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:23.700
probably statistically people watching

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:27.390
the sewer you know maybe in my hometown

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:30.360
there's a big university there in that

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:31.530
University you know that attracts very

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.880
smart people I don't know how its

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:33.990
reputation is lately I thought it had

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.090
taken a bit of a nosedive

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:38.300
probably because I'm not using my degree

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:43.440
they were really banking on that but

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:45.720
let's go oh he almost made it I got

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:47.790
beaten by the freeze like I'm not

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:50.340
insulting the alehouse if it still

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:53.790
exists but you know I saw modest mouse

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:56.010
play live at the Ale House in July now

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:58.050
should we turn the AC on nah that would

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:59.580
cost us 50 bucks so instead let's just

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:02.280
give like everybody at the venue heat

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:05.370
stroke and monitor mouse was fine like

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:07.530
they were they were good but I sort of

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:10.860
got the vibe that they were like where

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:12.480
are we you know it's like the the spinal

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:15.390
tap in Springfield moment from The

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.700
Simpsons like we love you and then he

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:19.430
looks at the back of his guitar

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:22.290
Springfield I can't blame them you know

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:24.810
it's better I almost prefer that than

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:27.870
like sometimes you go to a concert in

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:30.630
the middle of nowhere and then you know

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:32.250
they're like greater Nappanee fans are

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:34.290
the greatest fans of the world and

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:37.170
you're like that doesn't seem likely

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:39.630
this town is fifty five hundred people

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:41.850
the greatest fans in the world

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:45.390
I mean they're good people I'm not

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:46.830
getting you're wrong it's I'll say what

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:48.600
you will about Greater Nappanee but they

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:50.130
just breed the greatest music fan but

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.930
then you go I mean you go to those

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:53.760
concerts they have comforting lies told

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:59.010
to you like that it's all the spike was

00:21:53.760 --> 00:22:02.100
off-center and it broke my brain okay so

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:05.610
I feel like it's not really fair for me

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:07.260
to you if you're paying for the concert

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:09.320
tickets they should provide an ideal

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:11.250
performance I agree but at the same time

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:15.570
you know there's a difference between

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:18.299
Woodstock and like you know the

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:20.639
Belleville Folk Festival

00:22:18.299 --> 00:22:22.169
if Joe Cocker shows up to the belt is he

00:22:20.639 --> 00:22:24.089
still alive I should pick a living

00:22:22.169 --> 00:22:25.830
artist if Joe Cocker shows up to

00:22:24.089 --> 00:22:27.479
Woodstock and falls off the stage that's

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:29.219
news if he shows up to the Belleville

00:22:27.479 --> 00:22:31.169
Folk Festival and he's a little drunk

00:22:29.219 --> 00:22:38.789
people go like my let's you know it's

00:22:31.169 --> 00:22:40.289
got some down-home charm to it it's why

00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:44.820
like I don't bring my a-game

00:22:40.289 --> 00:22:46.619
unless it's III like at PAX hey and now

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.969
I'm a big fan of you oh you know I

00:22:46.619 --> 00:22:51.690
listen to your videos every night yeah

00:22:47.969 --> 00:22:53.369
whatever nerd talk to me in Los Angeles

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:55.459
if you want to have a real conversation

00:22:53.369 --> 00:22:58.709
I'm just here so I don't get fined

00:22:55.459 --> 00:23:01.799
that's obviously false I hope that's I

00:22:58.709 --> 00:23:03.389
hope that's clear probably didn't need

00:23:01.799 --> 00:23:04.950
to make it clear but I hope it's clear

00:23:03.389 --> 00:23:07.739
nonetheless so I'm going to use they

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:11.099
hear a font khari this run is just just

00:23:07.739 --> 00:23:13.739
strange not bad just strange still

00:23:11.099 --> 00:23:15.869
pretty good Libra is one of those things

00:23:13.739 --> 00:23:19.559
you know I'm trying to get it to to pop

00:23:15.869 --> 00:23:21.179
as often as possible and I just the last

00:23:19.559 --> 00:23:22.739
couple of times we've had it this time

00:23:21.179 --> 00:23:26.249
in the last time we've had it I haven't

00:23:22.739 --> 00:23:28.139
really managed to make it pop obviously

00:23:26.249 --> 00:23:30.659
we should just take that it really does

00:23:28.139 --> 00:23:33.179
come down to in our situation we found

00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:35.659
easy abilities oh I hate myself

00:23:33.179 --> 00:23:37.649
we found easy abilities to enable

00:23:35.659 --> 00:23:40.289
finding all of the rooms that we want to

00:23:37.649 --> 00:23:41.940
go to what we have not done is had high

00:23:40.289 --> 00:23:44.459
quality of items in those rooms

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:46.079
you know we hate we haven't knocked it

00:23:44.459 --> 00:23:47.519
out of the park on error rooms basically

00:23:46.079 --> 00:23:49.249
is what it's a roundabout way of what

00:23:47.519 --> 00:23:52.349
I'm saying

00:23:49.249 --> 00:23:53.969
why not teleport out well I still have a

00:23:52.349 --> 00:24:02.989
full charge at this point we're laid in

00:23:53.969 --> 00:24:02.989
the floor and we feel regular

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:13.350
in it so we were at the pharmacy today I

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:18.330
don't know why like you know one crate

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:22.590
that car girl I am bringing it okay

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:24.720
let's stab will do let's take it we

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:26.399
deserved punishment in this item is bad

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.539
and it costs us a lot of our HP so

00:24:26.399 --> 00:24:28.889
that's adequate punishment

00:24:27.539 --> 00:24:31.320
we are the pharmacy today and my initial

00:24:28.889 --> 00:24:33.149
reaction is like to tell you what we

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:35.999
bought at the pharmacy as if I need to

00:24:33.149 --> 00:24:38.039
either like corroborate the story or

00:24:35.999 --> 00:24:40.649
like you know you're my mom and I was

00:24:38.039 --> 00:24:42.450
like I need an excuse to be at the

00:24:40.649 --> 00:24:47.009
pharmacy whether it's a pharmacy okay

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:49.049
great it's a general store basically and

00:24:47.009 --> 00:24:53.340
I have embarrassed Mullen I'd like to

00:24:49.049 --> 00:24:56.549
relay to you I didn't go to the

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:58.559
self-checkout because I parked at the in

00:24:56.549 --> 00:25:01.409
a commercial parking lot which means you

00:24:58.559 --> 00:25:03.269
get a parking slip and then often times

00:25:01.409 --> 00:25:05.669
businesses will give you a small

00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:07.499
discount off of what you purchase in

00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:09.600
order to reimburse you for the parking

00:25:07.499 --> 00:25:11.220
so you can't do that at self checkout so

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.230
instead I had to go talk to a real human

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:14.879
being as I had other parking slip and

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:18.929
he's like cool so he took 250 off the

00:25:14.879 --> 00:25:21.059
off the bill and then he handed me the

00:25:18.929 --> 00:25:24.240
goods that I purchased and he said have

00:25:21.059 --> 00:25:27.799
a good day and I said have a good knife

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:32.249
and then I said oops have a good day

00:25:27.799 --> 00:25:34.019
pretty smooth right that's the end of

00:25:32.249 --> 00:25:38.039
the story is a real of the relatively

00:25:34.019 --> 00:25:40.889
minor social slip-up but that dude I

00:25:38.039 --> 00:25:43.019
know you know I've spent some time in a

00:25:40.889 --> 00:25:46.679
public-facing roles before I became

00:25:43.019 --> 00:25:48.509
essentially a hermit and that dudes

00:25:46.679 --> 00:25:50.700
gonna I hope you had a good laugh over

00:25:48.509 --> 00:25:53.519
it for like the next you know two or

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:56.909
three minutes so I did that idiot just

00:25:53.519 --> 00:26:00.269
say have a good nice that's a new one

00:25:56.909 --> 00:26:03.320
I mean knowing the location of this

00:26:00.269 --> 00:26:05.940
pharmacy you probably get some you know

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:08.220
wilder interactions than that on a daily

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:09.840
basis but at the same time I hope I'm

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.850
not saying I selflessly did this to

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:15.149
bring joy to this side to this man's

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:17.149
life I'm just saying that what that

00:26:15.149 --> 00:26:19.429
didn't give me a charge

00:26:17.149 --> 00:26:21.259
I'm just saying that I hope as like

00:26:19.429 --> 00:26:23.839
what's the opposite of collateral damage

00:26:21.259 --> 00:26:28.190
like collateral compensation as

00:26:23.839 --> 00:26:30.049
collateral compensation I hope it did so

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:33.589
what's the ideal outcome for us on this

00:26:30.049 --> 00:26:35.950
floor honestly if we could pick up like

00:26:33.589 --> 00:26:38.899
a spirit heart that'd be pretty sweet

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:47.599
I'm not too picky obviously the actual

00:26:38.899 --> 00:26:48.950
ideal is something like soy milk that if

00:26:47.599 --> 00:26:52.219
we'd blown ourselves up there I would

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:55.099
have been in a bad spot but we we should

00:26:52.219 --> 00:27:02.169
get some HP stop taking like the world's

00:26:55.099 --> 00:27:06.259
dumbest self inflicted damage and then I

00:27:02.169 --> 00:27:08.899
guess a fairly so good a fairly

00:27:06.259 --> 00:27:10.999
realistic outcome that would be very

00:27:08.899 --> 00:27:14.059
nice is if we got mama mega from the

00:27:10.999 --> 00:27:15.440
shop which gave us boss rush access and

00:27:14.059 --> 00:27:17.839
then we just teleported out of it

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:19.099
because that would mean for obvious

00:27:17.839 --> 00:27:21.799
reasons to be something that would be

00:27:19.099 --> 00:27:23.960
very interested in we have gone too slow

00:27:21.799 --> 00:27:28.009
and and honestly played too badly on

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:32.269
this run in a broad sense to feel happy

00:27:28.009 --> 00:27:34.700
about fighting boss rush Oh brain it's

00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:36.879
like you you think you're flying but you

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:39.139
didn't so you're dying

00:27:36.879 --> 00:27:40.999
she said you're pretty good with words

00:27:39.139 --> 00:27:46.700
but words won't save your life and they

00:27:40.999 --> 00:27:53.089
didn't so he died thank God for the one

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:55.399
key there nothing here makes any good

00:27:53.089 --> 00:27:57.259
sense to purchase in my opinion the moon

00:27:55.399 --> 00:28:02.869
card is actually kind of nice though

00:27:57.259 --> 00:28:04.609
we'll just use that right away dodge

00:28:02.869 --> 00:28:07.399
right into that I think we blocked it

00:28:04.609 --> 00:28:09.099
with the I don't think was the razor it

00:28:07.399 --> 00:28:12.260
might have been Guppies hair ball but

00:28:09.099 --> 00:28:16.640
either way

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:19.429
trying to take advantage of the good

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:21.950
situation we found ourselves in stars

00:28:19.429 --> 00:28:23.929
card we have been to our item room

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:25.340
already so the Stars card is not worth

00:28:23.929 --> 00:28:26.809
much we already have like guaranteed

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:29.540
teleports what it does mean is that we

00:28:26.809 --> 00:28:32.360
can that's very nice

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:35.500
it does mean we can fight the boss right

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:35.500
away and then get out

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:43.640
yeah let's I know there's one room back

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:45.140
there this seems like kind of a waste

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:50.210
but there's there's really nothing

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:54.440
better to do with our stars card I think

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:57.410
at least the binding of I think the

00:28:54.440 --> 00:29:00.790
buttress of Windsor we got to go devil

00:28:57.410 --> 00:29:03.610
deals I mean we don't but I want to

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:06.470
because of the guppy chance here and

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:08.120
free devil deals are actually ideal for

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:12.380
us right now because of my relative

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:13.780
badness so it made it back here been to

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:16.100
both secret rooms so our next

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:18.500
teleportation I believe that we

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:21.620
basically destroyed the angel room by it

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:24.500
not being our choice after the boss

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:26.059
fight so I'm pretty sure that our next

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.470
teleportation will take us straight to

00:29:26.059 --> 00:29:30.140
the arrow room because we've been to

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:35.690
both secret rooms I don't need a guppy

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:40.280
item wouldn't kick it out of bed for

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:46.309
eating crackers expression I still don't

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:47.059
fully understand you know what that's

00:29:46.309 --> 00:29:50.150
pretty solid

00:29:47.059 --> 00:29:51.530
it just seems nonsensical to me that you

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:54.830
would choose to eat things in your bed

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:57.620
on the regular and III want you to know

00:29:54.830 --> 00:30:00.190
by the way I been getting this

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:03.230
reputation that I feel is slightly

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:06.710
undeserving for being like a fictional

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:08.450
adults people go oh NL you know you're

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:09.980
always talking about how good Kael is

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:12.559
like why don't you stop trying so hard

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:14.600
dude that's not me trying to like put on

00:30:12.559 --> 00:30:17.799
airs to make you think I'm an adult I

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:20.299
probably would have a better like

00:30:17.799 --> 00:30:23.309
financial interest and you guys thinking

00:30:20.299 --> 00:30:27.659
that I lived like a permanent bachelor

00:30:23.309 --> 00:30:29.490
but like I just do kales delicious I'm

00:30:27.659 --> 00:30:30.929
sorry to tell you if you don't like kale

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:32.820
it doesn't mean you're wrong but if you

00:30:30.929 --> 00:30:34.200
think I like kale Daz like I'm putting

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:37.590
on airs or something you are incorrect

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:38.789
it's delicious food stuff okay now the

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:40.169
point what I was going to say though is

00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:42.419
I'm getting this undeserved reputation

00:30:40.169 --> 00:30:45.960
for like pretending to be an adult but

00:30:42.419 --> 00:30:48.629
I've lived I have lived a very very

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:52.499
bachelor esque existence and many times

00:30:48.629 --> 00:30:56.309
throughout my my life you know you can

00:30:52.499 --> 00:31:00.480
ask Michael al Fox sir I've lived in

00:30:56.309 --> 00:31:02.580
squalor decrepit houses I here's an

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:04.529
honest-to-goodness thing in in the house

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:06.419
I lived in in college we live in two

00:31:04.529 --> 00:31:10.830
houses but the second house I lived in

00:31:06.419 --> 00:31:15.299
in college I had six five other

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:18.029
roommates I can't remember and it was a

00:31:15.299 --> 00:31:20.220
big Gish house at least because I mean

00:31:18.029 --> 00:31:21.570
it had six bedrooms a couple of which

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:23.419
were just like oh this used to be a

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:25.499
closet and now it's a bedroom but anyway

00:31:23.419 --> 00:31:27.509
so people would come over all the time

00:31:25.499 --> 00:31:28.860
and there was a basement area that

00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:30.659
smelled like mold

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:32.100
but was conducive to having a lot of

00:31:30.659 --> 00:31:33.570
people sit on a couch and you know play

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.619
Super Smash Brothers a rock band or

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:36.899
something like that so we have people

00:31:34.619 --> 00:31:39.299
over fairly frequently when you when we

00:31:36.899 --> 00:31:41.580
urinated the bathroom was two floors up

00:31:39.299 --> 00:31:44.669
so oftentimes people would be like I'm

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:46.860
too lazy maybe you know adult beverages

00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:49.009
were involved maybe they weren't I don't

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:51.840
know why you're you narc or something so

00:31:49.009 --> 00:31:53.429
we let's use the Sun card here we

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.799
instead of going all the way up to the

00:31:53.429 --> 00:31:57.869
top floor sometimes we would just go out

00:31:55.799 --> 00:32:00.179
the back door which opened up into the

00:31:57.869 --> 00:32:01.889
outside and just urinate there usually

00:32:00.179 --> 00:32:03.360
is all dudes let's be honest no

00:32:01.889 --> 00:32:05.070
self-respecting woman wanted to find

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:07.169
herself in this environment so you know

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:09.269
we had to lay of the land or we have the

00:32:07.169 --> 00:32:13.980
we had the control of the land I suppose

00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:18.029
um we didn't do this this is just wear

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:20.700
and tear but eventually the the house

00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:23.789
was in such poor condition the concrete

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:26.909
that led from the outside to the

00:32:23.789 --> 00:32:30.509
basement eroded which meant that if you

00:32:26.909 --> 00:32:35.420
peed outside after like three people

00:32:30.509 --> 00:32:38.670
peeing the pee would start to like

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:40.800
I'm tried it would diffuse into the

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:43.830
basement basically like there's a little

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:46.680
puddle and a crack from the outside led

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:49.320
into the divot in our basement and it

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:51.240
would slowly fill up with actual human

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:53.160
urine that's the kind of conditions that

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:56.640
I've lived in at times in my life so

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:58.710
when you say like Oh little ml why are

00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:00.840
you pretending to be so dignified you

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:03.360
know that's I'm not trying to say you're

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:06.860
a hundred percent in the wrong you know

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:09.030
I pride myself on having some

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:10.860
self-confidence I guess at this point in

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:12.240
my life but I've and you know what the

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:13.560
worst part is we weren't like oh we got

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.820
to get this fixed we were like oh I got

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:16.080
a deal with his urine thing until we

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:17.370
move out okay

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:21.000
you know we're renting I'm not gonna pay

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:24.090
for this like I've lived in some some

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.460
bachelors bachelors conditions I lived

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:28.530
alone in a foreign country where I

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:30.270
didn't really speak the language you

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:31.920
know many times you know be like oh it's

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:33.570
Wednesday night what should I have for

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:35.040
dinner what about a whole can of

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:37.380
Pringles from the convenience store you

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:39.480
know I've been there I forgot where I

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:42.930
was going with this run but I think it

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:45.570
it was gonna come down to like you know

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:49.620
I'm we're not so different you and I the

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:52.080
thing is like I am you but older you

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:53.940
know I've been there I've I've gotten my

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:56.490
I wouldn't say I've gotten my life

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:59.820
sorted out but I've you know I have a

00:33:56.490 --> 00:34:03.120
positive influence in my life now that

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:05.220
will not allow me to urinate in such a

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:07.020
way that it Bloods into our own house

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:09.750
because that would be like pretty gross

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:11.669
to begin with but you know it's just a

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:13.020
different phases of life sort of thing I

00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:14.010
know that story is going to gross you

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:16.830
out by the way you're going to be like

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:18.389
NL that's gross I know it's disgusting

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:20.669
you know what's even grosser is that the

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:22.409
rent that we paid for that place that's

00:34:20.669 --> 00:34:26.970
you know that's the spooky part that you

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:28.679
don't want to know I mean we have

00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:29.879
battery charges we have a couple battery

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:32.429
charges so we should be able to get

00:34:29.879 --> 00:34:34.530
whatever we want here I'm not proud of

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:36.030
that at all I told you I've told the

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:38.460
story on the show at least when I lived

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:40.620
in South Korea I plugged in my xbox 360

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:44.639
and it exploded because they use a

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:47.429
different voltage in in Korea exploded

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:48.099
like yellow dust oh I shouldn't use that

00:34:47.429 --> 00:34:51.489
there I thought we

00:34:48.099 --> 00:34:54.999
any thoughts of awesome like electrical

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:57.819
poison or something came out and like

00:34:54.999 --> 00:34:59.650
air out the apartment Google like yellow

00:34:57.819 --> 00:35:01.779
dust transformer exploding will I die

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:05.200
the answer so far seems to be no which

00:35:01.779 --> 00:35:06.930
is pretty sweet but I'm just saying

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:10.029
we're not so different you and I you

00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:13.960
might be like me someday I want to point

00:35:10.029 --> 00:35:16.660
out as it's always Austin is going on

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:19.930
about you know the one and L I eat

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:21.549
vegetables you know like he's trying to

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:23.279
roast me I'm going for it I shouldn't

00:35:21.549 --> 00:35:30.160
have gone for it

00:35:23.279 --> 00:35:34.299
alright max level Bombo at least this

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:38.229
could be good thank you for the half

00:35:34.299 --> 00:35:41.440
spirit heart Austin is the guy eats so

00:35:38.229 --> 00:35:44.799
much takeout he's given himself like

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:47.890
abdominal poisoning a great time for the

00:35:44.799 --> 00:35:49.450
goat head two times in six weeks and I

00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:50.829
want to point out them aware that the

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:52.930
risk of me saying that if you may

00:35:50.829 --> 00:35:54.190
actually have at this point been

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:55.630
diagnosed with something more serious

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:58.210
although I assume that it's probably

00:35:55.630 --> 00:36:00.069
just routine so I'm not trying to roast

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:03.099
my friend I'm only roasting him because

00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:05.140
he roasts me I just you know I'm I'm you

00:36:03.099 --> 00:36:08.049
four years in the future you got to eat

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:10.660
some vegetables from time to time when

00:36:08.049 --> 00:36:12.279
you're when you're 18 your body is self

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:14.619
sufficient you can live on potato chips

00:36:12.279 --> 00:36:17.009
you can't do that forever I can no you

00:36:14.619 --> 00:36:20.589
can't you don't understand you haven't

00:36:17.009 --> 00:36:22.569
the rules apply to you your DNA is like

00:36:20.589 --> 00:36:25.210
a trillion years old was not literally

00:36:22.569 --> 00:36:29.079
you the idea though you know it's a

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:31.660
hundreds of thousands of years old the

00:36:29.079 --> 00:36:33.700
human body stops it stops being able to

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:37.509
live on potato chips do both secret

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:39.369
rooms we never should have taken both of

00:36:37.509 --> 00:36:42.400
those deals in cases not abundantly

00:36:39.369 --> 00:36:43.930
clear but I'm glad we did because it

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.789
keeps me on my toes here no doubt about

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:47.650
that

00:36:45.789 --> 00:36:51.930
I'm not trying to tell you how you

00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:51.930
should live your life I'm just saying

00:36:51.989 --> 00:36:56.799
even vegetables I'm at the point in my

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:59.730
life I'm at an age where I'm not old but

00:36:56.799 --> 00:37:03.840
eating vegetables makes me feel good

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:05.880
I ate like five slices of pizza

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:11.310
yesterday as well that also made me feel

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:15.720
pretty good but you know and I eat like

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:19.410
a like an apple as a snack

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:20.970
I feel just better afterwards

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:25.650
and I don't know if that's lame or

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:28.890
awesome but does an apple taste as good

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:32.730
as a slice of pizza look anybody who

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:35.520
tells you that it does is a Lyonya but

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:38.310
you don't necessarily gasoline you buy

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:39.810
you got to buy because it smells good

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:45.030
when you burn it you know this is a

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:47.369
strange metaphor we got him we got him

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:50.510
okay so we have the goat head which is

00:37:47.369 --> 00:37:53.640
like completely unnecessary right now I

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:57.990
feel like on this floor we might want to

00:37:53.640 --> 00:38:00.630
abstain from our previous Platonic ideal

00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:03.600
of always getting a narrow room because

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:12.920
I'm very scared about my existence on

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:15.090
planet earth right now don't you dare

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:17.010
you know what I'll go for it I mean I

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:19.170
could just teleport out at this point as

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:24.150
well but should be dusted pretty easily

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:26.580
oh you jerk you know what having gotten

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:27.780
some extra spirit arts out of it at this

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:30.090
point it seems like we should actually

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:35.220
look for everything we found both secret

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:37.650
rooms right that was it's I don't think

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:41.070
it's that I'm pretending to be an adult

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:43.200
I think it's that I'm actually like one

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:46.830
of the older members of the NL SS crew

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:48.570
at 24 I was living pretty similar to how

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:52.520
I'm living right now I'll admit but you

00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:52.520
know at 21 I was right there with

00:38:54.819 --> 00:39:03.709
just some like awful decrepit living

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:07.939
spaces you know the school that I went

00:39:03.709 --> 00:39:10.999
to the area its unique and it's in a way

00:39:07.939 --> 00:39:13.219
like awesome because the culture is that

00:39:10.999 --> 00:39:14.689
after first year of University everybody

00:39:13.219 --> 00:39:17.239
lives off campus or almost everybody

00:39:14.689 --> 00:39:20.049
lives off campus and there's an area

00:39:17.239 --> 00:39:22.729
that's colloquially known as the ghetto

00:39:20.049 --> 00:39:25.939
because it's not really the ghetto but

00:39:22.729 --> 00:39:27.439
like it's pretty grimy but it's nice

00:39:25.939 --> 00:39:28.849
it's a good culture just like it's all

00:39:27.439 --> 00:39:30.289
students living there and by a good

00:39:28.849 --> 00:39:31.640
culture I mean like hey it's a great

00:39:30.289 --> 00:39:36.199
lifestyle if you're between the ages of

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:37.910
like 17 and 24 which almost everybody in

00:39:36.199 --> 00:39:39.799
that neighborhood is but there are like

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:41.179
sometimes you be at somebody's house and

00:39:39.799 --> 00:39:42.859
their neighbors would come out and

00:39:41.179 --> 00:39:44.239
they'd be like fifty years old with kids

00:39:42.859 --> 00:39:45.859
and you're like you should have every

00:39:44.239 --> 00:39:48.859
right to be here but why would you

00:39:45.859 --> 00:39:51.769
choose this place amongst all the other

00:39:48.859 --> 00:39:54.619
places you could be this place it just

00:39:51.769 --> 00:39:56.420
seems like a bad call oh it's a gummy

00:39:54.619 --> 00:39:57.890
transformation anyway but that's that's

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:58.219
their business not mine so what do I

00:39:57.890 --> 00:40:05.049
care

00:39:58.219 --> 00:40:07.880
um but yet do people just get enriched

00:40:05.049 --> 00:40:11.209
being I don't want to call them slum

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:13.189
Lords necessarily but yeah how much is

00:40:11.209 --> 00:40:14.299
this house worth on the open market I

00:40:13.189 --> 00:40:16.369
don't know maybe like forty five

00:40:14.299 --> 00:40:20.599
thousand dollars in cash day of purchase

00:40:16.369 --> 00:40:22.279
all right well what are we charged seven

00:40:20.599 --> 00:40:24.319
hundred dollars a month times six

00:40:22.279 --> 00:40:30.670
bedrooms oh yeah no you can get that

00:40:24.319 --> 00:40:30.670
easy strange world but

00:40:32.829 --> 00:40:38.259
it was a good time I can't deny that all

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:40.390
right regular snow not regular secret

00:40:38.259 --> 00:40:42.849
room did we actually get bookworm not

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:44.440
quite I'm going to keep teleport 2.0

00:40:42.849 --> 00:40:47.289
owner away we can't get error rooms

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:48.940
after the Cathedral I think so or I

00:40:47.289 --> 00:40:50.319
don't even think we can get air rooms on

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:53.769
the Cathedral to the best of my

00:40:50.319 --> 00:40:56.469
knowledge so I think this is it for

00:40:53.769 --> 00:41:00.069
teleport 2.0 and you know what you did a

00:40:56.469 --> 00:41:01.719
thing I'm not there's not the greatest

00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:06.130
golden teleporters we've ever had but

00:41:01.719 --> 00:41:08.019
it's certainly you know not bad and at

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:10.989
this point I mean we've gotten in in one

00:41:08.019 --> 00:41:14.229
floor we basically went from me thinking

00:41:10.989 --> 00:41:17.380
that had a good chance to die to feeling

00:41:14.229 --> 00:41:20.170
like words pretty much on killable here

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:23.440
I was going to say I wish we had nine

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:29.459
lives but who cares like weird look at

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:29.459
this run it's extremely unlikely that

00:41:30.479 --> 00:41:35.859
that anything bad happens to us on this

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:37.839
run which I feel like is the thing you

00:41:35.859 --> 00:41:41.739
say just before bad things happen to you

00:41:37.839 --> 00:41:42.999
but we got nothing to done nothing to

00:41:41.739 --> 00:41:46.959
worry about we got keys

00:41:42.999 --> 00:41:49.209
we got luck we're got in Vince ability

00:41:46.959 --> 00:41:50.709
that I'm not even using and for once we

00:41:49.209 --> 00:41:52.269
can actually ignore doing our due

00:41:50.709 --> 00:41:54.900
diligence which honestly just makes it

00:41:52.269 --> 00:41:58.029
that much sweeter like let me tell you

00:41:54.900 --> 00:42:00.279
when you when you always do your

00:41:58.029 --> 00:42:03.640
homework it's that much sweeter when you

00:42:00.279 --> 00:42:05.319
skip it that's the thing it's like

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:10.150
everything in moderation including

00:42:05.319 --> 00:42:11.829
moderation right if you never do your

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:14.709
homework I can't imagine you know

00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:16.119
skipping it on day with 300 feels as

00:42:14.709 --> 00:42:17.410
good as it did on day one you know

00:42:16.119 --> 00:42:23.380
you're always trying to get back to that

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:25.630
that first high could be wrong I

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:31.239
basically never know what I'm talking

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:33.699
about so but unlike all other youtubers

00:42:31.239 --> 00:42:35.650
and streamers who also don't know what

00:42:33.699 --> 00:42:37.119
they thought they're talking about I at

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:40.359
least admit that I don't know what I'm

00:42:37.119 --> 00:42:42.009
talking about it's easy to get a big

00:42:40.359 --> 00:42:44.949
head doing this job sometimes because

00:42:42.009 --> 00:42:46.329
everybody tells you you're a genius and

00:42:44.949 --> 00:42:46.720
you know that oh you're so funny you

00:42:46.329 --> 00:42:49.990
make my

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:54.430
so much better you know those are honest

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:56.770
comments I'm sure not just gassing you

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:57.910
up and it they're much appreciated but

00:42:56.770 --> 00:42:59.440
at the same time you always got to

00:42:57.910 --> 00:43:03.310
remind yourself you're actually just

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:08.470
kind of like like a normal person who

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:10.390
might be a little clever but maybe not I

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:12.369
don't know you know it's like that

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:16.540
you're you're also mortal thing

00:43:12.369 --> 00:43:19.420
I can't imagine dude like this sounds it

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:23.050
sounds like a weird thing to say but I'm

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:25.030
really glad that I didn't make it as a

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:29.410
professional youtuber when I was like

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:31.180
literally 18 years old not that I was in

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:35.590
the market at the time the point is like

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:39.790
I don't know what is I I at least worked

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:40.599
like a couple bad jobs see you later

00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:42.400
buddy

00:43:40.599 --> 00:43:45.130
I have no interest in becoming doctor

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:48.880
just on this one but like I at least

00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:51.099
like I'd gotten some perspective I don't

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:52.869
know what it's like if you're like 80 I

00:43:51.099 --> 00:43:55.060
mean it first up I imagine is sweet in

00:43:52.869 --> 00:43:57.520
in many ways but I don't know what it's

00:43:55.060 --> 00:44:00.369
like on a personality standpoint if

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:02.650
you're like just leaving high school

00:44:00.369 --> 00:44:04.930
maybe and you're making like I don't

00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:06.910
know that you totally four times as much

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:10.240
money as like your own parents it's like

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:13.000
some child actor stuff right your

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:14.500
parents are like you know let me should

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.089
really don't be a doctor I don't know

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.560
this vlogging thing is going to work out

00:44:16.089 --> 00:44:20.800
forever and then you're like hey by the

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:22.839
way mom you know I I got paid thirty

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:24.790
thousand dollars this month I don't even

00:44:22.839 --> 00:44:26.710
know how to do long division anymore how

00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:28.599
much you get paid this month oh maybe I

00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:31.480
should just go be a nurse like you right

00:44:28.599 --> 00:44:34.390
like I think now I'm not I haven't met

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:36.849
any like 18 year old youtubers that I

00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:39.220
have this experience with but I can't

00:44:36.849 --> 00:44:42.580
imagine dude like well of course we'll

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:44.859
go down here I think that has the

00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:47.589
potential to just make for some if you

00:44:44.859 --> 00:44:50.020
had the the possibility within you to be

00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:53.320
like a terrible person I think that that

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:55.180
level of of Fame at a young age could

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:56.890
actually bring it out in a big way I

00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:57.609
mean I guess in the end it comes down to

00:44:56.890 --> 00:44:59.559
whatever kind of

00:44:57.609 --> 00:45:01.869
person you are to begin with like what

00:44:59.559 --> 00:45:03.519
kind of kind of stuff you got going on

00:45:01.869 --> 00:45:08.759
inside yourself from the strength of

00:45:03.519 --> 00:45:08.759
your character but I can't even imagine

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:17.200
like especially if you were like like

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:19.599
matp raps or something like that you

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:22.470
might be making like like five hundred

00:45:19.599 --> 00:45:26.700
thousand dollars or more per year as a

00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:29.200
thirteen-year-old doing rap cover songs

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:31.569
that's crazy I can't even imagine the

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:33.180
effects that you ever have like he's

00:45:31.569 --> 00:45:35.289
like someone in your high school and

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:36.819
then you're like wow that guy's a dick

00:45:35.289 --> 00:45:38.890
why is he such a dick

00:45:36.819 --> 00:45:41.309
oh he's the highest score on our high

00:45:38.890 --> 00:45:44.819
school basketball team that is like

00:45:41.309 --> 00:45:47.890
ranked 35th in the state like that

00:45:44.819 --> 00:45:49.869
breeds kind of like it has the potential

00:45:47.890 --> 00:45:52.180
to breed some like you know alpha

00:45:49.869 --> 00:45:55.450
nonsense out of it imaginable why is

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:57.220
that guy acting so high and mighty he

00:45:55.450 --> 00:46:00.460
just bought a mom a Lamborghini for his

00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:03.819
birthday and he skipped class in sixth

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:11.859
period you know I I just can't even

00:46:03.819 --> 00:46:13.539
fathom it did I just not pick this up

00:46:11.859 --> 00:46:17.829
earlier I don't even remember doing this

00:46:13.539 --> 00:46:21.670
room I'm sure there's there's counter

00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:24.849
examples of you know people who have

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:27.700
made it big or big ish at a young age

00:46:24.849 --> 00:46:34.799
and then we're totally fine I just think

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:34.799
like I can't even imagine man

00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:39.730
I know how many times have said that but

00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:43.870
you get the idea the idea is I cannot

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:47.680
even imagine man didn't really exist

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:50.200
when I was a kid it still I imagine it's

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:54.610
extremely rare now but when I was a kid
