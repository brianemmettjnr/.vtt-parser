00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.230
hey everybody welcome back to the land

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.700
place if anybody's a gay after birth

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.649
plus and it really is after birth plus

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.469
now we're doing the dang old after birth

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:17.970
plus challenges April's fool Oh what is

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:24.090
this one is this every item has the

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:26.220
wrong description but oh no yes it is

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.689
April's fool is challenged 32 the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.789
challenge changes all floor bosses to

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.199
the bloat changes pedestal items and

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.730
pickups to actually be something else

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.100
and displays your location as a random

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.079
room on the map your goal is to defeat a

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.850
moms heart which is also the bloat okay

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.040
so every boss is the bloat so it would

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.739
be nice if we got something good in our

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:49.590
first room I shouldn't have picked it up

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:53.210
okay well I still shouldn't have picked

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:57.420
it up because we don't know what it is

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.100
we know what it is now sorry I my

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.859
commentary might be a little confusing

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.260
on this one and the reason for that is

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.150
because nothing is as it seems on this

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.970
one so let me go back through this

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:14.880
what's going on with this challenge

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:18.210
every boss is the bloat every item

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.460
displays an item that it's not and then

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.170
when you pick it up you have to kind of

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.020
like reverse engineer what it actually

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:33.270
is don't have any bombs unfortunately

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:34.540
does the bloat shoot bombs I don't

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.250
believe so

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.990
I would like you to shoot some bombs

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:46.649
please and act acquiesce that tinted

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:51.179
rock for me worth it

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.409
HP well-spent or just give me a bomb for

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.729
completing this room which of course we

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.259
will not know if it came in the form of

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.210
an item because the items are all gonna

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.649
lie to us but this isn't that bad I mean

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.759
I don't like fighting the blow to any

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.200
more than the next guy and especially

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.600
you know fighting the blow in the early

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.369
game is extremely annoying but not

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.720
knowing what items do until after we

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.640
picked them up that's like a northern

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.190
lion original this challenge is made for

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.879
love and me baby and I was made for

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.130
loving it I can't get enough of it baby

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.720
I shouldn't have tried to do that even

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:28.079
as I was doing it I was like this is

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:30.030
dumb this also seems like one of those

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:33.959
challenges where you probably just want

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.310
to restart until you determine if you

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.519
get something good from your first item

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:43.799
room and if you do then you know the

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:45.989
world's your burrito but if you don't

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.519
you're fighting the bloat without really

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.519
any advantages whatsoever

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.280
I still let you know I want you to be

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:55.750
invested in this run and for you to be

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.090
invested in this run I have to be

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.090
invested in this run which means I have

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.040
to give it my all right now despite the

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:09.120
fact that it looks not very good right

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:12.400
now one of those situations where we

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.530
just kill to have a little bit of that

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.530
stupid damage we took earlier back now

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.090
no I described I sincerely tried okay

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.730
let's try again we don't know what it is

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.160
might as well pick it up Book of Shadows

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.410
totally fine it's a totally okay item

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.750
I'm a little bummed I am a little bummed

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:45.310
by the way it went down but that's life

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.720
as long as we know that the map position

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.460
is lying to us by the way we should have

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.770
an okay chance to actually be able to

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:55.120
use the map effectively like I have no

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.470
idea where we are but actually I do now

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.760
I'm in the room that's right next to

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.030
this room which means we want to go down

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.400
on this room okay I'm I'm sussing you

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.900
out Tyrone try to give me this like a

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:11.440
House of Leaves nonsense

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:14.140
I got you I know how you think we found

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.640
our boss fight I might just not even

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:22.480
worry about the map in the future but

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:24.360
for now obviously what I use the Book of

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.100
Shadows and yet I have no invincibility

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:31.680
so the I so what does Book of Shadows do

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.680
then nothing it just does nothing

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:45.730
why so I think I've determined getting

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.400
an active item is like the worst

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.500
possible scenario because not only does

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.900
the pedestal lie to you but then the

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.790
item itself actually lies to you if this

00:04:52.900 --> 00:05:00.850
was actually Book of Shadows it would be

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:03.100
a pretty strong get right now instead

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.920
because it ain't Book of Shadows

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.950
I actually just don't even know what it

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.950
is

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:17.140
we used our space bar item we got

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:20.680
nothing out of it we're doing all right

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:23.020
though taking our time to perfect the

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:28.810
beat and we still got love for the IIIi

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:29.980
II we just need to take essentially zero

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.080
dumb damage because I mean we got

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.450
another floor after this but actually

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:39.310
this is like the last challenge but done

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:41.230
over again because this one the start of

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.450
the run should be the hardest part of it

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.590
and the end of the run should be the

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:49.780
easiest part of it

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:51.550
why is this while the blowed ain't

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:57.220
getting any easier at the start of a run

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:58.480
so it's really like it doesn't get any

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.550
harder than this we're not losing any

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.770
items the more floors we do the more

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.770
items are gonna get random or otherwise

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.680
just a couple damage upgrades that's all

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:15.040
it takes

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:18.360
no no you're almost done don't get

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.360
behind that don't get behind that

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:27.900
all those dangerous but necessary we've

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:31.470
done it live through a floor we get

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:34.620
pageant boy which gave us money so you

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:35.880
know but some of these are we got red

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.390
hearts out of some of them and we have

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.750
no money

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:43.200
I don't know what to tell you honestly

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:46.760
so everything lies to you on these rats

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:49.440
that's just worth noting do we even have

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.960
keys I don't know I'm assuming that

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.670
that's the case yes but we'll wait and

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.010
see that we get to our item room so

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:58.170
pageant boy actually gave us 7 cents but

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:59.430
each cent was a random consumable one of

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.470
which was a black cart one of which was

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.420
a golden heart two of which were keys

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:07.580
and I don't even know what the summons

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.580
some of them are red hearts apparently

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:21.080
he's done it Roccat sinus infection good

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:24.470
item and actually does what it's saying

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:26.930
it does okay give us a random pill bombs

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:30.020
are key except it wasn't bombs are key

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:32.710
it was actually a speed downgrade what

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.710
did you do what

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:41.420
how many golden hearts are there and how

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:47.960
are the golden hearts set up like this

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:48.770
this is very confusing to me I don't

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.630
know dude

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.310
it actually seems great that Penny's

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:55.280
become random consumables because it's

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:56.990
leading us to have quite a lot of hearts

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.610
we otherwise would not have access to

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.590
right now I think we're off to the races

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.540
straight up I think we're actually in a

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:04.370
very very good position right now we're

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:07.430
going to get a deal with the devil kind

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:09.170
of amazingly our booger tears are gonna

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:12.620
allow us to whittle down the bloat

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:14.720
pretty I wouldn't say quickly but not in

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.790
as long as it might normally take and we

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.190
found our second secret room which is

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:21.410
very confusing ly up here now the

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:25.880
downside is that spirit hearts are also

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:27.770
random so it's actually we get a random

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:36.400
space bar item every room so we got like

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:36.400
metronome or maybe Dead Sea Scrolls

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:43.890
that was how to jump so I would not be

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:45.329
shy about replacing our our spacebar

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.950
item not that we would know that our

00:08:45.329 --> 00:08:48.990
spacebar our item was even being

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:51.959
replaced until it was already too late

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:52.320
to do anything about it but just stay

00:08:51.959 --> 00:08:55.560
still

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:59.250
yeah honestly not even mad the more time

00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:03.470
I can spend with you getting eroded by

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:07.649
these booger tears better my life is

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:10.019
unfortunately yeah yeah yeah stack them

00:09:07.649 --> 00:09:14.430
up stick them up ah I might be kind of a

00:09:10.019 --> 00:09:16.829
moron give me some more spirit arts I'm

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:19.250
all doing there goes our deal with the

00:09:16.829 --> 00:09:19.250
devil chance

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:29.450
I'm slowly losing my mind look at our HP

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:31.650
what happened it look getting a single

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:34.590
golden heart is like all you need to

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:38.460
bust this run wide open apparently we

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:40.350
got a speed upgrade but for getting hit

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.930
a few times we've replenished all of our

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:45.480
golden hearts and then also got like an

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:48.630
unbelievable amount of HP along the side

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:50.160
of it so you'll forgive me if I think

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.660
that like the golden heart is kind of

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.620
you know kick-started our heart and

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:56.520
we'll never stop

00:09:52.620 --> 00:10:00.150
hello Ruka go ahead hit me take my gold

00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:05.520
in the heart see what happens I don't

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:07.710
know what that was I would welcome

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:11.100
shoopdawhoop because even if it's not

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:15.360
shipped to woob it's a new item which

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:17.430
might even be better than or worse those

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:20.060
are the options as I see them I don't

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:25.650
want to be too controversial

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:28.970
shoopdawhoop but but is it

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:28.970

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:38.360
it's monster man well not a great choice

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:42.589
so we got our golden hardback and some

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:44.540
HP in the process I almost feel like we

00:10:42.589 --> 00:10:46.549
should just sack all of our golden

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:53.720
hearts like it's the only thing that

00:10:46.549 --> 00:10:56.509
makes sense here you think I never get

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:58.670
annoyed by this cat way to eat comes in

00:10:56.509 --> 00:11:01.549
here and then he wants some pets that's

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:03.049
no problem I'm happy to pay then he goes

00:11:01.549 --> 00:11:05.269
oh you're not petting me enough so he

00:11:03.049 --> 00:11:06.589
tries to jump behind the computer and we

00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:09.319
Jones spying the computer I got to stop

00:11:06.589 --> 00:11:12.739
the video and go no no and then all the

00:11:09.319 --> 00:11:15.499
comments go Peter you gotta go Peter the

00:11:12.739 --> 00:11:17.420
interval abuse and like 99% of them are

00:11:15.499 --> 00:11:25.910
joking but I don't even know about the

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:29.749
1% you see this guy okay do we care

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:31.309
about our item room probably but not as

00:11:29.749 --> 00:11:39.259
much as I care about making progress

00:11:31.309 --> 00:11:41.629
here I don't know what that was did it

00:11:39.259 --> 00:11:43.850
cost us a golden heart or give us money

00:11:41.629 --> 00:11:47.179
or maybe it gave us the pageant boy

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:49.549
effect I have I'm actually uncomfortable

00:11:47.179 --> 00:11:53.209
in the confusion it's an environment in

00:11:49.549 --> 00:11:54.589
which I flourish oh you know you don't

00:11:53.209 --> 00:11:55.970
even have to sweat it cake ever

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:57.079
hey this is the challenge I don't know

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:58.970
if you did all the afterbirth Plus

00:11:57.079 --> 00:12:04.160
challenges on this one

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:05.779
everyone is bloat yeah April Fool's like

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.189
all of them just lie to you you know oh

00:12:05.779 --> 00:12:09.739
we got a Cuba meet you got to keep meet

00:12:07.189 --> 00:12:12.980
that it doesn't matter cuz they give us

00:12:09.739 --> 00:12:14.749
so many golden hearts typically over

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:17.480
that time we only got half of all we got

00:12:14.749 --> 00:12:20.839
belly button which is like useless and

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:22.610
then but what is it at it's for real the

00:12:20.839 --> 00:12:28.850
mark oh my god it's a damage upgrade

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:31.209
after all this time is there a Toma on

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:31.209
YouTube

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:38.170
[Music]

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:44.470
the I honestly this CAD needs a

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:49.870
supervisor sometimes no no yes will I go

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:53.440
to a cursed room I don't want to now I

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:57.010

please yes we got our we got our good

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.730
stuff back why do I want to go now well

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:03.460
because we don't go back into the curse

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:05.260
room to get our consumables back so and

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:08.890
we even got another golden hard right

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:10.750
there all is phase two yeah he comes up

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.700
here and he goes like hey what you doing

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:16.420
I don't want to disrupt you or anything

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:20.500
but could you possibly be petting me

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:22.960
what could you pet me now please

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:28.660
and he'll like maybe do a little elbow

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:30.850
lick he goes then he'll lay down on my

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:33.460
like Mouse hand there my keyboard hands

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:37.960
and be like why aren't you petting me

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:40.120
don't I look cute right now he's doing a

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:44.380
little side-to-side head tilt but if you

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:48.010
ever pet him you've already lost because

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:50.800
you'd think like it would say she ate

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:52.950
him but now like one pet it just makes

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.370
him hungrier for more pets in the future

00:13:52.950 --> 00:14:00.470
[Music]

00:13:54.370 --> 00:14:06.400
exactly correct it's a gateway pet one

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:09.430
touch is never enough more golden hearts

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.720
don't look at me like that I see you

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:17.630
he's like is everything okay

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:23.270
okay fine there's a pen oh so good Ruka

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:25.880
boy oh well done he's acting like I'm

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:30.400
the unclean one where I petted him he's

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:34.010
licking himself a little rude honestly

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:41.600
you know you pooping a big robot full of

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:47.900
sand golden what in the world just

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:51.920
happened we what that was a great item

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:53.780
we got mini mush and little Gish still

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:56.900
pretty good not as good as displayed but

00:14:53.780 --> 00:15:01.670
like okay that was v6 or inside ice

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:07.340
shard I think as long as we have gold in

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:10.040
the hearts we we cannot be stopped now

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:11.780
as for why we got like 11 gold in the

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.410
hearts there I have no idea but I'm a

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:16.820
happy man

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:18.590
I don't know I'm choosing to take this

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:22.550
April Fool's run as it comes basically

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:26.240
because you know it's like we're riding

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:28.280
on a river full of waves and we're going

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.900
how do I avoid the waves not some of the

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:33.110
waves can't be avoided you know you just

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:34.550
got to steer into them or you just got

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:36.339
to say hey it's gonna be bumpy let's

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:38.720
accepting

00:15:36.339 --> 00:15:39.290
as long as we got golden hearts we can't

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:43.579
be stopped

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:45.910
it's an HP upgrade see this is like it

00:15:43.579 --> 00:15:48.610
never stops

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:52.480
my whole life especially when recording

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:55.360
is like these cats they just come in and

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:56.950
then they before I start recording they

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.420
don't care then I start recording and

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:59.800
they bang on the door and then I open

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.630
the door and they come in and then I

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.880
start recording again and they bang on

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:11.890
the door and they want out it just they

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:16.000
have no respect for for authority here

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:17.560
he goes no oh I thought he was getting

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.080
behind the computer get out of your

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:27.010
stinky bloat we need to just use Guppies

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:28.390
paw it's not a good option for us some

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:31.530
of these golden hearts are not paying

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:35.430
out the way that I feel that they should

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:38.430
makes me an unhappy boy

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:40.830
you let the devil please deal with the

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:42.270
devil you got mr. Dahle we really need

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:42.450
her to tears upgrade so I'm okay with

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.550
that

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:46.560
we got a headless baby which is okay at

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:48.330
best and we got a missing page too which

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:50.190
is not good but I figured we'd take a

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.450
crack at it regardless because you know

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:52.680
the more items you get the more chances

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:55.440
we get decided to get something

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.850
game-breaking there's one only goes to

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.450
mom's heart by the way so what are we at

00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:00.750
right now

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:06.270
necropolis one and against like all odds

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:08.400
we're ahead of schedule so hilariously

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:10.620
we might be able to do boss rush what

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.540
worries me about boss rush is every boss

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:14.400
going to be the bloat if we do boss rush

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:16.110
if so is there any way that I could

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:19.559
conceivably avoid it because it would be

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:21.240
hilarious to do it I don't know we'll

00:17:19.559 --> 00:17:25.800
have to we'll have to cross that bridge

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:28.170
when we come to it I suppose I am

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.820
actually still of the opinion that you

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:35.040
know if you ever hit me I'm just

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:36.900
stronger like you cannot actually deal

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.520
damage to me this is the most empowered

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:40.020
to Cuba meat has ever been for me in my

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:45.600
entire life

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:48.350
give me a black market it is not a black

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:50.610
market but it is three golden hearts

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:53.520
alright I was off by a little bit but

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:56.370
still pretty good there's no reason to

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:59.600
sleep we don't want spirit arts we

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.600
already have black hops

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:08.950
again you can kind of decipher the map

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:08.950
what did I tell you we only get stronger

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:21.500
if you're if you're looking for the

00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:26.890
right clues you can sorta decipher the

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:29.929
map it's not easy to do on the fly but

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:31.490
it's okay forego not particularly strong

00:18:29.929 --> 00:18:33.529
but again there's I don't think there's

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:40.580
any point to using the reroll machine in

00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:41.990
there because we got the mail because we

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:46.640
don't know what it's gonna be regardless

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:48.289
so and regardless we don't want to get

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:50.419
involved with all the lawyers and judges

00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:52.850
just to hold grudges in the courtroom I

00:18:50.419 --> 00:18:55.250
know you'd like to think your don't

00:18:52.850 --> 00:19:00.460
stank but lean a little bit closer see

00:18:55.250 --> 00:19:04.730
roses really smell like poo poo poo yeah

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:07.340
better come back down to Mars girl quit

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:12.610
chasing cars what happens when the dole

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:12.610
gets low girl you ain't that fine no way

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:20.710
Kenan attend goofy outcast track I'll

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.710
say it

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:28.900
I'm not afraid to tell the truth

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:34.030
that's a weird Tintin truck all right we

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:37.780
do have the the trinket that lets you

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:39.250
see tinted rocks we got magic 8-ball

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:40.900
which is not particularly good I'm

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:43.000
assuming the cards have random effects

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:49.570
so who knows what this will do for me

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:51.610
little brim dude actually fine and still

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:55.750
pretty much killing it from an HP

00:19:51.610 --> 00:20:00.370
perspective I really really do not want

00:19:55.750 --> 00:20:02.830
to do boss rush but I also acquiesce

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:04.920
that if it's all bloat it would be

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:04.920
hilarious

00:20:11.769 --> 00:20:23.450
our damage is still relatively not good

00:20:15.409 --> 00:20:25.970
I don't there's something wrong with the

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:27.249
golden hard like spawning code but I'm

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:31.100
gonna take advantage of it

00:20:27.249 --> 00:20:33.649
epic AK that's amazing ruins booger

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:36.230
tears but otherwise like really really

00:20:33.649 --> 00:20:39.440
strong item for us is it actually gives

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:48.529
us the ability to like hit and hurt

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:51.909
enemies which is not particularly common

00:20:48.529 --> 00:21:00.649
in Isaac lately I mean you saw the last

00:20:51.909 --> 00:21:03.289
refresh run we did ended up with three

00:21:00.649 --> 00:21:05.749
point five damage on Sheol not exactly

00:21:03.289 --> 00:21:08.480
an ideal course of action from my

00:21:05.749 --> 00:21:11.119
perspective but it's not like we had any

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:15.700
control over it so anytime I get a

00:21:11.119 --> 00:21:15.700
chance to screw the game I'm a happy man

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:28.560
cuz lord knows they'll do it back to you

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:32.850
maybe not the best attitude to have but

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:35.220
not a secret room once we get to a floor

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:38.250
where we have like dead ends on the

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:44.490
regular that's where like my watch ends

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:49.080
because I have no idea so we're probably

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:52.140
like I don't okay I know just amazed too

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:56.450
huh we want to be like as left as we can

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:58.230
get Gillette the leftist and man can get

00:21:56.450 --> 00:22:00.350
didn't really come out the way I

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:00.350
intended

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:18.380
it's a really fun challenge they should

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:22.550
have taken out Kirsten amazed like with

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:26.810
curse of the maze it's not possible to

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:29.120
see what's happening with respect to the

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:36.250
map so now we want to find like a way to

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:39.110
move left I almost like you know what

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:40.520
you can play this game we know we need

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:42.170
to move left what if we just like

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:45.230
Kirsten the maze do it for us okay

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:49.600
that's sacrilege so my mistake

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:49.600
we could also just get an emperor card

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.240
hermit card okay

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:56.590
hermit took us to the deal with the

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:59.630
devil where we got the book of sin which

00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:05.870
is actually the sprinkler and as a

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:08.780
result is a nightmare and the shade

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:16.630
which was actually mom's knife okay okay

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:19.480
we freed ourselves good lord

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:23.800
get me out of here I'm a celebrity sorta

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:25.180
get me out of here I always I mean

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.500
that's a that's a British show I haven't

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:27.670
seen any episodes of it but I always

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:30.100
thought the name was great I'm a

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:31.870
celebrity get me out of here never

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:34.600
thought like maybe try that one out on

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:37.000
the on a sinking ship or something like

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.930
that women &amp; children first I've got

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.230
over a hundred thousand Twitter

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:42.670
followers so uh let me off the boat and

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:47.800
I'll give it a five-star review in a

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:51.550
video is there any I don't think we've

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:59.710
gone this way we need to find a way to

00:23:51.550 --> 00:24:02.700
go left don't teleport me please oh it's

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:02.700
new that's a new room

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:09.980
we don't need spirit hearts we also

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:09.980
don't need your thought control

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:17.220
it's hilarious to me that we've gotten

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:21.210
like no money over the course of this

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:24.620
run double bloat also it does get a

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:24.620
little tougher in these boss rooms

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:32.990
Polaroid of course that makes a lot of

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:37.010
sense in hindsight that's the sprinkler

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:41.870
well I mean we got it they're not all

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:44.230
bloat well honestly I'm a little

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:44.230
offended

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:53.140
I guess we have the one up as a familiar

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.140
on this room

00:24:59.659 --> 00:25:03.750
I'm not displeased with this run but I

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:05.220
really thought we were gonna fight gloat

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:10.309
gloat gloat gloat gloat gloat gloat

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:10.309
gloat gloat that was blood rights

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:20.279
at least we get to break up the monotony

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:21.179
applying the same boss over and over and

00:25:20.279 --> 00:25:26.370
by monotony

00:25:21.179 --> 00:25:29.880
I mean mehat Annie because I'm

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:33.510
struggling man this Rodney you know when

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:35.250
the run zanier than I am where I start

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:37.380
to ask some questions

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:40.710
that was not High Priestess in fact I

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:44.340
think that was a question mark card that

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:49.909
used shoopdawhoop which could be a

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:49.909
coincidence or could just be weird

00:25:58.739 --> 00:26:07.149
or maybe it shot little brimstone

00:26:04.989 --> 00:26:13.720
through something that changed the color

00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:14.919
of its laser I don't know man I'm just

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.539
trying to get over the fact that we're

00:26:14.919 --> 00:26:21.070
doing this all for an item we don't even

00:26:16.539 --> 00:26:23.590
know what the item is gonna be could

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:25.779
ruin our whole run could make the whole

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:27.700
run incredible it's already pretty

00:26:25.779 --> 00:26:31.239
incredible actually we can't really

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:38.919
complain about a epic act moms knife

00:26:31.239 --> 00:26:42.909
high damage situation here nobody like

00:26:38.919 --> 00:26:44.799
ever tell them that it spawns way too

00:26:42.909 --> 00:26:47.529
many golden hearts or at least lets you

00:26:44.799 --> 00:26:49.090
get away too many golden hearts this is

00:26:47.529 --> 00:26:53.229
a beautiful thing and should be allowed

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:55.149
to survive the problem is you know in

00:26:53.229 --> 00:26:56.769
these booster packs they put all the

00:26:55.149 --> 00:26:59.830
mods in and this is the way I see it at

00:26:56.769 --> 00:27:02.979
least I could be wrong but mod makers

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:05.200
are not making items that's like you

00:27:02.979 --> 00:27:07.179
know damage upgrade they're making cool

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:09.779
items that are like a here's like a tear

00:27:07.179 --> 00:27:12.279
effect you've never considered before

00:27:09.779 --> 00:27:13.289
unfortunately varicose veins is actually

00:27:12.279 --> 00:27:14.950
pretty good

00:27:13.289 --> 00:27:17.080
unfortunately that leads to situations

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:19.059
where there's like in my opinion an

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:21.700
under-representation of tears and damage

00:27:19.059 --> 00:27:24.009
upgrades in the in the item pool now and

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:27.700
as a result find yourself having base

00:27:24.009 --> 00:27:32.249
damage a lot more frequently than you

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:32.249
used to I think

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:39.019
at least that's the way I see it

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:49.490
what is Dennis Miller saying it's just a

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:49.490
rant what's the deal with mod items

00:27:51.049 --> 00:27:57.750
don't wanna move

00:27:53.370 --> 00:28:00.840
I just wanna jump down dump damn denim

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:05.039
overly reductive look at Jerry

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:08.940
Seinfeld's comedy hey Jerry how you

00:28:05.039 --> 00:28:12.360
feeling come with the coma saw joke

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:16.200

three moves in French 7 7 al and comme

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:21.350

00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:25.769
says Michelle

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:28.049
c'mon Sava and you say 7 mal it's gonna

00:28:25.769 --> 00:28:31.950
make the dynamic of the class kite weird

00:28:28.049 --> 00:28:33.330
you know you always say 7 or you say

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:37.200
comme si comme sigh if you're the class

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:38.399
clown if you say seven mouths it's like

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:41.929
you gotta talk to the teacher after

00:28:38.399 --> 00:28:41.929
class to make sure your life's ok

00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:51.059
northernlion your french accent that

00:28:46.019 --> 00:28:53.909
makes me want to die I'm sorry ok I live

00:28:51.059 --> 00:28:55.350
in North America the North American

00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:57.990
attitude about languages you should be

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:59.639
lucky we even speak English we're

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:04.019
getting pretty close to our own dialogue

00:28:59.639 --> 00:29:06.090
of you know yah yah yah eat can I get a

00:29:04.019 --> 00:29:08.820
boneless people huh you know we're all

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:12.080
like robbing our own little world

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:12.080
dialectic when speaking

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:21.780
we used the razor there we're one floor

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:23.910
away from being free of this strange

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:25.980
prison so I'm pretty excited old bandage

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:29.840
is essentially irrelevant although we do

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.840
have a permanent polaroid invincibility

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.670
maybe something to be said about that

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:53.360
copies head great oh forget me now

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:53.360
actually what huh what

00:29:54.520 --> 00:30:02.980
so can we just use infinite space bar

00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:05.650
items thanks to IV bag there's no way

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:09.520
this ends up like not crash in the game

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:22.960
right like we're even are we are we

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:29.740

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:32.760
hey I can see ever I did I didn't think

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:34.990
it was possible I did have some people

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.580
message me after I made fun of Chad

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:37.900

a song from like my childhood that I'm

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:04.330
embarrassed if you looked at like my

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:06.600
sixth grade came out when I was in

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:09.840
eighth grade actually winamp

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:15.820
you can see that it had like 300 plays

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:20.580
how could that be look what love gave us

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:27.130

flies look it seems like we have a lot

00:32:04.609 --> 00:32:07.429
of flies I bet actually that was from

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.679
mashing the spacebar and getting a bunch

00:32:07.429 --> 00:32:17.859

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:48.630
like a super blow I might consider it

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:54.550
