##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.629
hey everybody welcoming her in the land

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.020
plays The Binding of Isaac after birth

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.639
Plus this is the wrong save file but I

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.990
have to admit it was very satisfying

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.269
going through every single one of these

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.190
characters and being like oh my god when

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.049
did I do this that doesn't make sense we

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.940
got a lot to do but we're slowly getting

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.840
there and it's a great metaphor for life

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.970
you know we look at this you look at

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.430
this and you go oh my god

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.810
we don't even have a rerun done you know

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.220
so many of these characters are barely

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.500
started in their posted notes when you

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.520
go back you go to here and you go oh my

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.160
god I could never possibly achieve this

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:43.070
what a Herculean task laid out in front

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:47.100
of me how do you get from here to here

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:53.370
one run at a time my dudes one run at a

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:59.579
time um we should probably do a greedier

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:02.129
run huh who deserves it Isaac's looking

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.809
good Maggie's got a lot to do but we're

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.549
gonna have to play Maggie so much that

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.590
maybe it doesn't matter Oh Maggie I

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.100
don't know she's already got the like

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.020
void handled certainly not Judas Judas

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.700
is like close to the end you don't want

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.689
to run a blue baby greedier that seems

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:23.729
like a nightmare and I'm ready for that

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:26.310
I'm in the zone that's like a perfect by

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.759
the way here's our seed one g63 q MP e

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.130
well balanced alphanumeric seed I'm okay

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.350
with that we're gonna get a decent rate

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.240
of fire increase but the HP is very very

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.950
important as blue baby here so for one

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.939
key we can get a key in a pill time will

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.710
tell whether or not that's a good

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.560
decision in my time I mean somebody else

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.970
playing the seed who's named time by

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.399
their hippie parents because I am

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.020
probably not gonna spend a key to get a

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.600
key in a pill knowing that that pill

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.640
could be actually deleterious to us in

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.590
the long run by the way out of our poop

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.079
we got a nickel so that item is actually

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.930
for once justified its existence what's

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.610
our game plan well blue baby is a very

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.420
interesting character because you can

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.119
never

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.800
oh that was

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:13.720
at least it wasn't one of the champions

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.250
you can never get red hearts most

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.290
characters even if they start with zero

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.790
or they start with low amounts of HP

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.660
that annoys me

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.099
you can still over time get them to a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.980
point where they have some HP blue baby

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:29.410
is the exception to that rule

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.080
constitutionally incapable of taking red

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.340
hearts or making red hearts have unless

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.540
you change to another character but that

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.910
doesn't help us with post-it note

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.290
situations so what do we do honestly

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.180
probably what we do is we build a

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.390
powerful run that allows us to survive

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.640
and then just before the final boss

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.849
fight we buy like as much HP as is

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.370
necessary to survive that seems like the

00:02:50.849 --> 00:03:01.950
consensus like wisdom for how to survive

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:05.140
a blue baby greedy or mode run really

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.790
like probably should step on this

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.709
freaking button at some point we killed

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.700
like two enemies over the course of the

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.819
head over the course of that wave oh

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.590
Lord

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.980
all right this is the last one though

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.239
it's the champions dude first up we're

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.340
living night and I want to make this

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.709
clear we're living on squeezie time

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.459
right now if a word for squeezy we would

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:30.040
be dead mind you'd like 10 times over

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.750
because not only do we not have any HP

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.389
except for the HP that squeezy gave us

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.980
but you know by a rate of fire our dps

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.620
would be lower so squeezy has been like

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.120
a life saving item but you know squeezy

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.030
wouldn't be anywhere without us either

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.870
without us to glorify its edifice it

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.910
would not oh that hurts me without

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.919
without us squeezy would be nothing it'd

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.319
just be a couple of lines of code

00:03:50.919 --> 00:04:00.390
written in Lua for some reason

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:04.140
now there we go we lived we absolutely

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.269
need the key and then we'll come down

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.359
and check and see what we get in here

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:12.720
it's pretty bad not gonna mince words

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.519
but per floor probably substantially

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.079
more useful than the poop because we can

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:21.269
use it for things like this for example

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.030
and even if it only pays out like two

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:27.110
cents for a floor that's actually fine I

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.310
am gonna take the gamble

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.720
worst case scenario it's a key for a key

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:36.630
even puberty can be good for us but step

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.190
on the button so how do we make doctors

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.720
remote work for us I think we blow up

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.310
everything useful wasn't there the

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.009
father was a tinted rock in our item

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.750
room so we might want to blow that up

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:48.750
but we can also use it to blow up of

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:52.229
course the you know the enemies which

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.509
actually might be a much more important

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.460
use of our time you're gonna die that

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:57.780
was really bad you're not gonna like

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.410
this or maybe you're gonna love it

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.229
actually

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.270
it's very non northernlion me but I'm

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.460
gonna save this doctor's remote charge

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.260
all that was very scary

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.220
I'm gonna save this doctor's remote

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:14.909
charge and I am NOT going to use it to

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:17.550
kill Larry jr. first off we could miss

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:18.930
we can hit one but not both and in that

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.789
case you know all we've really done is

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.440
saved ourselves a little time time is

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:25.830
valuable in fact for many people it's

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.900
the most valuable thing there is but for

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.180
me I've got an abundance of the present

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.500
moment but I don't have an abundance of

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.940
is explosive devices so we will use our

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.830
doctor's remote to blow up the tinted

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.199
rock in the other room if it gives us a

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.760
small rock we're happy if it gives us

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:44.400
spirit arts we're happy if it gives us a

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.930
golden chest our happiness is contingent

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.050
on whatever we find in those golden

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.789
chests which you know it varies we do

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.349
need to live for like the next couple of

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:54.500
seconds here which was looking

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:58.740
surprisingly unlikely

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:01.320
so we'll blow these up I would say that

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.969
were relatively unhappy as a result of

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.969
this but here's what we do

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:09.399
I mean the pill is actually not the

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:11.199
worst idea you blow this guy up okay we

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:15.459
got more than we bargained for which is

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:17.739
perfect I think you blow this up and

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:19.929
look for a spear at hardly we got one we

00:06:17.739 --> 00:06:23.949
got potato peeler potato peelers not

00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:25.209
that good I in fact I'm gonna go all the

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:30.069
way down I'm gonna go down to five cents

00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:31.929
here it's the point keeps us alive spero

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:33.429
rods aren't always gonna be for sale in

00:06:31.929 --> 00:06:35.379
the shop so I figured we'd buy them

00:06:33.429 --> 00:06:36.909
while we have them and yet we still have

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:39.869
a little bit of money left over on the

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:44.669
next floor to start our our dreams with

00:06:39.869 --> 00:06:46.959
so we should have lust and PIN here oh

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:49.029
my god the poops scared the crap out of

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:51.399
me they're not pun like actually

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:55.329
unintended pun apologized is what I

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:57.579
should say I gotta be honestly I think

00:06:55.329 --> 00:06:59.159
lust is probably much much harder to

00:06:57.579 --> 00:07:02.829
fight than pin

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:05.049
although pins HP is apparently higher

00:07:02.829 --> 00:07:06.459
unless lusts HP just didn't factor in

00:07:05.049 --> 00:07:07.599
either way it doesn't matter we're gonna

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:09.759
get our deal at the devil that's the

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:13.179
other factor that's a big positive for

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:15.789
us to have had the ability to buy as

00:07:13.179 --> 00:07:18.129
many spirit hearts as we did we're able

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:19.839
to have enough money to buy enough

00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:21.789
spirit hearts to potentially pick up a

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:24.789
deal with the devil if the deal is

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:27.369
really good Abaddonn ten out of ten

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:29.889
selection right now the pact not

00:07:27.369 --> 00:07:31.599
necessarily bad the mark think about

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:35.499
that instead we got two runes Yara and

00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:38.579
algae's it's tough it is it's tough I

00:07:35.499 --> 00:07:41.049
think we're gonna use Yara right now

00:07:38.579 --> 00:07:42.489
because there's a spirit heart and again

00:07:41.049 --> 00:07:45.189
there won't always be a spirit heart so

00:07:42.489 --> 00:07:47.469
I think that's worth doing and we get to

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:49.149
take a battery charge what's the point

00:07:47.469 --> 00:07:51.039
of the battery charge here we could look

00:07:49.149 --> 00:07:54.039
for a secret room I'd rather just save

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:55.269
the charge to like maybe get a tinted

00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:56.709
rock on the next floor I think we

00:07:55.269 --> 00:08:00.179
handled this floor pretty well except

00:07:56.709 --> 00:08:00.179
for you know taking way too much damage

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:06.669
all right so let's pop into our caves

00:08:03.009 --> 00:08:10.719
room ball of tar is exactly okay binky

00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:14.260
is pretty much just squeezy 2.0 I'm okay

00:08:10.719 --> 00:08:17.110
with this all right then in here

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:19.030
one key gives us a bomb and a card I

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:21.730
will absolutely check that it's like

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:29.080
that old prozac song well a bomb in a

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:31.180
car ah art I really wanna see see it's

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.760
an old it's a Canadian reference you

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:36.550
wouldn't understand it I don't know if

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:38.050
we're all liver is worth it I'm gonna

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.729
take like it what it actually feels like

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:44.020
an extreme gamble we're gonna come in

00:08:39.729 --> 00:08:47.860
here for a spirit heart we're gonna get

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:49.240
a bomb in a penny not a great deal dude

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:52.360
I don't know I think we might want to go

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:54.630
PhD here or me the other alternatives

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:58.770
blow this up

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:58.770
it's tough this is a tough one

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:03.940
toothpicks is not that good cuz we're so

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:06.250
close to the tear cab I think we take

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.630
nun's habit not with the expectation

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:13.150
that nun's habit by the way I'm gonna

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:14.380
try this now that's okay we're gonna

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:18.520
take nun's habit not with the

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:20.530
expectation that that oh my god it

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.120
whipped on all of them now with the

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:23.890
expectation as I've been trying to say

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.390
here if you would so rudely stop

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:27.610
interrupting me

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:29.470
that doctors remote is gonna be good for

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:30.730
us but with the idea that you know if we

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.140
get like a book of revelations or

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:35.530
something like that all of a sudden we

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:36.910
got Katy Perry style teenage dreams here

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:40.690
to help us out what is a Katy Perry

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:42.370
style Teenage Dream I do not know you

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:43.780
might think NL you should understand

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:46.420
that reference it's from your era you

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.890
would be wrong when Katy Perry was

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.690
popular I was not listening to Katy

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:52.150
Perry I considered myself above pop

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:53.890
music which was a very ignorant opinion

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:55.690
to hold I was listening to mission to

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:57.670
Burma mission of Burma

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:59.230
you know I was listening to you know

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:02.580
James Blake and I ain't talking about

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:02.580
the American tennis pro

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:18.250
just listening to wolf parade and other

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:20.230
Montreal indie rock staples oh excuse me

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:22.710
sir we're actually getting pretty lucky

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:25.930
like we're we're clearly strong enough

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:27.310
to handle most of the waves the fact

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.470
that there's like a lot of champions is

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:30.610
super annoying but like we're getting

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:33.280
through it regardless it's not

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:39.630
necessarily easy but it's it's not

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:42.130
proving to be super difficult either and

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:43.570
when we get the right style wave like

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:45.340
that one for example we can really take

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:47.500
out like a half of it with a single

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.910
charge which is not ten out of ten

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.790
something like shoopdawhoop would be

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:53.740
same charge much more value per charge

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:55.420
but we're getting something going here

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.310
unfortunately you know we already

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:59.590
purchased a lot on this floor so we

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:01.780
might not be able to purchase much extra

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:03.520
but we'll see we probably got one more

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:06.010
item left in us plus a potential deal

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.480
with the devil we didn't take our last

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:10.230
deal well actually we did take our last

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:12.520
deal with the devil it was just runes so

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:14.920
we could get a deal with the angel at

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.630
which point we'd love to have doctors

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.800
remote remaining but I guess it's not

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:24.610
that relevant in the whole scheme of

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:27.970
things is it okay moving on a single NV

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:29.380
not plausible to kill in 13 seconds but

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:31.780
that's okay because we might fight an

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:36.280
enemy that kills the other NV part's

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:38.460
relatively quickly potentially so keep

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:41.080
as few of them on the screen as possible

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:43.000
not gonna do much to stop Andy let's be

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:45.760
honest but both of these enemies and

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:50.260
both of these n of these are pretty not

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:51.640
tanky so we just hold our charge we can

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.290
use it for the deal with the devil wave

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:55.390
you might say hey why not save it for

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:58.060
the chance for blowing up an angel

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:59.890
statue that's like a maybe it's too much

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:02.650
of a maybe and this run is already

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:04.570
enough of them maybe for me too cool not

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:06.810
want to add any more uncertainty in my

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.810
life

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:12.890
no it's keep it's the spirit is a nice

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:17.300
you keep one thing steady and the other

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:18.950
thing you just go buck wild if you got

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:21.760
everything going buck wild that's just

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:24.680
you know you're living a life of chaos

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.810
and you keep one thing steady and go off

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.970
the off the chain but the other thing

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:30.830
that's more positive I think I'm gonna

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:31.430
spend like two cents to get a reroll

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:34.640
there you go

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:36.920
it's actually absolutely fine I think

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:41.360
that that is perfect lump of coal is a

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:43.490
decent upgrade for us that is like

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:48.320
exactly worth the amount of money that

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:49.910
it costs it's a good item it doesn't

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.440
need to be a em you were probably

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:53.210
getting value for money but still that's

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.880
what you want right it didn't cost them

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:57.710
15 cents to make a lump of coal in that

00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:01.190
shop you know they just cloned it from

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:02.870
an earlier instance so as far as I'm

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:04.580
concerned we had we allowed gains from

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:06.110
trade to happen here well also you know

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:09.890
satisfying both customer and business

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:12.950
owner it's a very groovy combination

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:15.050
baby as Austin Powers says at the end of

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:17.420
Austin Powers 1 we've got freedom and

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:21.740
responsibility it's a very groovy combo

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:23.089
baby he was speaking about the 90s at

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:27.230
the time so you didn't know about the

00:13:23.089 --> 00:13:29.709
recession anyway ok we did get a deal

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:34.130
with the angel we didn't maintain our

00:13:29.709 --> 00:13:35.930
charge but I'm not gonna use it better

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:37.700
to save it maybe get a tinted rock on

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:39.500
the next floor look for secret rooms at

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.630
some point free reroll on the reroll

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:49.110
machine etc etc I think it's it's very

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:54.850
valuable to handle that ok

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:56.860
matchbook is also fine three bombs we'd

00:13:54.850 --> 00:14:04.110
hesitate the call at a 15 cent value

00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:04.110
street value maybe but car battery I

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:09.340
think I mean you're gonna look at this

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:15.550
and you might be thinking the 10 out of

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:19.180
10 choice is is outbreak and I disagree

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:21.820
I love the item it's not a greed mode

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:23.530
item we could also use the charge to get

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:27.250
a key but I'd rather use my first charge

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:31.450
to get this it's not a terrible turn of

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:37.780
events um tell you what let's use a bomb

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:41.410
here grab this three cent card is not a

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:43.600
bad deal Ouija board and two cents

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:48.250
returned and it's not particularly

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:49.420
strong uh sorry I do want to I mean I

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.830
want to do a lot of things one of them

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:54.250
would be raise our damage for the first

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:56.770
time ever on this run another one would

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:58.630
be like blow up these skulls for the

00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:00.760
chance to get something okay that turned

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:01.990
out to not be necessary but blow up

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.150
these skulls for the chance to get

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:08.200
something worthwhile out of them like a

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:10.660
good tarot card for example two of

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.610
diamonds is a not just a run winning

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:15.820
item but like an item that enables you

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:19.350
to have all sorts of positives as a

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:21.940
result of its existence dang it

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:24.220
for all the you know I I hesitate I know

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:25.870
there's a lot of Isaac players who feel

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:27.430
differently than this I think that

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.540
anytime you take damage it's stupid

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:31.110
damage I think it's a deleterious

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:34.990
attitude to have

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:36.880
I'd like to achieve consider myself a

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:39.460
relatively successful person in spite of

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.360
the image I cultivate online you're

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:43.300
gonna make mistakes

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:46.240
you can't expect perfection being mad at

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:49.270
yourself when you expect perfection is

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:50.870
fine as long as it doesn't you know harm

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:52.730
you mentally I suppose

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:56.600
you know that's the mindset you want to

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:58.010
cultivate then so be it but you gotta

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.779
accept that mistakes are gonna happen by

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:01.400
the way this is why I didn't go into the

00:15:59.779 --> 00:16:03.320
curse room right off the bat is because

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.510
I should have taken PhD earlier with

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:13.510
what it solved a lot of problems I think

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:15.440
but let's try this potato peeler again I

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:18.230
didn't want to go in there cuz I was

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.910
like the demon heart is worth a lot it

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:22.430
could actually like wipe out more than

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:25.520
one wave for us so that's why I held off

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:27.110
on actually going into the cursor until

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:29.540
it was a little later I figured a spirit

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:31.640
heart is a better cos than a demon heart

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.720
unfortunately didn't get much out of

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:36.230
that room to begin with we would have

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:38.210
gotten a luck upgrade if we bought PhD

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.589
earlier now is a luck upgrade really

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:41.210
that valuable in greed mode I would

00:16:39.589 --> 00:16:45.230
argue not as much as it is in the

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:47.630
vanilla game modes but here we are will

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:50.180
probably save the rest of our money for

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:53.690
the next floor and maybe hope for a good

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:55.459
deal with the devil here but we're being

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:58.010
starved on this run slowly but surely

00:16:55.459 --> 00:17:00.890
we're being starved out of a wind and

00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:03.680
it's pretty much a hundred percent to do

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:05.089
with our damage rate of fire is fine HP

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.069
as long as we have enough money we can

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:08.569
always buy most of the time we'll be

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:11.240
able to buy a decent amount of HP before

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:12.709
the final boss fight but at least

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:16.160
there's there's a thread where that

00:17:12.709 --> 00:17:17.829
exists but as of right now this is a

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.660
perfect opportunity to use that

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:22.490
apparently Dodgers remote just doesn't

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:24.079
work with car batteries or should I say

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:27.860
car battery doesn't work with doctors

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:33.460
remote because a1 was existing on this

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:33.460
run before the other this is bomb City

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:44.299
cuz like this boss fight is actually

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:46.669
gonna suck know that that bomb placement

00:17:44.299 --> 00:17:48.440
was so bad on my part we're probably

00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:49.970
gonna get hit here I mean the good news

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.409
is with nun's habit we can only get hit

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:55.220
twice before we get a charge and then

00:17:51.409 --> 00:17:57.890
it'll probably kill him but we're in a

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:59.750
tight spot what we need to do is get a I

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:01.580
mean a deal with the devil that gives us

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:04.400
HP the deal with the angel that gives us

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:05.780
damage or just a much much better floor

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:09.770
on the next floor I think that allows us

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:14.299
to kind of elevate our game another

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:17.929
angel deal Holy Grail is fine flying is

00:18:14.299 --> 00:18:22.880
is certainly not bad as we head down to

00:18:17.929 --> 00:18:23.390
the next floor I can't let this cat into

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.919
the room

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.539
you only get one side of the story on

00:18:24.919 --> 00:18:28.270
this video there's a little damage I can

00:18:26.539 --> 00:18:30.409
accept that

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:32.780
you're going oh this guy doesn't let his

00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:34.250
cat into the room what a jerk you don't

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:36.880
understand you're not living the life

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:41.750
that I'm living here this cat all day

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:43.780
tries to get behind the computer tries

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:46.340
to bite things tries to bite me

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:48.409
aggravates Tomoe I know that's gonna get

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.940
you guys on my side when I say that he's

00:18:48.409 --> 00:18:51.530
biting tomé oh by the way we probably

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:57.770
want champion belt here tom was a

00:18:51.530 --> 00:19:00.830
champion of the people okay also with

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:05.510
tiers upgrade I always forget the era

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:09.860
please algae's also good save that for

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:12.409
the final boss by potentially so think

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:15.860
we want to use as many charges as

00:19:12.409 --> 00:19:17.960
possible wow that was really really bad

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:21.500
I want to use as many charges as

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:23.059
possible like right now oh this we we

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:26.240
got it we got to use algae's we're gonna

00:19:23.059 --> 00:19:30.110
eat it this is way too good like the

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:32.090
enemies are crushing us our damage is

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:35.260
not nearly strong enough step on the

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:35.260
button dude get out of here

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:41.690
my plan was to use the charges you know

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:44.330
keep the waves relatively maintained and

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:45.769
then destroy that tinted rock and

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:47.450
hopefully pick up at this point small

00:19:45.769 --> 00:19:51.110
rock we could absorb the speed downgrade

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:52.809
because we can fly and and maybe our

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:56.390
damage as a result would actually be

00:19:52.809 --> 00:19:57.919
palatable but now we don't even have a

00:19:56.390 --> 00:20:00.590
charge ready for it but we're gonna buy

00:19:57.919 --> 00:20:03.380
champion bail the damage is a critical

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:06.320
thing for us right now similarly to be

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:08.690
honest we might want to get a red candle

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.279
a better space bar item than doctors

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:19.039
remote an item I don't have a whole lot

00:20:10.279 --> 00:20:21.590
of you know built-up fondness for but

00:20:19.039 --> 00:20:23.750
our damage is very much still like the

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:27.110
the sore spot for us and and we're gonna

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:29.000
start to face some sincere problems very

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:32.419
very shortly so I think we're like a

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:38.630
halfway through these waves our end game

00:20:32.419 --> 00:20:42.049
at this point is to live that makes me

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:43.940
very upset it makes me very upset that

00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:46.070
about two seconds after I said our end

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:48.440
game is to live they killed us so we'll

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:55.130
do another greed mode run here's our

00:20:48.440 --> 00:21:00.130
seed ad we6 virus looks very familiar to

00:20:55.130 --> 00:21:01.610
start with here this is arguably a

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:03.559
little better

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:05.480
I guess cuz it gives us the higher rate

00:21:03.559 --> 00:21:07.309
of fire right off the bat and dude blank

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.929
card you almost just take it on greed

00:21:07.309 --> 00:21:12.710
mode or greedier if you want to be

00:21:08.929 --> 00:21:16.419
pedantic because it's like it enables

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:19.460
such amazing synergies hello hello Ruka

00:21:16.419 --> 00:21:21.980
have you decided to calm down have you

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:26.360
decided to be a normal boy or are you

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:29.539
still it crazy cuz about one day a week

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:34.760
Ruka chooses to be a crazy boy and he's

00:21:29.539 --> 00:21:35.929
chosen today go to sleep I'm not putting

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:38.590
him in a sleeper hold I'm putting him in

00:21:35.929 --> 00:21:38.590
his sleeping box

00:21:38.879 --> 00:21:43.919
I don't know why today he's chosen to be

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:47.029
a crazy boy maybe he misses Kate is that

00:21:43.919 --> 00:21:49.440
what it is she's coming back tomorrow

00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:53.639
there's no way for you to conceivably

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:56.100
know that unless you've learned English

00:21:53.639 --> 00:21:57.690
in which case dude please let me know

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.940
because that would be huge for both of

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:07.039
us I'm talking wet food everyday kind of

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:09.929
money if you're interested I imagined

00:22:07.039 --> 00:22:12.649
dude I know like this is a weird bit

00:22:09.929 --> 00:22:15.000
okay people are like when I get if

00:22:12.649 --> 00:22:17.279
reincarnation is real I want to be

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.950
reincarnated as a cat I think there's

00:22:17.279 --> 00:22:21.600
some situations in which that is fair

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:23.070
like if you're reincarnated with no

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.750
knowledge of the fact that you used to

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:26.340
be a human being like you don't have

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:28.169
your memories you don't have like the

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:31.919
lessons you've learned then sure a cat

00:22:28.169 --> 00:22:35.009
life like a domesticated cat that's a

00:22:31.919 --> 00:22:37.019
pet in a nice person's home it's a great

00:22:35.009 --> 00:22:39.299
life what do you do you sleep

00:22:37.019 --> 00:22:43.320
yeah eat you play around from time to

00:22:39.299 --> 00:22:47.539
time a little chubby for a cat who cares

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:50.909
you're a cat you know live your life if

00:22:47.539 --> 00:22:52.950
you maintain the knowledge that you had

00:22:50.909 --> 00:22:54.840
before you were reincarnated it's

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:56.759
actually the worst thing in the world

00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:00.299
can you imagine wanting to express an

00:22:56.759 --> 00:23:02.190
opinion for your entire life being aware

00:23:00.299 --> 00:23:03.990
that you know English but not possessing

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:06.450
the like biological structures to

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:08.629
actually create words except for meow

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:11.009
and then occasionally

00:23:08.629 --> 00:23:13.940
there's like I can't do it but there's

00:23:11.009 --> 00:23:16.500
like a cat wouldn't call it a growl

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:25.050
necessarily but like a frustrated cat

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:27.580
like emotions that sounds like a prison

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:31.260
but it is a prison which you get to even

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:33.190
sleep all the time can't deny that I

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:35.590
guess the other thing is we get

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:38.050
reincarnated as a cat maybe I guess the

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:39.880
idea is that you would be like you know

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:41.740
you to eat all this stuff and it's it

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.330
smells like garbage to human beings but

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:45.670
you'd be like this is delicious

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:48.370
but if you were a human being governing

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:52.030
carnitas Kent you'd be like can I have a

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:55.540
ribeye just once not more ground up like

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:57.730
a horse liver or something I don't know

00:23:55.540 --> 00:24:00.309
what they're even so I really want blank

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:02.110
card I want blank card more than I want

00:24:00.309 --> 00:24:08.830
any other item that could exist in the

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:11.559
item room so I mean that was actually

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:14.140
really okay and they use a bomb raid

00:24:11.559 --> 00:24:15.340
here and it's worth it it's worth it

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:17.380
because it gives us blank card right off

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:19.300
the bed so now if we get five cents

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:22.630
we'll buy a key four cents I guess we'll

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:24.340
buy a key or maybe we'll buy a card

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:27.690
because getting one good card right off

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:29.860
the bat would be extremely valuable

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:31.840
blank card is not quite enough to give

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:34.809
us a guaranteed win but it's pretty

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:40.050
close what we all we need now is one

00:24:34.809 --> 00:24:43.240
good card and you know for most floors

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:44.860
if we have 20 cents that means checking

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:49.960
out four cards to see if one of them's

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:52.780
good so this I don't really like

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:55.210
fighting a champion version of the gate

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:56.740
on the first floor or sorry even worse

00:24:55.210 --> 00:25:01.360
actually I'd say a champion version of

00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:03.520
mega fatty on the first floor so I think

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:05.980
we should shoot Edie we should shoot a

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:08.890
mega fatty and I'm gonna explain why we

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:10.600
won mega fatty to die second because he

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:12.250
can actually hurt monstro and the

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.900
champion version of monster was no slaps

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:16.270
in the HP Department compared to our

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:18.220
damage right now why shoot at mega fatty

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:20.590
then shouldn't be shoot at monstro first

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:22.990
so that monstro dies first no you're not

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:25.900
remembering is that mega fatty has about

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:30.280
a million times more HP than any other

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:32.590
boss at his level so by by shooting a

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:35.050
mega fatty he will still probably die

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:37.820
second monster will die two shots that

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:40.190
we accidentally hit him with

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:43.250
and also any damage that mega fatty does

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:44.750
swim and the other alternative is mega

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:47.059
fatty dies first and then we shoot

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:51.980
monster like 200 times instead of a

00:25:47.059 --> 00:25:53.929
million and then he dies so I think

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:55.700
we're we're making the right decision

00:25:53.929 --> 00:26:02.000
for the right reasons it just looks

00:25:55.700 --> 00:26:05.090
wrong please God who on the team said

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.529
this is the ideal boss for you to fight

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:09.950
in greedy your mode like this is

00:26:06.529 --> 00:26:12.080
actually just silly well that's why it's

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:14.600
hard is because mathematically it's just

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:16.580
really really really really tedious

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:18.770
unless you get an amazing item right off

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:20.360
the bat we actually sort of got an

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:23.120
amazing item which is what irritates me

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:25.039
the most like we got pretty close to the

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:27.980
Platonic ideal item you'd want to get on

00:26:25.039 --> 00:26:31.940
a blue baby greedy or mode run HP plus a

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:34.549
good DPS improvement anyway I digress

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:37.250
I suppose you know what we should buy

00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:39.230
two keys cuz they're cheap save enough

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:42.070
money to let me start the bankroll for

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:44.720
the next floor tough love is fine I

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:46.429
almost don't even want to go for the

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:47.600
deal with the devil but I will it's the

00:26:46.429 --> 00:26:49.700
same deal with the devil we had last

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:52.640
time why wouldn't we want to go for it

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:54.020
well maybe we think you know the right

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.250
of getting a deal with the devil or the

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:59.990
privilege of getting a deal with the

00:26:55.250 --> 00:27:02.470
devil is not worth the extra you know

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:04.850
one spear at heart it could cost us

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:08.539
there just doesn't feel right to not go

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:10.429
to it I actually think it's always the

00:27:08.539 --> 00:27:12.200
right decision to try as long as your

00:27:10.429 --> 00:27:14.090
your run is not gonna get you killed and

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:16.700
we've got a good enough setup that that

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:19.130
should not happen so just cuz the chance

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:22.360
of like a Hail Mary 10 outta 10 item

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:25.039
existing is is too real so see you later

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:26.659
on the next floor we're going down with

00:27:25.039 --> 00:27:29.200
enough money to possibly start by buying

00:27:26.659 --> 00:27:29.200
a card

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:39.600
there is no card for sale that was the

00:27:37.299 --> 00:27:41.919
cat sneezing and shaking my whole desk

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:46.570
you could buy a spirit heart but I'd

00:27:41.919 --> 00:27:50.220
rather I mean I might have to I guess I

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:53.020
should be more obvious about saying but

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:56.140
the time isn't quite right Black Lotus

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:58.809
is gonna give us three HP it's really

00:27:56.140 --> 00:28:03.159
good meat is gonna give us a little bit

00:27:58.809 --> 00:28:05.590
of damage in a little bit of HP we don't

00:28:03.159 --> 00:28:07.330
really want much of this in fact I'm

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:09.760
actually gonna go for a bit of a Hail

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:12.190
Mary here the idea there was maybe we

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:17.710
could get a card we didn't but we did

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:21.100
get a halo halo so Kay and I don't like

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:29.790
saying that a that in all stats off is

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:32.560
okay but it really is just okay careful

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:34.420
I'll still buy it I think it's worth 15

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:36.250
cents and and moreover even if it's not

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:39.210
worth 15 cents I think it's worth us not

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:41.560
using any resources to re-roll it again

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:42.760
we're not quite at the tear cap so we

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:45.280
don't have to worry about that we are

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:48.520
eager to get a rune or a card but it's

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:53.200
not compulsory in the exact immediacy

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:56.320
right now and I think this is actually

00:28:53.200 --> 00:29:00.750
at this point a balanced run we've stat

00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:02.620
it up enough that and I was completely

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:04.390
trapped there

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:06.340
we've stat it up enough that we can kill

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:07.990
enemies at a reasonable pace you know

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:11.350
we're leaving a little bit of debt from

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:13.570
wave to wave but with our those

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:15.490
champions or stone men they're actually

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:17.320
champions I've been living this whole

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:19.690
time thinking that they're actually the

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:23.710
stone dudes from old Valyria but they

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:25.480
are not we're also fighting like weaker

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:28.060
enemies I think they these guys are not

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:31.300
that strong so just consider ourselves

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:32.860
lucky for the present moment just give

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:35.290
me a card it doesn't have to be good

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:36.790
like there's so many cards that are just

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:42.910
made better by the fact that we can use

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:47.110
them 20 times per floor no well you wipe

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:48.550
the slate clean but not the world's

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:49.750
hardest and it means to begin with so

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:55.720
we're gonna be at like 20-something

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:59.940
cents 22 I think yeah 22 which means we

00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:03.130
will probably just take the halo and

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:05.320
then we'll have 7 cents we might go for

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:09.010
a rear old really almost entirely

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:11.620
because buying a card would be so

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:14.140
valuable nothing else we want here is

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:16.150
that good so we would want to solicit

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:18.310
the reroll to begin with we don't get a

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:19.870
card we get a 7 cent outbreak I don't

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:22.210
think it's worth it I think we probably

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:24.270
at this point save our money so I'm

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:28.230
gonna be a little audacious that is

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:28.230
surprisingly very much worth it

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:37.870
it's gonna leave us in a great state as

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:41.410
far as HP goes HP goes Pecos P goes P

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:44.080
goes P goes see that's be good Johnny by

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:45.820
the men at work which is the most

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:50.830
annoying way to describe that band name

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:54.570
it's the men at work no it's men at work

00:30:50.830 --> 00:31:00.880
it's very different it's the Beatles no

00:30:54.570 --> 00:31:01.510
it's Beatles it's not Beatles it's the

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:06.970
Beatles

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:10.720
it's the u2 that would irritate me if I

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:13.720
was Bono that would irritate me so much

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:15.630
I might donate like 25% of my salary to

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:20.070
defeating the AIDS epidemic in Africa

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:22.870
you know that guy's all about that

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:26.010
here's my impression of Bono I'm gonna

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:29.680
be a philanthropist I mean come on dude

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:32.590
why are you putting on airs can you just

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:37.090
write the music funny man music man

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:39.520
whatever not that bad of a wave

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:42.030
considering our stance should be able to

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:42.030
hang back

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:50.640
fire some shots in here that relatively

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:51.870
leave us safe once we get one killed we

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:55.020
open up a little bit more of the map

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:58.790
anyway I mean he's got a quite a

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:58.790
significant range on him to begin with

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:09.360
how I was gonna say how could he not be

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:10.500
dead the HP bar was at like 45% it's

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.910
been a while since I've been in math

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:21.210
class but I'm pretty sure that 100

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:22.680
divided by 2 is greater than 45 if you

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:24.590
think that expression doesn't make sense

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:28.680
if you're gonna say a 100 divided by 2

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:33.170
equals 50 you are correct but 100

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:33.170
divided by 2 also equals greater than 45

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:40.889
a hundred divided by two is also less

00:32:38.669 --> 00:32:42.659
than a million you know there's many

00:32:40.889 --> 00:32:44.880
potentially true statements that could

00:32:42.659 --> 00:32:46.559
be evaluated from an expression we got

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:48.029
14 cents we're out of here I was also

00:32:46.559 --> 00:32:49.620
going down a weird tangent there so

00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:56.789
whether like escape from that as quickly

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:58.919
as possible damage not bad HP rate of

00:32:56.789 --> 00:33:00.600
fire shot speed is irrelevant so we're

00:32:58.919 --> 00:33:04.559
at the HP cap no longer should we

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:06.269
prioritize tiers upgrades you got a I

00:33:04.559 --> 00:33:09.990
think you definitely take the gamble

00:33:06.269 --> 00:33:13.110
right here and it worked out swimmingly

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:15.269
now data miner no I know but you only

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:17.909
have to get it to but it's half price

00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:20.940
now it's not no we're not it's not worth

00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:26.580
it dude these secret rooms are way worth

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:30.139
it for curse rooms rather okay right

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:32.879
11:30 time doesn't matter too much I

00:33:30.139 --> 00:33:36.029
almost want to play the demon judgement

00:33:32.879 --> 00:33:39.360
but it I could not conceive of it as a

00:33:36.029 --> 00:33:46.860
smart idea let's start small piercing

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:48.870
shots absolutely lovely use a little

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:52.019
money I want to get cards dude we need a

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:54.090
card it's not even a want situation we

00:33:52.019 --> 00:33:58.679
need a card in order to validate the use

00:33:54.090 --> 00:34:00.120
of blank card and the faster I mean it

00:33:58.679 --> 00:34:01.919
doesn't really rhyme with anything I was

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.419
gonna say the faster the merrier it's

00:34:01.919 --> 00:34:05.009
not really how the expression works it

00:34:03.419 --> 00:34:08.669
creates a complicated situation for

00:34:05.009 --> 00:34:13.200
yours truly you can see there is a there

00:34:08.669 --> 00:34:15.389
is a playing card in there in fact step

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:17.520
on this we got 5 cents now we need to

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:20.069
buy that playing card because if it's

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:21.810
like 2 of diamonds using it immediately

00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:27.089
is worth so much it's too hard since

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:28.050
garbage ok well the joke's on me and I

00:34:27.089 --> 00:34:29.250
think a lot of people are gonna watch

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:30.659
this and they're gonna be like well with

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:32.129
the money you're spending on cards you

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:33.929
could probably pick up like uh damage

00:34:32.129 --> 00:34:35.550
upgrade I'm not trying to mess with you

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:39.750
I feel like uh damage upgrade is

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:42.629
substantially less valuable than getting

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:45.260
a good card early even if we spend 30

00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:45.260
cents you know

00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:50.649
surely it doesn't have to be ten out of

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:53.500
ten doesn't have to be chaos that was

00:34:50.649 --> 00:34:56.010
real bad but if we can at least get

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:58.690
something something that gives us any

00:34:56.010 --> 00:35:00.790
value then I can stop this like

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:06.630
relentless and very expensive quest to

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:08.950
find a worthwhile card even the devil

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:11.890
although I would prefer to get you know

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:13.599
a rune of some value or a really really

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:17.020
valuable card like strength would

00:35:13.599 --> 00:35:21.099
actually be pretty solid as well or hero

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:28.839
font is like 20 out of 10 we don't need

00:35:21.099 --> 00:35:30.849
it what we do need is any card that

00:35:28.839 --> 00:35:32.530
gives us value because it also justifies

00:35:30.849 --> 00:35:35.940
the existence of blank card to begin

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:40.990
with batteries not that essential

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:44.260
judgment could be that card it probably

00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:46.619
won't be in fact my yeah it's yeah we

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.619
got problems

00:35:50.819 --> 00:35:56.290
you should never do this in fact I

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:58.839
believe there's I can't I'm actually mad

00:35:56.290 --> 00:36:02.170
that the game enabled my idiocy you can

00:35:58.839 --> 00:36:08.829
play both of those one at like two at a

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:10.480
time each you don't - I I don't know I'm

00:36:08.829 --> 00:36:12.579
actually like a little mad that the game

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:18.670
worked out for me there and we got the

00:36:12.579 --> 00:36:20.290
hanged man again oh my lord well we will

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:23.050
get enough money to purchase one more

00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:25.000
card and we did get ceremonial robes on

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:26.890
this floor I mean in some case does the

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.900
end justify the means usually that's

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:30.910
like an ethical dilemma you know like

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:33.160
hey you were a real jerk that you

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:34.869
accomplished something noble was it

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:37.599
worth it instead in this case it's very

00:36:34.869 --> 00:36:40.869
much hey you were a moron but good

00:36:37.599 --> 00:36:43.210
things happen I don't think it's not

00:36:40.869 --> 00:36:46.780
really the spirit of the original idiom

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:50.910
but yet at the same time I'm kind of

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:55.720
like sweet it worked

00:36:50.910 --> 00:37:01.030
okay so I mean grab two more cards to

00:36:55.720 --> 00:37:05.080
his spades is okay the Sun is it's tough

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:06.820
it's tough I'm gonna keep blank cards

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:10.180
son won't you come and wash away the

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:12.760
rain the reason for that is because two

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:16.540
of spades it's good but we're never

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:18.130
gonna need 99 keys there's a there's an

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:19.900
upper maximum to the number of keys you

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:23.440
could ever need ingredient it's usually

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:26.920
like seven right you've already opened a

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:29.110
few doors so to to just get two keys for

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:31.510
five senses at least an okay deal and

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:33.490
then the son card is kind of like a once

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:35.620
every four rooms death card situation

00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:38.020
for us it's not good but it's it's

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:40.920
better I think unfortunately and they're

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:43.450
keeping us enabled with a lot of HP as

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:45.040
we head down to the next floor hoping

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:51.610
for good item rooms I'll tell you that

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:53.800
much it's okay a little too late to be

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:56.530
super useful and then squeezy is two

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:57.000
spirit arts could be worse could be

00:37:56.530 --> 00:38:02.530
better

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:04.450
so let's keep our extra special room

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:06.580
here I'm gonna use on soos because it

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:12.970
gives us secret room access but keep the

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:19.900
Sun card taro cloth does not synergize

00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:22.000
with blank card doesn't make it bad but

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:23.260
probably means it's not as good I'm

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.060
gonna add a swing for the fences a

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:26.650
little bit grab this remember we have

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:29.860
very little to donate it's much more

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:34.060
about survival on greedier mode at this

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:36.070
point blank card here a font blank our

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:39.940
magician I mean we just not gonna say we

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:43.200
won but really really helped our chances

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:43.200
with a single bomb there so

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:47.340
sorry the Hierophant that is what I

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:52.380
meant to say that's the way that's the

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:54.750
way we pronounce that I wish I could

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:56.730
hold two cards just because the Sun is

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:58.800
so good what my game plan was was

00:38:56.730 --> 00:39:01.320
basically just hey why don't you kite

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:03.090
every enemy on the screen and then just

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:06.500
Sun card them all at once and then you

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:09.330
basically don't end up fighting anything

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:11.850
not sure if that's even good it might

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:13.620
just be clever but you know you know my

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:16.350
thoughts on cleverness not always a huge

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:18.720
fan but I will admit that blank card

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:21.120
here of fun makes us essentially I mean

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:23.100
that was just god-awful but it makes us

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:26.970
essentially unkillable until the final

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:30.180
boss fight in my estimation dude it's

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:32.460
actually not fair that there is a turret

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:36.060
right down here because this guy's got

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:39.050
to go before I can conceivably ever

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:39.050
stand still

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:48.000
it's like a lot of badness coming what

00:39:46.859 --> 00:39:51.510
are all these shrieks

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:54.119
oh it's the three spiders down there at

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:55.890
the bottom well I mean if nothing else

00:39:54.119 --> 00:39:58.520
this should illustrate how powerful our

00:39:55.890 --> 00:40:00.900
blank card hero fonts energy is

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:04.559
essentially we play it like trash and

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:05.970
yet here we are I think we actually

00:40:04.559 --> 00:40:08.039
you're not gonna love this

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:16.740
but it's it's worth it and that makes me

00:40:08.039 --> 00:40:22.799
a little mad we should not take tarot

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:24.960
o'clock well we can there's like varying

00:40:22.799 --> 00:40:27.119
layers of enlightenment here on a

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:29.099
spectrum from young Sheldon to Rick and

00:40:27.119 --> 00:40:32.250
Morty there's various phases of

00:40:29.099 --> 00:40:35.430
enlightenment okay what do I mean by

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:38.069
this ridiculous inherently moronic

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:42.000
statement we're right that taro cloth

00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:43.859
won't work with blank card however we

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.839
might just want taro cloth to give us

00:40:43.859 --> 00:40:51.869
four spirit hearts from here upon as

00:40:47.839 --> 00:40:53.400
well as whatever tangential benefit taro

00:40:51.869 --> 00:41:00.270
cloth could provide in the interim

00:40:53.400 --> 00:41:01.650
period for example if we got a second

00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:04.079
hero fond card that's a good way to

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:06.119
think of it we essentially paid 15 cents

00:41:04.079 --> 00:41:08.309
for four spirit hearts the two extras

00:41:06.119 --> 00:41:10.440
that we would get from the blank card

00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:11.490
hero font I'm sorry the two extras we

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:12.720
get from the hero phone we're holding

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:16.289
and the two extras to get from the hero

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:18.869
family found so I might be by not taking

00:41:16.289 --> 00:41:20.640
taro cloth I might be accidentally out

00:41:18.869 --> 00:41:27.390
thinking myself out of a pretty good

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:28.859
situation essentially it makes every

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:30.539
card twice as good as long as we're not

00:41:28.859 --> 00:41:33.109
using with playing card which is also

00:41:30.539 --> 00:41:36.480
really good because the second best card

00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:39.420
with blank card useless without blank

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:42.670
card worth quite a lot well think about

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:45.770
it we got a little bit of time

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:48.200
our damage by the way like damage plus

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:53.750
rate of fire to make DPS is still pretty

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:55.160
garbage for them for the stage of the

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:57.230
game in which rat and the fact we've

00:41:55.160 --> 00:42:01.820
been recording for 42 minutes here at on

00:41:57.230 --> 00:42:03.200
a greedier mode run not necessarily the

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:04.640
greatest indication I really thought we

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:07.550
were being clever that clever thereby

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:13.730
hiding but clearly did not work out as

00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:17.170
well as I was hoping for I don't know

00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:17.170
how we didn't get it on that one though

00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:21.080
we're gonna get a deal with the devil

00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:22.760
then we can afford it whether or not we

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:24.920
should be able to afford it another

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:28.280
question for another day how these deals

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:34.640
dude 48 hour energy lovely choice thank

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:38.870
you back to full HP we're really hoping

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:42.320
to not get a tell appeals cuz that could

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:44.570
ruin the hero font for us we need to

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:47.270
find a second secret room I think we

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:49.340
should buy a taro cloth I don't love it

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:51.880
but I'm okay with it and immediately a

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:54.020
pays for itself

00:42:51.880 --> 00:43:02.080
now we can only take one of these with

00:42:54.020 --> 00:43:04.340
us and then that gives me pause to think

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:06.020
this popping the two of diamonds already

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:10.910
I would take me to 48 cents is there a

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:13.310
battery for sale no there's not what

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:16.310
about if we roll a few times

00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:21.610
still no battery oh it's gotta happen

00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:21.610
like on this play still no battery okay

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:25.160
so we should have used the two of

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:26.900
diamonds earlier when I was hoping for

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:29.870
is to find a battery and create kind of

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:36.080
like a small capital gain over and over

00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:38.180
but we did not get that so instead it's

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:41.150
tough because here a fun much better for

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:43.640
a survival but we have one more shop so

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:45.650
I think we think we take blank card two

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:47.420
of diamonds and just expect that hey as

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:49.190
a result of having blank card two of

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:51.590
diamonds we could buy as many spirit

00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:53.810
ours as we want in the future so this is

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:55.730
probably smarter I don't think we

00:43:53.810 --> 00:44:02.359
actually benefit from

00:43:55.730 --> 00:44:04.680
unfortunately I stand by this decision I

00:44:02.359 --> 00:44:07.109
almost say guess the theme in this

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:11.550
episode again is I almost out thought

00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:13.770
myself again we should be able to buy

00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:15.210
almost infinite spirits as long as we

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:19.920
can create a situation in which spirit

00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:22.830
ads are for sale I was like here a fun

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:25.349
is an guaranteed win but actually I mean

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:28.820
curve torn is amazing but actually I

00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:32.550
think 2 of diamonds is better for us

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:34.470
defensively then here a font is despite

00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:37.349
the fact that it's here a fun is already

00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:38.820
amazing we're still gonna keep going for

00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:42.180
this again cuz I believe that I can buy

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:44.400
infinite HP as long as we can get a

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:45.260
battery charge and a spear at our for

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:50.460
sale

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:53.160
that's very good so we've already raised

00:44:50.460 --> 00:45:00.240
our damage by like 50 percent versus

00:44:53.160 --> 00:45:02.400
where we were on the last floor just

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:04.980
keep it going here obviously you want to

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:07.830
a blank card pretty much as often as

00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:11.190
it's available pretty much in this case

00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:13.260
being a confidence modifier cuz I am too

00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:15.150
distracted by the enemies to actually

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:16.859
you know try to think of some edge cases

00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:21.710
where that might not be the case cuz

00:45:16.859 --> 00:45:25.820
come on the power of a doubling is

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:25.820
well-known well-documented

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:32.820
it's quite painful

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:34.900
[Music]

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:36.880
just keep it going here it's like the

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:38.830
first floor where I felt stronger than

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:42.190
the enemies were facing on earlier

00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:44.080
floors I was like you know we're doing

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:46.720
okay but we got it kind of it's guerilla

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:48.960
warfare on this floor I'm like word

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:51.160
we're in the driver's seat for once

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:53.230
well not for once but for the first time

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:54.430
on in the last you know forty four

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:57.190
minutes or something like that

00:45:54.430 --> 00:46:00.160
all right sixty-seven cents obviously a

00:45:57.190 --> 00:46:03.300
great state great place to be we're

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:05.560
gonna use our money instead of our bombs

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:14.080
don't think we can really benefit from

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:16.420
those okay I mean car battery seems

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:18.370
quite good battery baby as well but I

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:21.390
don't know we're getting close to the

00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:24.550
point where I don't think it's necessary

00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:26.620
9-volt is an immediate charge so I will

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:28.540
do that and and we're kind of

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:30.180
approaching ridiculous levels here in

00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:34.560
fact we should just start maybe by

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:34.560
buying as many spirit eyes as we can

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.020
leaves us in a good spot black candle is

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:47.010
like pretty solid and it restocks an

00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:47.010
item battery charges please

00:46:49.060 --> 00:47:05.120
so the d4 is very tempting however we

00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:06.410
essentially just won we can now we've

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.660
hit a point that happens on a lot of

00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:12.440
runs to be fair but we've hit a point

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:14.090
where we can buy anything and this is

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:15.800
because of the two of diamonds which I

00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:18.730
can't believe in hindsight I'm like I

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:22.940
almost didn't take this that is moronic

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:25.430
and you're going I know and I'm going I

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:30.100
know what was I thinking you know we're

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:33.920
on the same page here there's spun

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:35.900
anytime by the way we on ideally use our

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:39.290
purchasing power I mean we can just buy

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:44.300
another battery faster creates no issue

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:45.950
whatsoever like so yeah so we're

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:48.290
basically essentially a hundred percent

00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:50.150
set just re-roll these I don't like them

00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:52.430
we might break the reroll machine but we

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:54.740
got to move on anyway so starter that

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:56.780
gives us an extra card card is judgment

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:58.220
we get two judgments which we can

00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:59.990
totally afford to play but we don't

00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.920
really in all likelihood want what

00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:03.170
they're putting out with by the way

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:05.960
shouldn't have done that today we have

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:07.420
no battery charge yeah idiot every time

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:10.130
dude

00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:12.620
okay so let's say I mean we have is the

00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:13.880
next floor the end it might be if it is

00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:21.290
if it isn't it doesn't really matter

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:24.200
we're still like completely set let's

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:25.820
start

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:28.280
we're gonna get our deal with the devil

00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:30.500
wave after these boss waves are done

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:33.590
these enemies are pretty good at keeping

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:35.890
us away from them she's gonna slow us

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:38.930
down quite a lot here

00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:41.740
yeah just basically sat back and let

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:41.740
that one roll in

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:49.310
got an adversary essentially zero

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:55.130
problem so we do have one more floor of

00:48:49.310 --> 00:48:57.530
farming before we actually get the the

00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:59.030
final boss fight so we we didn't score

00:48:57.530 --> 00:49:01.730
ourselves too much hopefully there's a

00:48:59.030 --> 00:49:04.790
reroll machine on that last remaining

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:06.770
floor but if there is if there isn't we

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:09.470
can just buy it endlessly we could buy a

00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:11.990
bunch of junk items that impact us only

00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:14.360
is slightly positively or don't impact

00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:15.710
us at all to get rerolls and you know we

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:17.360
get so many of those it doesn't really

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:19.760
matter too much plus we have chaos so we

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:21.860
can get like Steam sale and it's just

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:26.330
it's a whole thing we're in a very good

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:31.520
spot though yes okay

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:33.770
it's like really good I mean at this

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:35.870
point I kind of feel like we might as

00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:39.560
well blow this up you know we'll get

00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:41.450
another charge maybe when we finish then

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:47.990
we can buy eight more items from this

00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:49.400
shop and it doesn't matter or they

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:53.660
probably the next shop cuz it could have

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:55.770
a reroll machine but anyway okay okay

00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:58.200
the shop

00:49:55.770 --> 00:50:00.390
there is not a reroll machine but that's

00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:01.890
not that bad so you definitely start

00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:03.000
there's a battery charge which is the

00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:05.430
most important thing you definitely

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.970
start taking the passives that are most

00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:12.440
valuable and Whore of Babylon is like

00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:12.440
certainly one of the most valuable

00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:17.460
probably reach a point and effect it

00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:18.930
might be at that point at the present

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:21.240
moment where we're gonna just be buying

00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:23.460
a lot of HP II that doesn't really

00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:26.100
matter or a lot of spacebar items that

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:30.090
don't really matter similarly I kind of

00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:31.830
feel like momma mega doesn't matter it

00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:35.780
might actually open up secret rooms for

00:50:31.830 --> 00:50:35.780
us so I'll tell you what crack into that

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:43.710
take the inner eye for a little bit of

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:48.990
triple shot power 9lives was a terrible

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:51.090
selection just awful and we probably

00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:52.980
will not be able to farm spirit arts so

00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:56.250
we've really created an interesting

00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:58.050
situation we should be able to buy

00:50:56.250 --> 00:51:00.810
spirit hearts but whether or not we're

00:50:58.050 --> 00:51:02.670
able to actually farm them remains to be

00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:03.810
seen so yeah you know we've kind of

00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:06.030
introduced a little bit of uncertainty

00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:09.300
but not much we're also about to become

00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:13.260
guppy I think so I mean even just the

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:16.260
use nail nail nail you know we're back

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:20.280
at the HP we want now we're gonna pin

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:22.890
very quickly we also have bookworm that

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:25.020
happened very quickly and I think we

00:51:22.890 --> 00:51:27.720
should probably just do well they'll

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:30.270
tell you what first off grab this gets a

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:35.880
full HP grab this and I think we should

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:39.660
just begin our next wave like we're like

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:42.540
really really strong strong enough that

00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:45.590
we should not die to greed without a

00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:48.180
doubt is there more to be gleaned

00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:52.790
absolutely always we have a hive mind

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:52.790
good damage guppy good tear effects like

00:51:54.080 --> 00:52:01.350
we should essentially be unassailable

00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:03.330
probably we will still get hit but that

00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:07.080
doesn't mean the whole lot in the whole

00:52:03.330 --> 00:52:09.690
scheme of things I would like greater

00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:11.520
rate of fire and just like if we could

00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:13.140
hit an order of magnitude higher on

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:15.170
damage that's right if we could get to a

00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:17.190
hundred and forty three damage

00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:21.390
you know what I'll settle one hundred

00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:23.160
and forty we can get to that level that

00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:25.610
would make me happy but even like like a

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:30.180
plus one damage increase who cares

00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:33.150
we're so unbelievably set 2020 probably

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:34.680
helps out quite a lot I don't even I

00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:37.350
don't even know at this point what this

00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:40.770
will do we got we got all the shot

00:52:37.350 --> 00:52:43.950
modifiers there we have we have 2020

00:52:40.770 --> 00:52:46.290
triple shot bookworm and quad shots so

00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:51.420
your guess is as good as mine more or

00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:55.020
less I think I'm ready I don't think I

00:52:51.420 --> 00:53:00.390
need to get you know anything else to

00:52:55.020 --> 00:53:02.850
really carry us at this point the

00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:07.380
certain point where you know complacency

00:53:02.850 --> 00:53:09.600
gets a bad rap good boy like you should

00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:10.820
always be ambitious ambition is a great

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:15.140
thing

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:18.600
most of the time in my opinion at least

00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:20.090
wonderful however complacency is also

00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:22.200
great when you know you look out on the

00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:24.570
situation in which you're in we finally

00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:25.920
got dad's key and another challenge look

00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:27.510
at in the situation you're in and you're

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:29.970
like I'm perfectly content

00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:31.980
I don't need sure I'm a doctor I own

00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:33.300
eight practices I could own I'm but you

00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:36.030
know what maybe I'll hug my children

00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:37.980
instead and that's where I'm at with

00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:40.020
complacency on this run right now is I'm

00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:42.570
like you know we're we're gonna win

00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:43.920
we're gonna win and it's fun what more

00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:45.330
could we want in life sure we could sit

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:47.940
there farming it up for a hundred years

00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:50.250
we're putting on airs I'm already at ten

00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:52.770
and a tenon joint am I trying to create

00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:56.120
an 11 doesn't 11 even exist I don't know

00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:56.120
maybe maybe not

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:05.730
and we should stop chasing the dragon

00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:09.740
and start entering the dragon alas

00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:09.740
Cisco's album from 1998

00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:18.650
so it's among the fastest I think I've

00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:18.650
killed greed in the in the new save file

00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:27.420
I'm not sweating the small stuff and

00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:30.510
it's all small stuff right now but I

00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:34.440
will say in theory dude it would have

00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:35.910
been awesome to bring like a it would

00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:38.610
have been awesome to bring battery baby

00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:40.800
but we're also like less than a hundred

00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:44.280
cents away from finishing our donation

00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:46.050
machine offs so with the amount of money

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:49.380
we have left at the present moment we

00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:52.920
could in theory absolutely max out the

00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:55.290
donation which is record time of the two

00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:57.300
times I've ever done which would include

00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:58.650
the one that we're about to do so it's

00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:01.580
faster than the last time might be a

00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:01.580
good way to describe it

00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:18.549
nice but it needs to not Jam Oh

00:55:18.559 --> 00:55:25.730
fantastic well I mean we're also only 30

00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:28.339
cents away from maxing it out so maybe

00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:29.660
we were not necessarily as concerned we

00:55:28.339 --> 00:55:32.630
were more concerned that we needed to be

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:33.829
but this we're gonna hit $9.99 and then

00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:35.510
we're gonna push it over to a thousand

00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:36.950
and that's that's the end of max in this

00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:39.020
thing out all we need to do after this

00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:41.059
point is worry about making sure that we

00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:47.660
win our Green mud runs not that it's

00:55:41.059 --> 00:55:50.930
been I can't believe you would do that

00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:52.250
to me either way got a little bit more

00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:53.240
impetus there for now thanks for
