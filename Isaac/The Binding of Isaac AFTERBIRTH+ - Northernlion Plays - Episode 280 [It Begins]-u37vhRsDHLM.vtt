00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.549
hey everybody welcome back I can't do

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.120
the dang old daily challenge I already

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.490
did it

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.840
welcome back to northernlion plays The

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.570
Binding of Isaac and rebirth where we've

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.389
been playing dare I say slightly better

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.750
at least our results have been better

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:21.270
d4q 6 2 3 C e now I don't want to get my

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.760
hopes up yet I also don't want to fall

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.710
asleep cause I'd miss you baby and I do

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.199
not want to miss a thing I especially do

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.009
not want to miss an opportunity to not

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.210
take damage Cuba meet first floor you

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.040
know what if there's anything positive

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.570
to say about 0.87 speed it's that it's a

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.309
little easier to aim your Cuba me when

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.680
you're not zipping around like crazy so

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.420
glowing hourglass you only get a few

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.219
plays of it before it becomes not

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.020
glowing hourglass admittedly like it

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.430
just becomes the regular hourglass we

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.050
should stick with it because I mean the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.899
beam is not that good I would get rid of

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.760
it for weight what probably but the big

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:05.790
play with glowing hourglass is to reroll

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.970
payouts that we don't actually like so I

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:13.310
mean we could go for nine lives here you

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.310
know what look at that we effectively

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.220
just turned two tiers down into a tiers

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.049
well we turn it into nada tiers down at

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.240
least so we avoided at tiers downgrade

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.500
as a result of that and now we don't

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.360
need to take that pill anymore we could

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.240
hold it until we get PhD but why bother

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.619
that's a smart play you might have good

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.820
fought a little bit when I said that

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.070
I've been playing better lately but

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.270
recall you know these episodes don't

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.369
necessarily come out in the order

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.509
they're recorded because of dailies you

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.899
know the one daily per day usually set

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.210
up means that my track record is

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.369
slightly off centered from your track

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.439
record you know recollection perhaps

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.200
right now so I have been starting to

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.869
rebuild my confidence to a small degree

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.850
but honestly it might take months before

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.729
even if things start to become normal

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.369
now it might take months before I truly

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:10.259
feel as if I'm at a home in Isaac again

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:12.390
after the the events of mid-may 2017

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.170
where I feel like I'm getting my butt

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.360
kicked me shouldn't

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.590
like this run is a you know guaranteed

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:23.580
win certainly not as of right now we

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:28.099
have no basis to think that thought

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:31.230
maybe that would get the pots up there

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:33.480
can we use this to re-roll will

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.980
effectively re-roll boss items I can't

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:41.700
recall because when we fought super lust

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.510
again or ultra lust it just gave us the

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.550
exact same item well gave us the exact

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.560
same pill in this case it wasn't that it

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.840
gave us another pill it gave us the

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.870
exact same pill so I don't think we can

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.209
use this to fight the boss and get

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.799
something different

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.390
although I would like to try but we

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.340
could use it to take back something that

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.600
we shouldn't have done I'm going to head

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.850
down to the next floor for now we'll use

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.500
our world card hopefully we have a

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.780
chance at an arcade we have the money

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.549
necessary sorry the HP necessary to at

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.230
least play it a little bit although we

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:23.430
are going to you know what check this

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:25.440
out yeah we want this but what I was

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.989
going to say is we could use the glowing

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.390
hourglass this is something I had never

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:36.329
considered but we could use the glowing

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:38.250
hourglass to be like you know what let's

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.690
go back to that third item in our reroll

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.640
rotation I've never considered doing

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:46.380
that okay that was pretty bad you know

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:48.239
what I don't need to do this room I know

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.180
we're not using it for like enormous

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.560
plays right now but we're at least

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.760
getting some value out of the glowing

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.230
hourglass which is more than I

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.120
previously gotten a lot of the time I

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.319
suppose we could also go into the curse

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.790
room and then if the curse room's not

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.620
worthwhile we could just you know go

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.250
back in time and at the end of this all

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:09.000
we get the hourglass which is not really

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.480
incredible but not necessarily bad

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.180
either

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.780
seaton - Drock no tinted rock no tinted

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:19.200
rock let's do it save ourselves a spear

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.380
at our potentially ah it is worth it

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.380
though

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.620
now is it spirit arts are the keys and

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:29.969
bombs on this floor

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:32.930
I think it's keys and bombs so we should

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:35.520
really save it to try to get something

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.960
better on the caves one but I'm just

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.759
going to use it and stick with glowing

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.599
our glass for now and I'll admit this is

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:47.280
mostly like out of novelty because we

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:51.389
don't use the glowing our glass that

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.770
often I think it's a neat item I'd like

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.919
to get a little bit more of a chance to

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.569
try it out here I guess we could all

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.770
look like imagine I'm just running these

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:00.599
things through my head right now because

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.189
I'd rarely get a chance to actually see

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:03.960
this item and usually what I see it

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:05.879
especially if it's not a daily I will

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.340
just immediately be like oh no I'm not

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:09.750
touching that today so this is my

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.610
sandbox where I get to play around

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.699
before I eventually take it to like a

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:18.900
top 1,500 finish on a daily which is not

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:20.400
that amazing but trying to think what if

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.319
we get hit on a deal with the devil

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.569
glowing our glass back out of the room

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:27.029
then go back into the room beat the boss

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:29.219
without getting hits we will qualify for

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:31.229
a deal with the devil I think so we

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:33.150
could use it as kind of like you know a

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.860
time machine I suppose in that regard as

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.479
well maybe that's what it's supposed to

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.099
maybe that's what it's a reference to I

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:41.310
don't know what the glowing hourglass is

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:43.379
maybe that's what you know they use an

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.270
HD wealth of Time Machine I got no clue

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:46.560
I didn't see the guy Pierce movie my

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:52.039
favorite guy Pierce movie as we've

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:54.659
established his uh prometheus okay pin

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:59.909
kind of would like to use a bomb to end

00:05:54.659 --> 00:06:04.800
you that was not good this will be good

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:10.349
he's done it uh let's check absolutely

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:14.339
worth it just don't die right now okay

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:16.289
all is forgiven a little bit of a scary

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:18.750
situation there we pulled it back now

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:23.430
now we know we don't care about being in

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:25.949
our uh our boss trap room there is old

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:28.919
NL back I hope so dude I didn't know I'd

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:30.389
miss them this much this is going to be

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:33.100
our secret room which leads to the shop

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:40.010
as well give me the quarter

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:41.960
no quarter man that's just not that good

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.280
uh we're going to open the golden chest

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.320
and probably save our bomb to try to

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.930
find a tinted rock later because we are

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.360
a little low well if you get money we

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.800
might look for a secret room in our shop

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.169
and buy secret room in our shop I mean

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.050
spirit heart in our shop we're still a

00:06:54.169 --> 00:07:03.020
little bit you know lacking in a couple

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:05.600
of different ways here mostly HP but our

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.370
speed is not particularly strong we have

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.660
no trinket I mean we had batwing for a

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:12.410
second but then we got rid of it with

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:15.290
glowing our glass with the wafer which

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:17.240
is very nice I think we should try to

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:19.190
get a spirit heart out of our shop as is

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.870
right now so I'm going to like if three

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:25.190
of these payout or one of them pays out

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:27.919
with a nickel even better but come on

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:29.180
cap I think I will blow up our donation

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:32.139
machine to get a spear and hard to keep

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:34.070
ourselves alive if we have to and

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:36.680
there's no spirit heart but I'm still

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:39.800
gonna try because we could kind of get

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.720
two birds stoned at once there I mean

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.220
maybe we could just shoot until we get

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:46.430
enough money I don't know that's how

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.690
this works if it only you know triggers

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.890
pennies if it shoots the enemies because

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:54.020
otherwise you're going to use it for

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:56.270
infinite HP even five cents wouldn't be

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.010
enough because we need to get the reroll

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.570
as well but anyway we're heading

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.250
downwards we're in a good spot you know

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:02.930
we got a great deal as a devil item it

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:06.080
we basically paid half price for it

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.850
which is lovely but we really want to do

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.880
that now is a good floor to pop this and

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:12.200
you know expedite the process of going

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.580
to the rooms that we want to go to and

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.470
skipping the rooms that are unlikely to

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:18.710
provide us with anything that advances

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:21.080
our interests as we are still at roughly

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:23.120
base stats I mean the wafers as good as

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:27.940
it is it doesn't really become as good

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.940
as it can be until later in the run

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:35.300
I'll be the first to tell you being able

00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:37.580
to fly and having an orbital to go along

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:40.789
with it you know it's one of the best

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:43.940
upgrades you can conceivably have in the

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:46.760
whole game all we have to do is use it

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:48.770
properly you know choose our battles we

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.180
got five cents now so if we get to the

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.860
spirit art there's a pretty decent

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.180
chance or if it gets the shot there's a

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:56.350
pretty decent chance there's a spirit

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:58.339
heart in there did take some damage I

00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:02.420
know what you're thinking and I'm

00:08:58.339 --> 00:09:04.940
thinking it too yeah you know what let's

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:06.709
go back we've still got the glowing

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:10.640
hourglass I guess it's five plays not

00:09:06.709 --> 00:09:12.680
three normally that would seem like a

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.330
pretty weak glowing hourglass play I

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:17.000
think but I'm concerned about my

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:19.399
survival so I think this was a smart

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.670
idea but dude the top notch glowing

00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:27.110
hourglass play so far one trillion

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:28.670
percent using it to make sure we didn't

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:31.520
get that tears downgrade that could have

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:39.640
resulted in us already being dead to be

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:39.640
honest with you that was very very close

00:09:40.209 --> 00:09:45.350
sixteen rate of fire is just god-awful

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:47.510
thirteen is still really bad especially

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:51.890
with three point five damage and that's

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:53.180
being very very slightly generous so now

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.980
we can actually skip that room that

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.660
could be annoying for us not annoying in

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.790
most cases but with poor damage

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:01.850
admittedly you know pretty nasty

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:03.470
potentially so just go down there we

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:08.330
have the shovel nail we don't really

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:10.550
want to use it but it does exist should

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:14.570
we find a good cause for for action

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:17.990
there okay any time you can use an

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:19.279
orbital tool and a kill shot on those

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:22.390
portals you're in a good spot we're

00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:22.390
going to go to the shop first

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:29.309
it's the right order of operations for

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:32.999
this floors bed mass boss every room

00:10:29.309 --> 00:10:37.579
then you go to the shop man did I forget

00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:42.420
the item room also secret rooms bed mass

00:10:37.579 --> 00:10:43.920
hmm actually is head mass it was written

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:47.009
by Julius Caesar that they're called

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.869
parentheticals not brackets so as a

00:10:47.009 --> 00:10:49.439
linguist I'd look I'm gonna stop you

00:10:48.869 --> 00:10:51.509
right there

00:10:49.439 --> 00:10:53.519
I've already slandered you and roasted

00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:55.379
you so hard in this characterization you

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:56.970
can't possibly hold this belief anymore

00:10:55.379 --> 00:11:00.449
it'd be too harmful for your social

00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:03.360
image so as a result just accept you got

00:11:00.449 --> 00:11:04.889
got son is bed mass it's not bad mass or

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.199
pet mass it's both you know it's

00:11:04.889 --> 00:11:09.829
whatever you freaking learn you think

00:11:07.199 --> 00:11:12.899
would they learn trigonometry in like

00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:16.740
you know Tripoli Libya they go Oh

00:11:12.899 --> 00:11:19.199
sohcahtoa I know maybe they do actually

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.699
math is a universal language none of

00:11:19.199 --> 00:11:22.110
those words are in English to begin with

00:11:20.699 --> 00:11:24.779
and they probably speak as good in

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:26.670
English as I do but so this time

00:11:24.779 --> 00:11:29.279
circumstances have changed we don't need

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:30.720
to sacrifice a charge of blowing our

00:11:29.279 --> 00:11:32.999
glass to get half a spear on our back

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.620
because the run is actually in a much

00:11:32.999 --> 00:11:36.720
better spot now because we have an extra

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:43.410
one-half of one spirit art to work off

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:45.990
of still very delicate situation and I

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:47.459
mean you know sticky bombs best thing

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:48.749
I'll say about sticky bombs right now is

00:11:47.459 --> 00:11:52.019
that we can use these bombs against the

00:11:48.749 --> 00:11:55.350
boss we're really looking I mean on

00:11:52.019 --> 00:12:00.240
glamorous but the truth we're looking to

00:11:55.350 --> 00:12:04.610
stack up HP so first start with the bomb

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.610
right there six cents

00:12:04.759 --> 00:12:09.290
there should be no donation machine

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:13.980
because we have a reroll machine instead

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:24.850
what in the world is that car battery

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:29.170
nipples so we will definitely get I love

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:31.390
charge items most of the time if it's

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:32.680
garbage maybe we can glowing our glass

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:34.780
out of it but I'll probably try to give

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:44.650
it a try regardless just for novelties

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:46.660
sake range upgrade huh hmm this run is

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:47.950
getting a little dicey again it's up to

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:51.180
us to hold it together here

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:57.550
we got bombs this could be a secret room

00:12:51.180 --> 00:13:00.910
it is not an eternal heart okay jumper

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:03.520
cables bloody recharge you know what

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.420
it's the kind of run where you go jumper

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:10.690
cables

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:15.040
Isaac grants an active item charge for

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:17.440
every 15 enemies killed cool idea we

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.480
have bad damage and a space bar item

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.720
that doesn't necessarily synergize very

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:30.790
well with this that doesn't mean it's a

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:32.380
poor decision however it's not going to

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:34.420
if it's going to be useful for us is

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:35.860
probably not going to be useful yet so

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.960
we're in kind of a weird situation here

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.910
I would boss rush just say goodbye to it

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.640
at this point the run is actually fine

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:44.140
it has the seeds of a win embedded deep

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.550
within it somewhere I'm just trying to

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:50.980
get the 5 cents so I can buy another

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:52.540
spirit heart I don't really want to do

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:56.500
that room up there because I know it's

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:59.340
nasty and if we get like oh I mean a

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:03.550
Book of Revelations and decent damage

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:06.900
probably is like the keys you know that

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:06.900
to the kingdom if you will

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.860
I'm okay losing half a sphere at hard to

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:15.290
keep a glowing hourglass charge we got

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:18.110
the five cents basically by doing that

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:20.150
we spent five cents on half a spear at

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:21.800
heart is that a good deal probably not

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:25.100
but you know beggars can't be choosers

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:31.030
right now also our only considerable

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:32.930
source of dealing damage is sadly our

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:34.820
orbitals so we have to basically

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:37.100
continue to use that so things are going

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:40.130
to start to get a little dangerous here

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:47.060
and I think it's gonna be a long long

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:50.770
time till damage upgrades manifest I'd

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:52.990
really like to get a better run oh no

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:54.700
because I'm a salty man

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:58.460
[Music]

00:14:54.700 --> 00:15:05.750
salty man blaming all his problems on

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:08.420
the game I'm just gonna go I thought

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:12.070
about using glowing hourglass there you

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:12.070
know we got a charge or two left a

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:20.120
little light on speed still - huh now

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:26.420
give me the William Shatner version of

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:32.300
uh of salty man she cheese my run last

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:42.940
night pre mom fights 20 minutes two p.m.

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:45.800
and I'm gonna die on my run by then and

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:48.860
then it would be and I think it's gonna

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:51.620
be in a long long time till I get a

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:54.970
double-digit streak inside and I've got

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:58.160
my Isaac skills come back to me oh no

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:59.480
I'm the salty man in something like that

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.700
I don't know it's good it's not a

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:04.160
horrible it's got potential this is some

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.790
fine tuning for sure oh there we go so

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.520
go to hook

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:10.930
we don't need batwing at all so go to

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:13.970
hook is actually functional speed

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:16.730
tarball by the way like just do not care

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:18.770
about we're running this whole run until

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:21.690
we get something we care about

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:25.260
sing it with me ant it's gonna be a long

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:28.230
long MOOC until we finally break golden

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:32.850
coupe that's enough that's enough of

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:36.480
that 14 seconds it's a great fight when

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:39.690
the greed hits your eyes like a big item

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:41.810
currency that's a grief fight I'm going

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:44.250
to be like 27 cents

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:45.779
money equals power just throwing it out

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:49.339
there wouldn't kick it out of bed for

00:16:45.779 --> 00:16:53.250
eating crackers pretty solid situation

00:16:49.339 --> 00:16:55.140
HP from the boss fight plus a deal with

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:57.899
the devil that somehow improves our DPS

00:16:55.140 --> 00:17:01.470
wouldn't kick it outta the Chesterfield

00:16:57.899 --> 00:17:04.199
for eating Cheetos brimstone mom's knife

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:14.480
wasn't thrown out of an airplane for

00:17:04.199 --> 00:17:18.030
suckin on an Altoid mom's panties would

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:20.660
remove them from the premises for

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:25.949
rattling off some Pringles

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:27.179
that should've hurt I should have eaten

00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:30.890
crap here you know what we're actually

00:17:27.179 --> 00:17:30.890
getting pretty lucky on these dodges

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:40.240
tell you what you don't even need to

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:42.520
give me damage upgrades give me the

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:45.880
relic and BFF and I'll make this run

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:49.210
work I'm feeling good right now but you

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:51.070
gotta you got to hook me up soon cuz

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:52.600
we're running out of running out of time

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:55.510
on this one I just want you to know

00:17:52.600 --> 00:18:03.340
things again a little dangerous slowed

00:17:55.510 --> 00:18:05.080
way down that's usually a bad sign one

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:08.080
black heart is like all the fuel I need

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:10.000
for this floor but I didn't even how

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:13.660
though I didn't even break the I didn't

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:17.110
finish the room but you spawned uh you

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:27.490
spawned a jerk to hurt me this it was it

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:31.260
just to see if I still feel I'm using

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:31.260
like all my bombs here by the way

00:18:35.059 --> 00:18:40.629
as far as I'm concerned that's resources

00:18:37.999 --> 00:18:40.629
well-spent

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:49.170
all I ask don't don't get too close

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.850
there you go

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:53.030
it's only going to take like another

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:59.370
five or six shots to kill them hopefully

00:18:53.030 --> 00:19:03.410
five or six hundred shots here we go no

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:03.410
deal with the devil

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:14.220
approaching absurdity we're on the

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:16.650
depths one with no map but we can fly

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:18.930
and that's worth something we got a lot

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:21.180
of money that's very useful for our

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:22.740
upcoming shop which I don't even nam

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:30.390
hope and it gives us a red candle or

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:33.990
something we're in like a dicey spot to

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:35.760
be honest with you and I think I've

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:37.650
actually and I you know I'll be the

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:40.140
first to tell you being a little bit

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:42.120
over aggressive my orbitals try the seed

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:43.440
and don't put yourself in the same boat

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.480
and see how you feel about things you

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:49.230
might not be that stoked to be honestly

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:51.180
that was it's almost worth it but I ran

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.830
into the curse room to gate myself off

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:56.190
from the chance to go back in time I

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:57.930
want to save I'll use the glowing

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:59.730
hourglass charge if it becomes strictly

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:07.320
necessary like we're obviously going to

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:08.730
die but okay you know what you got to

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:11.120
slow your roll a little bit I hate to

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.120
admit it

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:29.020
I finally understand why everybody hates

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:32.789
the spawners this is it this is the tilt

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:35.260
so it's up to us to fight the tilt

00:20:32.789 --> 00:20:38.669
we still got HP thank God we picked up

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.669
so much at the end of the last floor

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:45.520
we're not going to succeed just by

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:47.980
virtue of the fact of big pinging

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:53.770
enemies from 500 yards away I still

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:59.730
stand by the orbital usage do it guppies

00:20:53.770 --> 00:21:04.059
head pills retro vision paralysis okay

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:08.010
no run can be this bad for this long and

00:21:04.059 --> 00:21:11.200
I say this not even as like a

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:12.669
exaggeration we have base stats and base

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.700
stats that are not even particularly

00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:17.740
good on the depths one we're using our

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:19.419
orbital to deal all our damage and I'm

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.890
going to get railed on in the comments

00:21:19.419 --> 00:21:23.500
for using the orbital to deal damage

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:27.760
instead we should sacrifice our youth to

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:31.179
this run shoot every enemy 1500 times

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:35.950
until they die all because they haven't

00:21:31.179 --> 00:21:39.640
given me a damage upgrade what we could

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:41.440
have the one axis that I see for like

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:44.880
getting damage more quickly on this run

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:47.980
if something I dare not even mention

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:52.960
because the words are ashes leaving my

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:56.230
mouth we could have not taken the wafer

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:59.730
from the item room and then we rolled it

00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:04.630
and maybe nested somewhere deep within

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:06.610
you know the pillars of uncertainty that

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:11.620
that room is we could have gotten a

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:13.210
damage upgrade of some sort who needs a

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:14.799
damage upgrade though when you got a

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:17.230
single cube of meat at one point zero to

00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:18.909
speed I mean I just telling you that's

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:24.270
everything the body needs to have a very

00:22:18.909 --> 00:22:24.270
successful run to about the caves too

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:31.559
but it's up to us to not get flooded in

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.559
to persevere here

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:41.200
you gotta take these out like that's all

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:43.690
right I forgot your Satan okay

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:51.760
sorry we got our spirit heart back so

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:55.510
I'm not using a charge there every item

00:22:51.760 --> 00:23:02.670
room represents hope hope in the item

00:22:55.510 --> 00:23:05.740
rooms hope in the shops even a hope and

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:07.600
it deals with the devil that's just the

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:12.670
worst Barack Obama impression the

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:23.440
cadence is sort of there the words may

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:28.270
be good work okay

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:30.310
those enemies are part of the language

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:37.930
those enemies are my bees you know what

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:40.390
I mean any enemy that doesn't move very

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:43.570
much or moves very very predictably and

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:48.790
has no HP is like my ideal foe at this

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:53.980
point these guys are like the exact

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:55.900
opposite at low HP though low HP I'm at

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:58.960
the point where like if I get a bomb on

00:23:55.900 --> 00:24:02.800
a room I'm like thank God somebody up

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:04.330
there likes me a bomb I can use that to

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.610
kill one enemy instead of having to

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:08.620
rotate into him like a frickin

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:14.620
aggressive fidget spinner or something

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:16.270
here where is the item room where is the

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:18.310
shop I ask you this

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:19.990
100% deal with the devil chance don't

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:23.760
get excited as Krampus or sister Maggie

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:23.760
those are the only options plausible

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:38.470
let's give them a second you know how

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:38.470
they work they're very slow

00:24:45.499 --> 00:24:56.970
okay we managed to kill one thank you

00:24:53.159 --> 00:25:04.080
sister vis how did you come to be the

00:24:56.970 --> 00:25:09.980
gimme boss fight little Stephen copies

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:09.980
fucking pop you can't take it

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:18.539
you can't take it we don't have any

00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:20.429
other Gumpy items right we got we're 20

00:25:18.539 --> 00:25:22.049
minutes in 25 minutes in and we have

00:25:20.429 --> 00:25:23.970
like ten items we can see if we got a

00:25:22.049 --> 00:25:30.600
guppy I don't have any guppy items you

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:32.639
can't take G believe maybe we could have

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:35.100
read instance the devil deal by using

00:25:32.639 --> 00:25:37.710
glowing hourglass but I doubt I mean

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:38.669
it's seated right so we I don't know

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:41.610
what we would have been helping for

00:25:38.669 --> 00:25:43.559
there where is our item room and our

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:49.110
devil not a devil dealer's shop where's

00:25:43.559 --> 00:25:50.669
our item room in our shop man it's

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:53.009
getting out of control here

00:25:50.669 --> 00:25:56.820
they must be next to one another like

00:25:53.009 --> 00:25:59.850
that's plausible this run is so

00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:03.480
underpowered right now that I'm excited

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:09.539
we got little Stephen I'm like oh my god

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:11.220
our damage just got like 25% better you

00:26:09.539 --> 00:26:12.980
can tell the writing's on the wall and

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:17.279
the tide is turned

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:18.990
that's no no no no see now we got

00:26:17.279 --> 00:26:20.669
regular hourglass but I refuse to give

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:24.299
up our last sphere at heart like that I

00:26:20.669 --> 00:26:27.720
didn't take glowing hourglass over

00:26:24.299 --> 00:26:31.019
Guppies paw because I'm you know happy

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:32.940
with glowing hourglass it's more because

00:26:31.019 --> 00:26:37.860
Guppies pot cost us our only red heart

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:40.679
upgrade he's done it sweet merciful

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:43.379
Christ they gave me mom's knife in the

00:26:40.679 --> 00:26:44.009
item room of all the and I'm not

00:26:43.379 --> 00:26:45.840
complaining

00:26:44.009 --> 00:26:47.759
I'm the happiest boy in the world right

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:51.419
now but of all the lame ways to give you

00:26:47.759 --> 00:26:54.779
a win after you struggle you're going to

00:26:51.419 --> 00:26:56.500
give me mom's knife it's like a Pyrrhic

00:26:54.779 --> 00:26:59.240
victory

00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:02.740
let's donate you know just pay it

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:05.330
forward want to save maybe 20 cents oh

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:07.940
we're still not guaranteed the win but

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:10.010
we're in a very very very good spot now

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:14.300
even though our stats are still garbage

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:16.130
we'll save fifteen so that's like the

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:18.130
first time I've been able to relax in

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:21.980
like 20 minutes this run is actually

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:25.070
garbage the moms night pick up changes

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:26.720
everything notes you know previously

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:28.580
I've moved it around on my Power

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:31.880
Rankings internally over here at

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:33.740
northernlion enterprises keep like a big

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.150
stock ticker of how we feel about every

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:37.730
item I'm still not taking Guppies paw

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:41.000
I'm not I want to spend on it right now

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:42.800
mom's knife honestly it might be back in

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.290
the number one spot like the number one

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:50.150
Ludacris song from the Austin Powers in

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:52.180
Goldmember soundtrack might not be from

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:55.130
Austin Powers in Goldmember but it did

00:27:52.180 --> 00:28:03.350
have an Austin Powers themed music video

00:27:55.130 --> 00:28:05.420
either way it just even with poor stats

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:07.340
in almost every category it can take

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:09.350
over this run and make it almost a joke

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:11.480
for us now actually all we need at this

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:13.340
point is something that is awesome as a

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.410
space bar item and I would say

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:20.540
offensively or defensively just so that

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:22.130
we can actually use the nipple clamps

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:25.280
here whatever this item is called jumper

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:26.840
cables that's right the only time I've

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:29.210
seen jumper cables because I'm not a

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:31.850
handyman well that's not true I have

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:36.800
jumps a couple cars before in my life

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:38.750
because I'm also a nice guy but it's

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:41.810
always movies and video games as a

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:43.610
torture device you got to think jumper

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:45.740
cables are probably one of those 5050

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:48.500
items right 50% of the time they're used

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:50.450
as a torture and or pleasure device I

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:53.330
don't know if the jumper cables are ever

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:55.190
pleasurable I wouldn't know I don't you

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:58.910
know I don't mess around with that sort

00:28:55.190 --> 00:29:00.500
of stuff sometimes I like to kiss my

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:05.170
wife on the lips that's about as dirty

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:05.170
as I get I know weird she's a girl

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:14.420
come out come out where it actually

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:16.420
never do that because I hate ghosts dull

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:20.480
razor

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:23.710
we have fannypack fannypack plus dull

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:26.480
razor is the lamest but also like

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:29.600
literally does work kind of combination

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:36.670
we could conceivably have it will give

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:42.800
us consumables stop with the shooting

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:45.200
so I'd say at this point oh it's all

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:48.040
survival dude and honestly if we win

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:53.660
this run thank you with all of my

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:55.130
freaking heart to do that cube of meat

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:57.350
without this human meat if they'd given

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:58.520
us like you know an arranged upgrade

00:29:57.350 --> 00:30:01.580
instead of Cuba meat we would've been

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:03.290
screwed instead they gave us Cuba meat

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:05.450
and Cuba meat allowed us to succeed

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:06.740
while also simultaneously probably

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:11.270
causing us to take more damage than we

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:13.270
should have but you know what you know

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:17.980
you got to take the good with the bad

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:21.470
in fact it's so lame to have fanny pack

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:25.240
dull razor it actually does not even

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:28.190
work with a hundred percent certainty so

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:29.990
I'm definitely you know feeling like I

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:33.830
wouldn't mind picking up something that

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:37.490
gives us a bonus if we get hit I'll live

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:40.250
with it the halo all stats up Oh God

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:43.160
it's our first tears damage speed

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:44.660
upgrade we've had range admittedly don't

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:48.250
let me say this run hasn't given us

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:52.130
anything it's given us a range upgrade

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:53.540
and mom's knife but I'm I thought it was

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:56.900
clear that I'm leaving mom's knife out

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:58.310
of this but I didn't state that so I can

00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:01.540
understand why you would be confused

00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:01.540
yeah that was pretty dumb of me

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:12.730
take the polaroid fight Krampus I don't

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:14.800
care get dusted young head of Krampus

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:16.059
look I love dull razor I think it's

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:18.010
pretty clear this is not the right run

00:31:16.059 --> 00:31:21.070
for it and this is a once every six

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:23.110
rooms item so assuming get a full charge

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:28.420
after killing 15 enemies like that's

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:32.020
actually very very good it couldn't make

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:34.300
this into a fairly high quality item oh

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:37.480
it doesn't give us a full charge it

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:41.890
gives us one extra charge like one extra

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:43.090
increment of having charged still can

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:47.350
make up for things pretty quickly I

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:48.580
don't think we want tapeworm it's a cool

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:50.080
item I'm looking forward to

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:52.150
experimenting a little bit more with the

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:55.270
with the jumper cables whenever we get

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:56.950
the opportunity to that's not worth it

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:59.400
so we're not going to make the hush

00:31:56.950 --> 00:32:02.140
fight in a way that's actually like very

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:06.340
nice I don't have to think about the

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:12.100
hush fight just focus on grabbing the W

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:16.540
here oh he just made the biggest mistake

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:19.059
of your life buddy okay I just made the

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:20.830
biggest mistake of my life buddy it's

00:32:19.059 --> 00:32:25.240
not an Excel floor is it in fact a very

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:27.040
fast non Excel floor so oh he's done it

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.420
he has not done it he's done it he's not

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.500
done it that one you have to at the head

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.900
even though the tail is the weak point

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:33.700
every other time you do this but we got

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:37.350
a third deal with the devil in a row

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:43.900
this time it's got actually good stuff

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:46.960
Wow yes yes we have a statistically half

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:50.830
decent run now don't take the HP forget

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:53.170
the judgment just go we don't want more

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:54.070
HP from the judgment is the thing it's

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:56.640
not like we're doing anything with our

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:56.640
money but

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:04.809
in fact I just talked myself into

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:07.480
playing that judgment but sadly were a

00:33:04.809 --> 00:33:08.520
floor away so don't get your hopes up

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:11.230
too high

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:14.440
anyway this is now it's become like the

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:18.159
most boring archetype for a winning run

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:20.710
it's a moms knife Krampus head run an

00:33:18.159 --> 00:33:23.740
item that makes all other items on your

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:25.390
run relatively trivial plus a powerful

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:27.130
space bar item that shows up almost

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:29.289
every single time well you know what

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:32.500
it's a great reminder too boring ain't

00:33:29.289 --> 00:33:34.150
necessarily bad because we were having a

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.380
very exciting run for the first few

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:37.419
floors that would have almost certainly

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:41.200
ended in our debt if it was continuing

00:33:37.419 --> 00:33:42.669
along the same trajectory just like if

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:44.860
you continue your life of listening to

00:33:42.669 --> 00:33:46.750
rock and roll music eventually you too

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:50.230
will face the specter of the chosen

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:52.860
demon to call you when the poke I don't

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:52.860
know what I'm talking about

00:33:55.169 --> 00:34:01.000
you know rock and roll music used to be

00:33:57.429 --> 00:34:04.720
demonized of all the things all the

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:07.150
things to be demonized rock and roll

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:11.230
music seems like the strangest one

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:13.510
doesn't it have you ever heard a kiss

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:18.220
song I'm not anti kiss at all I think

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:23.500
kisses fun band it mostly singing songs

00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:25.359
about no Connie Lingus but I don't think

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:27.099
that we definitely do not want IV bag

00:34:25.359 --> 00:34:29.230
that's not an I don't think situation

00:34:27.099 --> 00:34:31.149
that's a guaranteed situation you're

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:33.190
worried I mean I'm just stealing from

00:34:31.149 --> 00:34:35.020
the plot of Detroit Rock City at this

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:38.669
point where the kiss is gonna make your

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:38.669
kids go to hell are you an idiot

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:43.839
gene Simmons is just a dirty old man

00:34:42.129 --> 00:34:46.030
he's not Satan you ever seen him outside

00:34:43.839 --> 00:34:47.879
of his makeup he looks like he runs a

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:50.470
mattress store

00:34:47.879 --> 00:34:53.379
you're worried that's you know the devil

00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:55.570
chose this as his disciple to corrupt

00:34:53.379 --> 00:34:57.160
the nation's youth I mean I'm like 30

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:59.070
years too late to be making this a bit

00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:01.900
but you get the idea

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:02.619
we just can't not get deals with the

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:05.050
devil anymore

00:35:02.619 --> 00:35:08.440
we also missed the hush fight by 59

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:12.550
seconds which is comical given you know

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:14.950
where this runs started so use a sun

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:16.150
card because at this point honestly it's

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:18.460
not that I want to finish the run

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:20.080
quickly - like I've got important you

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:23.560
know receipts to file or something like

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:26.380
that no it's more like set a second

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:28.630
Steam sale not that it matters at this

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:31.060
point but it's more like I want to make

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:37.170
this run pay the way it made me pay at

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:40.390
the start of this the Emperor dude

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:43.480
because I like you

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:49.119
I'm not going to use the Emperor on the

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:52.150
chest but know that I want to we're not

00:35:49.119 --> 00:35:53.890
why I instituted a policy like a year

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:56.950
ago people were complaining and they

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:58.900
were very right I was keeping Emperor

00:35:56.950 --> 00:36:00.400
cards from the Cathedral and using them

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:04.420
to skip the chest because the chest is

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:06.010
harder than the Cathedral but what why

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:07.330
that's a bad idea is because the chest

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:09.369
is more fun because it actually gives

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:11.530
you items whereas the Cathedral doesn't

00:36:09.369 --> 00:36:15.940
give you anything most of the time on

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:18.990
this run I have negative 0.82 luck it's

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:24.220
very unlikely please don't ruin my run

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:26.200
follow so angry fly maggie's bow it kind

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:30.220
of ruins it a little but it's not too

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:32.790
bad all things considered a speed

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:35.670
downgrade that's not too horrible either

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:38.470
so what oh that was close

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:41.830
we're very unlikely to get too many

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:43.930
extra items here for our performance on

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:45.940
this floor but we could still get some

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:50.850
and the chest has more engaging rooms I

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:50.850
think than the Cathedral so sure

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:58.300
I don't think it says it's a wrong

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:59.860
course of action so I don't know the

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:03.040
Krampus is head doesn't really seem like

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:04.720
it synergizes amazingly well with the

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:09.250
jumper cables maybe something more along

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:11.740
the lines of us something that takes a

00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:15.580
long time to charge up and is also

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:18.340
awesome so if you're low on defense

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:22.000
Satanic Bible Book of Revelations but

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:24.610
what about like you know what about like

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:28.210
a delirium or something maybe that's got

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:34.660
the the keys to the kingdom the one that

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:37.510
spawns a random boss bad damage the one

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:38.920
that spawns a random boss whenever you

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:40.300
pop it I was going to say when you go to

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.680
a boss fight but that's just the most

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:49.360
practical way to use it it's not the

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:51.280
guaranteed way to use it like I guess in

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:53.200
theory if you fought an enemy assuming

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.730
it works this way if you fought an enemy

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:58.000
that spawned other enemies that you

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:59.619
could keep it under control like a Dooku

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.540
flies for example you could get

00:37:59.619 --> 00:38:04.060
unlimited spirit hearts just by fighting

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:08.080
a dukkha flies kill all the Flies you

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:10.900
got to kill like freaking 90 to get to

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:13.359
the point where you get a this is the

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:14.800
one I should have killed first you got

00:38:13.359 --> 00:38:19.570
to kill like 90 to get to the point

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:23.890
where you'd get a an extra full charge

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:26.260
but hey you know you killed 900 enemies

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:28.320
and all of a sudden you got full spirit

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:30.730
hearts buddy nothing to worry about

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:33.510
just 900 flies how long could that take

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:40.030
all right dude

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:41.980
taste this cold steel and meats roast

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:44.020
beef sashimi

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:45.640
that's how I killed half the enemies in

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:46.750
this run that's how I got you to Buster

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.740
