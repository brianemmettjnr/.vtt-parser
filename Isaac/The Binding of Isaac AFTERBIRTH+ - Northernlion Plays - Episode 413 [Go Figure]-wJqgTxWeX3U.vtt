##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.629
hey everybody welcome back to neuronal

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.120
and plays the binding guys get referred

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.970
plus uh that we're starting like on the

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.099
first room of an Isaac run because I had

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.080
this weird glitch with OBS where the

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.700
game sound was like literally five to

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.619
six seconds behind where it should be in

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.480
the video it's been fixed but is

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.240
annoying as heck and just another

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.850
ongoing troubleshooting saga it never

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.420
ends because you know what struggle is

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:31.050
good it keeps you on your toes it keeps

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.680
you guessing and you grow that way one

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.090
9gn seven nine and three so I was doing

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.340
some troubleshooting testing and I just

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.660
started this run up there's nothing

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.770
special about it except that it's an

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.539
Isaac run I guess I will do darkroom

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.860
because we do have darkroom stuff to do

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:53.129
as Isaac still at the present moment we

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.020
might as well try to knock that out but

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.039
at the same time this is also just me

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.109
kind of refreshing my enjoyment of me

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.600
kind of refreshing my enjoyment of Isaac

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.799
in advance of diving into the afterbirth

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.510
Plus challenges and then we'll probably

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.760
do some more refresh runs and then we'll

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.180
go back and redo all the challenges that

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.180
we've unfortunately failed and/or

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.530
succeeded on poorly that's not really

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.600
the same meaning I was trying to think

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.770
of a way to sugarcoat it no sweetie you

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.780
didn't fail the challenge you just

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.530
didn't fit society's conventional

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.490
definition of success you know my

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:36.329
generation takes a live crap by the way

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.340
we we Millennials 50 year olds talking

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.280
about us it's the generation they always

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.689
had participation trophies oh you came

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.009
in the second-last here's a

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.509
participation trophy hey I got a ton of

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.270
participation trophies when I was doing

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.710
sports by the way that wasn't any good

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.340
at them but we got the participation

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.500
trophies nonetheless was it me as a nine

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.329
year old going to the engraver and going

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.909
uh excuse me sir could you please print

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.250
us up twenty participation trophies that

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.560
was your 30 year old butts going there

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.090
oh my son and/or daughter can't handle

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.739
failures so

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.599
we got to make sure that everybody gets

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.250
a trophy it wasn't us getting the

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.540
trophies it was you getting the trophies

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.860
cuz he didn't want to deal with our

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:22.800
emotions okay I pride myself I am very

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.569
able to handle failure and I know that

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.010
sounds like you know you're like a nail

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.930
you get mad when people say potatoes a

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.880
starch not a vegetable look all I'm

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.910
saying is that starches are vegetable

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.180
phylum vegetable is a kingdom in the tax

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.810
economical purposes of this I thought it

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.390
was worth a shot I did find it real rich

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.630
like my parents are pretty good about it

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.069
actually I think everybody to assume

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.900
that you're gonna get older and not be a

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.600
little bit out of touch is unreasonable

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.849
cuz I met a touch I'm 28 years old and

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.000
I'm I'm out of touch to some extent I'm

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.640
out of touch with you know 50 year olds

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.030
and I'm out of touch with 15 year olds

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:07.380
like I I don't understand can I get a

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.549
one boneless Pizza I just don't I'm

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.080
young enough to remember that if

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.640
somebody doesn't get your inside jokes

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.590
you laugh because that's the point is

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.120
that it's not funny you just go he does

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.390
he's not familiar with our shared

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.239
cultural experience but I also don't

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:25.560
understand what is a second mortgage

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.870
like you're taking out a loan on a loan

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.190
that you have on an asset that you sort

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.780
of own but not really it's very

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.700
confusing to me so I'm kind of caught in

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.010
the middle here but you know my parents

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.049
when they talk about my generation

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.139
Millennials they go you know I think you

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.180
guys are unique you know you're you're

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.980
you're the most overqualified generation

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.389
that's ever existed and yet you face you

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.380
know unique employment struggles and

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.299
stuff like that and I'm like you know

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.959
what mom and dad is a very progressive

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:54.450
way to think but they are also sometimes

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.889
like you know they they got to take

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.569
their own side in the debate to some

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.340
extent as well they're like what's going

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:03.600
on with people your age and I'm like mom

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.859
I don't know it's I have no idea I don't

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.709
even know what's going on with myself

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:11.260
some of the time this wasn't meant to be

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:17.169
like a generational warfare thing

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:18.549
oh no no yeah yeah yeah take the d6 we

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.810
can get a lot of value out of this let's

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:25.900
do this whole floor this could be a big

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:28.449
one but Millennials they take crap all

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.380
the time dude we're doing some good work

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.060
you know

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.740
fellow Millennials tough it out we're

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.620
we're one of the weirdest generations

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:39.699
probably that's ever existed well at

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:42.850
least in recent memory keep it going

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:44.199
you know keep killing Applebee's if we

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.990
can just get through this and have

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:48.190
killed Applebee's and possibly Chili's

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.960
look I'm not trying to insult anybody

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.080
who likes these restaurants it's not my

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.680
cup of tea then I think that we will

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:00.960
have succeeded as a generation great

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.270
granddad bought kaiser wilhelm ii

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.380
granddad you know went over to europe

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.919
struck down the tenants of national

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.919
socialism

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.949
we're gonna take down Applebee's and

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.530
maybe that's good enough

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.910
no offense Applebee's are you running

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.830
ads in front of this video eat at

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.639
Applebee's unlimited Appy hour what

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.800
could you like more than that so we're

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.180
definitely closing in on getting all

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:32.020
these books I think we've already gotten

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:33.330
I'm I ate and again as I always say at

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.800
this point I've told this story before

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.240
I've never eaten at an Applebee's so I

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.210
shouldn't insult them I have eaten at a

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:43.479
Chili's I hated it and they'd it was a

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.010
Chili's in an airport in the United

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.449
States and they had the nutritional

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.039
information printed on the menu which

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:50.110
was the worst because the food was not

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:51.970
only bad tasting but also like I was

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.729
like this is not taste good enough to be

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.500
this bad for me something that you guys

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.470
messed up the formula some it should be

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.520
like the most delicious food ever made

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:04.270
1300 calories for this

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:09.940
I don't think so anyway but I have eaten

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:12.310
at at TGI Fridays it was in Osaka Japan

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.690
and don't even get started with me cuz

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.389
everybody kill you we know you were in

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.360
Japan and you waited at TGI Fridays we

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:19.729
were in Japan for two

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.069
weeks we ate like one fast food meal and

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:24.139
my wife wanted to go to TGI Fridays okay

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:26.750
I'm sorry that's real live we have the

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:28.550
same thing that you no good second the

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.259
last time we were in Japan we ate at

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.789
McDonald's once and I ordered a weird

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:34.340
shrimp burger people why would you go to

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:35.930
Japan just even McDonald's you guys you

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.789
got a weird idea in your head

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.620
if island did you pan I would eat every

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:41.780
meal at the restaurant from jiro Dreams

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.120
of Sushi it would literally be like

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:48.110
thirty thousand dollars you're losing

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.759
your freakin minds here you know many

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.909
times I eat good Japanese for penny way

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:55.340
I ate at TGI Fridays in Osaka Japan it

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:56.659
was not that good and the meal for two

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.009
at the end of it came to like eighty

00:06:56.659 --> 00:07:01.129
five dollars and now it's like

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:03.439
something's the value proposition is

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:05.090
gone wrong here somewhere I don't her to

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:06.770
stay in fast casual what are you doing

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.659
maybe it was because it was overseas you

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.750
know I don't know they pay an extra cuz

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:19.969
TGI Fridays is foreign food yo this is

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:25.009
very good run baby Jude is a shadow nine

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:28.550
lives we can't get any more rerolls yeah

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:29.750
we can't get any more rerolls so you

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.940
might as well go back and take Eva's

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.680
bird foot or dead bird whatever the heck

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.529
it is I don't pay attention to items

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.060
that don't respect me we won't be

00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:39.919
getting any more rerolls so the best

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.629
thing we could do the thing that gives

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:43.789
us any chance I should say is to use two

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:45.560
of diamonds and then maybe go for like

00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:47.889
the world's luckiest reroll but now I

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:53.000
was we did it but it was kind of a whiff

00:07:47.889 --> 00:07:55.639
either way we're in a great spot here if

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.110
we wanted to we could become dark Judas

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:59.120
it's kind of not in the cards for me

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:03.589
just yet we do have stuff to do his eyes

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:05.360
again it's a fun run so it's open

00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:07.629
there's some other stuff Millennials can

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.629
kill

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:16.200
like car insurance I think I might be an

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:19.950
idiot because I don't understand

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:21.270
the insurance industry and I'm by the

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.720
way I'm not saying this is the way it

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.510
should be

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:26.490
I'm just asking for an explanation cuz

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.840
whenever I there's like a I think the

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:29.100
Internet has a problem of discourse

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.729
sometimes and you're gonna be like ooh

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:34.650
wheels say if I I firmly believe in the

00:08:32.729 --> 00:08:38.810
idea that there's no stupid questions

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:42.300
because you know stupid questions are an

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:43.620
important part of advancing as a person

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.630
and as a species you know it's the same

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:48.360
as like you know that's that's why you

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:50.070
do pair programming is so you know you

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.260
go to your buddy and you go hey what is

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:54.720
in this code working and then he goes a

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:56.220
stupid idiot you put your string literal

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.630
in single quotation marks instead of

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.890
doubles and you go I should have known

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:03.470
better but thank you for helping me

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:09.330
improve nonetheless how is car insurance

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:11.100
mandatory I own I I have never gone

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.330
without having car insurance because you

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.560
know you got to get this sticker to put

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.780
on your license plate hood you know you

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:19.650
get pulled over but I don't understand

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:22.050
why it's a necessity to have it nobody

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.480
forces you to have life insurance nobody

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.740
forces you to have health insurance

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.210
although I mean I guess in Canada they

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:30.270
do but yeah it's kind of a different

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:31.890
topic for a different day but car

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.690
insurance for whatever reason is is

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.310
different everybody has to have car

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:37.980
insurance is it because we as human

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:39.360
beings are bad drivers we're better at

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:42.360
living than we are at driving I don't

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:45.210
know this is I I admit there's probably

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.520
a really really good reason for it

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:49.770
but every time I something like that

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.930
online people just go oh lo look at this

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:54.510
idiot do they go not like this they use

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:56.310
various twitch emotes designed to you

00:09:54.510 --> 00:10:01.020
know shut down discourse instead of just

00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:02.550
offering a simple explanation I'd be

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:04.140
eager to know and you know what I think

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.760
the comments of the YouTube video about

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:07.080
the binding of issac afterbirth plus are

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.540
probably the right place to find out

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:12.270
teach me you know nobody you know they

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.710
don't say jack-of-all-trades or master

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:16.490
of all trades they say jack of all

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:16.490
trades master of none

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:22.280
I'm a master of certain trade it's

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:23.930
probably not many but I do put my string

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:30.200
literals in double quotation marks and

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:31.730
that's the important part this is our

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.550
turning point radio not that the run was

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:35.270
bad it was actually very fine but if you

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.460
know what I mean

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:39.380
but it's much much better now especially

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.940
cuz we already got our HP back and good

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:44.210
lord look at that that's another little

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:47.529
bit of HP for us there give me a little

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:57.009
bit more HP baby

00:10:47.529 --> 00:10:58.899
a good like insurance in general I don't

00:10:57.009 --> 00:11:00.639
fully understand I guess I should talk

00:10:58.899 --> 00:11:03.939
to a Roomba about her a room but why do

00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:06.850
you need car insurance what if I just

00:11:03.939 --> 00:11:09.249
got in an accident and I couldn't pay

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:13.240
the damages so they just threw me in

00:11:09.249 --> 00:11:14.589
jail or what if I just didn't get it in

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.850
an accident you might think that's

00:11:14.589 --> 00:11:17.019
ridiculous but what's the difference

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.670
between that and like non-mandatory

00:11:17.019 --> 00:11:22.360
health insurance what if I just don't

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:24.129
get sick well then you just die and it

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.720
has no consequences on anybody but

00:11:24.129 --> 00:11:27.339
yourself because of the way that we view

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:31.870
our contribution to society

00:11:27.339 --> 00:11:34.019
oh okay oh really reductive right now

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:39.879
hey you know fair that's a fair

00:11:34.019 --> 00:11:41.439
acquiescence as long as we keep the

00:11:39.879 --> 00:11:43.660
eternal heart in like half a spirit

00:11:41.439 --> 00:11:45.490
heart alive here I'm fine with this

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:47.259
who's our reroll potentially to get

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:50.259
something good from this room because

00:11:47.259 --> 00:11:52.059
Aquarius is just okay we'll save

00:11:50.259 --> 00:11:54.189
temperance for the next floor for

00:11:52.059 --> 00:11:58.209
multitudes of reasons is not the way

00:11:54.189 --> 00:12:01.029
that expression goes but we'll save it

00:11:58.209 --> 00:12:03.399
for the next floor because we'll have

00:12:01.029 --> 00:12:04.600
more HP predominantly plus we don't want

00:12:03.399 --> 00:12:07.959
to lose our eternal heart in case you

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:10.500
haven't noticed so pretty important

00:12:07.959 --> 00:12:10.500
element there

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.970
I don't have anything else I thought I

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.860
would have more on this you know

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:19.080
industries Millennials could kill bit

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:22.350
but I feel like weird I'm trying to keep

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:24.330
it in balance here yeah I'll take that

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:26.490
low resort well I got it confused again

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:28.880
it's not mom's eyeshadow it's mom's you

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:31.170
know mascara sorry two different things

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:33.060
apparently that's another thing

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:34.770
Millennials could kill you know what I

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:38.670
would like to see Millennials kill the

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:42.330
lotion industry I don't get it I you I

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:45.000
I'm being real with you I watch TV these

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:48.180
ads come on is Jennifer Aniston she's

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.040
using this you know oil of olay facial

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:52.730
cream don't no jokes please

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:56.340
this is a christian stream and she says

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:57.780
you know dermatologically proven to make

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.970
you look five years younger after using

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:03.060
for three weeks or less but but really

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:05.040
though I don't know I feel like we need

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:08.100
to do like a double-blind scientific

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.510
study like find me somebody you'll find

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:12.660
me like a hundred people who have never

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:13.080
used lotion in their life now we don't

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.730
need it

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:18.090
and a hundred people who have used

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:20.520
lotion prodigiously and then put them in

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:22.050
it like an a/b test with people who

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.580
don't know who's who and say you know

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:26.940
which one uses lotion which one doesn't

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:28.530
because I would like to know I would

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:31.790
like to know if this whole lotion thing

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.790
works out or if it's all a scam

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:38.389
by the way don't be a mr. know-it-all

00:13:35.689 --> 00:13:40.189
Chad don't go and chat Oh you know it

00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:42.800
does help but only a little bit I want

00:13:40.189 --> 00:13:44.449
to see data I want to see the New

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:48.170
England Journal of Medicine talking

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:50.120
about it okay I don't want to see a dude

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:51.889
with a spongebob squarepants avatar

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.930
telling me oh you idiot you don't even

00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:56.389
know what the oil of olay is one of the

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:58.189
most dermatologically email seed like I

00:13:56.389 --> 00:14:00.079
need that doesn't mean you're not a

00:13:58.189 --> 00:14:02.079
scientist just put on your lab coat when

00:14:00.079 --> 00:14:04.249
you tell it to me that's all I'm saying

00:14:02.079 --> 00:14:07.999
thank God we didn't die on that one I

00:14:04.249 --> 00:14:09.920
was a little scared I was petrified the

00:14:07.999 --> 00:14:20.269
Viggen Emma's was delivered where'd you

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:22.730
buy anything help me I don't know what

00:14:20.269 --> 00:14:27.410
swallowed like part of my own esophagus

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:28.939
there I'm still using our orbital you

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:31.990
know why I'm using the orbital civil

00:14:28.939 --> 00:14:37.220
disobedience maybe you've heard of it I

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:39.500
don't respect that the game forces me

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:42.230
into situations where I have no damage

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:45.519
upgrades three floors into the game four

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:53.660
floors into the game so what do I do I

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:55.370
use Cuba meat and I'm gonna keep doing

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.990
it until we face some real consequences

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:58.250
for our actions I mean we don't need to

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:59.629
do boss rush we're just supposed to go

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.189
dark room which I should continually

00:14:59.629 --> 00:15:03.829
remind myself hey you got to go dark

00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:06.379
room so make sure you actually would be

00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:09.139
algae's but ierra is also obviously

00:15:06.379 --> 00:15:13.399
amazing if the right circumstances align

00:15:09.139 --> 00:15:15.850
themselves no this is a bad time to get

00:15:13.399 --> 00:15:15.850
this room

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:23.760
slow it down we lived we must have had

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:31.790
another spirit are backing us up life's

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:35.910
good we have nine lives anyway but still

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:39.839
rather not throw our 2hp life away for

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:42.180
no reason we've had so many runs like

00:15:39.839 --> 00:15:44.670
not just recently like this week but

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:46.320
recently like this year we've had so

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:50.430
many runs where there's just like no

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:52.620
damage to go around you know we're on

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:53.070
like war rations for damage or something

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.370
like that

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:59.310
so it's always damage that comes with a

00:15:55.370 --> 00:16:02.250
catch to it you know hey here's a damage

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:04.220
upgrade but oh it makes your pinky toe

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:07.080
turn blue and fall off well here's a

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:09.089
tear delayed increase except it's not

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:11.790
actually unless you fulfilled

00:16:09.089 --> 00:16:12.839
you know the 1818 part quest line to

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:14.070
make it happen yeah I don't know what

00:16:12.839 --> 00:16:21.780
I'm talking about let's be realistic

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:24.180
okay um pokey Mans is pretty good okay

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:25.320
go wait the challenge is pokey man's

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:27.600
that's right

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:29.220
portable slot is not but it is a seven

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.589
cent item so I think it's worth buying

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:34.050
just to get a pedestal that we can then

00:16:31.589 --> 00:16:43.170
reroll and then we should have used a

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:44.760
bomb for that boomerang embarrassing we

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.050
do have another battery charge we should

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:49.890
go for because the battery charge is

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:52.560
effectively a free item right now but I

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:55.110
do the Tara waffles but I do find myself

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.990
annoyed a little bit just get a champion

00:16:55.110 --> 00:17:02.690
belt that's it that's all you need to do

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:07.350
mister me okay mister me is an item that

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:09.030
is mister me six but skirting copyright

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:12.959
infringement by calling it mister me

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:14.220
this item allows us to steal items now

00:17:12.959 --> 00:17:16.380
that I think about and that's kind of

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:19.790
the main draw right you steal sharp

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.790
items you steal deals with the devil

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:27.559
so what we should do I only want to

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:29.720
reroll the jar so we should do it like

00:17:27.559 --> 00:17:31.660
this I don't want any of those they're

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:35.390
not good enough

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:46.520
sure I'll steal there's options assuming

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:50.930
you'll allow me nevermind okay I only

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:52.610
want to steal with you would you it's

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:54.050
okay no don't even sweat it you know I'm

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:58.450
sorry I even asked here's my

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:58.450
participation trophy Oh careful please

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:11.660
it's the 3.5 damaged and actually slower

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:13.760
rate of fire is a new low for me as far

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:18.700
as I'm concerned I thank God for these

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:21.800
orbitals I really do I just wished that

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:23.480
you know they could hook me up with a

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.980
little bit of real damage instead of

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:27.200
forcing me to go the whole orbital route

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:29.059
every time no I don't I'm happy they

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:32.720
give me the orbitals cuz I like using

00:18:29.059 --> 00:18:36.050
the orbitals to deal damage it's fun

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:39.230
okay it's dynamic it's like how girls

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:43.090
like the bad boys you want the good

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:43.090
damage but you need the bad Cuba me

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:51.919
could you thank you could you thank you

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:53.270
as well for popping over down here if

00:18:51.919 --> 00:18:55.010
you could just die before I actually

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:57.679
have to land a shot on you that would be

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:59.600
perfect because my tears are basically

00:18:57.679 --> 00:19:01.850
just worth nothing right now but hey we

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:05.710
are getting close to spun and spun can

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:05.710
turn this whole run around like a top

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.720
speed is out of control why is our speed

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:15.650
out of control

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:16.070
I mean I know we just got a speed

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:19.580
upgrade

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:23.630
I'm just is this speed upgrade of this

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:26.960
magnitude or were we maybe we got pills

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:29.419
before just seems like we're like much

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:32.950
faster than I would normally expect to

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:32.950
be given the circumstances

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:44.290
what are we gonna use mister me for we

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:47.200
don't want permanent polaroid

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:51.010
invincibility because we want the

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:56.260
negative so it potentially could be wise

00:19:51.010 --> 00:20:01.090
for us I never heard that

00:19:56.260 --> 00:20:03.820
like drum beat before it's like Phil

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:06.130
Collins in the air tonight that'd be one

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:07.809
heck of a weather alert 90% of Phil

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:09.429
Collins in the air tonight oh we took it

00:20:07.809 --> 00:20:12.610
tears down pill that's what happened to

00:20:09.429 --> 00:20:14.290
us earlier again thank God for this

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:15.940
orbital apparently okay we got to stop

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:18.000
walking into enemies but I feel like

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:21.070
we're like a broken record at this point

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.200
hey how about I'll stop walking into

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:25.330
enemies accidentally when the game gives

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:27.100
me enough damage to justify me standing

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:29.620
apart from them instead of walking into

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:32.169
them go ahead big plays especially with

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:33.760
mr. musics sorry mr. mee it's a totally

00:20:32.169 --> 00:20:37.260
different that we came up with this idea

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:37.260
ourselves it's a very original thing

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:50.259
stop stop it

00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:50.679
either way we have taken a deal with the

00:20:50.259 --> 00:20:54.909
devil

00:20:50.679 --> 00:21:00.789
so we I would like it if you could can

00:20:54.909 --> 00:21:04.749
you that one you got all right I don't

00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:06.700
know what the criteria is but I'm a

00:21:04.749 --> 00:21:08.470
happy man okay so I squandered infamy

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:15.549
there and that one's entirely my own

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:18.399
fault is there anything else in here we

00:21:15.549 --> 00:21:20.139
might like to steal I mean you might

00:21:18.399 --> 00:21:21.309
like to steal the spirit heart but I'm

00:21:20.139 --> 00:21:22.539
just gonna buy it because we could be

00:21:21.309 --> 00:21:24.009
coming up close to our deal with the

00:21:22.539 --> 00:21:25.740
devil although there is a battery charge

00:21:24.009 --> 00:21:29.559
back there mostly it's more of like a

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:31.600
laziness thing to forgo future

00:21:29.559 --> 00:21:35.769
backtracking I was an ace of spades I

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:38.649
believe you can also use mr. me to deal

00:21:35.769 --> 00:21:43.299
damage but it's not very good at it kind

00:21:38.649 --> 00:21:46.649
of like me right now hive mind rod and

00:21:43.299 --> 00:21:49.269
baby is a big help and it's a one

00:21:46.649 --> 00:21:51.639
long-range manner to deal damage which

00:21:49.269 --> 00:21:53.279
is very nice we kind of run and dry on

00:21:51.639 --> 00:21:58.590
those lately

00:21:53.279 --> 00:22:02.950
infestation right okay we have I forgot

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:07.210
forgot that we don't have the d6 so I

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:10.710
tried to reroll and instead I stole an

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:13.419
item that was free so the joke's on me

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:16.090
it doesn't matter we have goat head just

00:22:13.419 --> 00:22:18.190
don't murder me and I'll be contented

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:20.080
any damage you want to give me is fine

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:24.179
as long as there's a guppy at the end of

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:30.690
the the railroad here rainbow somewhere

00:22:24.179 --> 00:22:30.690
over the railroad train tracks wine

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:36.330
locomotives all right here why then oh

00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:36.330
why can't

00:22:37.779 --> 00:22:47.609
I the song about a dude who wants to be

00:22:42.129 --> 00:22:50.109
a train typical millennial am i right

00:22:47.609 --> 00:22:52.899
yes we're gonna get a second level Cuba

00:22:50.109 --> 00:22:54.460
meet if we want to we could stick with

00:22:52.899 --> 00:22:56.559
the first level but actually I think

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:58.299
that's just being petty I would prefer

00:22:56.559 --> 00:23:00.279
to have gotten a chance at it if for an

00:22:58.299 --> 00:23:03.279
item but I think it's better to get a

00:23:00.279 --> 00:23:05.259
second level Cuba meet still fulfills

00:23:03.279 --> 00:23:09.059
its role as an orbital it's not like we

00:23:05.259 --> 00:23:09.059
gain anything for skipping it I knew it

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:20.970
at least it's the the good passive you

00:23:18.929 --> 00:23:22.169
want the bad hectic but you need waiting

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:25.320
you want the good active but you need

00:23:22.169 --> 00:23:28.679
the bad passive yeah I'm calling the

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:32.360
game of Thrones line it's a landmark in

00:23:28.679 --> 00:23:36.210
television cinema entertainment I

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:38.730
actually like do not care if I lose this

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:41.340
life bring me back is dark Judas okay

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:45.360
give me the HP and free my soul I want

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:53.520
to get lost in the rock and roll and do

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:54.720
rift away going from two HP to 1 HP

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.669
means nothing to me because I'm still

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.620
gonna continue to just run into these

00:23:56.669 --> 00:24:01.350
enemies not because I'm just impatient

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:03.870
by the way the reason I like this game

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:05.549
is cuz you don't end up having so many

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:06.630
rooms most of the time where you just

00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:08.130
walk in and go thought that that that

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:10.830
that that that that that that it just

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:12.410
makes the the combat sort of tedious you

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:15.419
know the idea is that you in the game

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:17.340
you both get stronger but you get

00:24:15.419 --> 00:24:19.350
stronger at variable rates we have not

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:21.690
really gotten stronger not much at least

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:25.020
and the game has gotten stronger it it's

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:26.820
like relatively linear rate we find

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:34.040
ourselves all of a sudden under that

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:34.040
asymptote George is getting upset

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:53.610
we will persevere I'm still not

00:24:50.669 --> 00:24:56.429
convinced the value of mr. mee by the

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:58.590
way you can probably guess from my use

00:24:56.429 --> 00:25:03.149
of it so far not my favorite item in the

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:06.590
game I kind of see it like the coupon

00:25:03.149 --> 00:25:12.360
like situationally it's got some

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:14.820
potential gravitas but in a kind of an

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:16.259
average situation it doesn't always you

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:21.720
know South Beach bringing the heat like

00:25:16.259 --> 00:25:24.059
Miami so the thing is stealing items

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:26.690
it's to say it's almost like a

00:25:24.059 --> 00:25:29.009
weaponized version of the coupon

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:30.840
stealing items sounds sweet and if

00:25:29.009 --> 00:25:33.679
you're low on HP is sweet but in most

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:36.690
situations actually just doesn't matter

00:25:33.679 --> 00:25:39.379
we can't get make boss rush so who cares

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:42.090
and and I say that it doesn't matter

00:25:39.379 --> 00:25:44.730
because it usually doesn't usually you

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:46.620
have enough HP to justify the deals with

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:52.710
the devil anyway another space bar item

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:54.750
might be more valuable or you have may

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:57.149
both of these unfortunately are not

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:58.620
useful for us because they're actives we

00:25:57.149 --> 00:26:00.480
could take blank card yarra and that

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:01.710
would be good on the chest but we'd miss

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.210
out on stealing to deal with the devil

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:06.769
items and experiencing kind of the new

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:06.769
items here but maybe that's for the best

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:18.180
give me a blank card Thoros we live to

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:18.180
get ierra and then we make this happen I

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:23.850
think it's a sensible

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:29.759
telling you just a damage up great

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:31.320
that's it it doesn't even have to be a

00:26:29.759 --> 00:26:40.610
good damage I've just give me a syringe

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:45.080
at this point that's like almost

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:45.080
tangentially what I wanted but not quite

00:26:46.249 --> 00:26:54.049
one thing's for certain though they

00:26:51.389 --> 00:26:56.879
basically cannot keep holding out on me

00:26:54.049 --> 00:26:59.340
if you get non-stop deals with the devil

00:26:56.879 --> 00:27:02.399
as long as you survive there is like

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:05.220
something good this way Thomas what is

00:27:02.399 --> 00:27:09.210
that crazy something will eventually

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:11.399
happen you'll get over that

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:12.499
three-point-five Damon chomp one way or

00:27:11.399 --> 00:27:14.700
the other

00:27:12.499 --> 00:27:16.230
notice I said get over I didn't want to

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:18.989
give the game the cosmic punishment

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:20.369
ability of me saying like oh that damage

00:27:18.989 --> 00:27:22.019
will change and then all of a sudden we

00:27:20.369 --> 00:27:25.559
pick up like curse of the blind soymilk

00:27:22.019 --> 00:27:29.899
and you know our damage all all of a

00:27:25.559 --> 00:27:29.899
sudden becomes like 0.73 or something

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:43.620
the Cuba meet is doing work I used to

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:45.840
think that take this and then Oh classic

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:47.400
and Al mistake I used to think okay

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.690
let's just throw whatever we have at the

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.250
wall here and see what sticks we still

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:51.870
do need to be Joel so we'll probably

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:54.680
just do that and hopefully maybe we'll

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:58.620
get the the void portal out of it but I

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:59.280
used to say like hey don't do as I do

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:01.350
here

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:04.020
don't use your orbital so much it's it's

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:09.030
bad practice I think in the modern Isaac

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:11.190
world it's actually completely okay

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:13.920
practice learn how to use your orbitals

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:15.420
the reason being approximately half the

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:18.120
time you're not gonna get a damage

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:19.500
upgrade anyway so any alternative

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:22.050
sources of damage you can practice with

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:24.750
no matter how risky dude it would

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:28.410
behoove you to get some experience in

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:30.210
that regard that's why I took sister

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:34.170
Maggie like half because I was mad that

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:37.500
I didn't take the negative and and half

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:40.890
because even sister Maggie is worth

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:42.180
something here this is also gonna be our

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:43.470
last deal with the devil so you know I

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:46.140
said if we keep getting deals with the

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:48.120
devil we're gonna be fine well it turns

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:50.730
out we're gonna stop getting deals to

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:53.040
the devil so it may not be fine I will

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:55.410
not fight hush but I will try to go down

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:57.120
to Sheol there's always a chance that

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:59.070
after Sheol will get the void portal and

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:01.260
then at least that justifies it to some

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:06.530
extent we like really don't care about

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:06.530
HP but we don't care much about each

00:29:06.759 --> 00:29:12.909
and think about it if you had mr. mee

00:29:10.719 --> 00:29:21.639
you could have gotten a free sister

00:29:12.909 --> 00:29:25.440
Maggie there Wow all right only mildly

00:29:21.639 --> 00:29:25.440
perturbed by that turn of events

00:29:26.279 --> 00:29:30.779
rotten baby you really got an aggro here

00:29:31.289 --> 00:29:40.299
agro like your first name is Carly and

00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:42.309
you work for sport net Pacific no see

00:29:40.299 --> 00:29:45.069
Carly aggro is a Canadian sports

00:29:42.309 --> 00:29:47.169
newscaster okay good stuff copies caller

00:29:45.069 --> 00:29:50.859
could be worth something so we're gonna

00:29:47.169 --> 00:29:53.229
go to Scholl if we play our cards right

00:29:50.859 --> 00:30:01.029
we might also be able to get a self

00:29:53.229 --> 00:30:02.529
sacrifice room and if we have to we can

00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:05.199
use the self sacrifice room to get to

00:30:02.529 --> 00:30:08.679
the lamb but we're in like full daily

00:30:05.199 --> 00:30:10.209
scum mode at this point we have not used

00:30:08.679 --> 00:30:12.789
blank card Yara at all we should

00:30:10.209 --> 00:30:15.519
definitely use blank card Yara ideal

00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:17.229
circumstance a spirit heart or demon

00:30:15.519 --> 00:30:21.789
heart pays out and then we can use blank

00:30:17.229 --> 00:30:24.399
card Yara to finish this HP level off

00:30:21.789 --> 00:30:26.979
here but dude do I have to tell you

00:30:24.399 --> 00:30:28.119
again I think at some point I might get

00:30:26.979 --> 00:30:30.009
a reputation for being a little bit

00:30:28.119 --> 00:30:31.509
complaining and maybe I have become a

00:30:30.009 --> 00:30:32.859
little bit complaining I played a lot of

00:30:31.509 --> 00:30:36.279
this game so I think wouldn't things

00:30:32.859 --> 00:30:38.289
when I get a semi bad dice roll it's you

00:30:36.279 --> 00:30:39.819
know plausible that I'm a little bit

00:30:38.289 --> 00:30:45.239
more of a baby about it than I was when

00:30:39.819 --> 00:30:49.659
I was more ignorant however we have no

00:30:45.239 --> 00:30:52.859
damage we have three point five damage

00:30:49.659 --> 00:30:52.859
on Sheol

00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:02.200
screw it that's a little on the

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:06.580
difficult side of course now okay now we

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:08.350
have 5.19 damage on show amazing I don't

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:12.549
know why I'm doing like an old Owen

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:16.000
Wilson voice Gigi types coming after me

00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:18.610
there's no a better one there I mean the

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.840
Royal Tenenbaums no wait wait that's so

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:21.610
you just getting weird now

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.169
it's like Owen Wilson playing

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:24.520
Littlefinger I'm sorry for all the Game

00:31:23.169 --> 00:31:30.909
of Thrones references that one just sort

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:35.919
of came out my director is into Michael

00:31:30.909 --> 00:31:39.250
Bay it's an Anderson oh I am dumb that

00:31:35.919 --> 00:31:42.970
was me being dumb so prepare for these

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:44.860
lives to probably start to end I think

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:52.450
we've done a pretty good job not having

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:55.510
them in advance at this moment the dirty

00:31:52.450 --> 00:32:00.419
secret here is that I really don't want

00:31:55.510 --> 00:32:00.419
there to be a self-sacrifice circle

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:09.019
where did that bomb go

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:12.320
I would much rather like be given a

00:32:09.019 --> 00:32:15.220
convenient excuse to be free of this run

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:15.220
right now but

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:22.380
we're not in that situation so hey

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:26.040
rotten baby would you like a range

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:28.470
upgrade or something like just looking

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:33.210
for like basically any way conceivable

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:34.770
to get some damage done to you and have

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:42.150
you help out and doing damage to the

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:44.030
enemies thank you so I think we're

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:47.100
basically even right now you know we've

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:48.720
gotten a modest tiers downgrade and a

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:52.410
modest damage upgrade what is he

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:55.980
complaining about not to mention one

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:58.560
third as much health as we had to start

00:32:55.980 --> 00:33:02.490
the game with just a pretty basic run

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:08.130
for all intents and purposes I don't

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:11.310
like Charms hooves here it's not one of

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:15.420
my things we did manage to win though

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:17.790
which is let's be straight up kind of

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:21.020
incredible it's actually the run of

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:24.020
which like I've played the best recently

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:26.490
and that's scary that's a scary thought

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:30.210
cuz it doesn't feel like one of the runs

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:31.440
on which I played the best Lovelace so

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:33.270
here's here's how you get out of this

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:37.200
situation you double that then we go

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:39.960
look for battery charges battery charges

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:41.940
hello yes Mr Bond it's a pleasure to

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:45.480
finally meet you my name is battery

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:49.290
charges I'm the main henchwoman to the

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:51.060
main villain who would be converted onto

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:54.860
your side by the power of your machismo

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:54.860
before the end of the field

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:12.300
no tinted rocks remember we're just kind

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:13.860
of farming bad - recharges Mr Bond I am

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:16.770
a noble woman I couldn't possibly

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:19.860
acquiesce to your libidinous demands

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:21.480
I am Duchess bad to recharge hey they're

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:23.310
like people watching this video like

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:26.610
he's finally broken game finally broke

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:30.290
him we knew what was gonna happen this

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:30.290
industry chews you up and spits you out

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:35.780
obviously we should have gone back a

00:34:32.490 --> 00:34:41.730
little earlier but we're looking for a

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:43.290
self-sacrifice that's more of a pee-wee

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:46.730
Herman that was attempted to be an Owen

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:46.730
Wilson at least I didn't just go

00:34:52.300 --> 00:35:01.920
I'll walk into the fire it doesn't

00:34:55.870 --> 00:35:01.920
matter though like yes Joker Joker me

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:17.500
why not so what do you do you try

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:19.710
something along these lines it it worked

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.710
ish

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:30.530
by the way if you're watching this and

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:32.120
you're saying I know he's gonna

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:33.860
accidentally end his own life on this

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:37.070
run not gonna happen

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:39.170
as soon as I get down to one life I'm

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:41.150
going through that chest I'm trying to

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:44.240
give the game the benefit of the dirt

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:45.920
right now it lost the benefit of the

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:48.760
doubt ages ago but for now it's getting

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.760
the benefit of the dirt

00:35:57.550 --> 00:36:01.510
the fellowship of the dirt

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:09.890
that's it that's the floor so the very

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:12.110
last thing we'll do is go check the

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:14.000
curse room I can't imagine unless the

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:16.610
curse room somehow allows us to teleport

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.580
to the air room can't imagine we're

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:20.030
gonna be too happy with how this goes

00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:22.130
there we go

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:24.200
I'm gonna be honest with you I gave it

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:28.000
my all I know that we did pick up the

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:30.830
wrong item after the mom fight but I

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.890
seriously like I left it all on the

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:35.570
table this time we didn't get what we

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:36.950
were looking for we're out at least we

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:39.050
unlocked something what do you get as

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:41.210
Isaac darkroom mom's knife that's a good

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:42.470
one well worth it and a new challenge

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:43.400
