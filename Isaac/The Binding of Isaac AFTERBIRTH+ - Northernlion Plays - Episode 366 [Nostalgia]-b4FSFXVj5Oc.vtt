00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.540
everybody welcome and relying plays the

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.610
binding of issac address plus excuse

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.559
this is the wrong save file I was like

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.170
negative one streak that doesn't seem

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.550
right so on the last run we dated as

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.350
Lazarus the game got mildly harder if I

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.150
remember correctly these two levels

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.430
without taking damage eve judas kane

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.380
maggie seven plus heart containers how

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.730
do we not have 7 plus hard containers

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.289
yet probably because we keep giving away

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.120
our HP to deals with the devil kept 616

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:38.270
Minnesota that's going to be our seed

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.649
today nothing to concern ourselves with

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.450
Isaac's been fun we've been having some

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.640
good runs lately some tricky runs I

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.739
don't know like if I regressed in terms

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.090
of my own personal skill level one

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.739
second I've find myself

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.090
shouting here that's usually an

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.309
indication that I've got the game turned

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.949
up too loud by myself talking over

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.180
myself which is normally not I mean it

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.859
just gets you caught in this feedback

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.840
loop world where eventually you're like

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.489
you know everybody was already you know

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.610
they don't want to do that I want to

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.630
have a voice when I'm 40 years old do I

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.150
ever want to use it

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.750
no preferably not but I do want to still

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.270
be able to talk if possible not that

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.250
likely it's an exhausting job

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.920
necessarily but you get the idea you

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.960
know I would if possible prefer to keep

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.290
my vocal health important as I've gotten

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.970
older probably because I sit at a

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.590
computer yelling into a microphone all

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.509
day there's two parts of my body I care

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.420
about more than any else what is that

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.960
your your heart and your kidneys snow

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.490
hardened lungs nope brain and liver no

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.369
no of course not

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:50.340
it's my voice and my rib eye once every

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.990
like three or four months I wake up with

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.689
just this terrible wrist pain and I'm

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.210
like I'm so close to like recalibrating

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.439
my setup to be mildly more ergonomic and

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.770
I know you're saying you're watching

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.329
this and you're going oh you know NL you

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.649
don't understand wrist pain you know you

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.899
want to be one of those nerds who wears

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.629
a wrist protector when they work as a

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.520
you know Ruby on Rails programmer at a

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:15.080
bank or something like yeah first off

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.000
it's probably COBOL but secondly

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.540
yeah I think I should get those wrist

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.680
guards it might be lame to look I mean

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.350
it's certainly you're not going to be

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.760
like the coolest guy on the block

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:33.090
wearing a wrist guard on the other hand

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.710
you know you might have risks alive when

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.480
you get to be like slightly older I

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:41.220
think that's important but I feel the

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.380
same way about wrist guards that I feel

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.610
about bicycle helmets so many times

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.260
we'll be in twitch ad people will be

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.390
like I don't wear bicycle helmets I just

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.700
choose not to fall off my bicycle that's

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.020
ignorant you say Oh what about seat

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.540
belts they go of course I wear a seat

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.420
belt I'm not an idiot I don't find them

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.040
too different you know you sure bad

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.510
drivers could hit you even if you're

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.350
driving well but they can hit you on a

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.940
bike too anyway all I'm saying is wear a

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.560
helmet do you need to have a wrist guard

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.700
maybe maybe not depends how much time

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.140
you spend on the computer and the kind

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.030
of setup that you got going on there but

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.930
I'm no longer concerned with looking

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.940
cool as an adult I have to look cool

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.760
only occasionally let's be honest I'm

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.530
not trying to score acting roles I'm not

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.820
trying to sell you ebooks I don't have

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.269
to look cool I just have to be

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:30.030
comfortable in having wrists back or

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.980
alive when I'm in my middle-age would be

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.709
nice you know I throw a spiral with my

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.530
imaginary child that's a joke obviously

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.140
I don't know how to throw a spiral in

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.030
fact I went to school in Canada because

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.160
I'm Canadian nobody in my high school

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.750
really knew how to throw a spiral my

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.060
high school has a football team but they

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.830
got one after I graduated and apparently

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.650
there's a long legacy of them stinking

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.300
which is fine you know it's high school

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.340
football in Canada what's your upper

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.930
ceiling try to play a high college

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:03.660
football in Canada who says most who's

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.730
the best Canadian football player ever

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.860
I'm not saying in the Canadian Football

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.810
League I'm they are there many Canadians

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.620
or even any Canadians who ever made a

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.540
you know multi-year career in the NFL

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.600
I'm ed this is an honest-to-god question

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:22.130
I don't know the answer

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.130
let's just go fight monstro

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.740
what is this is like run seven or eight

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.080
so we got to be getting pretty close to

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.720
permanently unlocking Sheol I think

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.830
which I don't know when do we unlock the

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.240
Polaroid when do we unlock Sheol when do

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.620
we unlock the Cathedral I don't remember

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.880
and I'm gonna try to avoid looking it up

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.080
so I can continue to be a little bit

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.320
surprised by what we're coming across

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:48.940
here I'm not insulting my countryman you

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:50.830
know I we're just not necessarily the

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.150
greatest football or soccer players in

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.430
the world and we got to accept that

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.860
we've got ice hockey we've had a great

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.020
recent track record with ice hockey that

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.730
I'm very appreciative of I think this is

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.840
our first Krampus putter eternal we

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.310
fought him once before and unlocked

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.270
Krampus is head we need lump of coal you

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.170
know what this might be a good run to

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:15.060
try to unlock Maggi at this point but we

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:19.030
think about this no okay um

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.250
anyway we'll see we got a good track

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.780
record with ice hockey I always end up

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.580
being surprised in the Olympics as well

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:28.060
you know they'll be like oh the number

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.130
one buy athlete is from Canada and

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.870
you're like I had no idea it's honestly

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.150
a major surprise to me it turns out

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.860
behind the scenes we got people

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.810
apparently training for the Olympics or

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.010
something I always thought you just sort

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.010
of showed up and we're good at it

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:49.690
so joking of course I will give this a

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:55.120
shot and a huge fan of what we got out

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:57.570
of that actually now on ironically a

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:01.000
huge fan of what we got out of that um

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.920
not going to let me gain access to the

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.740
item room huh it's a little bit of a

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:11.170
jerk move I'm going to be honest I'm

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:15.190
going to try for a secret room here I am

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:16.660
going to try for a secret room here we

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.840
already tried here and it wasn't there

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:22.300
so sadly I think we're just out I did

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.820
open a golden chest on the last floor so

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:28.240
I have to admit responsibility to some

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:31.120
degree it's very unfortunate

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.800
at least we got a really good item so we

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.280
don't feel too bad about it but kind of

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.530
a bummer

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.180
our angel statue is like do they even

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:44.039
exist in our game right now I'm not sure

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:47.069
I want that I want all of that as well

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:50.110
not too much I can do about it though I

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:54.250
think I've got an honest-to-goodness

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:55.410
question when the hell will it end what

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.360
are you talking about Northern Line

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:04.470
current events political stuff war

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:07.780
famine disease no movie theater snacks

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:10.270
I've grown up you know I've been on this

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.039
great earth for 28 years when I was a

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:15.639
kid to go to the movies to get popcorn

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:19.930
and say they got popcorn sodas and

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:22.750
candies got a little older first

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:25.120
evolution nachos hot dogs hamburgers

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:28.659
pizza slices they installed a Slurpee

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.190
machine and even then I didn't stand up

00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:31.389
I didn't say what are we doing here we

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:35.009
getting away from the things that are

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:37.449
important instead I just topped it out

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:40.389
sometimes they even got a Slurpee myself

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:42.280
I gave in to the temptation now science

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:45.190
has gone too far our movie theater has a

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:47.440
Starbucks in I can't help myself you

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:49.840
want to get like a hey can I get a venti

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.940
americano it's 10:50 p.m. I want to pee

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.380
19 times while watching spider-man

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:56.770
homecoming which I thought was a

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:58.360
genuinely delightful fun movie that in

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:00.759
my personal opinion was about an eight

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:03.280
and a half out of ten one of the one of

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:05.080
the most enjoyable Marvel movies of the

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:08.500
year and we can say that now because

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:10.030
there's like 20 a year I liked it I

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.380
think a little bit more than Doctor

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:14.969
Strange even though Doctor Strange is

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:17.320
still good in my opinion I liked it a

00:08:14.969 --> 00:08:18.610
lot more than guardians of the galaxy -

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:21.030
even though I did like guardians of the

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:23.590
galaxy - as well

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:25.599
I'd give his number one out of the last

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.550
three my mr. Aiman I'm not counting

00:08:25.599 --> 00:08:30.610
Logan Logan is transcendental it's

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:31.719
otherworldly it's haunting now went to

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.829
the movie theater last I was even

00:08:31.719 --> 00:08:34.479
talking about the Starbucks they didn't

00:08:32.829 --> 00:08:37.029
actually get a copy at 11 p.m. that's

00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:39.849
ridiculous plus it was like $8 I'm not

00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:40.670
paying $8 for coffee not until they you

00:08:39.849 --> 00:08:44.650
know

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:47.930
of the rollout of twitch Prime at least

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:50.030
they now have flavor boosters for

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:51.980
popcorn when you get popcorn they go oh

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:54.380
do you want some flavor boosters I said

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.940
of course the rational thing with the

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.740
heck is a flavor booster and the person

00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.890
mind the cash didn't even have the

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:02.870
decency to explain it to me like a human

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:05.450
being like I'm anything more than cattle

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:08.240
to them she just picked up this little

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:09.470
laminated placard she had and pointed at

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.260
it and she was like you can get you know

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:15.560
M&amp;Ms or score pieces in your popcorn I

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:17.420
said no because that's too far I don't

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.190
think you can just put one food into

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.990
another food and call it a booster I

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.580
don't think you can put a hotdog inside

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:24.380
of a pizza crust and say it's a crust

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:27.760
booster I'm trying not to give young

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:31.010
brands any ideas here that was close

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:33.590
candy on the side sure but even then I

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:35.090
start to call into question if whether

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:39.920
whether or not we really need this is a

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:43.610
society you know thank god that's a

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:45.380
great opportunity for us I don't I don't

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.550
not care about compost but I wanted to

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:50.030
see if there's a spirit Arden here

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:51.440
already the number one coupon at the

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:52.670
movie their number one combo at the

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.830
movie theaters too much for one person

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:58.250
to eat probably too much for two people

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:59.570
leave it's one like 22 gallon soda you

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:05.210
say gallons because it makes it sound

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:07.610
larger it's for centiliters no it's it's

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:10.040
like a it's a very very large soda like

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:11.870
an oil drum filled with pasty a medium

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.820
popcorn which is the size of the Hubble

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.440
telescope which I'm assuming is large

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:18.290
but I've never actually seen it in real

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.910
life and then a small candy of your

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:23.540
choice it's too much that's too much

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:27.080
food to eat over the course of two hours

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:32.900
and like still feel good about keys

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:34.580
please keyed for F to run and then you

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:37.670
want to put some candy into the popcorn

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:39.740
as well it's ridiculous you need to

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.750
start making longer movies to make that

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.010
a cost-effective decision like if I went

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:45.530
to the theater and we were watching like

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:47.680
battleship potemkin I might consider it

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:51.410
but apart from that it's not conceivable

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:54.029
it's like a 2,300 calorie snack

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:58.410
but I can't resist and this is where it

00:10:54.029 --> 00:11:01.950
all comes back around I I think I am a

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:03.360
strong person in many ways I don't get

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:05.880
rattled easily

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.829
I have resilience I'm not prone to

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:12.060
lashing out I'm not quick-tempered

00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:14.160
I try to make responsible decisions if

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:17.310
you put a bag of popcorn in front of me

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.930
I can't not eat all the popcorn I will

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:22.500
eat all the popcorn until I feel

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:24.480
physically ill I don't know if it's like

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.339
you know thanks a lot ancestors back in

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:29.399
the day we lived unlike a corn

00:11:26.339 --> 00:11:32.459
plantation you know in what is now Idaho

00:11:29.399 --> 00:11:33.899
or something like that all my ancestors

00:11:32.459 --> 00:11:35.550
ate was corn all day

00:11:33.899 --> 00:11:38.269
if the popped variety and now I

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:40.980
inherited this like you know

00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:42.959
biologically or evolutionarily redundant

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:45.899
preference required even like corn that

00:11:42.959 --> 00:11:50.279
much like of course Jonathan Davis's

00:11:45.899 --> 00:11:53.130
band is amazing but corn on the cob I'm

00:11:50.279 --> 00:11:55.019
for it corn just like you know shaved

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:56.519
off the cob and then served on the side

00:11:55.019 --> 00:12:00.029
of a meal I'm okay with it but it's not

00:11:56.519 --> 00:12:02.310
my favorite but for some reason popcorn

00:12:00.029 --> 00:12:05.579
and by some reason I mean obviously heat

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:07.350
butter and salt I can't resist they're

00:12:05.579 --> 00:12:09.690
on the same level as like tortilla chips

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:11.040
for me it takes a lot for me to admit

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:14.399
this because it's not becoming of an

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:16.860
adult but I cannot not eat popcorn if

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:19.290
you ever wanted to set a trap to catch a

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.760
northern lion just be like hey I bought

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:22.769
this platform but I'm not feeling well

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.480
because you want it I will eat all the

00:12:22.769 --> 00:12:26.160
popcorn you don't even need to poison it

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.600
just give me a lot of popcorn I'll be

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.519
like a bird I'll just keep eating until

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:35.279
I explode is that an urban myth I don't

00:12:29.519 --> 00:12:36.540
know same thing with tortilla chips you

00:12:35.279 --> 00:12:39.800
could put me in a review put me in a

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:42.120
room just me and like ten boxes of Oreos

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:44.430
you could trust that you could come back

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:46.140
in six hours I wouldn't have eaten the

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:48.329
Oreos I know some people they have a

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.800
sweet tooth can't resist that and of

00:12:48.329 --> 00:12:51.360
course when I say canvased I mean like

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.810
would prefer not to exercise the

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:56.870
self-control required to resist you

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:59.850
could leave me in trust of your Oreos

00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:01.589
there's no problem I will never eat your

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:04.480
Oreos unless you give me

00:13:01.589 --> 00:13:06.579
but never leave me in charge of us a

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:10.240
vault full of popcorn it's never going

00:13:06.579 --> 00:13:12.839
to work the only the only winning move

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.839
is not to play

00:13:13.709 --> 00:13:21.910
we do have an angel deal chance here

00:13:16.449 --> 00:13:26.759
which is actually pretty sweet because

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:29.620
we can get items while keeping our our

00:13:26.759 --> 00:13:31.269
HP to possibly unlock Maggie now why

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:34.720
would we want to unlock Maggie good

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:36.069
question as long as we can get to 6a

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.649
well the answer is because we have but

00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:39.790
if you want to get the six HP or if you

00:13:38.649 --> 00:13:41.589
want to get Maggie unlocked I'll be in

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:44.879
to do is get to six HP and then use the

00:13:41.589 --> 00:13:49.300
strength card and that should count I

00:13:44.879 --> 00:13:50.920
believe that will fulfill the required

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.779
conditions I don't want to do this but I

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:56.050
felt kind of like shoehorn into that I

00:13:52.779 --> 00:13:57.370
put myself in a bad spot there enough

00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:03.040
money to buy a red heart we do want to

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:04.509
go to the curse rooms if we can here so

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.550
just don't pop the strength card like an

00:14:04.509 --> 00:14:10.480
idiot and try to get xbox TiVo shots to

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:12.429
pop when he's vulnerable how are we

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:14.499
going to do that essentially the only

00:14:12.429 --> 00:14:15.999
way I think is to just spam expose TiVo

00:14:14.499 --> 00:14:18.579
shots and then hopefully you'll get more

00:14:15.999 --> 00:14:20.139
chances in the lottery this runs good

00:14:18.579 --> 00:14:20.679
though next we'll see those carrying a

00:14:20.139 --> 00:14:22.620
lot for us

00:14:20.679 --> 00:14:26.559
Oh spelunker boi cheeps samson unlocked

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:28.179
we didn't take any damage what we

00:14:26.559 --> 00:14:31.089
haven't taken any damage throughout all

00:14:28.179 --> 00:14:34.420
of the caves oh I wonder if the blood

00:14:31.089 --> 00:14:35.800
bank counts but if sincerely if we

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:39.429
haven't taken damage throughout any of

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:41.379
the caves we might as well just go down

00:14:39.429 --> 00:14:43.120
and see if this unlocks Sampson now

00:14:41.379 --> 00:14:44.259
instead of good yeah okay good I thought

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.389
if we went to the curse room it might

00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:48.100
cancel out that so technically the right

00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:51.639
decision was probably go to go to the

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:54.040
curse room but from from a more meta

00:14:51.639 --> 00:14:57.389
like long-term standpoint I think we

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:59.499
made the right decision here anyway

00:14:57.389 --> 00:15:01.779
what's your snack of choice is the movie

00:14:59.499 --> 00:15:03.040
theater I honestly Emma no food is the

00:15:01.779 --> 00:15:04.990
movie theater kind of guy because I

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:07.059
can't be trusted with it I've got I find

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:09.670
myself doing like war rations with a

00:15:07.059 --> 00:15:11.420
one-kilogram bag of cotton or not cotton

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:13.010
candy popcorn

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.450
I like to be so full when I go to the

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:17.210
movie theater that I'm not tempted I

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:19.730
know much is made of like you know

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:20.840
concession prices I understand you know

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.840
the movie theater is there running a

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:27.440
business and most of the ticket price

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:29.000
proceeds go to the studio but I still I

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.710
just prefer not to buy concessions

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.980
because it actually negatively impacts

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:35.480
my enjoyment of the movie frozen I enjoy

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.680
menteur about the first 15 minutes and

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.780
then after that I'm just thinking should

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:41.060
I have more popcorn no but I'm going to

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:43.460
anyway I'm like a five-year-old child I

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:45.080
do the same thing in sporting events I

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.730
would much rather eat before the

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:50.450
sporting event because then when you got

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:52.850
to get out of your chair you know you go

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:56.840
onto the concourse and it's really busy

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:58.460
and so you know you're walking into

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.110
drunk people all the time and you're

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:01.970
like hey I'm trying to get drunk can you

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:04.460
mind your own business you know some of

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:06.140
us aren't there yet I've got to go pee

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:08.360
in a trough with a bunch of other dudes

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:14.240
wearing the same shirt as you it's a

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:17.810
very strange event I do apologise for my

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:20.150
city somewhat recently there does our

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:23.000
deal with anything champs my parents

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:26.450
came over like last September September

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.640
2016 we went to a Vancouver Canucks vs.

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:31.730
Edmonton Oilers preseason game and we

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:33.830
sat next to these douchebags and I don't

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:36.290
use that term lightly but they were like

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:38.270
sauced up to an enormous degree what'd

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:40.160
you do at a hockey game from time to

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:41.900
time without a doubt they're like 30

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.670
years old

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.870
they were throwing I wish it weren't

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.400
this because it makes the story sound

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:48.470
more I'm sound more unbelievable but

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.960
they were throwing popcorn like trying

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:52.520
to throw it onto the ice nobody was

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.710
stepping up to stop him and I wasn't

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:56.180
going to do it it's like I don't want to

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:57.980
get my butt kicked in front of my dad

00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:01.670
that's like the most emasculating thing

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:02.990
you can't for imagine but you know

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:04.340
eventually after the second period they

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:06.680
just left and never came back I don't

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:07.220
know if they got removed or what but I'm

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.010
sorry

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:12.190
some people are jerks don't be that guy

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:14.540
I trust that everybody watching this

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:17.690
sometimes you can accidentally be a jerk

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:19.550
by like non maliciously just being

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:23.420
unaware of social norms like I worked

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:25.319
with a lady when I was in Korea one time

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:28.919
I got on the bus with her

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:31.710
and she just took out a like fingernail

00:17:28.919 --> 00:17:33.960
clipper and started clipping her nails

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:35.429
on the bus and I was like this is a

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.470
public place since she's late oh is that

00:17:35.429 --> 00:17:39.720
rude and I was like I don't know if it's

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:41.910
rude not like I don't think you're a

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.500
mean person for doing it it's just a

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:45.330
little weird right and she's like oh

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:48.390
cage put the finger narrow fingernail

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:50.520
clippers away I think that happens a lot

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:53.549
like I think we're all accidentally

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:55.350
jerks in a lot of situations I'm

00:17:53.549 --> 00:17:57.809
probably an accidental jerk all the time

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:59.070
and I think highlighting accidental jerk

00:17:57.809 --> 00:18:03.390
are' is kind of something that we do on

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:09.390
the show from time to time on the NL SS

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:11.549
that HP I please aim at amis I'm second

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:13.169
I had to close this it's not making it

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:18.630
framing it's just I got a lot of stuff

00:18:13.169 --> 00:18:20.220
open in the background here should be

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:22.260
better there's no reason to have like 12

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:25.580
active tabs open when you're doing

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:27.799
something else mom I'm at work right now

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:30.750
I'm trying to think of an example that

00:18:27.799 --> 00:18:33.120
fits the bill I in the grocery store I

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:35.370
cut in front of people all the time the

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:37.020
grocery store aisles are really thin I

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:39.630
will if I know what I want from a

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:41.160
grocery aisle and you're like hanging

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:42.780
out there comparing 12 different types

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.890
of granola bars I'm going to sneak in

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.450
there I'm going to push my car do

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:47.309
whatever available gap there is and I'm

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:49.919
going for it because that interaction is

00:18:47.309 --> 00:18:51.390
like in and out you know we're not going

00:18:49.919 --> 00:18:53.220
to have a conversation about it I'm just

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:55.049
going to excuse me and then I mean I

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.100
don't know if that's accidentally being

00:18:55.049 --> 00:18:57.360
a jerk but I'm sure there have been

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.770
times where people have come back from

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.990
the grocery store been like this little

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:06.870
tour push past me in the grocery store

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:08.780
today Kiki's blood honey I don't want to

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:12.360
kick anybody's button

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:14.850
mostly because I never have so I think I

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:18.059
wouldn't be very good at it although

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:19.950
like all nerds I maintain that there is

00:19:18.059 --> 00:19:21.210
a devil up inside of me and if you rile

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.500
me up to the point where I get that

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:25.890
angry watch out because you're going to

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:27.660
catch these hands I think it's our job

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:29.070
as understanding individuals which I'm

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.480
sure we all are for watching these

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.730
videos I like to think we're kindred

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.950
spirits

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:44.810
despite the probabilistic unlikelihood

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:48.680
of that I tried uh we've got a separate

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:50.780
accidental douchery from purposeful

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:53.270
Boucherie malicious douchery somebody

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:56.150
who is this is a real story that I know

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:58.280
is going to sound suspiciously fake we

00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:00.110
got our car like two years ago it's

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:02.510
maybe a week after that we were driving

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:04.450
in downtown Vancouver it's a bit of a

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:08.450
madhouse

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:10.730
kate is trying to change lanes she puts

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:12.320
on her left signal light looks to you

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:14.510
know checks her mirror checks her blind

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:17.750
spot tons of room she goes to get into

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:19.190
the lane the car that was behind her in

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:22.160
the other lane that she wanted to get

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:24.170
into sped up blocked her position and

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:27.620
then looked over I was in the car with

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:29.720
her looked over and did like a nonono

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:33.880
gesture with their hand like as if like

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:38.210
oh you thought you could pass me that is

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:39.980
such malicious douchebaggery that you

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:41.510
just first off on in one way you've got

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:45.140
to admire it you got to be like oh my

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:47.330
god you actually just don't care about

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:49.340
being a good person and in a way I

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:51.290
wouldn't say I'm in Myron's of that in

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:52.850
fact it's quite the opposite I find it

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:56.570
very sad that because you know that

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:58.310
person's the reason for that is they've

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:59.630
been wrong so many times in their life

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:01.430
that they're like well if everybody's

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:03.260
gonna try to screw me I'm just going to

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:06.200
screw everybody and it's a very sad way

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:07.670
to look at the the world I think that a

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.480
lot of people do look at the world like

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:10.790
that

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:14.210
I'm not going to say increasingly lately

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:15.650
but you know it's I see it before like

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:17.090
you know well everybody's trying to

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:20.390
screw everybody so just get ahead

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:22.340
however you can the sad world view in my

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:24.170
opinion if you hold that view you're

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:25.790
contributing to the problem you've

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:27.350
surrendered basically you've surrendered

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:28.640
you're no longer the good guy in the

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:31.070
movie don't you want to be the good guy

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:33.500
in your own movie you've gone from being

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:36.260
you know in an affable Ben Stiller

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:38.590
comedy to being like Michael Douglas and

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:40.669
falling down

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:42.169
you don't want to don't want to do that

00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:43.909
I promise you stay on the light side

00:21:42.169 --> 00:21:46.070
it's better this way don't become kylo

00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:49.130
Ren even though he does have a cool

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:50.330
lightsaber didn't get them all

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:52.610
we're not going to get boss rush and

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:57.380
that's ok it runs good but it's not

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:59.630
quite that good it's close so that guy

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:02.240
if there's a hell I hope he goes there I

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:03.830
can't imagine that he wouldn't you know

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:06.679
maybe he's a really nice guy at home

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:07.850
yeah maybe he's a total dick in traffic

00:22:06.679 --> 00:22:10.970
all day and then he goes home and like

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:12.230
hugs his daughters definitely that's

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:14.960
that strikes me as the kind of thing

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:22.399
that's incredibly plausible no he

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:26.149
definitely like kicks his dog I do like

00:22:22.399 --> 00:22:27.980
the huge growth killed card parasites

00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:31.279
appeared we've got enough head idols

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:32.690
that what happen there I don't know but

00:22:31.279 --> 00:22:34.399
then you know somebody cuts you off in

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:35.990
traffic and then they wave at you in the

00:22:34.399 --> 00:22:38.539
rearview mirror you just got to go you

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:40.460
know what today you tomorrow me that's

00:22:38.539 --> 00:22:42.549
my two of those two of those will do it

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:45.230
that's my perspective at least you know

00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:47.000
just by living your life you're going to

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:48.320
be a jerk from time to time you need to

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.179
get somewhere other people need to get

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.460
somewhere you're going to everyone at

00:22:50.179 --> 00:22:54.830
some point has to say my interest Trump

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:57.590
your interest for now but then if you

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:59.179
apologize afterwards you're you're in

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:02.720
the clear as far as I'm concerned do

00:22:59.179 --> 00:23:05.230
this is a good on lock Maggy plus some

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.230
other things

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:12.789
I would what do I care about more

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.860
options you've seen all the item rooms

00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:19.230
as an old NL mistake we're trying to

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:19.230
separate that no more old NL mistakes I

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:26.919
try to highlight that when I bring up

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:28.929
these bids on the show you know

00:23:26.919 --> 00:23:31.000
everybody is the hero of their own story

00:23:28.929 --> 00:23:32.679
I didn't come up with that quote well

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.659
maybe I did I'll take the credit for it

00:23:32.679 --> 00:23:36.250
either way please God there's six of

00:23:34.659 --> 00:23:38.140
these there's got to be some copy items

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:40.750
there's one I'll settle for two I'll

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:44.380
still settle for two I'll settle for one

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:48.490
it turns out so I think when people are

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:50.590
you know mild jerks you can mine it for

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:52.360
humor a little bit but you can't like

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:55.150
don't genuinely get mad about it

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:56.860
if someone's like a real jerk if it only

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:58.240
affects you in a way that's minor I

00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:00.370
think you just got to laugh like when

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:02.770
that dude cut us off and in traffic and

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:06.549
did the no no no gesture I just laughed

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:09.789
because I was like oh my god this guy

00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:11.049
has never had a blowjob I wasn't

00:24:09.789 --> 00:24:12.970
actually the first thought that came to

00:24:11.049 --> 00:24:15.039
on mine but I was like this something's

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:17.140
wrong with this guy if he's passed on

00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:18.400
his genes I hope your kids hate him wait

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:20.620
let me rephrase that this is very

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:22.270
inelegant if he has kids I hope his kids

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:24.970
hate him because that means his kids are

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:27.070
good people I don't want I don't wish

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:29.169
their kids to suffer by hating their dad

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:31.270
but if their kids love their dad and

00:24:29.169 --> 00:24:32.650
they're of a certain age like above a

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:34.510
certain age they have a certain level of

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:36.760
autonomy you've just introduced more

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:38.530
douchery into the world so I hope your

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.780
kids have grown up enough to hate you

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:43.419
and they've decided not to become like

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:45.220
you in that vein and that vein only you

00:24:43.419 --> 00:24:49.570
succeeded as a parent look I don't know

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:51.220
you maybe he's a good dad probably not

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:52.750
though because I only know one thing

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:56.610
about him and it makes him look like a

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:56.610
terrible person anyway

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:04.440
all I'm saying is that I wish she was

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:06.570
dead I'm not I'm not hoping that he dies

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.070
I just wish that he had never existed in

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:09.720
the first place not because it would

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:11.430
make my life better but because planet

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:14.720
Earth would be better at not having this

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:17.490
into it like if somebody cuts you off

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:18.750
you can and then they wave or even if

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:20.600
they don't wave you could just be like

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:23.040
you know they're having a bad day

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:24.390
somebody yells at you and then they come

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.680
to you and they're like sorry things are

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:27.270
really tough at home right now you go

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:29.220
that's okay it happens to all of us and

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:31.320
it really does you know part of being an

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:33.450
adult is putting your pride aside and

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:35.550
apologizing like yours truly did after

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:37.320
episode 90 player unknowns battlegrounds

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:39.600
it you know everybody's going to have

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:41.550
times where they're going to get mad

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:44.910
react in a way that is not appropriate

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:48.420
and what separates the juvenile from the

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:51.180
mature is having the nuts to apologize

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:54.590
effectively and say that I was wrong and

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:57.330
that was that was an inappropriate

00:25:54.590 --> 00:26:00.680
reaction but if you cut someone off in

00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:03.480
traffic and you do uh-uh that's like

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:04.860
second-degree douchebaggery you've

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.420
dedicated you that's probably like the

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:08.640
thirtieth time you've done that maneuver

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:12.270
you've dedicated yourself to being a

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:14.550
jerk yeah it bothers me if he'd been

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:18.660
like a Lamborghini that would have been

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:21.180
one thing he was in a BMW it's an

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:23.370
expensive car but not expensive enough

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:26.720
to be laid hey buddy let's compare who

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:29.580
has more twitch prime subscriptions okay

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:31.260
like if you're driving the popemobile if

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:32.880
you're driving anything with mobile and

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.570
that includes the Oscar why Oscar Mayer

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:36.150
Wienermobile

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:38.250
then you get to do the that's a high

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:40.230
status vehicle if you're driving a BMW

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:42.180
like seventy-five thousand other people

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:46.950
in this city you don't get to do the uh

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:48.990
not with feeling good about it so anyway

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:51.210
if we have like we ever invent time

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:53.370
travel I think I'm just going to make

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:55.920
sure I'm driving and then run him off

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:57.960
the road and then punch him in the face

00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:00.960
and then get back in the time machine

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:02.310
and then go back and run the events

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:05.250
through the way they actually happen in

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:06.810
real life so that in my mind I get the

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:09.660
satisfaction from punching him in the

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:12.090
face but I face no consequences for the

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:16.950
actions and mostly just get to have

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:19.050
enjoyed a guilt-free little jerk bash

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:21.870
session which is not an expression that

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:23.340
makes any sense but I digress it stuck

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:26.190
with me because it's just that it's a

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:30.930
level of heightened nonsense that I

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:31.920
cannot get so cynical plus I don't know

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:33.960
what that dudes going to do when we get

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.820
self-driving cars that's the guy I think

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:38.040
of when I see that Lexus ad on TV and

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:40.290
it's like enjoy the thrill of driving

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:42.750
while you still can I think of that and

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:44.820
I think of you know your cars skidding

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:48.090
on black ice crashing into the meeting

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:50.670
and then rolling over 180 degrees in the

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:53.570
in the desolate winter you know

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:55.800
wonderland of the sea to sky highway

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:56.310
enjoy the thrill of driving while you

00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:00.960
still can

00:27:56.310 --> 00:28:02.760
oh my god anyway I'm pretty excited for

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:07.590
self-driving cars we've touched on this

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:10.410
many time in the past though I'm not

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:12.000
anti driving the thrill of the open road

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:14.070
when there's no other cars around you

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.130
you can really let it rip red Barchetta

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:21.080
style there is something you know

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:21.080
intoxicating about it's an aphrodisiac

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:27.700
don't even try a buddy you know many

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:33.850
times I thought you blow you cannot best

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:35.830
me I know you inside and out mom's

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:37.720
contact we have the mom transformation

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:41.680
we did get the mom transformation we got

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:43.480
like five on locks per run I'm just not

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:46.270
sure the juice is worth the squeeze you

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:49.690
know when it comes to driving that is

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:51.280
it's like pooping sometimes a poop can

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:55.870
be enjoyable it's getting to be a little

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:58.600
bit of a gross episode Oh sometimes the

00:28:55.870 --> 00:29:00.100
poop can be enjoyable but bear ask the

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:03.430
question on the LSS you said if you

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:06.100
could get a procedure done that made it

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:09.070
so you never had to poop and your body

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:11.080
just ran at 100% efficiency would you do

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:13.830
it and I thought about it because I you

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:16.870
know I like to give these questions the

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:19.300
level of detail and attention that they

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:21.640
deserve and I said yes here's my

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:23.470
reasoning in greater detail do I

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.490
sometimes enjoy a bowel movement yeah

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:26.800
yeah I do

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:28.840
you're not ashamed to admit I think when

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:30.420
you get a particularly nice one not only

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:32.620
does it feel good on a physical level

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:34.660
like you're getting a sense of relief

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:37.000
but then beyond that you feel good on

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:39.910
like a higher plane you're like I must

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.890
have eaten well my body is responding to

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:43.630
what I've eaten and as a result I've

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:47.250
made good decisions so you're like thank

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:47.250
you pass to me for eating enough fiber

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:54.150
it's a very fulfilling thing however do

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:57.880
I enjoy pooping more than not pooping

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:59.170
because I enjoy doing I don't work at an

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.730
office job anymore when I worked in an

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:02.620
office job as the eviews decision in my

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:06.520
life of course I would not saw what my

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:09.190
butthole because that I'd take advantage

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:10.570
of the 10 to 15-minute defecation breaks

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:11.740
you can take once per day at work

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:13.930
without your boss starting to ask

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:18.820
questions that's when I beat Mega Man 2

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:21.180
on my old lg chocolate phone drunk would

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:21.180
phone

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:28.830
don't you dare leave it at home

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:32.190
chocolate phone your poop freaks will be

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:33.570
very boring out chocolate anyway wasn't

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:36.570
a phone made out of chocolate we just

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:39.360
called an lg chocolate well I had that

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:40.950
phone in third grade yeah okay well you

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:45.210
know a phone I had in third grade a

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:47.580
frickin landline you know what we called

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:49.290
caller ID back then recognizing the

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:50.700
voice of the person on the phone before

00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:53.250
they told you who it was

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:55.950
here's how a phone conversation went in

00:30:53.250 --> 00:31:01.080
like you know the year 2001 most of the

00:30:55.950 --> 00:31:04.170
time hello oh hey Ryan um who's this and

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:06.390
then they say oh I'm blah no way was

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:08.190
there like a lot of guy cell phones got

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:12.120
popular caller ID got popular before I

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:14.310
ever had to worry about this but they're

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:15.330
like a lot of phone fraud back then it

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:18.000
really seems like if you could just

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:19.920
sound like somebody else you could

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.870
convince other people to you know tell

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.870
you information that was private to them

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:31.080
maybe maybe not I don't know that's why

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:33.990
I'm asking the question you guys ever

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:36.840
have the situation where you don't even

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:38.340
know your own phone number anymore it's

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:39.630
happened it doesn't happen to me every

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:42.570
time but it has happened to me a couple

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:43.980
of times I'll be like you know signing

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:45.900
up for something and they'll be like

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:47.790
okay what's your email address and I

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:49.440
give them my dummy email address that

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:51.330
I'm never going to respond to and then

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:54.630
they go what's your phone number and I

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:57.180
go uh alright this is what it is like

00:31:54.630 --> 00:32:01.260
it's it's stored in like a section in my

00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:03.180
brain that's not in the RAM it's on the

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.560
hard disk it's like my brain has to spin

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:06.000
up and be like oh they just asked you

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:10.500
for a phone number okay here you go

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:13.200
I know three phone numbers now I used to

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:16.470
know when I was 12 I do 20 phone numbers

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:18.300
you know you need to you could always

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:21.190
bust out the phone book but you know you

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:24.880
needed your phone number

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:26.530
your best friends as phone numbers maybe

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.420
a pizza place phone number I don't know

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:29.740
you're getting left home alone with $20

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:32.470
bill you got a call a pizza place and

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:34.900
make an order sometimes and maybe like

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:36.400
your mother and father's place of work

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:38.230
right those those are the phone numbers

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:41.430
you have remembered now I know my phone

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:45.220
number my wife's phone number and 911

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:48.820
phone numbers I recall this could be our

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:54.490
last floor by the way so try to succeed

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:58.150
here and if they ever actually to the

00:32:54.490 --> 00:33:02.260
point where like if it's and this is me

00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:03.070
not joking if I don't want to ever speak

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:05.950
to somebody

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:08.050
I give them my phone number if I know

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:10.420
that it's important that I responded

00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:12.160
we're going to make it just barely if I

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:13.600
know that it's important that I respond

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.250
to give them my wife's phone number

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.570
not because I'm passing them off but

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:18.610
because she actually answers her phone

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:22.150
and I do not because I don't want to

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:25.150
talk to people until I want to talk to

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:27.010
them it's a bad look for me at the end

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:29.290
of this episode but if I call somebody

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:32.890
that means I want to talk if you call me

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:33.910
I'm not in any way maybe next episode

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:34.720
we'll talk more about that for now

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:36.070
