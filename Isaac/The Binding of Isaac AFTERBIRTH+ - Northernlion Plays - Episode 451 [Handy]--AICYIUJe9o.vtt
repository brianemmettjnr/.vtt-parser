00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.570
everybody welcome back to northern land

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.649
plays The Binding of Isaac and Ruth plus

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:11.250
I am an idiot moron man and I didn't get

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.519
the rerun achievement last time but I

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.880
did get the negative at least on that

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.109
like Aidan three million years our long

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.359
run I don't know what I'm talking about

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.880
I'm gonna try a greedy or Azazel you

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.480
know why I always I shy away from

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.949
playing as Azazel and it's stupid

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.579
we gotta play as him at some point nine

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:36.570
et/pt f2a the force two awakens that's

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.870
the sequel to The Force awakens coming

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:44.129
out this December from yay yay Abrams

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.960
not JJ Abrams yay yay Abrams how you

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.309
doin yay I'm surviving

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.320
I was directed earlier now I'm driving

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:56.399
we're gonna grab black candle and dude

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.750
okay well actually we might already have

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.910
the keys to the kingdom I know you're

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.949
saying it's a little too early to say

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.710
that you've got the keys I'll just say

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.490
we got the garage door opener for the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.840
garage that is adjacent to the kingdom

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.270
we push the button we can get into the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.280
garage because blank card essentially

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.439
with like almost anything to back it up

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.150
is is extremely extremely good not black

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.369
handle sorry that's a black him blank

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.860
card I might have said blank card either

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.619
way we want to get 12 cents on this

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.150
floor this is a floor where we buy we're

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.619
like Matthew McConaughey in the wolf of

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.479
Wall Street look it's been like six

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.550
years on that 60s but like four years

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.880
since I seen the wolf of Wall Street

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.979
[Music]

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.780
but I assume you know he's like some

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.930
kind of stockbroker or something he's

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:51.530
buying all the time buying and selling

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:56.869
import-export we need 12 cents because 5

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.789
videos 5 of it goes towards the key 7 of

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.009
it goes towards getting blank card and

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.960
honestly getting like 9 ball wouldn't be

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.780
too bad here either but let's start with

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:11.450
this night light is actually ok I think

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:14.480
as Azazel that might give us like a

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.330
little range upgrade I don't think it

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.440
does

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.630
wishful thinking but we'll still take

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.610
you because you know it adds a little

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.610
that's a little certain ribbing for our

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.209
pleasure at this point a certain you

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.940
know c'est quoi a certain knives you've

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:35.989
a dragon kosong civil play we should lay

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:40.489
off Sal de bomb where's Leila Salle de

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:44.500
Bain it would squirt a great deal this

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:49.010
is going nowhere ok it's terrible damage

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:53.030
we're gonna get enough money to get 9

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.130
volt if we want it do we want it I think

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.590
you have to say that it's probably for

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:01.400
the best you know it basically gives us

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:06.079
a 25% faster charge rate dude I swear to

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:08.000
God every single floor we start with a

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:11.239
deal with the devil that doesn't have

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.069
any dang deals in it d20 also lovely but

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.260
I mean we got the Azazel keys right now

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.420
or we're adjacent to the garage door in

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.370
fact we actually like you know if this

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.290
was the escapists 2 we knocked a guard

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.269
out we copied his keycard

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.620
we haven't actually put our plan into

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.190
action but we've got the infrastructure

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.900
to do so in the future quickly peep this

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.019
tears up great very good what else do we

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.430
need I mean a tears upgrade that

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.709
basically cuts 1/3 off of our rate of

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.810
fire is lovely no thank you

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:44.420
I can see forever is also pretty good

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:47.270
the real draw I think let's see if it's

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.760
a demon judgment it is

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.440
the real draw I think though is a range

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.200
upgrade if we can swing it I'll buy it

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.680
to send hard just to give myself a

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.600
little extra pull here

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.930
god I'm drowsy which is actually a very

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.640
very good pill if you know that you got

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.880
it if you don't know that you got it

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.890
it's not so good so we definitely need I

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.290
mean we'd like to buy a card on top of a

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.580
card obviously we need a key to get into

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.440
our item room and then on top of that

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.110
some more red hearts to maybe play this

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.800
demon judgement wouldn't be the worst

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:24.600
thing but keep in mind like right now

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.490
the Azazel loop is like the same in

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.220
every mode you start out looking really

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.530
strong and usually you end up being

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.780
really strong but it's totally possible

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.530
to get screwed by the fact that your

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.000
range is garbage and ultra greed is

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.150
genuinely one of the hardest bosses in

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.640
the game you know probably not quite as

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.410
difficult as the lyrium but we don't

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.790
want to be in his face most of the time

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:52.710
we're gonna want to be like as far away

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:55.830
as we can conceivably be we've been a

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.860
great magic mush but that's fine we want

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.780
to be as far away as we can get while

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.540
still being able to hit so unless we get

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.550
a brimstone we're gonna be looking for

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.050
no I mean I'm trying to think of what

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.870
would actually work for us here in the

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.310
in the blank card Department and I don't

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.470
think there is anything if we got like

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.690
placebo range upgrade pill we can make

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.580
that was bad we can make that happen but

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.170
I mean that's not blank card if we can't

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.870
make it happen with like a little baggie

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.090
or anything so um there is a range plus

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.000
luck upgrade in there but to be honest I

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.340
kind of like basically because these are

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.630
two cents it's like a cent per play on

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.950
the demon judgement we could also give

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:38.520
up a spear on heart to make it happen

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:40.560
which isn't the worst idea yeah

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.600
missing page two in the end I'm gonna

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.220
say that a key is a little bit more

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.910
important than being able to get mom's

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:50.370
pearls but that might be short-sighted

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:54.240
we got compound fracture which was a

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:56.130
range upgrade but apart from that a

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.870
little bit of a not quite as good on

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.190
Azazel as it is on other characters

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.270
shall we say

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.620
but that's the thing you know you got it

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.050
you got to buy a ticket to the lottery

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:08.710
to have a chance to win I hate that

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:11.460
that's the metaphor for like for taking

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.330
risk you got to do something that

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.740
statistically is gonna lose you money

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.810
over the course of your lifetime if you

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.720
want to get ahead that's not really the

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.820
case I suppose but you know the metaphor

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.620
fits except it's more like you know you

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:29.140
got to apply for the job if you want to

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:30.940
get it then metaphor is way less

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:34.510
exciting is if you get a job now you got

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:37.240
a job if you wouldn't a lottery you get

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:38.830
like you know 180 million dollars or

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.130
something did you guys see that story

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:45.460
there was a man in in Maine you know in

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:49.090
the United States of America he won the

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:52.300
lottery the lottery was twenty five

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:57.210
thousand dollars a year for the rest of

00:06:52.300 --> 00:07:01.900
his life but my dude is 93 years old

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:04.810
I'm not look he's paid his taxes

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.400
presumably he's uh he's got as much of a

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.860
right to do with his money whatever he

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.690
wants but does he work for the lottery

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.420
corporation cuz like it just seems a

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:17.050
little suspicious to me that a 93 year

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:19.870
old man is entering blank Rd era is

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:24.130
obviously extremely good that a 93 year

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:26.440
old man is entering contests to you know

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:29.200
win blank a year for the rest of his

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:31.480
life like I'm not again this is not a

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:34.630
the right time to use a ierra

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:36.280
we'll save it for the next floor I'm not

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:39.640
suggesting you shouldn't be able to but

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:43.750
am I wrong to suggest that he shouldn't

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:45.220
have look I don't know it's tough

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.270
because every at the range upgrade here

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.070
is nice it's tough

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:54.690
wait the range up here is not nice plus

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:59.790
0.25 why even bother um oh okay okay key

00:07:54.690 --> 00:08:02.790
check this what's the card justice Oh

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.790
baby

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:08.550
what's the big deal well let's hit this

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.650
we should hit this first now that we

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:12.270
have the bomb we could blank card Yara

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.750
in a different situation actually and

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:17.669
also probably stand to gain some money

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:21.510
but there's a nickel in here and

00:08:17.669 --> 00:08:22.380
infinity keys so what we'll try to make

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.940
this work I should have gone to the

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.919
arcade or isn't that the arcade for the

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:28.650
item room it's it's a tough thing for me

00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:30.630
to tease out how I want to say how I

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:34.320
feel about the issue I'm not even saying

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:35.669
he's selfish for playing cuz reasonably

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.020
he probably didn't expect to win he

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:38.310
might have just bought a lottery ticket

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.529
and been like you know you know this

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:44.339
will entertain me for like ten minutes

00:08:40.529 --> 00:08:45.390
or something like that but it's like you

00:08:44.339 --> 00:08:48.210
should have the rights to like

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:52.550
transferred the winnings or something to

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:58.470
his estate because it just seems unfair

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:59.880
a great boon for the lottery corporate

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.440
or maybe not you know maybe he'll live

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.680
to be a hundred and thirty in which case

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.300
you know I look extremely callous in the

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:11.520
present situation I'm also not saying

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:12.779
that even if he lives for oh we should

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.350
have doubled that probably about twenty

00:09:12.779 --> 00:09:15.810
years ago

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:17.670
um I'm not saying that even if he only

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:19.080
lives for one year that it that he

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:21.360
shouldn't have the right to collect on

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.850
the 25 grand that he's earned but just

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:27.450
saying like the the lottery company like

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:29.550
bases its margins on what their expected

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:33.870
payout is they're probably expected not

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:35.520
a 93 year old to win that you know

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:38.640
twenty five thousand dollars a year for

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:42.110
the rest of your life payout it's just

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.110
it's a funny situation

00:09:44.749 --> 00:09:48.199
you might even say it's Alanis

00:09:47.009 --> 00:09:55.769
Morrisette esque

00:09:48.199 --> 00:10:00.569
isn't it ironic an old man 1098 one the

00:09:55.769 --> 00:10:02.369
latter we $25,000 a year for the rest of

00:10:00.569 --> 00:10:06.979
his ok that's more like custom-fitted

00:10:02.369 --> 00:10:14.249
but dude I'm so mad cuz bighorn is like

00:10:06.979 --> 00:10:16.079
he's dead but I can't get to him without

00:10:14.249 --> 00:10:18.569
touching the coins we lost a lot of HP

00:10:16.079 --> 00:10:21.839
here but actually losing HP is mostly

00:10:18.569 --> 00:10:23.069
irrelevant considering we're probably

00:10:21.839 --> 00:10:25.259
gonna have pretty close to infinite

00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:29.879
money what we need actually is a battery

00:10:25.259 --> 00:10:31.799
charge like okay hear me out here cuz if

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:36.509
you get a battery charge things change a

00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:37.589
lot here battery baby is really good

00:10:36.509 --> 00:10:38.879
with the battery charges wherever you

00:10:37.589 --> 00:10:40.729
want to because now we can double here

00:10:38.879 --> 00:10:44.759
endlessly and that gives us endless

00:10:40.729 --> 00:10:48.809
everything like we have double NV

00:10:44.759 --> 00:10:52.889
unfortunately it might actually no it's

00:10:48.809 --> 00:10:57.359
gotta be double NV one super NV one

00:10:52.889 --> 00:10:59.429
regular NV this borderline gives us the

00:10:57.359 --> 00:11:04.589
win I think I mean blank card it's just

00:10:59.429 --> 00:11:06.359
like it's kind of almost cheating in in

00:11:04.589 --> 00:11:09.899
green mode it's within the rules of the

00:11:06.359 --> 00:11:11.549
game but it's also like really really

00:11:09.899 --> 00:11:15.899
easy we're also one item away from

00:11:11.549 --> 00:11:21.479
becoming guppy so I think we start we

00:11:15.899 --> 00:11:25.529
era the era there's a justice card as

00:11:21.479 --> 00:11:27.869
well Vieira and then we era and what do

00:11:25.529 --> 00:11:30.569
you do after that well you want to avoid

00:11:27.869 --> 00:11:33.539
like cluttering up the screen too much

00:11:30.569 --> 00:11:36.470
so we're gonna buy battery bay because

00:11:33.539 --> 00:11:36.470
it's excellent

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:45.670
I'll think about that we might this I

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.779
don't want to keep EE necessarily the

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:48.040
thing is you might be saying well why

00:11:46.779 --> 00:11:49.360
are you picking stuff up you could just

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.970
double it later yeah but we can also

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.410
double one thing infinity time so we

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.540
have infinity no matter which way you

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:59.230
slice it let's go with latchkey for a

00:11:55.540 --> 00:12:03.569
little extra Janice a qua will take a

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:07.540
couple of range upgrades here and then

00:12:03.569 --> 00:12:17.190
let's go I mean with too many justice

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:20.050
cards to be honest did that yera and

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:25.620
maneuver to the battery charge there you

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:28.149
go wrong like it's gonna become tough to

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:30.220
do anything in there we could have just

00:12:28.149 --> 00:12:32.079
gotten our money out here I guess but we

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:37.750
can also get infinite money anywhere we

00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:42.660
want I don't really want to do this for

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:45.160
one cent at a time be here for 20 years

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:47.980
why are you paying for a battery charge

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:51.790
in today's modern world dude you know

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:53.459
what I think we should get like 99 cents

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:56.050
and then head down to the next floor

00:12:53.459 --> 00:12:57.730
like just take all of your money make

00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:00.279
sure you leave with the era rune and

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:03.660
then just go to the next floor because

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:03.660
we've crowded this up too much

00:13:07.899 --> 00:13:14.480
yeah yeah yeah I think this is fine

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:16.550
there should be no shortage of good

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:22.240
items now our range actually looks good

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:22.240
now we still have blank card Yarra

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:29.839
ranges 29 it was 18 I think at the start

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:31.700
of this floor so relatively well it's

00:13:29.839 --> 00:13:34.279
not that big but it's decent

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:36.560
Pyro's good HP we can always use cuz we

00:13:34.279 --> 00:13:38.060
did take deals with the devil here we

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.130
might as well peep this room real quick

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:42.680
we got a blank card High Priestess which

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:44.029
is ear relevant I would say and a reroll

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.380
machine which is awesome okay so again

00:13:44.029 --> 00:13:49.390
we got a battery charge right off the

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:57.529
bat what do you do if that's a nickel

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:58.850
well we got two cents just looking at

00:13:57.529 --> 00:14:01.430
this I'm like we get a key in a red

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:04.010
heart but every time we do this we're

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:05.510
also losing a cent to get a key in a row

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.830
or not forever though because we're

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.270
creating more money on the ground that's

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:09.470
right okay so we're just gonna create

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:11.029
like a bunch of money we're lucky

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:13.040
there's not nearly as many consumables

00:14:11.029 --> 00:14:17.779
here this time so yeah we'll just double

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:21.190
to like this point and then start buying

00:14:17.779 --> 00:14:25.420
so we'll get PJs another range upgrade

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:29.600
another range upgrade Cuba Meade is fine

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:37.209
Halos good one up not necessary yet

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:37.209
we'll go spider mod start doubling again

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:42.749
[Music]

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.749
now we've done it

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:50.370
such a satisfying sound though okay

00:14:46.519 --> 00:14:52.110
we'll go one up now I can't even see the

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:56.760
other I'd look a lump of coal

00:14:52.110 --> 00:15:00.440
take some HP take a tears upgrade nah we

00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.440
don't need that where's our other

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:06.120
where's our other right there it is no

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:07.410
way that's I thought we had another item

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.449
in here I don't know where it went

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:13.050
let's go for the reroll so we had luck

00:15:09.449 --> 00:15:16.649
foot that's okay I'll go for Agard

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:18.810
BFF absolutely x-ray goggles absolutely

00:15:16.649 --> 00:15:21.120
d4 not necessary yet we'll go

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:28.649
experimental treatment take another

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:31.250
range upgrade it's about to get real

00:15:28.649 --> 00:15:31.250
crowded in here

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:38.399
[Music]

00:15:35.029 --> 00:15:39.930
take a speed upgrade take another HP

00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:41.279
upgrade we can use the red hearts take

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:48.750
the damage upgrade okay I think we're

00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:51.470
ready now to fight on this floor you

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:53.880
might as well double right off the bed

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:56.880
cuz that first you know knocking out an

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:58.470
early doubling can mean a lot eventually

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:01.110
as long as we don't accidentally pick up

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:04.290
anything and then like here it's much

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:08.010
easier for us to not pick up all the

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:09.540
coins accidentally you know so why are

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:13.980
we getting a battery charge every time I

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:16.649
press the spacebar I don't know if we

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:18.029
we've done something amazing every time

00:16:16.649 --> 00:16:23.220
I press the spacebar I get another

00:16:18.029 --> 00:16:25.470
battery charge back every whatever I've

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:28.470
done to deserve this I it was not enough

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:31.199
because this is unlimited rolls of

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:34.260
unlimited money which is a new level of

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:36.209
ridiculousness and again we can actually

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.560
pick up all this if we want because

00:16:36.209 --> 00:16:40.329
we're getting so many more charges it

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:42.500
actually does not matter

00:16:40.329 --> 00:16:46.870
hard to get out of the mindset that this

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:46.870
is like wasting money but

00:16:49.699 --> 00:16:54.439
a little harder to care when you realize

00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:55.639
that it's well and truly infinite

00:16:54.439 --> 00:17:00.230
especially because we got battery

00:16:55.639 --> 00:17:01.699
charges in here I can't even see what's

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:05.449
going on in here so sure give me a tears

00:17:01.699 --> 00:17:08.510
upgrade we're at the tears cap give me a

00:17:05.449 --> 00:17:11.659
reroll oh dude

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:13.010
another damage upgrade and spun another

00:17:11.659 --> 00:17:16.639
tears upgrade that won't work for us

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:20.740
another syringe boxes stuff another

00:17:16.639 --> 00:17:20.740
syringe which is also a range upgrade I

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:25.689
mean I don't really care about the left

00:17:23.179 --> 00:17:25.689
hand right now

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:41.269
[Music]

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:44.360
mom's key means okay we instantly got

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:46.639
fully charged again we'll go mom's key I

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:50.269
mean kind of feel like we might as well

00:17:46.639 --> 00:17:52.639
stack red hearts to some extent like

00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:55.600
anything that gives us stats is more or

00:17:52.639 --> 00:17:55.600
less worth taking I think

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:05.400
[Music]

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:10.770
we need like a quarter of the screen to

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:14.310
get the max HP got the fungi

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:16.620
transformation and we're actually just

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:19.100
buying HP to avoid using a single bomb

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:21.660
to re-roll right now which is not smart

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:24.180
but on top of not being smart you know

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:28.100
what it is extremely not relevant

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:30.810
because this is actually like the most

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:34.440
money I think I've ever had the

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:36.570
capability of having on a run I'm kind

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:42.480
of stunned I'm also just waiting for

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:48.600
Kaos to eventually show up I use the

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:50.900
blank card health up there we go so this

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:53.010
will be a win it's just a matter of

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.270
whether or not I have the patience to

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:58.710
actually take the run to like its

00:18:54.270 --> 00:19:01.400
logical conclusion here I mean straw is

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:01.400
fine actually

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:06.450
obviously like not quite as good as a

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:12.180
lot of the other stuff we got going on

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:13.710
on this run we might as well there's

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.730
probably like transformations that we

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:16.740
could create that we've never seen

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:19.800
before we are not not seen in this save

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:21.660
file I should say so bum friend is

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:24.060
actually a terrible pick up he's gonna

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:26.190
pick up all of the the myriad coins we

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:29.990
got but we might be able to double too

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.990
fast for him to actually grab them all

00:19:31.389 --> 00:19:40.179
a lot of these do like literally nothing

00:19:37.149 --> 00:19:44.079
for us rubber cement might bounce I

00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:50.159
can't remember is that another D it is D

00:19:44.079 --> 00:19:55.119
for I don't want the broken remote ha

00:19:50.159 --> 00:19:56.979
good I can't see what's going okay I

00:19:55.119 --> 00:19:58.719
think we almost like we still have year

00:19:56.979 --> 00:20:04.179
we still appear like we almost have to

00:19:58.719 --> 00:20:05.849
get out of here like I just can't see

00:20:04.179 --> 00:20:08.529
what's going on in that room anymore a

00:20:05.849 --> 00:20:10.329
rubber cement does bounce off the wall

00:20:08.529 --> 00:20:18.669
so we're pretty close here dude this is

00:20:10.329 --> 00:20:21.039
like ideal Tammy's head I don't even

00:20:18.669 --> 00:20:22.389
look at bum friend when it goes over one

00:20:21.039 --> 00:20:27.129
of the coins that has like eight coins

00:20:22.389 --> 00:20:28.730
on it goes like good and how can you do

00:20:27.129 --> 00:20:31.890
that sound for me one with that good

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:31.890
[Music]

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:36.820
like he's thought this is the fattest

00:20:34.749 --> 00:20:37.480
bum friend we'll ever see in our entire

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:42.179
lives

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:42.179
he's gonna pick up like a thousand cents

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:50.180
my dude is still going I mean at this

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.740
point we might as well take it like

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:56.090
literally every day I don't know why

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:57.650
even rush for that I don't think we need

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:59.000
illuminated bulb it's not like the other

00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:08.000
ones are doing anything for us always

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:10.940
paying out get out of the way we could

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.560
we could be there all day he's still

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:18.230
paying I actually think this guy might

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:21.100
pay out for eternity like my dude is

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:23.390
still going Oh another damage upgrade

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:25.310
getting up there damage is still like a

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:27.710
weak spot but not by to much

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:29.690
we have no battery charge here this is

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:32.960
where oh my god he's gonna drop all this

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:34.340
stuff on the ground and it's gonna annoy

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.440
the crap out of me because every time I

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:37.910
double is just gonna crowd things up so

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:41.630
I mean we might as well almost just

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:44.800
stand still wait for him to pay out with

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:48.250
everything he's gonna pay out with cuz

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:52.790
we're approaching like absurdity here

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:54.740
and by approaching I mean like we

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:58.640
crossed the absurd threshold quite a

00:21:54.740 --> 00:22:00.940
long time ago is he still going yeah yes

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.940
he is

00:22:07.259 --> 00:22:11.879
well I mean most of these items kind of

00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:14.080
stink let's be honest

00:22:11.879 --> 00:22:19.899
think fast bombs ooh

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:26.169
leprosy number one minor range downgrade

00:22:19.899 --> 00:22:29.820
in our current context thankfully we're

00:22:26.169 --> 00:22:29.820
mostly just buying at this point because

00:22:30.119 --> 00:22:37.389
there's not a great reason not to we

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:38.710
have I mean we literally do not have to

00:22:37.389 --> 00:22:41.440
donate anything we've already gotten our

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:42.639
donation machine to its peak so a bum

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.980
friend is picking up all the money so

00:22:42.639 --> 00:22:47.350
there's not actually too much point in

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:51.309
going for the rerolls here unless you

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:54.490
can do them fast enough to kind of

00:22:51.309 --> 00:22:55.990
create enough money to I don't know

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:57.460
think that things are gonna get real

00:22:55.990 --> 00:23:01.299
confusing in this room if we keep doing

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:02.980
that not like we're in a terrible spot

00:23:01.299 --> 00:23:06.429
here we're actually like in an

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:11.230
incredible spot I kind of I'm in over my

00:23:06.429 --> 00:23:13.149
head though in the sense that I have no

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:16.450
idea what's happening at any given

00:23:13.149 --> 00:23:19.350
moment because of the fact that it's

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:19.350
it's just so busy

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:31.000
I'll be done we're done let's just

00:23:27.929 --> 00:23:32.740
finish it up here like I don't even mean

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:38.920
finish the run I just mean finish this

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:40.179
floor like I would love if you just gave

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:42.280
me a deal with the devil that turned me

00:23:40.179 --> 00:23:46.120
into guppy cuz honestly like I'm like

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:48.490
Howard Hughes in his movie room right

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.910
now in his home theater I'm trapped in

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:51.250
there

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:54.490
I got no idea what's going on there we

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:57.809
go there's the guppy dream we might as

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:57.809
well take little Horn

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:04.390
you got some I can't even tell cuz we

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:09.309
got so many familiars like I've

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:11.590
surrounded myself with with things I

00:24:09.309 --> 00:24:14.350
can't see anymore even like bum friend

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:15.490
is just living off of the passive income

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:17.020
here I don't think there's anything

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:21.490
wrong with that but at the same time

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:23.890
like please let me out we got to finish

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:26.440
this one up it's been a fun run like I

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:28.299
mean we were the picture of Isaac's

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:30.250
success right now yet at the same time

00:24:28.299 --> 00:24:32.890
it's almost like be careful what you

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:34.480
wish for which is why I'm gonna take it

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:36.490
a little simpler on this floor I'd still

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:38.320
like to get some improvements like I'd

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:40.600
like to be in max level HP whether

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.480
that's some combination of red hearts

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:51.010
and spirit arts red hearts only etc etc

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:52.960
I wouldn't mind replacing the card in

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:55.330
blank card with something else right now

00:24:52.960 --> 00:25:00.820
like we don't necessarily need yera

00:24:55.330 --> 00:25:04.740
anymore there's really just one floor of

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:04.740
madness created this situation

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:15.260
see oh they're all completely alive

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:23.160
okay

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:26.700
this is why I both love and hate

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:28.410
greedier it will greed in general it was

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:31.350
like it's a really fun run

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:33.450
but the Zane is almost removed by the

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:36.420
amount of Zane you can get it's too much

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:40.920
Zane luck stat is 4 so I think GIMP is a

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:44.700
fine pick up and in here

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:49.650
ok blow this up first blow this up we

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:51.030
got consumables out the resume here it's

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:51.810
a common expression people say it all

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:57.570
the time

00:25:51.810 --> 00:26:00.300
I think first just lowers our shot speed

00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:04.320
huh first see what you get out of

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:10.860
starter deck we get a good card I'm yeah

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:12.210
that'll do so how do we do this I mean

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:15.770
with only one battery we could have done

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:20.640
this better but I think we'll buy

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:23.690
telekinesis it's a fun item I think

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:27.300
we'll buy this I think we'll buy this

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:28.440
well double up oh I didn't use blank

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.880
card to double up that's fine we should

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.650
have a full charge on blank card anyway

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:34.260
yeah we use that to double up remember

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:36.660
we don't donate anything so the next

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:39.960
step is just since there's no battery

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:41.370
charges we're gonna use non stacks dad's

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.050
key doesn't do anything for us these are

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:47.610
we're just getting like all the actives

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:50.100
out lusty blood is lovely we might as

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:52.920
well just buy this double with two of

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:54.260
diamonds pick up Papa fly I'm just

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:57.060
trying to get the maximum amount of

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:59.760
resources chocolate milk I think is a

00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:02.580
big damage boost right there big fire

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:08.340
rate upgrade Capricorn not really much

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:10.260
in the damaged apartment I don't think

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:12.000
static tears does anything for us so I

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:15.420
think we're okay we'll just take

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.690
telekinesis with us get the heck out of

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:21.360
town

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:24.030
we still have a year Arun the purpose of

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:26.820
the year Arun at this point is to use a

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:29.460
little Chad wood that it will that even

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:32.940
work might not I was gonna say to use a

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:35.160
little Chad to generate twice as many

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.480
red hearts for us but maybe it'll be

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:39.060
relevant maybe you won't that'll

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:40.170
probably be irrelevant though yeah we

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:43.290
don't need a flatworm at all so just

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:45.420
rock like this and telekinesis is

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:47.160
actually just good so the idea is

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:48.960
whenever he shoots at us especially

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:51.570
explosive shots we can push him away

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:55.460
with telekinesis as long as you remember

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:55.460
to actually press the button

00:27:59.779 --> 00:28:04.700
does not work on keys just tried it

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:16.980
it's like extremely good damage output

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:18.810
mind you because of the ultra armor the

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.760
dude is going to be relatively safe

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:22.650
regardless but you know that's that's a

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:29.430
bone to pick for another day I don't

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:31.140
want to go out on a rant here okay I had

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:32.550
a good Dennis Miller impression lined up

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:38.190
but the the hard part is just thinking

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:39.240
of the words I don't want to go off on a

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:41.040
rant here but is anyone thinking

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:43.800
Machiavellian philosophy is like

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:46.010
throwing relish only on a hot dog I mean

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:48.870
come on there's so many better options

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:52.400
sure might get you calories but why

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:52.400
don't you go for something to taste good

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:59.490
Dennis Miller of course most famous for

00:28:55.890 --> 00:29:01.820
his role as radio DJ in Joe Dirt I

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:01.820
thought

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:16.260
you cannot hurt me unless you move very

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:16.260
very slightly up

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:27.580
shooting me sure to me see what happens

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:27.910
I'm ready I'm ready for telekinesis look

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:30.309
at that

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:31.630
you've been deflected sir and then I

00:29:30.309 --> 00:29:34.350
stood right under the next shot but

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:34.350
we're gonna ignore that part

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:49.920
finally and by finally I mean 28 minutes

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:51.900
into this run we're gonna be done and

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:54.299
these any reason to donate any more

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:58.590
we just got batwing which I basically

00:29:54.299 --> 00:29:59.510
never use take two cents we'll be on our

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:02.760
merry way
