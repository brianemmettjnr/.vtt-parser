00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.980
hey everybody welcome back to nor the

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.890
lion plays The Binding of Isaac after

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.070
birth plus a cosmic prison of my own

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.620
creation but hey at least it's fun we

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.590
got negative runs as many you know why

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.590
we got it like concealed is it don't

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.359
want to choose as asel because it's like

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.510
choosing easy mode but it's gotta be

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.340
done three eg1 wdv zero

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.359
you know what we could do we don't do

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.030
hush we need we don't have to do boss

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.660
rush with you mega satan and the entire

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.480
negative path and then delirium it's a

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.860
little premature to suggest that like we

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.230
have a hundred percent chance of making

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.379
any of all any of that happen much less

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.940
all of it but you know it's a it's a

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.350
flip and start dude that's a great time

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:56.460
for explosive diarrhea cuz there was a

00:00:51.350 --> 00:01:00.620
tinted rock there panic power at least

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.699
it's a an enabler for us to get spun

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.019
enabling is normally you know people

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.780
consider it a bad things it's always

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.670
used in context in like a amis

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.799
intervention so as i all you know and

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.450
enabled my addiction but sometimes you

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.820
could be enabled good things like for

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.470
example the existence of the interstate

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.420
allows me I shouldn't say allowed I

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.930
should have say enabled the existence of

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.259
the interstate enables me to drive

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.600
interstates

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.340
I can drive from solid to liquid I could

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.640
drive from liquid the gaseous I can even

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.200
go gaseous to plasma it's actually the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.900
worst joke I've ever told please give me

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.290
a key so I have something to talk about

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:43.170
via this golden chest if you do not mind

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:45.000
hello I would love some pizza whatever

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.579
you would like to get on the pizza is

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.340
fine by me

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:53.100
thank you that's some best question I've

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.630
ever been asked in my whole life

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.180
rarely will I say no to a request of

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:02.530
that nature

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.060
now Ragman went down easy and we're very

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.640
very close to spot and plus we got a

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.260
range upgrade which is high value right

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.620
now I don't know what I was gonna say

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:14.760
instead of value that's high oh wow

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:20.230
she's a bitch good don't chat ahead it

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:22.060
pits on the soles of the shoes you don't

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.390
get that reference listen to Paul

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.980
Simon's Graceland right now I know kids

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.980
these days you'll NL what about Death

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.240
Grips nah dude I'll listen to Death

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.270
Grips when I get sick of listening to

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.390
Paul Simon's 1986 album Graceland

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.800
recorded with Ladysmith Black Mambazo

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:45.120
aka never gonna happen cuz it's a

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:48.970
perfect album Oh careful here

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.520
in other news sales of Paul Simon's 1986

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.740
album have doubled this week from one to

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.040
two look it's an enduring success story

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.570
is all I'm trying to say

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.920
we might rather go to the shop first but

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.180
I'm gonna Bank on getting some extra

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.620
bonus love in here

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:08.230
I shouldn't be it's extremely good

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.000
I shouldn't be sad about doing Anna's

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.200
asel run cuz you got to do it and some

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.150
azazel runs end up being difficult

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.370
that's not even like a joke obviously

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.290
once you get everything ticked off and

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.080
you never have to do these guys what

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.410
have you exploded it looked like at

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.230
least once you you know never have to do

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.480
hush again it ends up being a lot easier

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.400
but you know to get very specific things

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.190
to ticked off the list is not always

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.560
easy is it always difficult no that

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.100
would be a lie but it's certainly not

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.019
always 100% of the time easy mind you

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.420
this run is shaping up quite nicely so

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.720
far we did spend some money which means

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.700
we spent some damage but one of the

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.110
things that we want on any azazel run

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.680
basically is to pick up a high-value

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.750
space bar item and pretty much you know

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.370
ready for that life now that we have

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.110
triple of Earth's Aria on nine-volt not

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.510
triple-a battery take this immediately

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.260
trade it away for dark bomb look at that

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.080
okay

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.580
now we've got almost everything you

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.959
could conceivably need I would love to

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.430
knock out everything here I would love

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.209
to knock out just a lyrium like we

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.080
knocked out two lyrium on Eden a runner

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.000
two ago

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.079
must have been two ago cuz we just did

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.760
that keeper run it's nice to get that

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.930
you know off of your off your plate

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.020
because the negative runs you can do

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.600
anytime in theory we could roll the dice

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:34.580
and go down to Sheol beat Sheol go down

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:37.430
to the dark womb and then there's a dark

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.800
room sorry it would be a much stranger

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.419
of Freudian slip if there weren't like

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.340
multiple areas in this game called the

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.110
womb to begin with sometimes with the

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.979
hue attached to them but anyway try not

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.720
to read too much into it

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:54.020
that was pretty stupid of me but beyond

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.340
that you know we want to take the chance

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.700
and we could just knock out the Delirium

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.889
run maybe much more easily than that so

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.870
obviously like you know I don't want to

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.340
wish for the moon here but that's the

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.990
only say wish for the moon even if you

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.800
miss you'll land amongst the stars right

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:14.870
if I could get something along the lines

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:16.479
of may I please actually yes can't do

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.360
anything with that yet

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:21.590
like gimpy for example so I could get a

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.770
bunch of red hearts that could be

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.289
converted or I could also get spirit are

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:33.770
it's just directly we should take that

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:36.800
get mom's key if we could get the wafer

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:42.289
like we had two runs ago then ended up

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.729
being a huge enabler for us if we can

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.830
get something better than Bob's curse

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.780
that would be a start let's go check out

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.610
this right here it's a two of diamonds

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.280
so we've milled ourselves down to like

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.850
zero money but the idea is that in the

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:58.160
future we're gonna be able to oh dude

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:02.990
that's actually like almost fits into

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:04.340
our plan we can actually get some value

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.990
out a little chat even if we end up

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.990
never having read HP on this run

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:14.010
No why do you insist on standing right

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.440
in front of the enemy who's charging you

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:18.150
did the commenters ask and I have no

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.370
answer

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.740
I'm not owned I'm not owned I shout as I

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:31.330
shrink into a decreasing streak anyway

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:33.370
we want to get over five cents why pop

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.620
quiz hotshot I have failed the pop quiz

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.570
there's no reason to take that damage

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.540
here's the thing like I don't really

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.430
want to play these guys cuz I doubt

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.870
we're gonna go my lord I doubt we're

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.750
gonna get much but why don't we like

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:49.140
play one and blow up every single one of

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.140
the others

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.460
[Music]

00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:01.830
no I think it worked I mean we got over

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.530
five cents at least let's go back to our

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.820
special room here as well the idea is I

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.380
think not that we used to have diamonds

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.830
right away to get back to the damage we

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:13.020
used to have but rather that we'll buy

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.000
everything on the final floor that has

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.230
the chance to have something which in

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.820
this case could be the Blue Room and

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:20.160
then use two of diamonds to get

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:23.490
ourselves back to a reasonable damage

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.020
bonus if necessary I'm not sweating the

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.000
damage that I've taken so far cuz even

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:30.810
though it looks bad I mean in the end we

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.060
do have dark bums so it's only a matter

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:38.810
of time until we get to shine it's not a

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:41.430
question of when and who isn't Jed no

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:44.760
and now why do you know the theme song

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:46.140
to party of five is that the theme song

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.630
- it's the theme song of one of those

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.710
frickin shows Dawson's party of five at

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:56.250
9:02 100

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:58.910
Melrose Place etc etc I know it because

00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:02.130
my parents took me to see a concert from

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:04.080
Canadian rock star Colin James anybody

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:08.540
know Colin James if he don't he goes I

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:12.960
just came back to say goodbyes you know

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:14.970
he's kind of like discount Bryan Adams I

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.010
like it more than Bryan Adams but I

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:19.230
don't like Bryan Adams at all so I know

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:21.000
that's sacrilegious for a Canadian to

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:24.240
say that about the Canadian you know

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.230
rock star laureate yeah I don't think we

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.230
have a rock star Laurie

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.580
but it's true everything I do I do it

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:44.920
for you more like everything I do I do

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:51.070
it for poo Bryan Adams Bryan Adams Bryan

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:53.170
Eden's I wish my Bryan azazel you got a

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:55.089
decent amount of HP I'm starting to

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:56.170
think like you know there could come a

00:08:55.089 --> 00:08:57.550
time it's gonna sound a little

00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:01.900
ridiculous but there could come a time

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:03.190
where we actually get to full HP and

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.690
we're still getting spirit hearts paid

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:07.600
out from dark bomb so we can actually

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:14.610
use we can use IV bag as stupid as it

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:14.610
sounds to create more damage for us via

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.430
money equals power

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.380
I think we're substantially well

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:24.220
equipped for progress here and do the

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:26.770
fact that we got gimpy even better like

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:29.080
I almost want to just try something like

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:32.680
that on for size is it a smart idea

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.940
probably not but I am thinking it in the

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.480
same manner that I'm thinking about

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.529
those beans that was just terrible

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.240
especially because it's kind of like

00:09:38.529 --> 00:09:41.680
it's a positive feedback loop right like

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.480
we should be getting luck upgrades from

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.890
Penny's as you saw right there that

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.630
gives us a better chance to make gimpy

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:48.160
payout which gives us more fuel to get

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:49.900
money for money equals power which gives

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.630
us more items to purchase which makes us

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:56.940
stronger etc etc right now it's

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:56.940
predominantly like the little Chad show

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:04.959
there's a joke in there somewhere but

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.470
that could change in the future we could

00:10:04.959 --> 00:10:10.810
have the gimpy show it is my favorite

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:15.390
show because it's my show dude got mad

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:17.910
frozen swinging a Miss buddy

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:19.170
we should take that I mean might not

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:22.470
even want to trade because we can

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:24.120
actually get we're gonna trade I mean

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.440
come on let's be real yet at the same

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.450
time there was a lot of value that we

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.709
could garner from that like we could

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:31.440
have used that to get a lot of plays out

00:10:28.709 --> 00:10:34.380
of IV bag but it's it's a decision

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.300
that's made tougher by the fact that you

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:38.100
know the deal was for an item that's

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.110
actually pretty ok you got something for

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:43.079
me you do it's good cuz I haven't taken

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:46.230
some stupid damage another two of

00:10:43.079 --> 00:10:50.490
diamonds so we will pop this immediately

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:56.250
by nun's habit blow this up nun's habit

00:10:50.490 --> 00:11:02.220
doesn't do a lot for us when we have the

00:10:56.250 --> 00:11:04.519
whole razor gotta think about that one

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:06.450
which means I'm not gonna take it

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:07.920
nuns have it doesn't do a lot for us

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:09.899
with IV bag but we might not be used an

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:12.660
IV bag forever there's chaos and at half

00:11:09.899 --> 00:11:15.890
price I might add if the Emperor which

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:18.839
we don't really want just yet but still

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:21.779
forget me now in the d4 not really a d4

00:11:18.839 --> 00:11:24.480
bull run yet at least take another guppy

00:11:21.779 --> 00:11:25.680
item might as well up our bombs which we

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:30.149
got a decent amount of and then just

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:32.010
move along dude this is incredible we

00:11:30.149 --> 00:11:33.690
are one item away from becoming guppy

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:36.060
and that really cements the odds of this

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:42.630
being like a plausible delirium victory

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:44.160
way up there and again you might think

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.300
we've made a mistake there are they in

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.740
many ways you might be right but I'm

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.690
just saving two of diamonds I don't

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:51.899
think I need the huge damage bonus right

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:53.970
away instead you know I'd rather have

00:11:51.899 --> 00:11:57.120
the damage bonus more permanently but

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:58.890
later because I mean if you can't

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.660
survive with eight point seven one

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:01.529
damage on this floor you got you know

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:06.329
bigger problems

00:12:01.529 --> 00:12:09.000
we got a joker right off the bed decent

00:12:06.329 --> 00:12:11.220
chance to become copy right off the bed

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.610
even decent or chance to get something

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:18.300
of value regardless I would probably

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:20.220
take Krampus as head right now I just

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:22.769
don't I don't see a future for IV bag

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:26.399
here so we will take it not sure if it's

00:12:22.769 --> 00:12:28.320
ten out of ten but IV bag as much as I

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:29.100
was like excited to get it my brain

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.780
started

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:33.330
Caladan ideas that could be useful I

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:35.430
don't think it was ever gonna be a huge

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:40.830
value should be another spear at a heart

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:42.960
or two maybe a spider Ferris Bueller

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:45.240
Ferris Bueller's Day Off there you go

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.290
this there's an SNL skit look I came up

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.930
with the title that's the hard part

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:52.920
everybody else get to work on somehow

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:54.090
making various Bueller entertaining in

00:12:52.920 --> 00:13:01.530
any way possible

00:12:54.090 --> 00:13:04.680
the spider nothing not that I'm

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:06.840
necessarily complaining about the

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:09.630
situation I mean we're still steam

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.950
rolling here I did I take I didn't take

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:12.930
jumper cables I definitely should have

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:14.310
taken jumper cables the only reason I

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:17.610
didn't is cuz I was like we don't need

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:19.200
it with IV bag but you know while doing

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:20.760
that I was simultaneously talking about

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.840
how we don't need nun's habit but it

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:24.750
could be useful for us in the future

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:27.030
anyway so basically it's an extremely

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:32.880
like do as I say not as I do sort of

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:39.480
voice going on so a negative victory

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:42.000
here is like extremely easy what we need

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:45.690
wow it's a lot of HP dude that's pretty

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:51.780
good what we need though is a delirium

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:53.100
pass thank you for creating two spiders

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:56.150
that fought each other for my amusement

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:58.350
that was very nice of you

00:13:56.150 --> 00:14:01.080
we're just keeping it quick not to rush

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:02.190
but because you know boss rush is in the

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:05.700
cards for us if we do things right

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:08.730
that's another two of diamonds okay

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:10.770
though why don't you just blew up the

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:13.440
donation machine for no reason man okay

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:15.510
let's get back out of here playing too

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:18.950
much greed mode apparently things I

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:22.500
never thought I'd say four five hundred

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:23.730
all right so we don't care about seeing

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:27.140
a deal with the devil here in fact we

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:27.140
would rather not see one

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:37.870
give us a better chance on the next

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.070
floor gimpy and dark bum doing work of

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:40.810
course now that I've gotten rid of IV

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:43.480
bag I'm like dude IV bag would be pretty

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:45.670
sweet right here you get Necronomicon

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:47.590
because we have chaos and you gotta I

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:49.900
mean once every six rooms Necronomicon

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:52.060
versus once every well yeah six rooms

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:53.680
unless we get hit once every six rooms

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:55.570
Krampus instead you're probably going

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:58.890
cram pees head on that one I mean like I

00:14:55.570 --> 00:15:01.090
I'm a forward-thinking guy sometimes but

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:11.470
that's a little too far for me

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:13.000
Necronomicon still sorta sucks well we

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:15.370
got a battery charger we're like beyond

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.320
max HP halo flies of course is great

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:20.830
it's supposed to diarrhea not so much

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:22.630
are we gonna do boss rush if we are

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:25.620
that'll be where we pop to a diamonds

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:27.820
because it's not really like I'm

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.960
extremely invested in making it to the

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.690
hush fight why are we getting so many

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:33.280
red chests except for delirium plays

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.690
like I'm not worried about it but we

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.750
might as well take our maximum bonus

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:39.250
like at that point I'm not really

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:41.200
worried about like any form of

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:42.700
consumable including money because I

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.500
mean we got affluenza

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:48.660
we got Isaac affluenza right now my

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.660
favorite Star Wars Jedi character

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:59.880
he wields a gold lightsaber sorry yeah

00:15:53.640 --> 00:16:01.140
go light saber we have as many of every

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.850
consumable as we can conceive what we

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:05.400
want we also have like the best card for

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:08.880
where we're at right now it's like that

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:12.360
copypasta you know a fighter hilarious

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:14.820
oh you nerds talk crap too NL and twitch

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:16.530
chat in real life he's jacked he wears

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:20.040
the most expensive clothes hangs out

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:23.640
with the hottest babes you wouldn't you

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:26.690
would never say this to his face which I

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:30.660
mean I'll be a true is also humorous

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:33.360
mom's key ended up being her boss key it

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:35.730
knows what is it boss key I can't even

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:38.010
remember now whichever it was ended up

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:45.720
being very useful for us dude the goat

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:46.320
head sure sign me up I'll take a little

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.930
HP

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:51.570
plus the speed advantage well donate as

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:53.460
much money as we'd well maybe we

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:56.520
shouldn't do this actually tell you what

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:59.790
I'll donate to there because we are

00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:02.750
gonna need money for our future here to

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:04.920
get to maximum HP as quickly as possible

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:09.240
money as quickly as possible we can now

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:10.860
donate anything over 50 cents though so

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:13.620
like we can go we're not quite done yet

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:16.819
um get easily afford to come back here

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:16.819
and throw them like another 10 cents

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:22.439
it's not like we're gonna be spending

00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:28.439
any money on the womb anyway and we can

00:17:22.439 --> 00:17:32.460
like blow this guy up might as well just

00:17:28.439 --> 00:17:34.440
pick it up donate another 5 cents all

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:36.720
right I mean it's a productive donation

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.940
can't really be mad oh he's always throw

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:41.580
a couple of keys away just for sport are

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:42.630
you've never done that oh we should have

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:44.160
taken the world car because we could

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:45.930
have just used the two of diamonds there

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.190
that's what happens when I win not not

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:49.680
when you that's what happens when I try

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:54.000
to min max as much as possible end up

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:55.680
actually a min meaning but my heart was

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.270
in the right place

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:59.270
I was trying to tinker

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:04.920
now pretty much walked right into that

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.690
one

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:09.679
not that it's relevant we want the

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.679
negative just in case

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:17.100
so probably Benny no you know what

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:18.420
weary rolled our run very recently I'm

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.210
just gonna take a theme and get out of

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:24.059
here anybody that says that's not zany

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:25.380
sucks - you're a smart basically I also

00:18:24.059 --> 00:18:27.540
think none of this is worth it we've

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:29.130
already done mega Satan so let's get the

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.020
heck out we've already done boss rush as

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:35.700
Azazel so let's get the heck out of here

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:39.690
we want to force this Azazel fight god I

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:45.300
hate this room made easy but still we

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:49.800
want to force the Azazel fight that was

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:51.390
actually horrible and and by Azazel I

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.520
mean mega sane man it's a queue that I

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:54.540
should record something other than Isaac

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.190
for today when you can't get the right

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:58.860
name for something like eight times in a

00:18:56.190 --> 00:19:00.360
row but you got to force the mega Satan

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:06.000
fight so we can force the Delirium fight

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:09.600
I think I will sack a spirit heart to go

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:13.650
to the curse room it's a rate of fire so

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:15.990
bad now and I don't believe it's changed

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:18.360
why is my perception that our rate of

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:23.730
fire is worse now are these the same

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:30.080
same signs my uncle was showing oh my

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:30.080
god you scared me trick-or-treat

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:37.480
yeah yeah yeah you can just leave that

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:42.800
there this run will be done in a

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:45.710
millisecond sorry what I don't know I

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:49.090
didn't hear anything that was mine

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:49.090
flooded all right

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:56.530
god I hate scolex

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:56.530
you're the worst my dude

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:04.390
give me liberty Thank You holy mantle

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:07.780
you've been out too long in the midnight

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:10.120
sea the guppy dream we don't forget the

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:13.470
tears of grape that's not like relevant

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:13.470
in the very least here

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:27.350
with holy mantle we can essentially walk

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:30.470
into every room and kill every enemy

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:33.920
like instantly not instantly but like at

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:35.420
very little risk to ourselves and if you

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.950
ever see me playing badly on this run

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.030
I'm just gonna default to the neck pain

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:40.010
excuse that's right

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:43.910
three Isaac episodes in one day what is

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:48.440
he some sort of madman that's two hours

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:52.070
and 20 minutes of work where does he

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:53.809
find the time I don't understand it's

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:57.740
true being a youtuber is streamers a

00:20:53.809 --> 00:20:58.940
pretty tough gig cats yet to sneeze

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:02.480
around me I don't know if there's any

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:04.429
like cat to human diseases that can be

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.500
transmitted like that but I just like

00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:08.420
I'd prefer if you didn't sneeze into my

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.830
face when you wanted my attention maybe

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.179
that's just a person too maybe I'm being

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:13.190
a little bit of a germaphobe I do

00:21:11.179 --> 00:21:15.980
resemble Howie Mandel at least in the

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:18.080
follicular Department which is also

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:22.190
coincidentally my least favorite area of

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:23.780
the grocery store but still dude you

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:26.830
don't have to give me the facial sneezes

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.830
give me the facial rubs

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:36.870
the sneezes are too much though anyone

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.190
did that to me on the street I would

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:41.280
think about smacking them in the face

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:42.570
but actually do nothing instead I would

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.670
tweet about it later and get a lot of

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:46.410
sympathy I'd go this guy's a jerk and

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:48.270
people would go yeah he is and I would

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:51.930
feel vindicated as a result despite my

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:55.530
inaction in the face of an injustice uh

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:57.120
nothing of value so easy floor down to

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:58.620
the blue room we're gonna take our time

00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.060
to perfect the beat and we still are

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:03.810
gonna continue to have love for the

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:07.260
streets it's the d-r-e plus we can

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:09.060
donate like crazy here no we can donate

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:14.280
a couple of times is what I meant to say

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:17.250
yeah we'll take scapulae and we will

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:19.830
take faiths reward neither of which very

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:20.970
pivotal well takes mom's box of trinkets

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:23.670
could be cool actually

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:26.940
but guppies head is obviously like

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:29.250
substantially better in pretty much

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:31.470
every available situation this is where

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:33.660
things tend to get difficult though is a

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:35.310
fight against an enemy where you got to

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.530
get real close cuz you range stat ain't

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:39.780
all it's cracked up to be

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:42.290
and that makes dodging much more

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:42.290
difficult

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:51.750
we do have 43 but bombs as well oh there

00:22:48.059 --> 00:22:53.340
goes holy man's legs I'm an idiot um we

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:57.299
could throw in the butt bombs like in

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:59.130
the middle dodge to the side put your

00:22:57.299 --> 00:23:00.419
right foot in put your right foot out

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:03.029
you put your right foot in you shake it

00:23:00.419 --> 00:23:04.830
all about you do the Hokey Pokey then

00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:05.519
you turn yourself around that's what

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:09.630
it's all about

00:23:05.519 --> 00:23:12.649
I'll see you can check out anytime but

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:15.120
you can never leave

00:23:12.649 --> 00:23:19.529
welcome to the instructions for the Hulk

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:24.860
epoch in such a lovely dance structure

00:23:19.529 --> 00:23:24.860
lovely things give the dance a chance

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:31.529
most people don't know this but Charles

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:35.250
dance was actually named for the

00:23:31.529 --> 00:23:38.059
hokey-pokey which is out dance as most

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:38.059
people don't realize

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:46.210
and when Jo Dee Messina sang you know so

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:48.100
when you get the chance to sit it out or

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:50.050
dance I hope you'll dance she was

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.430
talking about the hokey-pokey it was

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:52.930
either that or a chicken dance at her

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:58.120
best friend's wedding starring Julia

00:23:52.930 --> 00:24:00.010
Roberts so this is like the ideal enemy

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:01.930
for us to be facing or the ideal way for

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:04.570
us to be facing against this enemy the

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:07.510
less he moves the safer we are the more

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:14.440
flies we generate the faster he dies the

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:15.910
less damage we take overall this is just

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.410
a little preview of what its gonna be

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:20.710
like to fight delirium so like I

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:24.390
wouldn't get too cocky about the way

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:27.550
this looks just yet Wow

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:28.930
well actually a theme came through in

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:34.920
the clutch and actually took us back to

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:37.630
basically full HP oh my lord just die

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:42.010
you've you've served your purpose on

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:43.600
this green earth be destroyed your ashes

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:44.650
will scatter to the earth you will be no

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.020
more okay

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:51.090
is there anything of value that we could

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:55.270
get before we go to this delirium floor

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:57.010
maybe a pill that's a vert pill which

00:24:55.270 --> 00:25:00.090
gave us another range up you know what

00:24:57.010 --> 00:25:02.530
that ended up actually being pretty good

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:05.580
so forget the negative let's knock out

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:12.700
delirium we're looking for like a

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:17.380
strength card we're looking for a what

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:19.750
we're looking for four cents another

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:22.680
range up is not bad to speed ups don't

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:22.680
do anything for us but

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:34.130
looking for a devil card basically

00:25:28.429 --> 00:25:36.260
anything that gives us damage I would

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:40.580
accept a lovers card for the

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:45.679
potentiality of it's giving us spirit

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:47.870
hearts from dark bomb I'm not gonna

00:25:45.679 --> 00:25:49.340
sweat too much by the way like just in

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:53.510
general I'm gonna sweat just the right

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:54.740
amount and don't ever question it no but

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:57.200
I'm not gonna sweat too much whether or

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:59.150
not we're on the boss fight that could

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.710
be delirium too early of course it's

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:03.530
always better to get more items before

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:04.790
you go for it but we don't have too much

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:09.980
in the way of control there

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:12.260
unfortunately we can't see the map is

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:13.700
basically what I'm getting at here is a

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:16.760
two of diamonds better than a speed

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:18.559
upgrade no both of them are now

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:21.730
irrelevant but at one point of this run

00:26:18.559 --> 00:26:21.730
were extremely valuable

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:31.690
last system it's good at least get a

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:34.150
couple items we got chaos so like the

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:36.840
world's our burrito your dude might I

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:41.220
suggest a little cut okay well nevermind

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:44.260
- just a little combo we had earlier um

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:46.110
Sacred Heart Plus a crown of light

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:47.920
please

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:49.990
wouldn't be the worst thing in the world

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:51.700
in fact it might actually be the best

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:54.040
thing in the world and yes I have

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:56.350
consumed a cronut so I feel like I'm an

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:57.910
authority on the best things on earth I

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:59.470
actually I have to admit I'm lying you

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:03.250
have never consumed the cronut I missed

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:06.520
that fad I've gone in on other fads

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:06.940
though I have I've consumed Val this

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.890
month

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:11.169
I'll admit what do I think of it I think

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:13.150
they're expensive sandwiches I'm not

00:27:11.169 --> 00:27:14.710
talking about Bon Me's I'm very for

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:17.669
those I'm talking about the you know

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:20.590
Chinese style steamed buns filled with

00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:23.320
like you know two bites of food three

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:25.030
bucks about four bucks a Bao day Bao Bao

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:28.360
it's alright but you know it's not an

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:30.700
everyday thing for certain I love cold

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:32.110
brew coffee people think I'm a snob for

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.520
dreamin cold brew coffee you know why I

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:36.100
love cold brew coffee cuz I have a

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:38.530
crippling biological dependency on

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:41.860
caffeine and cold brew coffee is cold as

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:43.270
a result you can drink it immediately so

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:44.830
it's that combined with double you know

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:46.480
that Coverley cuts down on the acidity

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:48.940
so the flavors of the coffee yeah maybe

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:50.710
but also it can enter you know my

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:56.919
bloodstream faster that's a big part of

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:58.299
it it's like a ton of money not that

00:27:56.919 --> 00:28:01.590
that makes any difference for us right

00:27:58.299 --> 00:28:04.390
now I also have no idea where we are

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:06.669
that's a little bit more on the annoying

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:09.100
side we checked here is this where we

00:28:06.669 --> 00:28:14.799
came from this might be where we came

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:16.450
from so I'm thinking I obviously by the

00:28:14.799 --> 00:28:17.919
way the big mistake we made here we

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:19.690
tried to split the difference so instead

00:28:17.919 --> 00:28:21.429
of getting the polaroid which would have

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:24.040
given us a really nice period of

00:28:21.429 --> 00:28:25.780
permanent polaroid invincibility to

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:27.429
abuse down here we have the negative

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:30.820
which is more or less pretty much

00:28:27.429 --> 00:28:32.830
useless when it comes to you know

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:35.320
offensively doing anything for us here

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:41.680
at least

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:43.930
it's pretty dumb however we were trying

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:45.520
to accomplish our bets cuz we didn't

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:47.200
know right we took insurance on our

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:51.100
blackjack plate I understand that that's

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:52.810
considered a bad move but let's be

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.800
honest if you were looking for good

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:56.950
moves you probably wouldn't be in the

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:58.930
casino in the first place these runs

00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:05.080
exist for us to make mistakes and get

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:06.700
messy as Miss Frizzle said I forget the

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:08.230
other she had she had some important

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:13.720
advice I don't remember all of it look

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:15.310
she's a smart lady though I always tried

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:17.170
to embody that miss Frizzle spirit when

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:19.360
I was teaching if the Miss Frizzle

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:20.800
spirit was hey here's the lesson I'm

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.990
happy to answer any questions that you

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:24.730
have but at the same time if you're

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:28.210
gonna act up please just sit down and do

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:30.670
your workbook because I'm being paid

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:35.230
about seven dollars an hour to be a

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:38.080
surrogate daycare for children that

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:40.540
consider me to be a mercenary from

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:42.940
another country so it's really like the

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:44.560
workbook does the heavy lifting you're

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:49.060
there to make sure nobody gets killed

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:51.190
and also help with pronunciation not

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:53.430
exactly Teacher of the Year material but

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:55.690
a pragmatic approach I would suggest

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:59.410
please allow me to find the boss rooms

00:29:55.690 --> 00:30:03.760
before I further illustrate that I was

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:08.620
not very good in my last job oh please

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:11.620
delirium I beg you let's go so I don't

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:12.760
want to take damage but you ever hear

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.940
the expression you gotta spend money to

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.940
make money

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:22.360
I think we gotta put ourselves at risk

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:25.780
to have the best chance possible to also

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:27.940
get damage done here so a theme is like

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:30.100
a little sliver of our damage it's not

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:35.560
worth very much I think the Flies are

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:37.420
extremely valuable foot thank you

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:40.210
and and the beam is obviously like

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:42.130
number one any damage we can get done

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:45.100
with that beam is gonna be extremely

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:48.220
valuable so we're more than halfway done

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:49.690
and our HP is not that was actually

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:51.640
extremely good I still think there's

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:54.400
like a little bug where when a boss

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:57.220
transitions if it's transitioning to a

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:59.230
boss with low HP you can do like its

00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:01.180
regular level of HP for like a split

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:06.280
second instead of it's delirium level of

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:08.590
HP either way though some of the easiest

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:11.800
money ever made here like I said you got

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:13.510
to spend to make what are we unlock dark

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:15.250
Prince's crown that's a great item or

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:16.570
great trinket I should say so an overall

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:18.010
