00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.470
everybody welcome back dinner with the

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.970
line please finding vice-gerent plus

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.040
we've been well you haven't been playing

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.660
that well but we getting wins this is a

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:16.710
difference between playing well and

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:18.300
winning I suppose let's do a polygon we

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.070
got a lot to do as a polygon including

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.439
boss rush if we got the if we got the

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.070
money honey I got the time DHD are jo7

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.810
said I'm assuming that that's I mean you

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.789
never know what this frickin game I mean

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.369
am i right

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:37.260
spend 3000 hours in its piece of garbage

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.570
um that's a joke of course mostly how do

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.590
you how do you tell if that's the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.120
negative or the Polaroid I'm gonna

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.219
assume that that's the Polaroid because

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.500
how else would we get to the negative

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.000
path without using like a self-sacrifice

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.129
room and I would like basically

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.559
guarantee that we have not done that as

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.500
any character on this SAF file much less

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.090
apollyon so not too I'm not too worried

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.199
you want to go negative path this time

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.040
cuz it looks like we've already done the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:08.820
positive path you might be saying NL in

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.090
episode you know 461 we're not quite

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.310
there yet never soak 422 you win light

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.810
side path how do you not remember I have

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.990
to tell you first off that's extremely

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.850
flattering secondly your boy spends a

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.490
lot of time in this office talking to

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.310
himself videos bleed into each other

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.320
days bleed into each other months and

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.740
years sometimes bleed into each other in

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.170
here it's like being inside of the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.650
freaking the hyperbolic chamber that

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:42.180
Goku trains in I do believe it's

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.820
hyperbolic not half

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.220
hyperbaric which is what David Duchovny

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.720
puts his hand in in the Zoolander series

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.430
of fish see we're all very familiar with

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.880
the Zoolander mythos I really hope they

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:58.439
make Zoolander retribution I hope they

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.930
did never actually make that but I still

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.450
somehow like I can't hate on that

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.890
generation actors you know I really like

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.229
Ben Stiller seems like a day in hates

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.610
him if you wanted I don't want to call

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.920
out there necessarily but I've always

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.349
he's always seemed like an

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.700
he plays affable characters and even

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.230
when he plays someone like white Goodman

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.510
from dodgeball you kind of get the idea

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.010
that he's like he's having fun with it

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.280
you know when he's a jerk like in heavy

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.690
weights or in happy gilmore for some

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.670
reason I don't know maybe Dan you know

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.430
he did live in Los Angeles for 12 weeks

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.290
two different times maybe he's got some

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:42.920
Ben Stiller stories some Stiller tales

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:46.850
if you will I think I'm gonna take it

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.019
I shouldn't accept I took damage so I

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.510
think taking it was the right decision

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.980
here so that we can actually protect our

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.260
deal with the devil chances cuz I kind

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.340
of screwed it up we should not have

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.569
taken that much damage especially

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.250
against Ragman but that's fine anyway

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.049
like same with Will Ferrell there was a

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.410
period I think Will Ferrell's considered

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:09.380
you know he's respected to some extent

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.519
right now but back in like 2008 a lot of

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.680
people were like I don't like Will

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.799
Ferrell I don't respect him I respect

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.400
him just seems like an affable guy I'm

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.989
gonna suck that item up and I shouldn't

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:27.109
have perhaps you could definitely make a

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:28.970
case that I should have taken it but I'm

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.250
gonna do so anyway it's weird that we

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.870
have like an attachment or at least a

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.709
preconceived notion of what an actor is

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.980
like just based on their the roles that

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.260
they play I'm trying to think are there

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.730
are there people in Hollywood that if I

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.470
saw them on the street I would be like

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.480
all that guy's a dick

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.000
the answer is there probably shouldn't

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.370
be you know just cuz someone played a

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.980
terrible villain doesn't necessarily

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.620
mean you know I wouldn't go say hi to

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.560
them like trying to think of examples

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.299
here like if we saw Bill Sarsgaard the

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.000
guy who played penny wise in the new it

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.680
remake ironically he's probably got

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.989
people you know walking over to him and

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.430
going dude I loved your role you'd

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.540
knocked it out of the park I don't think

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.430
he's got too many people crossing the

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.930
street then again people who might not

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.609
recognize him quite as much outside of

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.799
the make up I'm popping algae's here

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.650
just to give myself the best chance

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.690
possible to stay alive and I actually

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.490
and wait till he jumps and then gonna

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.510
drop a bomb just to speed this up so

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.390
algae's will definitely

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.480
last the whole fight or more probably

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.130
last the whole fight so damaged kind of

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.390
stinks I'm actually not gonna use the

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.470
bomb I'm going to use the bomb I really

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.360
thought we were gonna be able to make it

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.580
work without using it the bomb is sort

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:48.860
of valuable but okay we probably want to

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:51.560
take that it's not bad I want to take

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.270
the little brim so we should take the

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.970
shovel as well but I'll be the first to

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.900
tell you a little bit of a funky game

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:04.880
plan here

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:11.810
I think we just oh it worked oh my lord

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:15.410
okay we're alive but that was very scary

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.300
I think we want to suck that up oh

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:21.170
please don't be a black market just be a

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:23.960
good crawlspace I still stand by this

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:26.420
being the right decision but it's

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.010
looking a little grimy here our dps is

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.990
the real problem which is why I'm very

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.720
tempted to actually suck up belly button

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.030
but allowing us to hold two trinkets

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.820
could potentially be pretty nice okay

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.320
well let's go peep this I'm happy we

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.570
have the shovel the question really is

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.800
whether or not it was worth thank you

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:47.930
whether or not it was worth using our

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.250
charge when we could have gotten a DPS

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.720
upgrade and also I mean it would have

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.370
been better of course we didn't step on

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.050
the spikes but I'm not sure there's any

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.700
way to like painlessly swap items

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.850
without stepping on the spikes I kind of

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:01.210
left it up to a chance and that was

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.380
clearly like the super wrong decision

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:11.560
it's kind of a weird one here cuz you're

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:13.880
not supposed to pick up the d6 with void

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.710
can lead to some weird interactions I

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.020
don't necessarily think it's destructive

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.090
but I don't think it's a good choice

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.370
necessarily that being said I'm gonna

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.740
completely do it so we'll suck that up

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.190
and I really have no idea I think we

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:31.520
just sucked up nothing I think we've

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:33.170
weary rolled the active into a passive

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.760
sucked it up and got nothing out of it

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.640
which is pretty you know that sucks

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.150
that's not great let's put one cent in

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.830
here we were looking for the rear

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:45.220
in theory we could make a pretty good

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.840
case for taking the four taking the

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.099
battery I guess but let's save our money

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.050
instead cuz you never know we might be

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:52.000
buying spirit hearts out the wazoo you

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.280
know this one started a little bit

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.169
scarily and really the only thing that's

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.000
given us a big DPS improvement in the

00:06:56.169 --> 00:06:59.470
present moment is the fact that we have

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:06.389
little Grimm without little brim we

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:06.389
would be in a much much scarier position

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:11.610
in fact I would I would probably be

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.870
angling towards a loss I think but now

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:15.849
we bought ourselves some time you know

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:19.479
what we didn't we gave ourselves a gap

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:21.460
here people come up to me all the time

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:22.870
they go NL how can I be expected to know

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.060
what I want to be for the rest of my

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.159
life when I'm 17 this is a conceit for

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:30.729
the purpose of this bit no one has ever

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:32.020
come up to me and said that okay I only

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:34.539
get a couple of different kinds of

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:37.810
interactions what I'm recognized there's

00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:39.880
three of them one of them is hey excuse

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.500
me are you NL that's one another one I

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.090
get hey Ryan

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.380
and I go yes and they go hey I watch

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.360
your YouTube videos and I go okay it's

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.639
gonna be you know this is this is I'm

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.259
not being served right now oh we should

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:52.719
probably suck that up even though it's

00:07:50.259 --> 00:07:54.580
not Canada ten necessarily but it won't

00:07:52.719 --> 00:07:58.530
even suck it up because of the d6 right

00:07:54.580 --> 00:08:02.530
okay well we'll see and the other one is

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:07.150
someone shouting an inside joke of mine

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:08.620
at me from like across the street like

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.849
sometimes and this doesn't happen all

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.380
the time I don't want to make it sound

00:08:09.849 --> 00:08:15.009
like every time I walk outside of my

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:19.509
apartment like people are like there's a

00:08:15.009 --> 00:08:21.219
hot dog sandwich but it does especially

00:08:19.509 --> 00:08:23.740
at conventions sometimes people will

00:08:21.219 --> 00:08:25.690
just like shout a joke at me and it's

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.840
fun you know I just wave and go like

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:31.330
this is my life this is my life this is

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.880
my life you know it's it's a song it's a

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:36.099
thing let's give this a chance

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.419
nobody's ever coming up to me and now

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:39.159
what should I do with my life and that's

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:43.060
probably for the best

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:46.420
dude restock is a great get in this

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:48.730
situation buy this check the secret room

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:53.170
mmm that's a magic much 10 out of 10

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:55.560
guaranteed like I said but yeah you know

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:59.220
you can't really when you go to college

00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:02.139
your age may vary

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.550
Bob's curse worth sucking up for sure

00:09:02.139 --> 00:09:04.810
but then again we wouldn't have sucked

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:07.540
it up so maybe it's better to keep it

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:09.040
this way um when you go off to college

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.540
or university if you go off to college

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:15.190
or university or you choose something to

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:26.019
apprentice in etc etc okey dokey

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:28.300
oh my god it's actually just really

00:09:26.019 --> 00:09:31.000
stupid so I just skipped the bathroom I

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:33.329
don't know what that that's a rare form

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.829
of mistake for me it's just like

00:09:33.329 --> 00:09:39.010
complete idiocy well you got to own it

00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:42.820
basically anyway the overly prey wing

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:46.329
lang thank you the one the steak

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:47.410
deserves another I suppose the what I'm

00:09:46.329 --> 00:09:49.720
trying to get at is you know we gave

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:51.790
ourselves a gap year by getting little

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:53.620
brims you know mom and dad are like hey

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:54.970
you know we'll cover your rent for a

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:57.160
year just try to figure out what you

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:58.180
want to do and you're like I will even

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:03.069
though nobody really knows what that

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:05.620
means check out our room here it doesn't

00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:07.269
mean we're safe forever even though you

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.620
know what the dawn of a gap year it

00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:10.720
might seem like that year's gonna last

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:12.819
forever no year does unless I mean

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.440
honestly it would be like terrifying if

00:10:12.819 --> 00:10:16.300
the year did last forever that would be

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.790
just I can't even imagine the

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:20.500
existential dread of knowing that a year

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.970
is never gonna end or not knowing that

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:25.440
it's never gonna end it just living in

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:28.149
it it's like you know David Lynch in

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.500
either way though so we could sprinkler

00:10:28.149 --> 00:10:32.470
and we get shovels so there is

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:34.060
unintended to use this not necessarily

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.440
all the time but if we could use it once

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.389
per floor and maybe get a crawlspace

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:40.690
it's worth something you could probably

00:10:37.389 --> 00:10:43.120
use it twice per floor now it may come a

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:46.449
time when the sprinkler is better that

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:48.190
time is not now unless occasional Holy

00:10:46.449 --> 00:10:50.639
Light shots which are like you know 12

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:50.639
out of 10

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:57.020
yeah we're starting to do okay here to

00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:00.140
definitely use more though more

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:04.340
everything basically oh my god that was

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:07.190
uh obviously we're not sucking that out

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:11.690
that was um Liberty cab given us VAT

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:14.060
mushroom I think can't help so yeah we

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:15.770
got a we got to still find a way to get

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.910
ahead of this run and honestly the way

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.470
that we're probably gonna do that is

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:20.870
related to the fact we just picked up

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:23.240
cricket said which is an awesome damage

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:25.190
up for us I don't see any tinted rocks

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.140
been pretty lucky on consumables Bob's

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:30.980
curses showed up which I appreciate

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:33.350
plus like take it from me um why would I

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.640
lie to you the boss fight that we

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:37.850
skipped it was gonna be garbage it was

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:41.540
gonna be like champion mega fatty and

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:42.920
then he was gonna drop pageant boy and

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.150
if we tried to suck it up it was

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:48.410
actually gonna give us it was gonna

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:52.640
reduce our speed 20.2 I've seen it all

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:57.490
happen we get another charge as soon as

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.490
we leave so we might as well pop this

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:05.810
just wanted to share my puffs secret

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:09.629
with you actually this is really good

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:11.190
the eternal heart is going to be very

00:12:09.629 --> 00:12:13.350
useful now we're fighting mega fatty but

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:15.540
you know this isn't a champion so it's

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:19.949
it's way better than if we fought him on

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:21.089
the boss fight and actually sprinkler is

00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:22.800
gonna be a lot better because of the

00:12:21.089 --> 00:12:25.500
fact that we got that damage upgrade as

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:28.589
well although still like not in the

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:30.930
thing is I want to use a poly on I want

00:12:28.589 --> 00:12:33.540
to use void rather we can get mega Satan

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:39.389
done here which we definitely have not

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:41.069
done we want to use void to get the the

00:12:39.389 --> 00:12:43.110
best like passive run that we can get

00:12:41.069 --> 00:12:44.459
stacking up actives it's the only thing

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.110
I don't like about void and it's

00:12:44.459 --> 00:12:49.050
probably good for balance that it's a

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:52.339
choice that's gonna hurt the only thing

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:56.519
I don't like about void is the fact that

00:12:52.339 --> 00:12:58.620
we're basically stuck choosing to stack

00:12:56.519 --> 00:13:01.230
up awesome actives or stack up the

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:02.959
chance for an amazing passive run by you

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:05.250
know re-rolling items into stat upgrades

00:13:02.959 --> 00:13:08.730
unfortunately it's hard to have your

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:13.380
your cake and eat it too there god I

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:17.009
hate are you a wizard frickin stupid

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:21.389
internet mean picture those dang meme

00:13:17.009 --> 00:13:23.130
pictures now I got to spend 45 seconds

00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:26.639
every third run not being able to hit

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:29.819
anything okay obviously we want that and

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:35.430
oh I mean like we're gonna get HP back

00:13:29.819 --> 00:13:38.100
immediately but is it worth it I think

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:40.889
it is let's I mean it like contract from

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.089
below is really good as well it's a it's

00:13:40.889 --> 00:13:43.860
a tough call it's a tougher call they

00:13:42.089 --> 00:13:45.329
need to think at least it might not be

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:49.680
that tough cuz go ahead is also amazing

00:13:45.329 --> 00:13:51.420
but so we're gonna keep get out of jail

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:56.189
free and if it seems like that's kind of

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:57.899
unnecessary want to remind you that

00:13:56.189 --> 00:13:59.550
there will probably come a point on

00:13:57.899 --> 00:14:02.399
every single character where we need to

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:04.889
accomplish something annoying often

00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:06.899
times that's mega saver so if we can get

00:14:04.889 --> 00:14:10.920
this whole mega Satan nonsense taken

00:14:06.899 --> 00:14:14.360
care of before it becomes as annoying as

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:18.300
it'll neva tably be

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:20.610
and I am very pleased to do so now the

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:22.530
other thing by the way and normally with

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:24.180
restock the the methodology that you

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:25.440
want is pretty simple you know you're

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.610
like I'm gonna buy things from the shop

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.900
I'm gonna buy a bunch of items

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:30.540
especially if I get steamed say they're

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:32.940
gonna be real cheap we can get stacked

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:35.940
that is important however on a run like

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:39.210
this you know HP not really our strong

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:41.100
suit right now we may want to consider

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:43.770
just buying spirit hearts and I think

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:45.990
that that is fundamentally an okay thing

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:50.670
to do also if you ever step on one of

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:52.410
those spikes I'm disowning myself no

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.970
you're gonna say NL that's not even you

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:55.470
know you can't legally disown yourself

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:57.360
it would have extremely troubling

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:59.520
implications in the field of law you

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.650
know declaring bankruptcy and so on I'm

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:06.090
gonna do it try to stop me it's a free

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:08.400
country please blow up the skulls you

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:14.220
know you got one and it paid out I'm a

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:16.260
happy camper I don't like the expression

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:17.700
happy camper you would be fooled because

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:20.850
I use it all the time it's just because

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:23.370
it has a certain singsong genus to to it

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:26.100
that I kind of like and it gives you a

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:28.940
folksy nature which can be valuable in

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:34.020
building a moment I think you know I

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:37.080
don't understand why campers are the the

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:39.030
number one representative of happiness

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:42.180
maybe it's because they're prone to

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:43.590
sadness homesickness you know get a

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:45.990
phone call from mom that makes you a

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:51.000
happy camper maybe it's plausible I

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:52.650
suppose apart from that I can't really

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.220
think of where that idiom conceivably

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:57.750
could have come from

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:59.400
or is it that campers are like the

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:02.370
happiest people on earth because I

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.420
honestly don't know I honestly don't

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.920
know the answer to that question I've

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:08.250
been camping I've never been to camp

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:11.910
though I listen to a lot of camp low

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:14.700
though you know you need to relax and

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:16.590
dress low weight you need to unwind and

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:21.780
come low relax yourself and let the

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:23.670
sugar Love coolly hag got you boy see

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:29.360
Luchini is a much easier one to actually

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:29.360
rap Cooley high is like impossible

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.220
so I won't even try although I did

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:36.210
entertain the thought temporarily

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:38.130
surrounding depths one we're about two

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:39.780
minutes ahead of schedule just go leave

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:41.460
if you don't get that reference here's

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:43.830
your required listening can't blow up

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:45.650
town Saturday night you can skip a few

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:50.550
of the tracks but you've got to hit

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:53.100
Luchini you got a hit Cooley high you

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:54.360
got a hit black nostalgic and that's

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:57.630
good enough you know those are gonna be

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:59.070
on the quiz next week I was ready for a

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:01.910
Krampus fight because betrayal just

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:04.530
sucks so I think we'll just take HP

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:09.660
because we have time I feel like I

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:11.400
should look for a secret room and that

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:13.950
worked out very well it's a little bit

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.660
boring to just get HP but also essential

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:18.990
I would say and then beyond that we need

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:20.790
keys cuz we we really value and benefit

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:23.040
from going to our item room in

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:24.450
particular but also shop with restock

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:33.210
like nothing wrong with that oh it's

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:34.590
pretty solid get actually plenty of

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:38.640
bombs

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:41.970
let's try try can always escape down

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:44.240
these portals if we if we have to two

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:44.240
keys

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:48.470
okay get the heck out of here we still

00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:50.749
want to keep pace cuz boss rush is is

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:52.429
doable but do we really want to do boss

00:17:50.749 --> 00:17:55.100
rush and mega satan in the same run

00:17:52.429 --> 00:17:58.730
possibly in a way I'm kind of like why

00:17:55.100 --> 00:18:01.129
not so this is a ideal Steam sale we

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:05.269
didn't get Steam sale but it would have

00:18:01.129 --> 00:18:07.159
been super good with restock still if

00:18:05.269 --> 00:18:09.110
we're able to get keys for the next shop

00:18:07.159 --> 00:18:11.629
we can make a lot of we can pay

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:14.419
dividends let's leave it at that all

00:18:11.629 --> 00:18:17.809
right we can't fly permanently here holy

00:18:14.419 --> 00:18:19.309
water not particularly strong let's try

00:18:17.809 --> 00:18:23.299
to suck it up I don't know what we're

00:18:19.309 --> 00:18:25.909
gonna get we got damage and also an

00:18:23.299 --> 00:18:27.409
escape not worth taking the Hermit card

00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:28.940
just bounce I think we're in a really

00:18:27.409 --> 00:18:31.639
really good spot now we got to keep pace

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.269
but apart from that we're like fairly

00:18:31.639 --> 00:18:36.889
well off

00:18:32.269 --> 00:18:40.129
so let's smash we'd have 10 damage I

00:18:36.889 --> 00:18:43.039
don't want I'm always the guy I don't

00:18:40.129 --> 00:18:45.679
complain that much I find very little to

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:48.440
complain about except in Isaac videos

00:18:45.679 --> 00:18:52.429
it's always a topic for conversation you

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:53.809
know oh my lord it's it's a topic for

00:18:52.429 --> 00:18:55.399
conversation what does this run need

00:18:53.809 --> 00:18:56.869
well I was complaining about damage

00:18:55.399 --> 00:18:58.940
earlier now our damage is sorted so

00:18:56.869 --> 00:19:01.519
we're probably set right no we're not

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:05.330
and the reason is our great of fire kind

00:19:01.519 --> 00:19:07.129
of sucks I'm motivated by that you know

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:10.220
there's always gonna be a thorn in your

00:19:07.129 --> 00:19:12.950
side in life you know you gotta do what

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:15.320
you can to minimize that thorn even with

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:17.929
the knowledge that once you remove that

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.999
thorn from your side another thorn is

00:19:17.929 --> 00:19:23.049
going to appear you know there's always

00:19:19.999 --> 00:19:23.049
something to focus on

00:19:23.799 --> 00:19:28.419
I think people are like and I do this as

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:31.830
well zero question about it I think

00:19:28.419 --> 00:19:35.380
people are like you know if I just had

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:36.970
money all my problems would disappear

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:38.409
people with money got problems you think

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:42.039
professional athletes aren't stressing

00:19:38.409 --> 00:19:43.809
out they might be stressing out even

00:19:42.039 --> 00:19:45.370
more I'm not saying they have a harder

00:19:43.809 --> 00:19:47.140
life but that doesn't necessarily mean

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:49.090
it you know we all know that a lot of

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:52.750
stress is rational a lot of is

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:54.220
irrational right if we could I mean we

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:57.309
could reroll then and then be fine

00:19:54.220 --> 00:20:02.919
same thing like you know I did I also

00:19:57.309 --> 00:20:05.110
believe then I was gonna say I was gonna

00:20:02.919 --> 00:20:06.490
go down like a dark road I was gonna say

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:08.679
I don't believe that human beings are

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:12.279
like a hardwired to be happy I don't

00:20:08.679 --> 00:20:15.279
mean that the way that it sounds just

00:20:12.279 --> 00:20:16.539
mean like you know keep in mind this is

00:20:15.279 --> 00:20:18.340
coming from someone with a bachelor's

00:20:16.539 --> 00:20:21.190
degree in biology if you want to listen

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:22.750
to like more intelligent people say this

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:27.159
stuff you should vet him first I am a

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:29.470
moron I graduated with like a 3.2 GPA in

00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:31.950
an undergraduate program not qualified

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:34.840
to say this stuff my hunch is that like

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:37.990
there's not too much in our evolutionary

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:40.149
past there wasn't that much value in

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:43.630
being happy you know contentedness was

00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:46.929
probably good cuz let you to give you

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:48.190
time to appreciate what you had I

00:20:46.929 --> 00:20:49.419
suppose I mean we'll start working

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.370
towards bookworm just because we don't

00:20:49.419 --> 00:20:52.630
need our money for anything else we're

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:55.029
not gonna donate on this one just

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:57.039
because we're moving faster than then

00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:59.470
that is relevant I guess well you know

00:20:57.039 --> 00:21:01.419
back in the day what were the what were

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:05.380
the emotions that led to your survival

00:21:01.419 --> 00:21:07.390
probably you know like Drive passion

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.679
anger stuff like that I think we're

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:11.230
gonna save our charge because we could

00:21:08.679 --> 00:21:13.840
suck up all the items on boss rush you

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:16.750
know hunger it's not really an emotion

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:18.880
but you get the idea there's a caveman

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:20.049
you know three the hundred thousand well

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.390
that's too long ago there's a caveman

00:21:20.049 --> 00:21:25.450
fifty thousand years ago how do you feel

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:28.120
Bill I'm happy that dudes he's being

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:29.710
weeded out someone hungrier than in is

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.750
gonna take a spot on the food chain now

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:33.250
I love the fact that we live in a

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:35.020
society where that stuff is largely

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:36.280
irrelevant except for the best

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.440
is you know trapped in our skulls

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:41.050
because I would be sooo I'm done

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.500
like slovenly that's maybe not the right

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:44.560
word

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:49.870
sloth like occasionally I have lazy

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:53.530
tendencies negative please and I'm

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:58.840
content spend a lot of my life being

00:21:53.530 --> 00:22:01.240
content I want to save some HP I'm not

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:03.790
necessarily pleased with this but I

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:05.230
think that we it's probably better for

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:07.060
us to have gotten the stats than the

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:10.000
virus and at least we got to roll the

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:12.670
dice but I think it's kind of like you

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.530
know that's the struggle is that if our

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:17.710
ancestors had what we had would they be

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:20.020
happy you know uniformly or nearly

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:21.640
uniformly possibly but I think that the

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:23.830
human brain is designed to look for

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:26.080
problems and then solutions to those

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:27.820
problems you know it's a blessing but

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:31.000
also a curse is a blessing because I

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:32.830
mean let me we live in a world at least

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.660
in North America of like considerable

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:37.510
abundance a lot of the time not

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:39.610
everybody of course but Elon Musk the

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:41.440
other day posted a concept video which I

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:45.640
think there's a lot to make fun of here

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:47.650
but he's also like incredibly ambitious

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:50.170
and ten times smarter than I'll ever be

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:51.760
uh where it was like hey now boarding

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:53.320
New York to Shanghai and you're like oh

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:55.060
cool did they invent some kind of plane

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:58.810
that's gonna be very fast no you know

00:22:55.060 --> 00:23:01.540
what they did my dude it's thinking not

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:04.120
saying he's gonna but the concept art at

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:06.220
least this exists thinking about sending

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:09.450
people up in one of those SpaceX rockets

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:12.340
from New York to Shanghai there is

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:14.230
without the human brain nobody's doing

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:16.660
that we go what are you gonna do today I

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:18.430
was thinking I would eat a balanced mix

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:21.340
of carbs proteins and fats and then

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:23.110
maybe watch some art nah son what are

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:25.990
you gonna do today I'm gonna solve an

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:27.550
incredible problem maybe send human

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:29.170
beings up in a rocket ship that hasn't

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:31.630
even been invented yet that can then

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:35.440
land on a you know mobile aquatic

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:37.180
platform also Elon I gotta ask dude are

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:40.330
these people not gonna be experiencing

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:40.930
like 80 G's during takeoff this is Ivan

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:43.090
I missed

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:44.800
you're a smart dude it's one of the

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:46.690
questions I imagine that you've asked

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:48.550
yourself many times what do you do you

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:49.990
can you build a cabin

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:55.810
Cillian enough the things gonna go like

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:58.360
a higher than the ISS gives us our

00:23:55.810 --> 00:24:04.320
ambition but also our discontent unless

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:04.320
I think so we don't need to do boss rush

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:08.110
what we do we don't need to do it right

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:10.240
now

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:13.570
but I'm gonna because you got a pretty

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:15.940
good run here sprinkler helps out but to

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:19.860
be honestly I love the sprinkler with

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:22.380
the void that's like the big draw here

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:24.970
it's almost like having a big read mode

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:26.860
wow that was horrible and we're probably

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:28.960
gonna take a bunch of damage as a result

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:31.630
of this I also don't know if we actually

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:33.430
can finish the negative path while

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:35.680
simultaneously doing the mega satan

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:37.000
fight but we'll try to do both because

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:40.240
if we could knock them both out it would

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:44.310
be quite nice for us okay so you were

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:44.310
just invisible for a hundred years

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:52.000
don't forget there could be a black

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:53.500
market there I know what you're thinking

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.150
you're like NL you're accidentally gonna

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.560
go down to another floor no I knocked

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:58.390
that out of my system earlier on the

00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:01.330
caves one remember that was the worst

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:02.320
damage you can't go over this you can't

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:08.860
go over there gonna you're gonna hit a

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:12.340
wall dude so some of the shots from

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:14.740
sprinkler are indeed getting holy light

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:16.780
that's really the I don't wanna say

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:19.690
endgame but that's the ideal situation

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:21.790
for us is that we get these holy light

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:24.190
shots occasionally from sprinkler to hit

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:28.990
enemies and if they do amazing you know

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:31.710
that justifies like 20 misses I think we

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:31.710
had one there too

00:25:32.629 --> 00:25:36.690
haven't been playing particularly well

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:44.279
on this boss fight but you know wherever

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:45.480
we go there we are we get a range up

00:25:44.279 --> 00:25:47.549
greatly I feel like we should not be

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:53.009
hidden enemies from this far away oh you

00:25:47.549 --> 00:25:56.340
stand like literally no chance the

00:25:53.009 --> 00:25:57.899
sprinkler array is actually working we

00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:00.090
could we could use a higher rate of fire

00:25:57.899 --> 00:26:01.440
I don't want it I want to always be that

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:04.320
guy I think we did get it tears up in

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:05.820
the boss rush bedlam there but but still

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:07.289
eight rate of fire is not good

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:09.059
hey locust of conquest unlocked

00:26:07.289 --> 00:26:09.809
Harlequin baby is no good but we don't

00:26:09.059 --> 00:26:14.730
have a choice

00:26:09.809 --> 00:26:16.590
yep go peep this let's book a rep right

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:20.549
right right right right we saw it

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:21.870
earlier so we lost the ability to even

00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:24.049
take Harlequin baby that's something I

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:26.990
learned a long time ago but forgot about

00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:30.269
unfortunately in the moment right there

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:33.330
still very little to worry about but the

00:26:30.269 --> 00:26:37.320
map uh we probably could do the hut of

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:41.970
the hush fight and we do need to I don't

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:47.070
I might save that one for a future a

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:48.659
future Ryan because as I was looking for

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:50.970
a way out of that situation I did not

00:26:48.659 --> 00:26:52.889
see it it's just a little too much to

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:53.909
accomplish on one run plus like we don't

00:26:52.889 --> 00:26:55.769
have very much money

00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:58.350
I'm not leaving that scent behind

00:26:55.769 --> 00:27:00.389
because of the you know because it fits

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:03.149
my agenda there it's more I don't want

00:27:00.389 --> 00:27:05.879
to risk possibly hitting the red hard to

00:27:03.149 --> 00:27:07.649
pick up a single penny which is probably

00:27:05.879 --> 00:27:10.110
why I'm not in the upper tier of Isaac

00:27:07.649 --> 00:27:12.809
players and rest firmly in like the a -

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:15.870
tier despite playing you know almost as

00:27:12.809 --> 00:27:19.700
much as anybody else outside of the you

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:19.700
know a few node where the outliers

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:27.630
good good good spirits would have been

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:29.860
better but that's also okay

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:32.730
well yeah you know it saves something

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:35.380
for a future run because the mega satan

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:37.900
there's like an order of magnitude more

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:39.820
difficulty getting a mega satan victory

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:41.320
versus getting a hush victory not

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:43.300
because mega satan is harder but because

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:46.300
it's harder to will it into existence so

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:48.610
i think if we focus on getting negative

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:50.290
mega satan taken care of that's good

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:53.920
enough I know we have Steam sale I know

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:55.180
we have restock things could change you

00:27:53.920 --> 00:28:02.980
know we got guaranteed deals with the

00:27:55.180 --> 00:28:08.890
devil and we know how to use them on

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:12.010
occasion you got guaranteed deals no how

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:13.420
do you use them on occasion so this will

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:14.950
probably ruin the sprinkler but we

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:19.480
haven't had moms knife in forever and

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:22.120
the damage output is real gone still

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:25.090
might not do the hush fight it's not

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:28.930
like I have round table in 17 minutes or

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:30.520
anything if I were the boss fight

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:34.980
nanananana

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:39.580
I need me open oh no no no no dude

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:43.510
didn't drops my Sylvester Stallone sings

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:46.960
Rafi and so we're gonna vine one thing's

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:52.980
for sure I would love you Adrian no no

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:52.980
no no see the joke writes itself

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:59.620
banana phone Adrian

00:28:57.430 --> 00:29:01.750
ring ring ring ring ring ring ring

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:05.980
banana phone

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:09.790
Adrian I've got my hunches Adrian

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:12.040
they're the bunches it's the best beats

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:14.830
the rest but not me cellular modular

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:15.309
interactive aaj alert Adrian ring ring

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:18.279
ring

00:29:15.309 --> 00:29:23.350
this is actually like dude this bit

00:29:18.279 --> 00:29:25.210
would have killed in the 1970s now is no

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:28.210
good you know we expect something a

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:31.179
little bit more cerebral and said just

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:38.740
seems like the a man casting out the

00:29:31.179 --> 00:29:44.950
psychological shackles of sanity see the

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:46.629
joke is he says Adrian oh my god you're

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:50.529
giving me too many options here I'm not

00:29:46.629 --> 00:29:53.100
gonna fight hush not gonna fight hush

00:29:50.529 --> 00:29:55.450
it's not the right run we don't get em

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:57.190
we don't get much from going down it's

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:59.049
just poke as you get along you've got

00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:07.720
not a lot of HP in a long life ahead of

00:29:59.049 --> 00:30:11.110
you I almost did it straight up oh yeah

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:13.869
we can't even get a shovel payouts down

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:20.019
here it's really it's an HP related

00:30:13.869 --> 00:30:22.360
concern at this point now the damage is

00:30:20.019 --> 00:30:25.529
out of control we should basically crap

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:28.539
on pretty much any enemy we come across

00:30:25.529 --> 00:30:30.730
including bosses as long as we don't

00:30:28.539 --> 00:30:32.440
miss with that first knife shot but

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:34.090
we're not you know yeah I hesitate to

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.470
say this cuz it's gonna you take it out

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:36.610
of context a little bit and you know

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:39.039
look at the stats

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:41.529
we're not that strong we're very very

00:30:39.039 --> 00:30:42.999
powerful we're not that strong you know

00:30:41.529 --> 00:30:46.210
we can only get hit a few times before

00:30:42.999 --> 00:30:49.779
it would have a sincere and immediate

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:53.470
impact on the run especially considering

00:30:49.779 --> 00:30:54.460
all the all the enemies left to face but

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:57.450
they I mean we're getting like speed

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:57.450
running here towards the end

00:31:01.979 --> 00:31:10.149
okay maybe we had already done that

00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:11.950
I don't think so though so the idea is

00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:17.169
and I could be mistaken here but the

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:19.179
idea right now is we fight the lamb and

00:31:17.169 --> 00:31:22.359
I hope after fighting and killing the

00:31:19.179 --> 00:31:23.739
lamb that we gain whatever you get you

00:31:22.359 --> 00:31:27.879
get the post-it note basically there's

00:31:23.739 --> 00:31:32.499
no need to belabor the point get out of

00:31:27.879 --> 00:31:34.389
here if we do then we can fight mega

00:31:32.499 --> 00:31:35.889
Satan if we don't we'll still fight mega

00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:42.309
Satan I'll just be a little bit more

00:31:35.889 --> 00:31:44.320
annoyed by the situation it's an ideal

00:31:42.309 --> 00:31:46.059
run to accomplish as much as possible to

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:48.399
be honest we probably could have fit the

00:31:46.059 --> 00:31:50.049
hush fight in could have fitted the hush

00:31:48.399 --> 00:31:52.119
fighting but it's better this way I

00:31:50.049 --> 00:31:54.029
think just because if it had gone

00:31:52.119 --> 00:31:57.580
terribly wrong

00:31:54.029 --> 00:32:00.700
losing out on the extremely rare like

00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:03.549
get out of jail free dynamic mega Satan

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:05.859
appearance is not catastrophic but

00:32:03.549 --> 00:32:08.349
demoralizing I don't even remember what

00:32:05.859 --> 00:32:10.839
you get for it knocking this guy out

00:32:08.349 --> 00:32:14.489
anyway Demura

00:32:10.839 --> 00:32:21.190
lies at Etsy it's like a reference to

00:32:14.489 --> 00:32:29.909
second season of master of none this is

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:32.919
why I chose not a chill not to go to the

00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:34.960
hush fight just seemed like the

00:32:32.919 --> 00:32:37.749
potential for this level of disaster was

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:40.859
high we might even die to mega Satan but

00:32:37.749 --> 00:32:46.019
the damage is such that we shouldn't

00:32:40.859 --> 00:32:46.019
does depend a little bit on Oh No

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:52.190
whether or not we take damage here I

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:53.450
think no explosives please okay maybe we

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:59.080
should be hoping for the explosives that

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:59.080
was actually relatively easy to dodge

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:06.220
these

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:09.220
you ain't no Isaac dude I can dodge

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:17.260
those shots all day oh not that one

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:19.510
apparently she got me homing shots

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:21.760
that's a bummer I'm trying to shoot

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:22.860
diagonally oh it worked but I missed the

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:29.920
hitbox somehow

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:33.130
okay just kill the lamb No

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:42.010
did we get the posted note we don't oh

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:44.730
you got a try dude you got a try don't

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:49.480
get it don't get it don't get it

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:52.570
don't get hit algae's algae's a Waze

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:58.030
should do nothing the guys that's the

00:33:52.570 --> 00:34:04.600
one okay so what do you do to get out of

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:06.220
jail free you'll walk back to the spawn

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:08.320
room you use get out of jail free you

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:10.480
walk back to where the algae's is you

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:14.800
carry that into the boss fight and you

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:16.510
use it against Magus Aiden when he uses

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:20.050
the most attacks that are nearly on

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:21.340
dodge able hopefully we can still go

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:27.730
back in there if we can I'm gonna be

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:29.889
real cheesed I'm just gonna be in

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:31.870
defensively ornery about the whole

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:33.780
situation but I think we're gonna get

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:36.129
that mega Satan payout I am a little

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:37.360
little rattled by the fact that it

00:34:36.129 --> 00:34:40.600
doesn't look like we'll get the Lamb

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:42.879
payout but you know what it was an easy

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:44.950
fight and we had to check to take off as

00:34:42.879 --> 00:34:46.600
many posted notes not to speed up as

00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:48.879
much as possible but just to be you know

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:50.500
fun it's just fun to knock out as many

00:34:48.879 --> 00:34:52.240
of those as conceivably we can right off

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:54.220
the bat so the idea I think is that we

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:56.169
probably wait to pop algae's until the

00:34:54.220 --> 00:35:00.540
second phase or rather wait to pop

00:34:56.169 --> 00:35:00.540
algae's until we get hit once just so we

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:08.930
maximize the likelihood of our survival

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:15.590
okay that's just horrible it should not

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:16.970
have happened that early all I can't

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:22.340
even hit him by standing there that's a

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:23.630
bummer should pop sprinkler down we're

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:25.010
gonna have to fight mega Satan without

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:28.040
getting hit so we might actually end up

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:31.400
accomplishing nothing if it all goes

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:34.090
crashing down no you don't understand

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.090
you got to go

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:41.340
algae's is over it is shooting knives I

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.260
actually thought it would just do

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:45.660
nothing or rather maybe just have like a

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:47.130
little knife that pokes out or something

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:52.410
the fact that it shoots the knives is

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:54.240
actually fairly strong who was the most

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:59.310
likely to hit us probably the the wave

00:35:54.240 --> 00:36:02.220
that we got hit on but this is also not

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:05.070
easy this wave with like the fires and

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:12.180
you know the weird bouncing shots and

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:14.900
the etceteras and the what force yeah

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.900
this is what I mean

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:23.850
we have done it I mean we got hate once

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:28.650
so I'm a little bummed out but dude no

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:29.570
owner not today not on 0 okay we got

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:32.730
locusts to death

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:34.410
we got Mort baby which is a co-op thing

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:35.430
