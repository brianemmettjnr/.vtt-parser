##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.020
everybody a welcoming dinner the lion

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.670
plays The Binding of Isaac after birth

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.780
plus we're working our way through the

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.240
challenges uh you thanks to you you you

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.650
not you have a heart I don't even

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.660
remember have a heart will probably

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:21.090
finish the read challenges and then move

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.310
on to doing a couple of random runs just

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.769
to again palate cleanse a little bit so

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.199
have a heart starts you with one heart

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.470
and many empty containers which is very

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.750
bad because we cannot grab spirit hearts

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.420
despite getting Book of Revelations is

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.570
our first item here so just don't shoot

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.010
a bomb at me please thank you we do have

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.510
charm of the vampires so basically we

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.550
just need to kill some enemies and after

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.129
we kill some enemies we'll probably be

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.449
pretty safe here I mean it's not a very

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.699
high power start to a run starting with

00:00:51.449 --> 00:01:00.750
charm of the vampire is worth slightly

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:04.110
more than zero but I would just like to

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.990
see like a single little heart drop

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.840
crazy little hood red drop let's try it

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.510
again crazy little red hog drop I took

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.830
it a good a good two critical to coudn't

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:21.020
this thing called hearts I just don't

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:24.420
start with it this thing count hearts

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:29.280
various other words would go here so get

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.049
ready crazy little placeholder song we

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.380
actually did get some HP back in the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.810
middle there so um oh dude this would be

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.130
an ideal black market because we could

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.979
give up all these heart containers we're

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.710
never gonna use anyway but I digress cuz

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.729
apparently no longer relevant uh we have

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.979
nine cents we can buy red hearts really

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.500
this seems like one where we want to get

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.090
a deal with the devil though get a deal

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.259
with the devil trade HP then all of a

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.270
sudden all of a sudden Book of

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.000
Revelations can actually work we might

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.030
as well use Book of Revelations and the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.719
idea is that we'll fight a boss that

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.770
gives us a guaranteed cube of meats

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.789
obviously the spirit heart is not worth

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.370
quite as much as I would like but

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.480
that worked and I'm kind of amazed I

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.859
don't think there's any other way we

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.750
could make this happen we need like a

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:24.549
nun converter like the reverter from the

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.400
shop which is an item that doesn't exist

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.810
but you know I got you thinking either

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.040
way we're just gonna move along as long

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.239
as we can keep our red heart side

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.670
there's pretty much no chance to lose

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:37.389
this run I'll spend two keys going to

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.859
this room why not I want that and then

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:41.200
we'll reroll the rest cuz we can't use

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:42.639
them and oddly enough one of the few

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.799
times I'm gonna be happy to re-roll a

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:50.769
spirit heart into a single penny this GU

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.659
poon you look I don't really have any

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.370
particular reverence for the song crazy

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:59.400
little thing called love I think it's a

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:03.189
bad song in particular not my favorite

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:07.389
see what we got in here Wooden Nickel

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:10.870
and The MITRE there's something like

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:12.730
uniquely hilarious about this because we

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.260
can't actually use spirit arts but we

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.959
can use red hearts but I took it anyway

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:21.010
so I get who's laughing now I would like

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:23.379
a better spacebar item please well for

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.790
two cents I could buy five cents wait

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.019
for five cents I could buy two cents I

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.269
had a backwards I don't think we want to

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.579
do that let's try the card it's hanging

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.049
to man and apart from that we'll just

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.489
move along so I guess we can't buy red

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.919
hearts from the shop earlier in this run

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.090
you may remember I erroneously said I'll

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:42.370
just buy some spirit hearts from the

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:44.470
shop know I pressed hanged man to try to

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.459
get out of that bucket of syrup as

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.739
quickly as possible

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:53.739
no such luck dude although it might be a

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:57.340
little bit on the not that not as zany

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:59.590
side for y'all I am thinking that I'll

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.329
probably never use Book of Revelations

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.459
again unless we can get spirit hearts

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:06.129
out of it and the reason for that is

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.359
quite simply one Cuba meat is kind of

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.919
like the optimum amount

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.889
what do you factor in the opportunity

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:13.629
cost of what we would what we would have

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:15.819
to spend to get more cubes of me which

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:18.700
is missing whatever our other bosses are

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.320
gonna give us the worst upgrade is level

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.169
one now there goes our deal with that

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.389
chance mostly the worst upgrade is level

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.400
one

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.020
level two you know we could have gotten

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.840
to tears upgrade we could have gotten a

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:33.020
damage upgrade instead instead we turn

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.499
our familiar into our sorry our orbital

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:41.960
into something that shoots a little bit

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:47.150
not valuable like in the least well this

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:48.650
is very scary didn't really want to go

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.509
to the other double key room I just

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.210
figured I'd spent enough keys on this

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:59.289
run just give me like HP at before is

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:59.289
good we might actually die on this one

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.949
has me a little bit surprised mind you

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:08.509
it might be like this super wrong run to

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:14.650
try to be using an orbital to deal

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:17.169
damage rarely does that stop me though

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:24.219
just need to get a little bit of HP back

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:27.289
nothing now we'll say on a run like this

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:29.389
might be tempted to get a third or

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:31.550
fourth level cube of meat which requires

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:33.669
by necessity us going through level two

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.819
unfortunately

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:39.259
why would I appreciate that well because

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:41.180
we wouldn't have to walk into enemies to

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:45.469
kill them and if it triggers lifesteal

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.389
even better there we go so I think that

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:48.740
there's more of a gimmick to this run

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:55.039
than I originally thought you don't just

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:57.139
start with no HP no HP drops you have to

00:05:55.039 --> 00:06:00.979
get all of your HP buy a life steal or

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:04.159
by HP upgrades I suppose would also be

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:06.379
functional this could be a little bit on

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:08.180
the trickier side what we should be

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:10.099
shooting for then is an opportunity to

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:14.240
like deal as much damage as possible

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:15.889
like hey it is in a way here's the like

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.810
the ultimate thing that kind of sucks

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:20.810
about almost all these challenges in the

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:24.110
end most of the challenge strategies

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:26.240
boiled down to get a good rhyme like I

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.860
don't want to pull back the veil but

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.750
that's pretty much how Isaac works I

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.159
don't think it's emblematic of Isaac

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.750
being a bad game at all

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:36.460
I think it's just oh dude it'll totally

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:39.080
take restock I think it's more just like

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:42.199
sure justice could have been HP I

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.680
thought but apparently not um let's try

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:44.629
it again

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:49.069
son card that's more along the lines of

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:52.189
what we're looking for I think it's more

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:54.289
just that challenges for all the

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:56.029
gimmicks the gimmicks represent kind of

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:58.879
like a novel starting position

00:06:56.029 --> 00:07:00.439
however in Isaac if you get a great run

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:01.879
like if you get a high damage in

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:04.729
particular you're probably gonna ball

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:06.680
out right so no challenge can really

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:13.789
stop that the son card there was ten out

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:16.189
of ten that was an ideal pickup take two

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:17.990
and call me in the morning now all I

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:22.939
want to do is stay like as far away from

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:24.680
this guy as Earth will allow me to our

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:26.349
speed is pretty good so I'm less worried

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.639
about that than I would otherwise be

00:07:26.349 --> 00:07:29.960
just lay in the shot get your

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:32.839
hundred-percent deal with the devil and

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:35.360
then like oh dude he might just give me

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:38.749
pennies but still little Chad this could

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:44.060
still be good don't give up hope all

00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:45.800
right it's stunk hugely that's okay

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.839
I really think I mean it goes to mom's

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.509
heart so on the womb we might start to

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:55.250
have some issues here in terms of our

00:07:50.509 --> 00:08:01.729
amount of HP but the son card is gonna

00:07:55.250 --> 00:08:04.310
buy us an awful lot of time The MITRE is

00:08:01.729 --> 00:08:06.469
making me laugh here maybe the deals

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:09.439
with the devil are designed to not give

00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:12.080
you I mean it's it's pretty rich to just

00:08:09.439 --> 00:08:17.120
go on one sample size but maybe they're

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:18.379
designed to not give you red hard deals

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.629
cuz that would make things maybe a

00:08:18.379 --> 00:08:22.159
little too easy I'm fine with red chess

00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:24.139
deals I just like you know one of them

00:08:22.159 --> 00:08:26.509
to have Guppies head in it that's pretty

00:08:24.139 --> 00:08:28.819
much the optimum outcome for us there

00:08:26.509 --> 00:08:32.180
we've already sort of compromised our

00:08:28.819 --> 00:08:36.370
deal with the devil chance here so I

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:36.370
think he's paying out with with money

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:44.550
which means we're pretty much completely

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:46.800
incapable of turning that into HP

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:50.910
because the shop no longer has any red

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:53.190
hearts but okay there's a big get for us

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:57.000
djaro flies is actually like 10 out of

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:59.970
10 I think we're gonna be fine I mean

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.130
this again there's like six challenges I

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.630
even remember the name of and some of

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.490
them might be like onl you think you've

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.880
got early onset dementia or something

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:09.510
like that

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:12.300
I feel relatively confident in the

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:14.730
health of my brain mental health I'm

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:18.420
like 75 percent confident I think I got

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:20.250
an okay kind of like what's the word I'm

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.770
looking for Constitution I think I got

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.540
our okay Constitution but in terms of

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.800
like the actual biological health of my

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.350
brain I think it's holding it together

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.640
for the most part sometimes people say

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.830
like NL how can you not remember that

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.270
that happened yesterday my dude you see

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:36.990
how many videos go up on this channel on

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:39.120
a daily basis it's absurd I don't

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.950
remember you know what I said in an

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.720
Isaac video yesterday most of the time

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:44.850
unless the Isaac video that went up

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.380
yesterday was recorded like two minutes

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.720
before the one that went up just now you

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:50.220
know I got I'm keeping a lot of

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.110
information in the brain here not least

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.580
of which is like oh how do you you know

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:54.960
when you use a weak pointer versus a

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.940
shared pointer and you're like I don't

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.460
know the correct answer is just use C

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:04.440
sharp instead anyway

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:06.810
we got two keys it's pop them in here we

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.980
should do this close to the bomb that we

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.690
can get there but I just don't care

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:12.630
about that head of the keepers fine

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:13.860
guppies head is awesome and bomb bag is

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:17.250
great as well but honestly I think I'm

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:21.090
gonna stick with jar of flies no I

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:24.300
wouldn't that sleep in this jar it flies

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:26.490
so toss me yeah that's a reference to

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:30.510
the song that comes on after bent on

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:34.140
matchbox twenty's 2001 album that I've

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:37.500
forgotten the name of kind of a deep cut

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:39.690
and honestly deep cut b-side reference

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.120
in this case does not imply good

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:44.050
reference

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:46.519
it's a fundamental error on my part um

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:50.470
so just blow these guys up this will

00:10:46.519 --> 00:10:50.470
probably take care of the riffraff know

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:56.449
they're all one hit away and we should

00:10:54.559 --> 00:10:57.889
kill the Flies and then DoubleTap the

00:10:56.449 --> 00:11:00.740
poop and that'll take care of the

00:10:57.889 --> 00:11:02.029
silkworms maybe I don't know maybe maybe

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.220
not doesn't really matter

00:11:02.029 --> 00:11:06.050
skinny odd mushroom you might think I'm

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.790
disappointed quite the opposite is ten

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:10.220
out of ten

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:11.930
allows us to fire faster now if we could

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.269
actually become guppy or at least get

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:16.879
the Mulligan it's kind of a big ass but

00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:18.920
if we could we can make that happen I

00:11:16.879 --> 00:11:20.089
would be stoked Jarrah flies still fine

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.249
you might think that it's kind of like

00:11:20.089 --> 00:11:24.230
compromises its existence there was like

00:11:22.249 --> 00:11:26.839
by Isaac standards there's a big debate

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:29.660
in the community way back in the day is

00:11:26.839 --> 00:11:32.600
like is skinny odd mushroom good or bad

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:35.360
I've come down like firmly on the side

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:41.540
of this is good technology to kind of

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:43.699
bad but but skinny odd mushroom double

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:45.079
our rate of fire have our damage more

00:11:43.699 --> 00:11:46.579
than double our rate of fire once we get

00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:49.120
at before a popping oh that's kind of

00:11:46.579 --> 00:11:51.589
like moving the goalposts I suppose

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:54.819
absolutely so we didn't get hit and I

00:11:51.589 --> 00:11:57.559
was hoping against hope that that would

00:11:54.819 --> 00:12:00.939
lead to us getting a deal with the devil

00:11:57.559 --> 00:12:05.300
that arguably we didn't really deserve

00:12:00.939 --> 00:12:08.209
that's okay this I think is actually a

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:10.670
deceptively hard challenge like I don't

00:12:08.209 --> 00:12:13.699
know how I fared on this one back in the

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:15.499
day was that a clandestine Michael

00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:19.249
Faraday reference no he's not even my

00:12:15.499 --> 00:12:21.889
favorite physicists we're talking andre

00:12:19.249 --> 00:12:23.360
on pair or bust dude of Maxwell's

00:12:21.889 --> 00:12:28.759
equations it is the longest and

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:30.199
strangest of all hook me up but I think

00:12:28.759 --> 00:12:31.519
there's a couple of cards that break the

00:12:30.199 --> 00:12:34.300
game the amperes isn't one of them but

00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:34.300
the Sun is

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:41.750
try to come back to this cursed room if

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:46.910
necessary or if we take damage like ever

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:48.110
and then that'll be that but yeah I

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:52.850
don't know how we fared on this one back

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:54.320
in the day but it's not super easy if we

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:57.650
didn't have that son card we would be in

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:59.390
a much much trickier spot now mind you

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:02.300
at this point we do have the son card so

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:04.190
it seems like we'll probably just waltz

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:09.410
our way to victory hopefully that does

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:11.420
end up being the case highly not worth

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:13.400
it unless we get a key back so we can go

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:15.920
to the shop but this is where you give

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.300
us an I don't even think nine lives is

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:22.640
something we should take unless it

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:24.350
guarantees guppy I don't think the

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:29.210
Empress card is worth it for this cost

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:31.160
either well yeah okay we're still moving

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:34.840
on here we just it would have been great

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:37.610
to get a black market on the on that

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:39.830
crawlspace we got earlier that would

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:41.180
have given us like probably the easiest

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:43.730
finish to this challenge I could imagine

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:45.830
if we got decent shop items traded our

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:47.720
HP away we're able to hold spirit hearts

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:49.490
the spirit arts would give us the

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.660
ability to almost certainly get a deal

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:53.060
with the devil those deals with the

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:54.710
devil presumably you know lead to us

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:56.780
being stacked right now we're still fine

00:13:54.710 --> 00:14:00.710
really it's it's amazing what one son

00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:02.030
card did for us on this run but if that

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:06.650
had been a black market instead of a

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:08.990
crawlspace we'd be like even better that

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:12.260
was way too much effort to get three

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:14.210
cents for a bomb as like a bad trade end

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:16.370
it was annoying to hook up in the first

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:19.880
place but I think we more or less have

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:21.620
this one under control not a quick one

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.690
though a one we want to be a little bit

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:26.620
more careful on and the other thing is

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:30.560
like you might still be a little bit

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:32.150
displeased about the fact that we gave

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.470
up on possibly getting a fourth level

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:35.960
meat boy here which would have been nice

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:38.030
as well but I don't know I'm kinda I

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.560
think it's a common opinion among people

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:41.660
who've played Isaac for a long long time

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:43.640
I kind of think Cuba meets overrated

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:45.709
like third level meat boy third level

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:47.480
Vantage girl and and fourth level as

00:14:45.709 --> 00:14:49.100
well not as good as you would originally

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.420
think I think

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.540
give me a health downgrade it would

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:55.670
actually be amazing speed down

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:57.770
irrelevant more or less lock up lovely

00:14:55.670 --> 00:15:02.920
but not strictly what we're looking for

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:02.920
so I think we're down to the depths -

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:15.410
this is our boss rush floor I could be

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:17.690
persuaded what I really want to see

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:19.750
though especially with restock is a key

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:23.810
and then a shop with no greed in it

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:25.370
because that could allow us to to work

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:27.830
our way over to hive minds

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:31.640
oh good just what we're looking for more

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:35.480
HP if we can get hive mind all of a

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:37.550
sudden like all of our run like the

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:41.570
whole everything of it is tied up a

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:44.000
little bit stronger BFF would also be

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:45.980
pretty swell but we'd like notice we're

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.470
not even talking about like our HP

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:49.430
anymore

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.930
mostly because we're actually able to

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:52.910
kill things relatively quickly now and

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:59.150
as a result we don't have to worry as

00:15:52.910 --> 00:16:00.440
much about you know if we lose one half

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:05.030
heart it could take us you know twelve

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:07.340
enemies to get it back kind of rocking

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:10.400
it right now we do still have an item

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:11.540
room to get to as well so I might have

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.700
actually skipped some now that I think

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:17.440
about it I maybe I do Everly onset

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.440
dementia I don't know probably not

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:23.790
I think it's you don't understand like

00:16:21.279 --> 00:16:26.140
multitasking it's harder than you think

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:27.640
everybody goes NL you missed this you

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:30.610
missed this you missed this I'm not

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:32.080
trying to act like I have an infallible

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:34.750
brain or anything like that but there's

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:37.209
a reason they tell you not to not to

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:39.100
text and drive you know it's a diverts

00:16:37.209 --> 00:16:40.300
your focus admittedly part of it is that

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.620
you're not looking at the road but part

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.180
of it is instead of thinking about oh

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.320
well there's this weirdo on the other

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.760
Lane what are they trying to do they

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.110
might come over into my lane so I got a

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.850
set up like this bla bla bla and you

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:51.880
know drive a little defensively you're

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:53.709
like um she texted me a winking emoji

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.910
with an eggplant after it what does that

00:16:53.709 --> 00:16:56.470
mean I got to go to urban dictionary

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:58.690
look it up see what that means in

00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:03.490
today's day and age right it diverts

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:05.110
your focus it distracts you for some

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:07.199
people at least I also think sometimes

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:09.579
when I'm recording I'm more focused

00:17:07.199 --> 00:17:11.829
because I have like I have skin in the

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:12.939
game you know what I mean maybe not

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:14.679
because it's a weird expression to use

00:17:12.939 --> 00:17:16.059
there what I mean by that is you know

00:17:14.679 --> 00:17:18.490
that people are gonna be watching the

00:17:16.059 --> 00:17:20.020
content so at some point that they're

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:21.459
gonna judge it be like I know why'd you

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:24.990
take damage on this room I mean I sure

00:17:21.459 --> 00:17:24.990
hope someone got fired for that gaffe

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:30.760
sometimes it's you know little the finer

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:32.230
points started to slip up like

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.030
forgetting to go to the item room

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:36.429
particularly on challenge runs cuz not

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:40.320
all or even most of the challenge runs

00:17:36.429 --> 00:17:43.120
even have item rooms so it's sort of a

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:44.650
variable to begin with so we are second

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:47.710
a lot of HP here

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:53.940
I can't necessarily recommend that you

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:53.940
do this for yourself but I'm gonna try

00:17:55.350 --> 00:18:00.250
speed ups I can see forever well at

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:06.309
least we can get out for free that gives

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:07.540
us some more plays here experimental

00:18:06.309 --> 00:18:10.900
treatment

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:13.480
damage down luck up speed down that's a

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:15.460
bad draw on experimental treatment

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:20.500
I think everyone's probably well aware

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:22.750
of that fact not bad enough to be scary

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:26.710
and it did take us to the point where

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:29.230
we're one away from spun but bad enough

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:30.760
to be at least mildly annoying we should

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:33.400
actually I still think the best use of

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:35.650
our bombs they're good bombs Brandt but

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:38.440
we could use them to oh it's tears

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:41.560
upgrade I think we don't need that as

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:43.210
much as we need I mean that could work

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.040
oh there you go as much as we need to

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:46.960
get spun basically which gave us a three

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:50.440
damage upgrade and a speed upgrade and

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:53.340
then tell appeals we're still looking

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:55.480
for the shop though knock that out and

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:57.250
you know maybe Telep Hills is like a

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.960
blessing in disguise will get another

00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:01.330
tell appeals use that to teleport out of

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.220
boss rush with two guppy items how do we

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:04.540
get to guppy items out of one boss rush

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:07.660
I don't know there's gonna have to be

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:08.740
like a diplopia involved at some point I

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:11.170
haven't really thought that far ahead

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:18.280
but like Bank it cuz it's definitely

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:22.180
happening we got our long-lost Empress

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:23.740
card back as well now I know I've said

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.300
this like six times over the course of

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:27.970
this episode but this one should be in

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:30.460
the books now look at how many syringes

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:32.830
we got sticking out of our arms that's

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:36.030
collateral damage baby you really leave

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:36.030
it all on the line in this business

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:47.200
stay away thank you alright

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:48.940
good use of a bomb sure why not why not

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.770
take an item that is one of the few

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:52.780
items that could completely ruin my

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:54.940
chances of success pay to play is not

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:55.890
worth much would I rather pay to play or

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.780
a reroll

00:19:55.890 --> 00:20:00.580
like the reroll from pay to play is one

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.840
item in seven cents we got three cents

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.990
to work for everything so that's good

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.370
I don't think car battery does it for us

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:07.570
mom's purse I don't think is worth the

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:10.030
squeeze here

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:12.670
mom's key is a little late to be useful

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:16.300
I think a box of friends is not good

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:18.490
enough champion belt is blank card

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:19.690
Empress not to be honest with you I do

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:23.139
like blank card

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:24.820
but I kind of prefer Jarrah flies right

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:28.750
now devil card now we just worked

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:32.860
towards maybe getting a Sun card tell

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:35.169
you what let's use our moon card kill

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:38.379
mom take an item from boss rush moon

00:20:35.169 --> 00:20:40.269
card out grab the emperor card use it on

00:20:38.379 --> 00:20:42.159
the first floor give ourselves a chance

00:20:40.269 --> 00:20:43.720
to deal with it like I see the whole run

00:20:42.159 --> 00:20:45.340
laid out in front of me right now we do

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.960
have a chance and not a terrible chance

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:49.570
of the deal with the devil here as long

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:51.879
as we don't get hit against mom highly

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:54.039
questionable oh okay I hit myself

00:20:51.879 --> 00:20:55.480
despite I backed up and then I was like

00:20:54.039 --> 00:20:58.779
wait I gotta get closer to actually lay

00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:01.480
in this shot turns out joke's on me what

00:20:58.779 --> 00:21:02.860
is under what is that red that's buddy

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.169
in a box right now it's like a weird

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.669
Tetris block or something no no thank

00:21:05.169 --> 00:21:08.919
you no thank you

00:21:06.669 --> 00:21:10.929
that time will come we're gonna do our

00:21:08.919 --> 00:21:15.370
fair share of delirium runs no question

00:21:10.929 --> 00:21:16.539
so these are kind of garbage items I'm

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:18.909
gonna take rainbow baby because it's

00:21:16.539 --> 00:21:26.470
free but sure wait wait what is also

00:21:18.909 --> 00:21:28.350
okay here so we're trying to get I mean

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:32.429
a son card would be ten out of ten an

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:32.429
emperor car is like an AIDS

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:44.390
judgment let's pop it I was kind of

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:52.460
hoping for demon judgment that might be

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:56.120
a stupid ask but you can tell what's

00:21:52.460 --> 00:22:00.950
coming there mmm and that's it so I'll

00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:02.600
start by blowing up you don't really

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:11.860
want to give you money I'd rather go for

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:15.410
another card well sorry to do this

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:22.420
matchstick we just want the emperor card

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:29.000
no not the Empress 5hp

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:32.810
doesn't make me the happiest boy at 6 hp

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:38.090
by the way common it's a classic

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:39.620
northernlion problem try for a second

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:42.140
secret room that I guess if it had red

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:46.040
hearts would actually be full of single

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:49.700
pennies if that were the case no all

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:52.670
right let's uh let's escape then I think

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:54.080
it is important that we use the emperor

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:55.550
card right away because it gives us this

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.380
deal with the devil chance if we don't

00:22:55.550 --> 00:23:00.800
get hit which is I mean questionable but

00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:03.380
is there anything I only really want to

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:04.910
use the emperor card to get through

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:06.590
rooms that are too annoying to do

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:12.560
normally because we could get drops or

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:14.870
HP back in the interim period so I'm

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:20.930
like definitely not gonna do a big room

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:22.160
I could hit myself it is valid we're at

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:23.900
this point maybe we should just go for

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.720
an era no I hate that room

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:30.680
easiest decision of my life okay lose

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:34.040
Bob's brain and then pop jar of flies

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:36.850
and then let jar of flies do like all of

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:43.500
your dirty work for you

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:43.500
Oh and Epiphone is killing it

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.450
greatest shot in my life we got a deal

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:53.550
with the angel we also got pentagram

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:55.950
which is very good loud pretty good

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:57.150
apparently and we get Holy Light which

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:59.700
is great

00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:02.820
let's fight the angel statue for

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:04.980
effectively no reason but a Holy Light

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:08.310
at before ax and a really strong rate of

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:09.720
fire to begin with is great is that

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:13.320
panic power the more you get hit the

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:16.110
more damage you do over the course of a

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:17.430
floor though wait what is exactly the

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:19.080
same as bloody lust if that's the case

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:21.420
so I'm assuming that I mean correct here

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:24.240
all right we got five-and-a-half HP we

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:25.470
still lost HP on that floor probably

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:29.820
because we fought a boss we had no

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:32.640
reason to fight fair enough a demon

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:34.650
judgment is still we should just kill it

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:39.500
like there's no reason for us to fight

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:39.500
it and we should never use our orbital

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:44.220
our tears are potent you know we're

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:46.320
gonna have a way above average rate of

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:49.050
fire with like probably average damage

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:52.260
and a great tear effect a Holy Light

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:56.250
Plus great rate of fire is like it's up

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:58.920
there so just coast this one to the

00:24:56.250 --> 00:25:01.260
finish nice length of a challenge and

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:04.830
and a fun one nonetheless I got to talk

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:08.870
about the health of my brain my favorite

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:16.440
Backstreet Boys song show you the health

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:18.480
of my brain I think this is the kind of

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:20.010
challenge that it does depend like your

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:22.650
ability to beat it to some extent

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:24.570
depends on the quality or the kind of

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:25.800
run you get cuz all runs obviously

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:28.830
depend on the quality of the items you

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:32.610
get but like if you had a super glass

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:34.310
cannon like no lifesteal ever no ability

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:38.540
to kill enemies I guess to activate

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:38.540
charm of the vampire you're done

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:46.000
and things like bloody penny are not

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:48.640
gonna do it for you but we just got like

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.830
a nice little menagerie of items that

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.570
manage to have make this happen and did

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:55.900
you call it a menagerie just to use the

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:58.170
word menagerie yes I did I think it's a

00:25:55.900 --> 00:26:00.910
great word

00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:05.070
it's no secret many of the best words in

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:07.780
English are actually just French but I

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:13.990
don't even know how to use menagerie in

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:16.740
like a context that's that uses the

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:18.790
original definition of the word like I

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:22.390
can't believe it's not butter

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:27.760
that's right it's margarine menagerie

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:29.050
that's it's not really a good joke

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:32.440
honestly in the whole scheme of things

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:33.820
but and we never lost any hard

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.770
containers over the course of this run

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:37.300
which is not bragging I mean we took

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:38.860
damage we just never lost any heart

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:41.050
containers which would have been very

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:42.190
nice you know we would have had spirit

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:43.090
hearts that could have given us deals

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:45.310
with the devil this is the

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:48.600
quintessential example of like too much

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:48.600
of a good thing can be a bad thing

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:54.940
we're out I never want to see this one

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:57.220
again what do we get for it two new

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:58.690
pills oh that's right we're in the pill
