##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.069
everybody welcome accident land please

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.870
mining lies again - redd+ where we sort

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.420
of won the last run but it was a little

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.920
dicey and we didn't lose on routes as

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.769
well we're starting with a D 100 in

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.599
chocolate milk good speed good damage

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.550
and actually our rate of fire is

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.230
terrible but it's only terrible because

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.750
we have chocolate milk so I think 15

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.220
rate of fire with chocolate milk might

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.869
actually be like 9 out of 10 quality you

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.000
know what we owe it to ourselves to have

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.380
a Zayn run we haven't had a lot of

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.090
there's been like two things that have

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.670
not shown up recently one has been full

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.809
run rerolls when the other one has been

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.329
guppy transformations for whatever

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.520
reason these two things used to be like

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.680
a once every 2 or 3 run sort of thing

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.899
and now they're just you know gone to

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.820
the ether wow I'm an idiot ok see what I

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.680
was trying to do there was use a bomb to

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.360
make some inroads into blowing up other

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.949
rocks while also getting a bomb out of

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.840
it but I must have been off by like a

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.070
little bit so usually when I start the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.769
d1 I I try to go like one floor between

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.810
rerolls just to pace myself otherwise

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.770
you can you know by the end of the game

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.619
there's 40 freakin alternative floors in

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.080
this gosh-darn game right now so you can

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.299
accidentally end up breakfasting

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.060
yourself pretty easily I should have had

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:25.530
that on lockdown love lockdown or

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.750
otherwise we also might want to save it

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.150
for a good opportunities to actually get

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.560
value out of the d6 part of the d20 part

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.540
of the reroll like that other room back

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.740
there as a bunch of consumables on the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.659
ground for example but right now all

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.100
we're rolling in chocolate milk so I

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.960
wouldn't necessarily recommend this as a

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.840
great idea

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:49.200
yeah I mean I'm not sore about it I mean

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.020
we did fine very recently we've had

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.299
fairly good performances get the item

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.729
room animal reroll fairly good

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.380
performances but the gummy

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.079
transformation for whatever reason just

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.460
has not been showing up as often and

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.820
it's not like that's the difference

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.380
between winning a loss it's more the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.390
difference between me feeling like this

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.030
runs a 10 out of 10 and it's runs an 11

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.260
out of 10 this run by the way absent the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.360
d100 which

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.819
will almost always give us a win anyway

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:23.760
unless it completely screws us it is

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:25.379
pretty much up there as well but the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.180
rate of fire plus chocolate milk plus

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.370
decent damage right off the bed is super

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.650
good

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.170
not quite arcade level all vials die I

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.480
don't know though this is a tough choice

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.250
I'm just gonna pick it up let's go for

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.250
it it's a tough choice

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:57.410
so curved warned huh

00:02:47.900 --> 00:03:04.280
what so mostly cracked crown is tears up

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:09.569
so we get to damage up with with the

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:12.660
digital curved horn but we get three

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:18.660
tiers down this is still very much worth

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:20.549
it still no access here that's fine

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.099
though uh yeah so I mean that was

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.040
actually a pretty definitive sort of

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:30.630
situation I think cracked crown is

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:33.180
probably worse than a curved horn the

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.690
exception might be if you really really

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.819
need tiers for some reason but I mean

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.660
they're both very good there's no doubt

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:44.940
about it maybe both in the top three

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.859
trinkets I think you got to put curved

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.650
horn on there I would probably put a

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.970
cracked crown and cancer maybe on the

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.410
same level but then you've also got to

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.489
consider the dark princess crowd with a

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.379
bloody crown or whatever the heck that

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.609
the trinket version of dark Prince's

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:04.260
crown is called that gives you item

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:06.150
rooms on the womb those are all up there

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.190
although I think you might you know

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.750
agree with me when I say that I'm over

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.120
rating item rooms in the womb actually

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.280
like sure getting two extra item rooms

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.139
on the womb is very nice but is that

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.060
that much more valuable than getting

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.289
reroll machines in every item room is

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.970
that that much more valuable than

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.729
getting an eternal heart every floor

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.520
from you know silver dollar and Maggie's

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.970
faith respectively I do sometimes think

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.230
and I

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.710
think we have that like Peter Griffin

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:34.920
syndrome where you know I know da ela

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.780
family guy but please I was like 13

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.640
years old when that show was in the

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.210
height of its popularity that least

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.310
means first-run so coming some slack you

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.570
know that's when Peter Griffin wins the

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.550
game show and they say you can either

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.400
have the boat you can have the mystery

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.840
box and he says there Louis says take

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.980
the boat and then Peter Griffin says no

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.530
you got to take the mystery box there

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.290
could be anything in the box even a boat

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.120
feel that way about item rooms sometimes

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:04.010
an Isaac where you're like ah you know

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:06.630
it of guaranteed HP upgrade who cares

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:13.170
the item room could be anything it could

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:14.610
even be an HP upgrade but I digress

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.930
we don't need to get into like what's

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.580
the best trinket in the game let's be

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.300
honest you've got it like a 90 something

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:24.450
percent win rate and trending pretty

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.880
much level I think as far as things are

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.200
going right now we're going to wait till

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.620
the deal with the devil didn't use our

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.090
reroll either on the dealer just after

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.650
we take an item in there I never I still

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.900
don't understand like when you take and

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.610
then reroll versus when you reroll and

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.450
then take but it doesn't matter much in

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.280
the whole scheme of things because the

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.740
d100 again it's like the most

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.740
misunderstood item in Isaac it just it

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.600
feeds you free wins it's like having the

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.760
opportunity to reroll your life until

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.860
you get something that like you know

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.750
you're okay with you can survive a day

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.700
in the life you get to re-roll again so

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.669
you know re-roll once and you're like

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.710
I'm a prisoner of war okay live a day

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:05.700
reroll okay now I'm the CEO of like

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:07.290
adidas I'll stop here not making light

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.810
of serious issues or at least that's not

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.610
my intention but from an Isaac related

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.160
sort of metaphorical standpoint that's

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.260
kind of what we got going on here right

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:20.700
now I mean we started we were like you

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:22.140
know VP of Finance at Samsung or

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.700
something like that and now you know

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.350
we've rear old out or now we've moved to

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.300
where the chief technical officer we're

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:30.450
in the same boat basically it's all good

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.100
I I can't believe I've missed the item

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.390
room here so odds are we're probably

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.440
going to accidentally re-roll into

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.970
something that's garbage

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.970
or at least more garbage

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:43.980
at some point but I'm I'm okay with this

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.000
you've got plenty of time to work our

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.460
way through it and get something a

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.740
little zanier see what we want is to

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.300
reroll ourselves in the Zayn plus power

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.040
you know we want to be like a Richard

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:56.850
Branson not just the stuffy old

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:59.190
fuddy-duddy guillotine if it gives us

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:00.540
stat upgrades that are persistent I

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.520
don't know why they reverse direction

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:05.120
there but if they give us that upgrades

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:08.690
that are persistent I would like to I

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.690
would like to keep it

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.710
all right I'm happy that I picked it up

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.210
rather so I dukakis to hit in the

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.880
bloodstream here give me a moment takes

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:19.410
a second takes a second thinking of like

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.270
what we want to reroll what we don't

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.620
want to re-roll but there's no reason to

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.760
buy the boomerang unless we want to

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.430
re-roll immediately and then we get

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.140
another item in the shop but the d100

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.340
makes you nihilistic man because you're

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.440
like okay I can get the boomerang

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.820
re-roll it it becomes a pass if I pick

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:39.240
it up but then it gets rear old again

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:42.390
like it never gives us it never gives us

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:45.419
anything persistent which is fine

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:47.640
but at the same time makes me kind of

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:52.380
unattached to any item in particular Oh

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:53.790
I mean we'll take sake bus it'd be good

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.430
to get something persistent like nine

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:58.200
lives out of the other side though it's

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:00.600
the same so this is just a straight up

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:03.930
everything downgrade except we got epic

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:07.650
foetus along with it but we're low on

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:09.180
like every stat but epic foetus with

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.440
five point five two damage is going to

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:13.650
kill everything in one hit anyway I

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:15.090
think so it's very similar to like mom's

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:17.010
knife and that five point five two

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:18.540
damage doesn't really apply what's nice

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:19.680
is that we can actually reroll right off

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:23.150
the bat as well I don't really want to

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.150
do a whole floor with epic foetus

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:31.260
doesn't interest me all that much so

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:34.880
let's throw this out instead all of our

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.880
stats stayed exactly the same

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:43.229
except our speed went up that's not very

00:08:39.899 --> 00:08:45.990
good it's not very good at all actually

00:08:43.229 --> 00:08:49.069
the parasite is nice but okay stick with

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:49.069
this for a flooring then we're good

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:55.350
excuse me sir I've got a bone to pick

00:08:52.379 --> 00:08:57.360
okay and I know people they go and I was

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:59.399
going off on another one of his rants I

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:03.589
wanted to be clear that all of my ramps

00:08:59.399 --> 00:09:06.180
are men like my brand is making a

00:09:03.589 --> 00:09:09.059
self-aware making a big deal out of

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:12.569
things that are very minor but Kate and

00:09:09.059 --> 00:09:14.519
I have this you know basically grocery

00:09:12.569 --> 00:09:15.990
delivery service it's not like grocery

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:18.240
deliveries it's not like they show up

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:20.519
with a bunch of ingredients that we

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.730
asked for it's just like we pick three

00:09:20.519 --> 00:09:25.230
meals a week and then they basically

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:27.209
prepare the ingredients and then deliver

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.720
them with a recipe so it's even worse

00:09:27.209 --> 00:09:32.069
than just getting the food delivered

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.509
they're taken liberties because they've

00:09:32.069 --> 00:09:35.009
been in there marketing they're like you

00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:36.449
know what's for busy people and for

00:09:35.009 --> 00:09:37.620
better or worse we do tend to be busy

00:09:36.449 --> 00:09:39.809
people even though a lot of that is

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.370
self-inflicted I don't necessarily see

00:09:39.809 --> 00:09:42.420
that as a mark of personal pride in a

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:46.939
way it's a little bit of like

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:49.500
workaholism but anyway the point is we

00:09:46.939 --> 00:09:50.939
we got it partly because it is

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.069
convenient and then partly because it's

00:09:50.939 --> 00:09:54.600
like all the meals are under 40 minutes

00:09:53.069 --> 00:09:57.389
40 minutes might seem like a long time

00:09:54.600 --> 00:10:00.089
but it's nice you know because it's 40

00:09:57.389 --> 00:10:03.930
minutes where you're making real food

00:10:00.089 --> 00:10:07.259
and you're you know making a wholesome

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:09.540
meal sure you could order delivery in 40

00:10:07.259 --> 00:10:11.309
minutes and and be fine I guess that the

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.139
with the timing it would make sense but

00:10:11.309 --> 00:10:15.629
you know we're spending time together as

00:10:13.139 --> 00:10:17.750
well but they've been taking liberties

00:10:15.629 --> 00:10:19.980
yesterday's Mia I look at it

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.720
Bombay chicken I don't know if that's a

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:23.579
real thing but it was pretty delicious

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:26.160
in the end but this is absent the point

00:10:23.579 --> 00:10:28.709
of what I'm trying to get at here might

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.059
as well take passiveness I suppose and

00:10:28.709 --> 00:10:33.120
try to stack up as many items as

00:10:30.059 --> 00:10:34.999
possible even if it is transient um so

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:40.740
it was basically like chicken thighs on

00:10:34.999 --> 00:10:43.769
basmati rice walking on sunshine

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:45.660
chicken thighs on basmati rice with some

00:10:43.769 --> 00:10:48.420
like roasted cauliflower it was pretty

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:49.080
good on the box or not on the Box on the

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:52.590
bag with you

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:55.470
readings it says easy recipe 30 minutes

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:57.210
I want to run something by you here 30

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:59.790
minutes how long is that one more than

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:02.430
29 right what if I told you that step

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:04.650
like three of the recipes was after

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:06.120
seasoning the chicken breasts cook it

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:07.380
for three to four minutes on both sides

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.880
you're going okay that's six to eight

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:11.400
minutes of cooking and what is it what

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:13.530
does it say after that apply the

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:16.020
marinade put it in the oven set a timer

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:19.470
for 25 minutes I'm not trying to be rude

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:23.820
to you meal delivery service you say 30

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:27.570
minutes you've given me at the minimum

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:31.020
bound 31 minutes of cooking time do I

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:33.060
look like I was born last night and I

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.770
say that you're going to be like oh

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.600
they're only off by one minute no no

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:38.850
it's like 1 minute in the perfect

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:42.990
scenario that's like if I ask you how

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:44.850
long it took you to drive to work you

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:46.110
would give me the average amount of time

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.640
it takes for you to drive to work

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:49.830
probably you wouldn't give me the oh

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:52.110
it's 3:00 a.m. and there's no traffic on

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.790
the road and I'm driving you know one of

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:55.950
those cars that they always have in the

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:57.450
desert where the engine explodes half

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.980
the time it's got parachutes that come

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:01.800
out the back of it to slow you down

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:03.780
sets World Records etc etc that's what

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.790
they've done at this point so I've come

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:07.440
to the realization you basically just

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:09.300
said they're lying to you you have to

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.640
add 15 minutes on either side cuz

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:14.130
sometimes you'd be like ok we got 50

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:15.330
minutes where we're going we know we're

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:19.320
going to be at home so let's cook this

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:21.150
meal it says 30 minutes on it and then

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:23.580
it's 45 minutes and it's like now take

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:25.620
the broccoli out of the oven and put it

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:27.690
in a small bowl with the chili oil and

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:30.600
toss it and you're like this is too much

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:32.970
I actually fully understand Austin then

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.230
we got him onto the well I'm not going

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.700
to suggest that it was all our idea

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:38.100
because you know using adult as well but

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.930
he heard about us using the service and

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.460
was like hey there's analogs in my area

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:43.350
I should try it out for myself and then

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.590
after like a month or two he's like I

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:48.360
don't want to do this anymore I

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:51.300
understand you know it makes a lot of

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:53.250
dishes it takes longer than you'd expect

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:55.140
and if you're like a Austin's living

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:57.480
that bachelor life right now which I

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:59.990
don't say as a pejorative to be honest

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:02.220
with us say it as a term of endearment

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.970
he's at the point in his life right now

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:07.740
where he's like

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:11.819
my body mostly can handle eating takeout

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:12.930
for almost every meal so you know if

00:13:11.819 --> 00:13:14.550
it's going to take you the same amount

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:15.899
of time and cost roughly the same I

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:19.019
understand where you're coming from but

00:13:15.899 --> 00:13:21.930
I'm sadly I'm past that point in my life

00:13:19.019 --> 00:13:23.639
if I don't eat you know three or four

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:24.899
servings of vegetables a day I wake up

00:13:23.639 --> 00:13:27.509
the next day and I'm like I'm a

00:13:24.899 --> 00:13:29.100
different person like my body just

00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:30.810
doesn't feel right it's like why are you

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.790
punishing me I wish that things were

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:38.129
like that but it's what it's what

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:40.620
happens man that should be bookworm by

00:13:38.129 --> 00:13:44.250
the way this run is like unless we roll

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:46.319
into something so bad we lose an average

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:48.209
of two HP per room for the rest of the

00:13:46.319 --> 00:13:49.319
run we're so completely fine that

00:13:48.209 --> 00:13:51.930
there's nothing to worry about at all

00:13:49.319 --> 00:13:53.519
here what is well reroll the active I

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:55.110
guess so that we can get something like

00:13:53.519 --> 00:13:55.980
this is an example Isaac's heart is

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:57.689
something we don't want to have

00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.990
especially with epic act but let's go

00:13:57.689 --> 00:14:03.000
let's give it a chance for a floor he's

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:05.670
got a head like 15 minutes on it

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.779
you know you get this 30-minute cooking

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.250
time you're pulling it out of the oven

00:14:06.779 --> 00:14:11.569
at 45 minutes here like we got five

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:11.569
minutes to eat and I've been lied to

00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:17.759
I'm not that salty about it but I just I

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.350
wish they were honest because it would

00:14:17.759 --> 00:14:22.649
help me plan my time better also

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:24.899
sometimes David I want you're going to

00:14:22.649 --> 00:14:26.550
take this as a surprise you're going to

00:14:24.899 --> 00:14:28.410
be surprised by this there was a period

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:31.290
you know in college when most people

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:32.730
well the stereotype at least I won't say

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.709
most people but the stereotype in

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:36.540
college is like I'm going to eat you

00:14:34.709 --> 00:14:39.420
know peanut butter for dinner because

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.870
I'm broke and also I don't know how to

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.750
cook

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:45.029
I was almost like the antithesis of that

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:47.790
when I was later in college like I had

00:14:45.029 --> 00:14:49.230
more free time in college than I had any

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:51.750
other time in the rest of my life

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:53.790
basically except like pre-kindergarten

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:56.639
or something so I was cooking like

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:57.779
mother sauces and you know Olli would

00:14:56.639 --> 00:14:59.490
over dinner tonight

00:14:57.779 --> 00:15:00.569
ah you know anything sounds good alright

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:03.569
I'll tell you what I'll make a homemade

00:15:00.569 --> 00:15:06.029
bechamel and pour that over it you know

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:08.610
there's some roasted chicken breasts it

00:15:06.029 --> 00:15:10.709
was a the time of my life where I was

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:12.500
the most culinary active I'm reroll and

00:15:10.709 --> 00:15:16.050
this is garbage

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:18.180
so I'm not a stranger when it comes to

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:19.830
when it comes to cooking and my skills

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:22.320
of atrophied alot admittedly but you

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:24.000
know there's like base level culinary

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:27.990
chemistry that sort of just stays there

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:31.620
I think at least but they'll be like

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:34.860
okay this is an easy every bag as a

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:36.029
difficulty on it I don't know why

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.450
because I guess they're trying to

00:15:36.029 --> 00:15:41.010
promote it for people who are not

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:43.470
skilled or at least experienced in the

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:45.810
culinary department but it's meaningless

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:48.420
because they all have easy I've seen

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:51.029
like two in my entire four months life

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:52.500
with this corporation I don't know if

00:15:51.029 --> 00:15:56.250
they're legally a corporation anyway

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:58.140
entity that have not had easy and

00:15:56.250 --> 00:16:00.149
they've only had medium so what would

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:03.779
you say is an easy meal sandwich right

00:16:00.149 --> 00:16:07.500
PB&amp;J nah son this they'll give you a

00:16:03.779 --> 00:16:11.339
little bit of a primer to the bad and

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:15.120
boozy lifestyle here this one was like

00:16:11.339 --> 00:16:16.829
okay we got this cauliflower well first

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:19.529
off it was like you know put a cup of

00:16:16.829 --> 00:16:21.209
water in a pot pour the rice in set it

00:16:19.529 --> 00:16:23.010
to boil and then when it starts boiling

00:16:21.209 --> 00:16:24.630
cover it and reduce the heat to low and

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:29.310
simmer for 20 minutes that is easy no

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:31.320
doubt second step was you know take the

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:33.630
chicken thighs salt and pepper them on

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.550
both side heat up a skillet a medium

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:36.810
heat put them skin side down when the

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:38.630
skillet gets hot cooking for three to

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:40.620
four minutes per side that's easy

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:42.180
next step once the chicken is done

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.829
you're going to take a small baking tray

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.760
I'm going to put a little bit of oil at

00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:45.899
the bottom they're going to take this

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.240
cauliflower you're going to put the

00:16:45.899 --> 00:16:50.490
cauliflower spread out and an even layer

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:53.279
on the bottom you're going to put the

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:54.390
chicken breast on top of it from the pan

00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:56.100
and then you're going to involve your

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:58.850
oven should be preheated to 425 degrees

00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:04.079
Fahrenheit at this point and then you

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:07.169
get ginger garlic yogurt mint uh there's

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:08.429
like a cumin seed plus mustard seed

00:17:07.169 --> 00:17:10.260
spice blend then you're going to like

00:17:08.429 --> 00:17:11.400
you know with that all together in a

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:14.880
bowl you're going to pour it on top of

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:16.350
the stuff and then you know you kind of

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.970
work it around in the baking tray and

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:20.490
then put in the oven for 25 minutes I'm

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:23.030
not suggesting this is a hard meal

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:25.800
necessarily but as far as I'm concerned

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:28.079
anything that has like six steps and

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:30.000
three different cooking methods you know

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:31.920
we had a boiling a frying and a baking

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.510
going on here sorry that doesn't get to

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.280
be easy anymore that at least puts you

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:37.170
in the medium range sure they're not

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.030
saying oh and now you know remove the

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:41.400
spine from the chicken butterfly it and

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:45.210
insert you know your custom herb garlic

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:48.570
butter under the skin they're not saying

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:50.280
that but you know that's I would dispute

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:53.160
that being an easy meal at this point

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:56.880
easy meal is like you know put the

00:17:53.160 --> 00:18:01.380
potatoes in the oven fry the steak on

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:03.210
both sides you're good to go this run is

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.860
like still solid I'm thinking we should

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:07.770
go too boss rush but often times it ends

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:09.270
up with me accidentally re rolling

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:13.080
myself into breakfast because we just

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:15.180
get too aggressive with it I can't even

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:18.090
remember what the medium one is but

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:19.590
definitely there's some like easy 30

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:21.900
minutes and then it's like you're making

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:24.510
a marinade letting it chill in the

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:26.430
fridge making a sauce frying something

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:28.110
finishing it in the oven and then making

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:29.970
like a starch to go on on the side of it

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:31.440
they look like sometimes it's like a

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:34.980
salad dressing as well you're right you

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:37.710
know this is I signed up for convenience

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:41.220
and now you're you got me making these

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:42.480
uh these meals that admittedly like I

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.800
would never make for myself which is

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:46.830
nice because it's you know I get to

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:50.250
experience some dishes I would never

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:53.600
otherwise make probably but just saying

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.600
they're taken some liberties with it

00:18:55.450 --> 00:19:04.120
wait we have dog too active dude thank

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:06.190
God we got a curved horn because

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:09.419
otherwise we'd be sitting in a terrible

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:11.559
place from a damage standpoint here I

00:19:09.419 --> 00:19:15.250
have some of my favorite meals in

00:19:11.559 --> 00:19:16.779
University there's I have talked about

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:22.120
this before but this isn't one of the

00:19:16.779 --> 00:19:23.649
like super old rehash sort of NL SS bits

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:27.250
that I do from time to time this is like

00:19:23.649 --> 00:19:29.080
a genuine like I had good friends in

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:32.019
college and we were doing fun stuff

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:35.559
together every Wednesday in my fourth

00:19:32.019 --> 00:19:37.029
year like the recession hit and I don't

00:19:35.559 --> 00:19:39.070
I don't know why I say that as if that

00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:41.260
matters for a publicly funded university

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:44.860
but either way a lot of like the classes

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:46.419
that I wanted to take were not offered

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:50.260
because they're like well you know we

00:19:46.419 --> 00:19:53.230
got less money this year so basically I

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:54.940
had like a the minimum schedule I can

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:55.870
conceivably have and still graduate cuz

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.399
I was like you know I want to take

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:58.539
insect biology at night oh yeah we're

00:19:57.399 --> 00:20:00.940
not offering that this year are you

00:19:58.539 --> 00:20:01.990
crazy you know you can stick around for

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:04.419
another year if you want to take that

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:06.070
but I'm gonna graduate well you know how

00:20:04.419 --> 00:20:08.679
much do you want to take insect biology

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:10.350
at five hundred dollars a semester not

00:20:08.679 --> 00:20:12.880
that much

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:14.980
obviously we'll take a champion belt

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.480
here another luck upgrade is nice wool -

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:21.519
I write that much that's right we're on

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:23.080
this special room I forgot justice but

00:20:21.519 --> 00:20:24.909
yeah so like on Wednesdays I had like

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.580
one class at 9:00 a.m. or something like

00:20:24.909 --> 00:20:29.200
that and then I think that was it for my

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:32.049
whole day so I would always cook dinner

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.610
on Wednesdays a year for my housemates

00:20:32.049 --> 00:20:35.769
and there's a recipe on YouTube from

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:39.519
America's Test Kitchen called

00:20:35.769 --> 00:20:43.690
a high roasted I think it's called high

00:20:39.519 --> 00:20:45.760
roasted a whole chicken it's so good but

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:47.380
also know your own kitchen well because

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.880
you will set off the smoke detector just

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:52.419
by virtue of this you take a whole

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:55.450
chicken apologies to vegetarians out

00:20:52.419 --> 00:20:57.669
there take a whole chicken the night

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:59.950
before requires some preparation you

00:20:57.669 --> 00:21:01.840
basically get a big old bowl or pot you

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:03.760
fill it with water you dump in a cup or

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.409
two of kosher salt and you let that

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.419
thing brine overnight it seals the

00:21:05.409 --> 00:21:09.419
juices it makes

00:21:06.419 --> 00:21:10.980
nice and juicy we should grab this you

00:21:09.419 --> 00:21:13.889
might have a chance at boss rush till

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:16.769
then you know after 12 to 24 hours in

00:21:13.889 --> 00:21:20.100
the brine you take it out you you cut

00:21:16.769 --> 00:21:23.279
out the spine of the chicken lay it flat

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:25.200
basically like beaded flat so then all

00:21:23.279 --> 00:21:26.609
of this skin is going to be all the skin

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.350
on one side at least is going to be

00:21:26.609 --> 00:21:31.769
exposed to this like super high heat of

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:34.139
the oven you whip up like an oregano and

00:21:31.769 --> 00:21:36.539
basil garlic butter put it under the

00:21:34.139 --> 00:21:38.249
skin high roast it only takes like 50

00:21:36.539 --> 00:21:39.960
minutes or something like that or 40

00:21:38.249 --> 00:21:44.669
minutes to cook a whole chicken at 500

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:48.149
degrees Fahrenheit comes out like dark

00:21:44.669 --> 00:21:50.279
and crispy wonderful great times

00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:52.350
take this we've already fought Krampus

00:21:50.279 --> 00:21:57.330
so we might as well just grab this and

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:59.549
go basically we have no teleport I mean

00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:02.009
serpents kiss is pretty good but I don't

00:21:59.549 --> 00:22:07.279
mean look at our rate of fire rate of

00:22:02.009 --> 00:22:11.190
fires 38 I'm not interested in taking in

00:22:07.279 --> 00:22:12.330
taking and Serpent's kiss especially

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:13.320
because we're going to be rolling it in

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:17.580
10 seconds anyway

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:20.009
but I will say 38 rate of fire is like

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:23.340
obviously terrible but sharp plug are

00:22:20.009 --> 00:22:25.679
sorry sharp pencil made that a lot

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:27.710
better although we still got rid of it

00:22:25.679 --> 00:22:32.100
in like record time

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:33.960
anyway that's enough food talk if you're

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:35.340
you know in college you're living alone

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:37.799
or going off to college I really

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:40.320
recommend learning to cook people don't

00:22:37.799 --> 00:22:43.559
don't let people they always give you

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:46.259
like not always Rob's really good about

00:22:43.559 --> 00:22:47.940
this and I know I usually like take this

00:22:46.259 --> 00:22:50.549
opportunity by myself to roast my

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:56.220
colleagues but I have respect that you

00:22:50.549 --> 00:22:58.350
know Rob likes to cook complicated meals

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.850
sometimes relatively complicated meals I

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:01.649
don't mean anything when I say

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:02.850
relatively complicated I mean that you

00:23:01.649 --> 00:23:04.739
know he likes to cook meals with some

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:09.749
pomp and circumstance I'll do this stuff

00:23:04.739 --> 00:23:11.129
necessarily great but when like someone

00:23:09.749 --> 00:23:13.019
who's not that experienced in the

00:23:11.129 --> 00:23:13.739
culinary arts like Austin is like what

00:23:13.019 --> 00:23:16.049
should I make

00:23:13.739 --> 00:23:18.179
Rob isn't like oh you make the

00:23:16.049 --> 00:23:19.620
occasional rains the easiest thing in

00:23:18.179 --> 00:23:21.990
the world that

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:25.380
step one of 67 is blah blah blah you

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:29.309
know he's always like you know just cook

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:31.559
like a starch and then fry learn learn

00:23:29.309 --> 00:23:33.690
how to like fry meat so that it's not

00:23:31.559 --> 00:23:35.220
dry as heck and then you're good to go

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:37.440
you know he always goes to the simple

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:41.880
stuff and it's so easy to be like an

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:44.220
okay chef probably different for

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.750
everybody an okay cook maybe I don't

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:49.049
know I don't want to people go to school

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:50.909
to become a chef but for me it basically

00:23:49.049 --> 00:23:53.279
came down to like hey cook everything

00:23:50.909 --> 00:23:56.100
like slightly less than you think is

00:23:53.279 --> 00:23:58.440
right and then it comes out you just

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.700
learn you know this has to cook a little

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.960
longer than this has to cook a little

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:04.460
longer than this and then you're good to

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:06.809
go it's the easiest thing in the world

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:08.520
save you a lot of money in college as

00:24:06.809 --> 00:24:12.330
well until you start making your own

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:14.460
quiche Lorraine conjoined what's up its

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:16.649
your boy conjoined this is not that bad

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:19.770
18 damage eight rate of fire you can

00:24:16.649 --> 00:24:29.130
survive live with it thrive don't mind

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:30.840
if I do I'm very surprised that it

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:35.340
appears impossible for us to get a guppy

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:37.760
transformation here by the way if you

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:39.690
don't know how to cook that's also fine

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.669
like I'm not trying to say it's a

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:44.880
necessary skill to have as an adult but

00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:46.860
I do think it is I do think it's helpful

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:49.260
and I think that people do a bad job I

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:51.630
don't want to you know Dae computer

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:53.580
science 101 but it's like people do the

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:55.679
same thing about computer programs oh I

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:58.049
don't know I could never learn how to

00:24:55.679 --> 00:25:00.090
compute a program it's really just like

00:24:58.049 --> 00:25:01.950
you know the entire shoes in the morning

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:03.390
that's the same thing that's computer

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:05.700
programming is just you got to learn

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:09.080
like slightly different involved very

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:09.080
different syntax for it

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:15.430
anyway David s cooking dude now if you

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:17.290
learn like three different ways to cook

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:20.400
eggs you never have to eat the same

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:22.810
thing twice you got it under control

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:24.720
twice in a week I should say not twice

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:28.840
after that would be a little ridiculous

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:30.820
restock is almost worth stopping for but

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.650
we haven't had a run that really has

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.340
made me feel like this is where we want

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:35.380
to be forever

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:39.300
at this point run room two right yeah we

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:39.300
we've really picked up the pace here

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:44.800
that being said there's plenty of skills

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:48.190
that I don't have that you should

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:52.300
probably have as a 28 year old adult I I

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:54.790
can't build anything my brain and I

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:57.070
accept this I think I have a good brain

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:59.410
and not in the you know Tropic Thunder

00:25:57.070 --> 00:26:06.160
simple Jack soared away I think I have a

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:08.410
good brain for words for language for

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:11.700
logic to some extent you know I think

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:15.040
for whatever reason either you know

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:16.630
natural acumen or whatever you know

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:19.660
maybe I spend a lot of time as a kid

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:21.700
doing specific puzzles that work in that

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:23.200
area of the brain and I was like just

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.040
let it atrophy and then it's always

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.230
coming back to me now

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:28.330
but when it comes to visual spatial

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:30.370
sense I'm actually an idiot when people

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:32.620
go NL you're blind you missed something

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:34.390
on the screen I go back sometimes I

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:37.600
watch those videos and I go I am

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:41.500
actually like legally blind like how did

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:43.360
I miss that it's crazy you know I'm the

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.620
kind of person like all I have skate

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.880
I'll be like okay where's this like

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:49.000
thing I'm looking for and she's like oh

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:51.400
it's in this thing and I go no you don't

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.340
understand I need you to give me like

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:56.170
the latitudinal and longitudinal

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:58.000
coordinates of our apartment I need you

00:26:56.170 --> 00:27:00.790
to tell me it's in this corner next to

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.190
the blank because I don't know where you

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:04.510
know oh it's didn't like the it's in the

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:05.920
bag section I don't know where the bag

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:07.120
section is what's where's the bag

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:09.580
section I was in the closet

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:14.500
okay now I'm on the level now we're okay

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:17.560
but you know I can't build anything

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:19.630
it takes a lot I've gotten better at it

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:21.250
but if you show me like a chair and then

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:22.360
give me the pieces of a chair I will not

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:26.460
be able to put I can

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:26.460
conceive of how it gets put together

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:33.220
genuine we'll take this and then re-roll

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:39.550
I don't think we're gonna fight hush

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:41.080
because it's too dicey on a we have 1.62

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:42.970
damage so I'm really not going to fight

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:46.420
hush but I kind of like this you know

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:48.400
monkey's paw run right here looks like

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:50.080
the left 4 dead 2 logo except it's got a

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:52.390
3 which obviously something something

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:53.320
valid etc etc yeah ok so there you go so

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:55.390
I can't build anything

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:57.370
I'm not very handy I'm not I'm not

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:59.950
particularly good at fixing things what

00:27:57.370 --> 00:28:03.850
I am good at is being humbled so I

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:05.890
understand like our dishwasher broke I

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:07.390
wouldn't say that I fixed it but I

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:08.740
looked at the dishwasher and said I

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:13.330
don't know what the heck's going on

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:14.470
there and then I went on Google second

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:22.750
we've got an important Skype message

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:25.180
here ok I went on Google and it wasn't

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:26.770
an important message I googled the make

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:29.110
and model of our dishwasher and then I

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:31.240
would was like there's we had the part

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:32.380
number because the part had come off and

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.510
was just kind of sitting in the bottom

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:36.130
of the dishwasher and I googled that and

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:38.230
I got like a video tutorial of how to

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:39.910
fix it and I was like you know I'm glad

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:42.640
I didn't just go oh yeah this goes here

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:46.320
and try to snap it in but I also cannot

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:49.210
drive a stick-shift and I know if you're

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:51.580
European or really into cars and not

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:52.600
European you're probably going what do

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:55.300
you mean you don't know how to drive a

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:56.680
stick shift it's whether you might not

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:58.990
realize it it's not part of driving

00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:03.130
culture to the same extent in North

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:08.010
America definitely my dad knows how to

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:10.360
drive a the manual transmission we had a

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:11.620
manual car when I was a kid but ever

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:17.320
since then it's been automatic

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:20.200
transmissions you know oh I didn't mean

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:22.980
to do that but this is so much better

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:25.930
good lord although our speed is garbage

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:29.170
dude just let me out I'm begging you

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:32.320
here I'm trying to there's probably like

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:35.710
various other skills that I'm unaware of

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:37.899
but you know you can't flick an RPG

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:39.159
spec into everything this is this is it

00:29:37.899 --> 00:29:42.760
this is the run we're keeping here it's

00:29:39.159 --> 00:29:45.669
so good although that's kind of like a

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:49.620
misnomer because I can definitely learn

00:29:45.669 --> 00:29:52.000
how to drive stick in like you know

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:54.730
probably like a month I don't know how

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.309
long does it take however long it takes

00:29:54.730 --> 00:30:01.360
that's how long it would take

00:29:56.309 --> 00:30:03.190
do we need piercing shots why don't we

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:05.409
take piercing shots like dead onions the

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:07.090
fears are bigger of because I range it's

00:30:05.409 --> 00:30:11.320
so much worse and then black ruin

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:14.620
everything else we got some shots to be

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:17.460
out of it at least um yeah you know you

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:20.730
can't always spend your whole life

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:23.140
worried about you know self-improvement

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:24.880
there's a good chance you're like I've

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:28.059
done it I've learned all the skills

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:31.570
what's left time to die because I'm 90

00:30:28.059 --> 00:30:34.000
you know like you got a self-improvement

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:36.789
snice but you gotta take some leisure

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:41.409
time as well not too much but like

00:30:36.789 --> 00:30:44.169
enough not to feel well rested the key

00:30:41.409 --> 00:30:47.789
not that I know you know the secret to

00:30:44.169 --> 00:30:51.580
life but it's you know taking enjoyment

00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:54.059
in productivity which sounds like the

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:57.070
title of like the world's worst like

00:30:54.059 --> 00:30:58.809
corporate PSA is like the Walmart

00:30:57.070 --> 00:31:01.059
employees are trying to unionize quick

00:30:58.809 --> 00:31:02.679
show them the gaining employment they're

00:31:01.059 --> 00:31:08.679
gaining enjoyment through productivity

00:31:02.679 --> 00:31:10.690
video it's extremely patronizing back in

00:31:08.679 --> 00:31:12.850
the day the greatest generation used to

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:16.630
take pride in a job well done what

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:18.700
happened no this is it's too far

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:20.740
alright I've crossed over from self

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:22.750
awareness into satire I should learn how

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:26.590
to drive a stick shift but they honestly

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:28.240
like straight up we drive in downtown

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:30.940
Vancouver all the time it's a freaking

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:32.260
Mad Max nightmare dude I'm glad to drive

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:35.470
an automatic have one less thing to

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:38.350
worry about there's that there's a one

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:41.110
intersection I don't know maybe you can

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:44.950
google it on Google Street View I hear

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:48.670
that's a thing that exists it's West

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:52.570
we're sorry he's sixth Avenue at Oak

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:55.630
Street very like fairly well trafficked

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:58.030
thoroughfare it is a 60-degree angle

00:31:55.630 --> 00:32:00.310
straight up on a right turn with

00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:02.200
four-way stops at every intersection on

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:04.420
the way up I know if you live in San

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:06.940
Francisco you're like I laugh at your

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:10.690
well it would never stick in San

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:12.010
Francisco either you've got nothing to

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:14.410
worry about in that department is saying

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:17.290
that's why sometimes I you know go up

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:20.380
that road and I go thank God even though

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:22.570
the focus is like right after you trying

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:25.090
to get up anyway you get the idea the

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:26.050
Fiesta of course is what I meant

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:26.950
thanks for watching hope you enjoyed the
