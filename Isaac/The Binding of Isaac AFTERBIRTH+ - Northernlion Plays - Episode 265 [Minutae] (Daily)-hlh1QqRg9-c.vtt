##

00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.689
everybody welcome back there on the line

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.529
please inviting Liza contra Plus don't

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.660
shoot the messenger

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.010
yesterday became 118 plates one point

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.190
three two percent that's fine

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.349
today's scores are in the 30s to 40

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:20.869
thousands but it is another run that

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:28.019
only goes to Mom's foot just saying I

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:29.779
see I mean I we went on a spiel I look

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.219
for a seat we got bombed boy and guppies

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.200
pas here which is not that bad they

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.520
already went on a spiel about this in

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.640
the last daily I just wish that all day

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.510
leaves went like all the way I'd be fine

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.950
with that and then make delirium like

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.170
wait now this is a different episode

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.700
I've recorded I was gonna say so much

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.170
Isaac lately but I've recorded enough

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.270
Isaac lately that I've gotten myself a

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.500
little confused your disregard I don't

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.059
want to have you know commentary

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.100
spoilers fourth I'm just joking it's

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.320
irrelevant I just wish they all went all

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.539
the way because the seam is the the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.750
hardest part every day is like a one

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.670
more yard you take them by the hand and

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.920
then you take them by the heart because

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.700
the theme finding is the hardest part

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.100
that's what I've always said Lou kept

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.140
good item speed is terrible right now

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.299
but apart from that word kind of loving

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.110
this I mean one bomb with bomber boy and

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.909
hot bombs can do a ton of damage and our

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.619
damage itself is actually fine which I

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.119
neglected to mention but should because

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.790
I always complain when it's bad our

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:37.560
speed is bad that's the biggest downside

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:41.579
right now but our HP is fine Greaves

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.290
gullet huh seems like we should take it

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.460
I'm not going to hit the button I don't

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.680
know if it's worth a bomb to hit the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.509
button I'm not always thrilled with what

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.549
we get from those buttons let me get

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.360
callous I'm going to stick with safety

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.009
cap but it's not you know what we should

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.110
as much as I hate to do this because

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.920
it's probably a waste of a bomb for the

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.240
exploration points and also for the the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.829
chance that we get the world's greatest

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.659
shop you should go in we didn't get

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.950
either well we got the exploration bonus

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.629
but we didn't get the world's greatest

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.740
shop but that's okay it was a relatively

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:20.490
low cost this floor is a little

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:24.540
it's of a of a gamble because it's bad

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.070
to use Guppies paw before it's necessary

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.390
because you can get the advantage out of

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.210
having the red hearts and the red hearts

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.500
do give you a pretty sizable advantage

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.850
the longer you hold them you know you

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.640
can use them for blood banks you can use

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:40.950
them just as we general regenerating HP

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.450
you get the idea but I kind of want some

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.530
spirit hearts luckily we've just gotten

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.050
so I'm not going to wait for that fire

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.790
to dissipate no I'm not because we don't

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.170
have a key to get into the other item

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.060
room there okay with a pill I'm gonna

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.390
die with a spirit I'm going to take some

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.750
pills

00:02:51.390 --> 00:03:01.560
there you go I'm going to place a bomb

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:04.500
here at least I waited to get a spirit

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.620
heart before I took the pill otherwise

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.210
we could have actually screwed up this

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.620
run pretty bad and cost ourselves to

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:17.460
deal with the devil did we really have

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:22.500
no no cause to not get smart man smart

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:24.240
man that was a situation where pride

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.650
could have been before the fall I wish

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.770
they would make some sort of expression

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.990
that is you know easily digestible for

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.190
that friends to the end burp

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.470
has given us another friends till the

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.240
end that's not too bad at least don't

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.730
care about that trinket but that was a

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:43.800
very humble use of Guppies paw that has

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.390
led to me definitely getting a deal with

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.650
the devil here and we'll see what's in

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.480
this deal with the devil it's nice to

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.120
have this sliding door sort of effect

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.580
where we actually know what our run

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.720
would look like if we didn't do what we

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.020
did there so let's see what we would

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.710
have been missing out on it's not at

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.540
present that incredible but you know if

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.220
we pop Guppies paw one more time we will

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.560
be able to get to the Whore of Babylon

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.160
state I don't want to do it just yet

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.890
because I really do value we don't want

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.300
that yet either I really do value oh

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.549
come on

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.310
Chewbacca I don't know why I slipped

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.020
into this weird pseudo Nick Nolte

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.290
impression that makes my voice feel like

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.500
it's just gonna shear off of my pharynx

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.270
okay

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.560
we have no keys so it's an easy decision

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.110
we didn't even use any keys on the last

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.490
floor you know we just we use two bombs

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.660
to get into the shop because the shop is

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.870
adjacent to the secret room

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:44.220
either way this run is it very very very

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.220
good right now

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.130
damage is above average especially for

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:56.230
us like not having modified it and then

00:04:51.130 --> 00:05:00.580
our fire radar to your raid rather is

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:02.620
fantastic as well you guys were I don't

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.000
I don't buy that hitbox I know that's

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.650
like the number one thing if you want to

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.930
seem smart about criticizing a game you

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:12.460
go the hitboxes don't seem right but I

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:15.400
was what I saw your your pupils dance in

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.050
the pale firelight there you tell me

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:22.060
they're not taking fire damage I don't

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:24.700
know I call I call shenanigans there so

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.110
we're further away from having zero HP 0

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.790
red hearts because of greens Gullit

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.250
greens going is one of those items I

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:33.790
have almost exclusively squandered my

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:37.150
use of up to this point so I still it is

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.410
a fundamental lack of knowledge I have

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.470
with respect to one of the rules of

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:45.070
engagement with grieve gullet if you

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:47.050
spend the money do you lose the HP and

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.630
if you lose the HPV you lose it forever

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.010
because if you lose it forever I don't

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.320
really want to go to the shop and buy

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.640
something until I see if maybe I can you

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.840
know lose it on a deal with the devil

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.280
here is something instead that's more

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.750
productive and then maybe you just can't

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:06.760
take the HP away from me no okay you

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:12.100
need to stand right here a bit of a

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:16.390
whiff honestly just keep yourself safe

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:18.910
it's not like we're tight on time that

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.250
is the perfect spot for you to be thank

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.690
you very much

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.970
still got 5 bombs nothing wrong with

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.910
that no deal with the devil little

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:29.710
Stephen is you know fairly

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:33.340
inconsequential for us at this point in

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:35.140
the run should go to the shop I mean I

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.940
think I should buy things but we might

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.590
want to play a self sacrifice room so

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.039
it's kind of a tough call but you know

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.409
black

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:43.539
like really good also the moving box

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:45.819
boxes up all the freaking items then you

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:47.110
drop them down later I don't know what

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:49.629
to do with that but I'm going to buy a

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.369
black candle it did cost us HP so now

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:55.990
the next test is to see what happens if

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:58.059
we get over 25 cents again I'm assuming

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:01.029
we will not get our HP container back

00:06:58.059 --> 00:07:07.270
which would be a modest bummer but black

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:09.249
candle is like worth getting curse of

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.379
the unknown curse of the lost curse of

00:07:09.249 --> 00:07:16.990
the blind on a daily can can ruin your

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:21.039
existence so don't take that yet we have

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:22.899
keys now so we might be able to get like

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:24.669
a pill identifier we got the wafer which

00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:26.469
is actually fantastic for playing a

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:28.779
self-sacrifice room so you know we're

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:31.930
approaching the point of the game you

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:33.909
know what I want to get on this daily at

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:36.490
this point it seems like the most likely

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:39.129
outcome is not in a waz room or at least

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:44.169
the preps the best outcome for us is not

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:48.039
in a waz room it's a it's a teleport

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:49.449
card out of boss rush into playing a

00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:54.909
self-sacrificing room where we have the

00:07:49.449 --> 00:07:56.649
wafer now we can get down to that lam

00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:58.719
floor relatively cheap and be in a

00:07:56.649 --> 00:08:01.469
decent spot I think so

00:07:58.719 --> 00:08:05.319
we'll grab this now to health upgrade I

00:08:01.469 --> 00:08:10.930
still think that's good please be secret

00:08:05.319 --> 00:08:12.849
room it's beautiful because now what is

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:17.129
this a place we could place this and get

00:08:12.849 --> 00:08:19.240
like the secret room and the shop man

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:20.469
waiting in the sky he'd like to come and

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:24.430
greet us what do you think he'd blow our

00:08:20.469 --> 00:08:26.830
mind honestly I will use one more bomb

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:30.339
to make this safe I've done enough you

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:32.620
know fire walks here to find myself

00:08:30.339 --> 00:08:34.719
probably believing that the right call

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:37.240
is not to try to go in between the

00:08:34.719 --> 00:08:40.419
spikes there we could look for a second

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:42.610
secret room there's not many locations

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:43.810
for it in fact I think I've kind of

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.069
become disillusioned with looking for

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:49.569
second secret rooms but that's going to

00:08:45.069 --> 00:08:51.510
change right here let there be C grid

00:08:49.569 --> 00:08:55.350
rooms and let them begin

00:08:51.510 --> 00:09:00.120
with me what do we got the world's super

00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:05.730
$0.05 that's fine like it has to be here

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:08.190
more or less what okay it could have

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.420
been on the big room I neglected to give

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:19.860
you that valuable piece of information

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:22.380
until that moment so the general all we

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:24.930
need bombs that I just spent a thousand

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:27.690
of them the general consensus on these

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:30.030
mirrors is first off everybody makes fun

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:32.010
of me when I say mirror how do you

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.390
pronounce it it's one of the worst words

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.340
in the English language in terms of its

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:37.530
design in my opinion it's got a lot of

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.490
syllables that sound lightens muddled

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:42.630
when you say them next to one another

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:44.970
don't even try to be like mm I say me

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:48.800
roar I know you don't say me roar you're

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:51.720
from frickin you know North Carolina

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.480
you're not from 18th century England

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:57.180
Hugh Jackman freaking Kate and Leopold

00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:00.800
over here yeah so find a Victorian

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:03.330
mirror we're all saying mirror all right

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:07.950
let's go down to the freakin home debit

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:09.600
get us some mirrors learn a little about

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:12.300
living and a lot about love you know

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:18.270
that's what Amir's for probably I don't

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:19.950
know I've never used one we're so far

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:22.200
ahead of schedule on the boster anyway

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:24.180
did I mention what the general consensus

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.320
is or did I just move into the tangent

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.240
after that point immediately

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.680
the general consensus right now is

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.330
ignore them and then if you have a bomb

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.160
blow them up especially if you blow them

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:36.270
off on the chest you get a free item so

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.900
it does function like a football that

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:40.820
was close

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:44.190
it does function like a fortune-teller

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:46.530
which is actually really cool although

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:48.780
now it brings into question why the

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.340
blood bank doesn't behave like that if a

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.080
freaking mirror can give you items but I

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.060
guess a mirror can have drawers inside

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.400
of it you know you can store an item in

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:58.560
those drawers

00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:00.030
it's like Kanye West said forget all

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.230
that flirtin now I'm trying to get in

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:04.350
some drawers he was probably just

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:05.310
talking about blowing up the makeup

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:08.249
table

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:09.720
Oh to get how we could get a secret room

00:11:08.249 --> 00:11:12.870
if you play our cards right though it

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:15.870
was a terrible idea you moron okay get

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:20.370
out of your that that that is just the

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:22.709
worst ah you idiot okay move on I got

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:25.110
mine flooded myself with the with the EZ

00:11:22.709 --> 00:11:26.430
that's okay happens all the time so I

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:29.790
it's hard being so Street you know

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:31.949
constantly I'm like well what the

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:33.930
amortization table look like for this I

00:11:31.949 --> 00:11:39.180
don't know I can't tell because I'm too

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:41.279
mine flooded by the easy oh and when I

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:43.680
wake up I recognize you're looking at me

00:11:41.279 --> 00:11:47.459
for the pay cut okay what do you got for

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:49.230
me here that is not a teleport car but

00:11:47.459 --> 00:11:52.319
it's valuable nonetheless we I mean you

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:58.740
pick it up and then you put it back down

00:11:52.319 --> 00:12:00.480
it is bookworm enabling at least and I

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:03.870
think maybe we just want to go straight

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:06.720
up for spirit hearts here we definitely

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:08.519
want to do the boss trap room as well so

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.540
I'm I'm not worried about HP I'm a

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:11.040
little worried about our damage penalty

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:14.730
cuz I've been kind of a needy already

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:22.769
can't screw it let's do it

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:24.930
I believe nice okay worth every penny i

00:12:22.769 --> 00:12:26.399
dodge right into that enemy you it

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.870
always happens ten minutes into a run I

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:29.790
start to lose a little bit of focus and

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:31.529
things start to go off the rails a

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:33.809
little bit I'm not popping to hear a

00:12:31.529 --> 00:12:39.870
farm card yet because if we get a blank

00:12:33.809 --> 00:12:43.259
card or a taro cloth even it will be

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:44.759
worth having waited because raw HP is an

00:12:43.259 --> 00:12:48.420
important resource here when it comes to

00:12:44.759 --> 00:12:49.949
getting into the the self-sacrifice room

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:53.670
and being able to play it to its logical

00:12:49.949 --> 00:12:55.350
conclusion so or really it's incredibly

00:12:53.670 --> 00:13:00.079
illogical conclusion but you get the

00:12:55.350 --> 00:13:00.079
idea dude

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:08.310
I think it's pretty clear that our

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:14.610
damage is starting to overstay its

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:16.620
welcome here six times 4.19 could use

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:18.329
well I'm not going to complain about it

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:21.360
because honestly we'll probably get a

00:13:18.329 --> 00:13:22.769
damage upgrade regardless from our deal

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.860
with the devil in one way or the other

00:13:22.769 --> 00:13:27.959
usually this is what happens so still on

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:31.230
pace not too worried we could reroll

00:13:27.959 --> 00:13:35.100
this but I think I'd rather - and maybe

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:36.449
take a nap but I wanted to take it in

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:41.100
case it was a teleport car because we do

00:13:36.449 --> 00:13:46.380
want to do boss rush and after doing

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:48.990
boss rush teleport out that goes there

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:54.480
guys did the tune of the Pink Panther

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:57.480
theme song that's that's a joke for

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:59.550
eight-year-olds who was somehow were

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:02.720
born in like 1963 so they're familiar

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:05.220
with you know the Pink Panther theme I

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:07.319
mean it's probably not it's not only as

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:12.420
an unheralded piece of media I'm just

00:14:07.319 --> 00:14:14.430
saying okay Bighorn this is going to be

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:16.050
a fairly long boss fight this would have

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:24.600
been a good one to save a bomb for but

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:27.470
oh my god II put me in the freakin Full

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.470
Nelson here

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:34.850
it's again just par for the course maybe

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:37.820
there's some bias in this but I was like

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:40.430
you know if you have bad damage sorry

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:42.230
you're going to fight rag man probably a

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:43.790
champion version and you're going to

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:47.510
fight Big Horn it's just the rules of

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:51.680
engagement of course if you have amazing

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:53.930
damage you're probably going to kill Big

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.400
Horn in like you know less than 30

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:58.640
seconds and not even really think about

00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:05.470
it that much that's good oh we got it we

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:07.750
got it absolutely grab it grab it and I

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:10.970
think you stick with Guppies head and

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:12.530
just acknowledge that red hearts are a

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:14.360
little dangerous although with go ahead

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:18.470
we shouldn't have to worry so much now

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:20.510
we need to stack up HP because we are

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:21.800
going to possibly want to play a self

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:25.760
sacrifice room soon we are of course

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:28.400
also almost guppy Pandora's box

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:31.100
I think this floor is the spirit hearts

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:33.290
which is ideal by the way we improved

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:38.660
our damage immensely not just because of

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:40.340
the flies but we got simple Incubus is

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:42.020
effectively going to double our damage

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:44.120
if we hit with every shot which is not

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:47.240
realistic but it provides a number

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:49.910
maximum for quality and then I don't

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:52.490
know how we got a charge there we also

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:54.620
got a Whore of Babylon activated you can

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:56.510
be forgiven for forgetting that it even

00:15:54.620 --> 00:16:00.830
existed but here we are

00:15:56.510 --> 00:16:02.990
I will check our secret rulers higher

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:08.800
curse room now ended up paying dividends

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:08.800
but it's not always going to be the case

00:16:11.639 --> 00:16:17.709
so we have to make a judgment call

00:16:14.199 --> 00:16:19.389
fairly soon that's going to hurt you

00:16:17.709 --> 00:16:21.699
have to make a judgment call fairly soon

00:16:19.389 --> 00:16:24.579
about what we're going to do when it

00:16:21.699 --> 00:16:26.769
comes to boss rush I think in the end we

00:16:24.579 --> 00:16:30.490
did make the right decision yesterday it

00:16:26.769 --> 00:16:33.129
was the lame decision but it also did

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:36.089
allow us to finish top 100 which you

00:16:33.129 --> 00:16:38.259
know I'm somewhat happy for at least

00:16:36.089 --> 00:16:42.249
means that we didn't miss an obvious

00:16:38.259 --> 00:16:43.660
seam today we got to choose if we have

00:16:42.249 --> 00:16:45.639
no teleport card and there's a

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:47.199
self-sacrifice room are we going to do

00:16:45.639 --> 00:16:48.459
boss rush and hope for a teleport card

00:16:47.199 --> 00:16:50.949
or are we going to do the self sacrifice

00:16:48.459 --> 00:16:53.290
your expecting that boss rush is never

00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:57.819
going to come to fruition okay this is

00:16:53.290 --> 00:17:01.269
easy you take crackerjacks you get HP

00:16:57.819 --> 00:17:04.169
use the HP to get contract from below

00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:07.360
and then you buy the shovel as well

00:17:04.169 --> 00:17:10.569
sorry Guppies head but the shovel

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:12.789
actually completely changes the game so

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:14.260
now I start to realize that we have a

00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:18.220
chance to rank well today and it's for a

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:20.649
very obvious reason not everybody is

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:22.929
going to have the resources or time even

00:17:20.649 --> 00:17:24.309
if you consider that a resource not

00:17:22.929 --> 00:17:30.700
everybody is going to have the ability

00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:32.500
to play all of the boss Trap rooms that

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:34.360
led us to get Goathead maybe it's just

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.620
the one I don't know somewhere deeper

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.970
down the causality chain there's

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:40.120
something else going on there but you

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:41.380
get the idea like there goes forward

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.809
Babylon we could always trade this away

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:45.730
for like something else immediately if

00:17:43.809 --> 00:17:46.960
we want to we have go ahead so

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:49.419
everything's open but yeah if you didn't

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:53.830
get go ahead you're going to be in a bit

00:17:49.419 --> 00:17:57.130
of a weird spot here the shovel is

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:59.830
actually like the best of all ways out

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:01.450
because especially for boss rush it's

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:04.690
not a one-shot deal you know we'll get

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:08.730
like 6 boss rush shovel attempts and the

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:08.730
odds of all six of those paying out with

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:14.409
with the crawl space are effectively nil

00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:18.039
nil enough to not have to concern

00:18:14.409 --> 00:18:20.620
ourselves with it at all basically yeah

00:18:18.039 --> 00:18:23.470
that's what we need getting pretty close

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:24.460
to spun you got to go chaos like that's

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:26.410
just how

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:29.470
she goes boys and you grab this and

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:36.010
48-hour energy you grab that and you use

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:38.590
this and yeah don't use that verb last

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:45.040
pill 48 hour energy we got to go faster

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:48.220
by the way yeah we like we have to go

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:51.520
faster but we also do have to I mean I'd

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:53.470
like to get a crawlspace if only for my

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:55.270
own personal pride all right so we're

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:56.350
down here and we did everything on that

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.600
floor I think it's fine

00:18:56.350 --> 00:19:01.360
we lost our HP because of reeds gullet

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:04.630
again completely okay oh so yes we will

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:06.490
become Gumby it will give us HP which is

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:10.480
bad but will also become guppy which is

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:11.980
extremely good so now we definitely do

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.450
not have to make a decision all we have

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:16.000
to do is get the boss rush and if we get

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:17.860
the boss rush we will be able to use the

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.090
shovel to teleport down one extra floor

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.430
so we're just going to keep this room

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:24.040
for basically the fact that it exists

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:26.230
get that exploration bonus I think you

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.700
know if the top score is 37,000 I'm

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:31.330
sorry the top scores like forty three

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:33.520
thousand today but if we're if we're

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:35.860
able to get to boss rush I think we got

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:38.590
every ability to be in the 30s at least

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:40.300
I'm a little bit lighter on points than

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:44.020
I would normally be at this point and I

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:45.430
think it's a basically bad damage but we

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:47.980
have a chance to recover for that

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:49.900
through surprisingly good luck slash you

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:52.510
know the decision-making that we had I

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:55.330
guess okay so don't take too long here

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:57.550
but get these rerolls done evil eye is

00:19:55.330 --> 00:20:00.370
fine Bob's rotten head is not this is

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:03.910
our last play yeah okay Expo steve-o is

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:05.320
decent enough gulp it's a trinket

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:08.280
smelter we don't really need to get any

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.280
smaller on this one

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:12.440
we're only going to use the shovel for

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:14.270
like business purposes only this is our

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:16.100
company shovel you know we can't use it

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:19.160
for personal stuff we're just being

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:20.990
audited so there's our dodge right into

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.280
it great common trope for me with those

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:24.710
guys

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:27.230
grab these that's probably our second

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:29.720
secret room we do if possible we'd like

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:31.970
to explore absolutely everything and we

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.860
also do not need the budget time to go

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:35.510
to the deal with the devil because we're

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.600
going to have the goat head so we can go

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:39.890
to the deal with the devil regardless

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.930
now it's going to be like do you even

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:45.620
want those internal hearts my guts

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:49.580
telling me no right now because there's

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:50.870
no point uh well the thing is do we want

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:56.530
to make it harder for us to have Whore

00:20:50.870 --> 00:21:01.220
of Babylon may not matter

00:20:56.530 --> 00:21:03.050
check the shop to a diamonds grab it I

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:09.890
don't know grab another key get the heck

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:11.840
out of here we got to go uh I guess

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:12.980
here's the thing we'll take both it does

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.750
put us further away from Whore of

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:16.250
Babylon but if we got one item on a deal

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:19.040
with the devil it could be too hard or

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:20.780
we could easily up two items so having a

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:22.370
second red heart is not necessarily a

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.020
bad call we may want to play a

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:25.580
self-sacrifice room eventually and by

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:28.220
the way leaving those two keys behind

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:31.070
for once did actually cost us big it

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:36.140
cost us the ability to easily get into

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:36.770
that double key room that was a bit of a

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:40.370
mistake

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:42.800
hopefully not a major one easy fight I

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:44.210
was going to say if it's Krampus we

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:51.620
don't really care because he's going

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:54.800
down I hate new Krampus dude lump of

00:21:51.620 --> 00:22:02.180
coal exactly what we wanted take a gulp

00:21:54.800 --> 00:22:04.730
pill with you take this no yeah if you

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:07.280
want me to reroll that I understand your

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:11.300
point and the other items are not

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:13.580
necessarily crushing it but I can't dude

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:15.380
I'm going to take holding bombs the real

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.880
reason behind this is because a couple

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:19.790
of runs ago I rolled my whole run and it

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:21.500
turned into complete garbage so you know

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:23.210
take it up with the

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:25.970
take it up with patrol engine if you got

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:27.410
a problem with it we had a run where I

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:29.630
thought we might have a chance of being

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:32.060
in the you know the front page and then

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:35.210
by reroll it I made it nearly impossible

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:36.620
for us to survive did end up surviving

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:39.920
and actually I was very proud of how

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:41.570
that run ended but so we don't want to

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:47.090
use the shovel too many times it's just

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:49.760
a little dicey we did take chaos which

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:51.920
might explain why you know this boss

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.500
rush was a little wonky but I don't know

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:56.780
what I don't know if it looked that

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:59.060
irregular as compared to a normal boss

00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:02.060
rush payout at this point so remember

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:04.160
there's no chance all it's a crawl space

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:07.960
the crawl space you've got to be careful

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:10.880
though it spits you out on the mom floor

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:12.320
yeah maybe we actually just on the mom

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.330
room so many little things to remember

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:17.060
with the shovel we might just want to

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:18.500
ignore it in theories there is a way we

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:19.790
could get the crawl space to work for us

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.950
and if it's a black market and this

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:25.730
worked I would be mad that I didn't do

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:28.400
it but if you have a charge you could

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:32.960
use your charge your shovel charge that

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:33.860
is on the mom fight like the mom room I

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.180
should say goes we're not gonna be able

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.500
to get back into boss rush is what I'm

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:40.520
getting at we're already past 20 minutes

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:42.290
so and the odds are very good you would

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:45.520
not get another crawl space but the odds

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:48.080
are not a hundred percent so I feel like

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:50.720
it would be a little foolish although

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.310
admittedly quite brave but straight-up I

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.780
want to have a daily that goes past boss

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:55.100
rush for the first time in like four

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.810
days and I think we're we're

00:23:55.100 --> 00:24:03.530
well-equipped to to get a good score

00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:06.220
today so I don't want to squander it for

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:06.220
no reason at least

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:14.820
watching out for enemies they can pop up

00:24:12.809 --> 00:24:16.920
I mean guppy is doing our job for us

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:18.660
right now our damage and swell our tears

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.920
that is great but our damage stat is

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:23.000
still a little low for the point of

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.000
which we're adding the game but

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:27.900
explosive Oh lump of coal and Gabi are

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:31.380
finishing the job that poor didn't

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:32.940
started here so although of course I

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:34.200
would love to see a hive mind or

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:37.590
something along those lines you really

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:42.990
don't need much else to to beat the lamb

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:44.640
like this is unacceptable run for

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:46.620
beating the lamb and in a timely fashion

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:51.470
- like we would definitely be able to

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:51.470
make it to a hush fight if one existed

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:58.770
you should be out of here within like

00:24:54.720 --> 00:25:00.870
the next 45 seconds or so like this

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:04.470
might even be our final wave please give

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:06.480
me hive minds hive mind my mind will be

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:07.710
really good I know I'm harping on it but

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.480
if you want to give me double damage

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:11.700
flies and whatever form that takes if

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.870
it's hive mind great if not hey as long

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:20.580
as it does what it says on the tin

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:22.890
that's cool okay almost got me that we

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:25.650
didn't take it took one hit here two

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:27.809
hits I can't remember the oil hits it's

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:33.059
been a good boss rush and matchbooks

00:25:27.809 --> 00:25:34.799
okay i think you just go sorry

00:25:33.059 --> 00:25:41.190
crawlspace I've been burned one too many

00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:42.630
times the door doesn't stay open

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:45.390
otherwise we could have walked back into

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:47.669
the mom fight and then look to see if we

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:49.110
got anything and then you know fountain

00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:51.720
dude I think of the bombs that I got

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:53.370
from I think I did from matchbook I

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:56.870
think I did anyway

00:25:53.370 --> 00:26:00.059
now these floors we do still need to get

00:25:56.870 --> 00:26:02.419
portals downwards but if we can get a

00:26:00.059 --> 00:26:04.650
black market that would also be swell

00:26:02.419 --> 00:26:07.770
crawl space or black market I don't

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:09.540
really care so we're looking for 30,000

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:10.650
I always like underestimate the amount

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:12.090
of points you get in the early game and

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:13.860
overestimate the amount of points you

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:14.880
get in the later game so I'm looking at

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:18.390
this right now and I'm like eighty

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:21.330
thousand easy I've got it cold but

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:25.680
it's a troll bomb I don't know if we do

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:27.720
to be honest with you I think it is

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:29.370
conceivable although a little brazen to

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:32.280
suggest that we might not ever get hit

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:33.420
again except for self-sacrifice rooms

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:35.700
which are really the big deal right now

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:38.430
again now it becomes the classic like

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:40.080
game of chicken in a daily like what do

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:41.610
you do if you find a self-sacrifice room

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:43.250
on this floor do you take it or do you

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:45.600
ignore it

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:47.600
personally I'm kind of inclined to be a

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:53.510
little risk-averse on today's daily and

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:53.510
and take one as early as we can find it

00:26:53.810 --> 00:27:04.890
because of the fact that I worry about

00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:05.970
gaining ourselves out of the scene but

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:08.510
we don't have to worry about it too much

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:08.510
just yet

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:12.750
mapping would be really nice as well

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:14.430
we know these pills none of these pills

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:16.170
Seattle cane we do know these pills

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:18.240
none of these pills have been incredible

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:19.920
so far but the hero font card came in at

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.750
important time in my life keep in mind

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.840
for a self-sacrifice room we really only

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:31.290
need probably needs seven spirit arts

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:33.210
because of the wafer so we're like well

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:38.340
above that we also have nine lives which

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:41.160
means if things like truly got horrible

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:44.880
we could still probably have a chance we

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:45.960
are going to keep our room here we're

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:48.420
going to miss out on the money in the

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:52.140
process unless we can teleport so 48

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:54.900
hour energy well all it's a crawl space

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:59.610
or a black market crawl space crawl

00:27:54.900 --> 00:28:04.230
space with the Bible closer to bookworm

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:05.670
at least if they made it so I couldn't

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:07.320
pick up the shovel there I would have

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:08.820
been a little ornery to be honest with

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:13.440
you I might as I might have said some

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:15.270
colorful language keep gulp I don't care

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:19.560
about the money whatever sure had some

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:21.300
points down the drain but either that or

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.410
we lose damage even if we went really

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:26.760
fast we would have ended up losing

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:28.260
damage on the way out so again clever

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:30.580
play good play

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:32.800
not necessarily in my opinion

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:34.540
all right sixteen bombs we should look

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:36.430
for secret rooms here probably like

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:40.990
2,000 points below where I'd like to be

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:43.060
but we are past Mom's hard which is or

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:44.800
past mama I should say which is very

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:46.660
good for us sad bombs is a wonderful

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.860
item and we want to trade two HP away

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:50.170
basically regardless of the

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:52.420
circumstances with the wafer we actually

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:53.830
can these are great items by the way did

00:28:52.420 --> 00:29:00.430
we not get chaos because those are just

00:28:53.830 --> 00:29:05.500
normal feel with the dental items let's

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:07.030
go let's go he's done it okay that we

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:09.730
definitely got chaos Immaculate

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:11.560
Conception and the more HP you get the

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:13.720
more you get like familiars that are

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:16.780
angelic I can't remember on Gabby's tail

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:19.150
we want ceremonial robes so we got a

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:23.080
whore of babylon plus all that extra

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:25.930
damage there of course the ideal for the

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:28.840
ideal for us is to not encounter a self

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:31.120
sacrifice room on this floor and then

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:34.840
for sure encounter one as late as

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:37.390
possible for example on Sheol if we can

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:42.460
get a self-sacrifice room on Sheol I

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:47.560
will bust into song I got show but I'm

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:50.530
not a show jerk how do people feel about

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:52.600
the killers cuz I grew up you know I'll

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:56.650
not grew up I had my formative years as

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:58.990
like a as a hipster basically and I

00:29:56.650 --> 00:30:00.850
didn't hate The Killers that's not I

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:05.260
mean I hate serial killers because

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:07.390
they're bad people but I was like I'm

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:09.850
not the biggest fan mr. Brightside

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:11.320
catchy song I don't even mean catchy as

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:14.560
an insult which is how most people mean

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:16.270
when they say catchy but I really liked

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:19.410
all these things that I've done I was

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:21.820
like that's a that's a classic there I

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:25.300
mean it's no wolf per raise I'll believe

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:27.460
in anything but we want to get rid of

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:29.140
this HP as well by the way but we're

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:31.750
getting permanent polaroid invincibility

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:36.000
so it's not an enormous ask by the way

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:36.000
our bombs are beautiful right now

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:40.780
you got to fight him you get like a

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:42.430
damage not a damage but a points

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:46.600
multiplier for this floor something I

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:49.330
can't remember let's get out of here all

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:50.650
right there's no there's no X in there

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:52.150
so we should really just take one of

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:54.100
these existing exits because we're not

00:30:52.150 --> 00:31:00.550
tight on time we can't fight house

00:30:54.100 --> 00:31:04.360
anyway remember I think we had the one

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:09.360
in here yeah all right so we're gonna be

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:11.800
like 24,000 maybe 20 play yeah nearly

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:13.540
25,000 I'm just going to use the shovel

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:17.760
over here in the corner that's entry to

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:21.610
show so we know that we're at least good

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:24.700
to get to Sheol that's bookworm which is

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:28.030
also lovely that's not bookworm am I

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:30.910
losing my mind did we already get

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:32.860
bookworm does dead sea scrolls no longer

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:35.740
count as bookworm by the way health up I

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:42.070
do care but I don't need it right now

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:50.290
and I might not ever but either way this

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:54.490
floor is all about risk if we're able to

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:58.060
get excuse me

00:31:54.490 --> 00:32:00.130
I mean you dust is like highly dusted if

00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:01.990
we're able to get a self-sacrifice room

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:05.760
on this floor what do we do I think you

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:09.130
take it 37,000 is closely you can get

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:10.240
37,000 on shoulder - easily I know I

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:11.380
mean not pretty easily have to be a

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:13.570
great player but if you're a great

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:14.620
player that's not a it's not a mark

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:16.900
that's outside of the realm of

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:21.880
possibility but I would expect there to

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:24.310
be a self-sacrifice room somewhere

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:28.210
between the womb one and sholde at three

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:29.440
floors to get one self-sacrifice room we

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:32.440
didn't get one on the last floor that

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:33.640
doesn't mean we do but you know be nice

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:37.690
I guess is all I'm saying

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:38.890
dad's key you unfortunately dad's key is

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:43.570
useless right now because you can't

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:44.980
actually fight mega Satan if the run

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:47.200
doesn't go to mega satan to begin with

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:49.690
so unfortunately that's you know it

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.509
looks like a seam it walks like a seam

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:55.879
it's now

00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:58.129
the scene he's going to keep exploring

00:32:55.879 --> 00:33:00.469
obviously we have like basically no

00:32:58.129 --> 00:33:02.329
reason not to explore as much as

00:33:00.469 --> 00:33:04.099
possible relieving points on the table

00:33:02.329 --> 00:33:09.469
if we were to bounce

00:33:04.099 --> 00:33:12.379
I don't know now that I starts to come

00:33:09.469 --> 00:33:14.719
into clarity the more you play you know

00:33:12.379 --> 00:33:16.219
on a daily I should say you know at

00:33:14.719 --> 00:33:18.079
first you're like 37,000 there's

00:33:16.219 --> 00:33:19.129
multiple avenues one could take to get

00:33:18.079 --> 00:33:20.859
there but then you get further and

00:33:19.129 --> 00:33:23.749
further into the daily and you realize

00:33:20.859 --> 00:33:24.249
there actually aren't not anymore at

00:33:23.749 --> 00:33:26.839
least

00:33:24.249 --> 00:33:29.089
honestly wait do we already have poison

00:33:26.839 --> 00:33:31.399
bombs I thought we already go we got

00:33:29.089 --> 00:33:35.509
fire bombs not poison bombs like

00:33:31.399 --> 00:33:37.339
shielded tears are great but why not get

00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:42.589
five extra bombs that are also crazy

00:33:37.339 --> 00:33:45.459
here like that's going to kill

00:33:42.589 --> 00:33:45.459
everything

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:50.239
not that there's necessarily much left

00:33:48.859 --> 00:33:52.849
for us here to begin okay yeah and

00:33:50.239 --> 00:33:56.839
that's my bed another ones down there as

00:33:52.849 --> 00:33:58.729
well then I've got a bomb back again

00:33:56.839 --> 00:34:00.259
what do you think about an eternal heart

00:33:58.729 --> 00:34:02.949
I don't really want to lose Whore of

00:34:00.259 --> 00:34:09.279
Babylon by going down to the next floor

00:34:02.949 --> 00:34:09.279
those are one makes you small we

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:18.619
I'm just going to keep exploring I I

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:20.179
feel confident over top 250

00:34:18.619 --> 00:34:22.820
like that's my first leg order of

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:25.850
magnitude because I think a lot of

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:27.679
people will have excluded some people

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:29.210
just died on runs and that I don't mean

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:31.250
that to be rude but like it's happened

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:33.350
to me sometimes you just you know you're

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:34.520
playing badly and you take two hits when

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:36.619
you're not supposed to maybe started

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:39.470
this run relatively fragile not not

00:34:36.619 --> 00:34:40.940
Judas level but still you can you can

00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:44.090
just make a couple mistakes and get cold

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:46.490
so that happens pretty frequently and

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:48.290
then you know throw on top of that the

00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:50.000
people that didn't get go ahead the

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:51.409
people that you know maybe misuse the

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.850
shovel on boss rush the people that

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:55.159
didn't make boss rush to begin with I

00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:57.139
think you can see like we got a we got a

00:34:55.159 --> 00:35:01.360
bead on an okay score today but we need

00:34:57.139 --> 00:35:04.220
to just go one level greater to get to

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:06.710
to get to those thirty thousands but it

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:09.290
appears and now I would probably feel

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:11.900
more comfortable saying that Sheol does

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:15.080
not have a self-sacrifice room because

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:21.200
we have explored almost everything here

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:24.710
I think it still would have found it

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:26.359
because of bomber boy well that's our

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:29.510
secret room anyway so we're just going

00:35:26.359 --> 00:35:31.810
to go down to the next floor don't mind

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:33.800
fighting greed points no matter what

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:37.520
we're going to go down to the next floor

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:39.500
we're going to go down to Sheol and you

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:42.109
know what we might as well just do that

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:43.640
yeah okay well the guy HP so we might as

00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:47.300
well taken a half red or it doesn't

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:49.760
really matter actually okay on Sheol we

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:52.040
got twenty nine thousand if we find a

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:54.140
self-sacrifice room we could be ranked

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:56.810
number one which makes me believe that

00:35:54.140 --> 00:36:01.910
we are probably not likely to find a

00:35:56.810 --> 00:36:04.550
self-sacrifice room so it's up to us to

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:07.850
find a few thousand extra points here

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:10.190
and it's not as tough as you might I got

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:12.050
hit by them in my own bombs there it's

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:14.770
not as tough as you might think to be

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:14.770
honest with you

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:19.770
because we're going to get a few

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:21.300
thousand just for like we'll get like a

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:23.250
thousand for being on this floor and

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:26.640
finishing all the rooms and I will get a

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:29.730
couple thousand for finishing as a bonus

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:32.220
for you know points or like consumables

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:34.710
etc etc I still you know one day you

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:39.810
should probably look up what the actual

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:41.580
bonuses are at the end but I might as

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:55.320
well exhaust all of our keys at this

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:58.650
point when you kill bosses on a boss

00:36:55.320 --> 00:37:01.200
Trap room it gives you a charge every

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:04.200
time every wave you beat that's such a

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:06.300
positive change is that due to an item I

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:08.430
have is due to today's daily or is that

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:11.340
a new change in the most recent patch

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:15.420
because that is actually like a very

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:17.310
very good change doesn't mean make space

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:19.770
bar items even better but only on in

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:21.840
like one room every two floors so dude

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:24.690
that's really cool if that actually if

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:25.980
I'm not hallucinating and that actually

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:30.000
is the change that's been implemented

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:33.870
Thank You Nicholas that's a very

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.280
sensible change in my opinion obviously

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:41.040
we're going to crack into all the news

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:43.470
explosive diarrhea range up bread 30,000

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:48.420
oh he pulled away the last second we've

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:50.340
done it keep using this I mean I mean I

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:56.220
mean I don't think I can actually give

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:57.780
you grapes benefits necessarily now we

00:37:56.220 --> 00:38:03.900
might be able to snag a crawl space

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:07.580
although I'm somewhat doubtful might as

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:07.580
well fight make a save

00:38:12.229 --> 00:38:22.190
Wow even like a badly place sad bombs is

00:38:16.619 --> 00:38:24.539
so good right now okay

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:26.670
so we're still looking for self

00:38:24.539 --> 00:38:31.140
sacrifice rooms it's very important that

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:31.949
I actually look into the rooms because

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:33.900
that's creepy

00:38:31.949 --> 00:38:35.640
seeing in the past sometimes I have a

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:37.410
tendency to gloss over the fact that

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:40.949
there might be a self-sacrifice room but

00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:45.779
again I would be I would be stunned if

00:38:40.949 --> 00:38:47.670
there were because we have not played

00:38:45.779 --> 00:38:49.739
ten out of ten we're probably not you

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:51.619
know in the sevens with a maybe a bit of

00:38:49.739 --> 00:38:53.789
a fudge factor upwards for our

00:38:51.619 --> 00:38:57.630
decision-making process that's led us to

00:38:53.789 --> 00:38:59.219
have some pretty good items here but you

00:38:57.630 --> 00:39:04.049
can afford to take that and get nine

00:38:59.219 --> 00:39:06.690
extra points but and it really would

00:39:04.049 --> 00:39:10.699
open us up to getting like a ridiculous

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:13.319
amount of a ridiculous amount of points

00:39:10.699 --> 00:39:18.089
what we would we would be first with a

00:39:13.319 --> 00:39:19.410
bullet you know sorry what I meant to

00:39:18.089 --> 00:39:21.660
say of course is I'd be your number one

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:24.809
with a bullet allotted god complex talk

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:28.019
it and pull it but we're gonna get

00:39:24.809 --> 00:39:28.979
another HP upgrade they think and it

00:39:28.019 --> 00:39:30.239
doesn't really matter if it's not

00:39:28.979 --> 00:39:33.449
pushing a spirit heart out of the way

00:39:30.239 --> 00:39:36.479
who cares it is it is right now pushing

00:39:33.449 --> 00:39:40.549
a spirit out out of the way but okay

00:39:36.479 --> 00:39:44.190
good good no self sacrifice room still

00:39:40.549 --> 00:39:48.029
we played this right is the thing feels

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:49.799
like a secret room to me but it's hard

00:39:48.029 --> 00:39:51.809
to argue that we didn't play this right

00:39:49.799 --> 00:39:54.799
but we're not going to be in that we're

00:39:51.809 --> 00:39:54.799
not going to be on the front page

00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:04.030
I don't think there's any reason to go

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:06.010
to the self-sacrifice room honestly then

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:06.660
grab this red heart pick up like 30

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:09.100
points

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:11.020
grab this half red heart or full red

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:12.970
heart and pick up another couple and

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:15.820
then grab this so now they're like eight

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:17.590
points and then we're well we don't have

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:20.830
a self-sacrifice room or sorry a sec a

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:25.870
second secret room just yet that found

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:27.730
it amazingly and we're out okay we did

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:29.860
fine on today's daily would love to see

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:32.260
a scene where 149 I think that's fair we

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:33.550
played the okay but not at the top of

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:35.020
