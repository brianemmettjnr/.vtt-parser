00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.879
everybody welcome back to nor the lion

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:09.570
places binding of issac afterbirth plus

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:11.759
we're due for a greedier Samson Samson

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.960
greedier why not like Sam seems a fun

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:20.310
character he's got good things going on

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.779
new kid 1 6 6 x3 uh that's 198 for those

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.640
of you running the mental math out there

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.660
you know what leave that fire for a

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.029
second mr. Dahle is a lovely pickup you

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.540
might think NL stop you're hurting

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.969
yourself you're not wrong however we're

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.770
also potentially getting like a huge

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.870
reward just in the damage Department

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.780
here right off the cut so I think we'll

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.550
also pardon me grab this we get even

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.379
more damage out of it we get allergies

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.940
as well so what are we hoping for with

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.989
this algae's well is very simple

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.579
actually we want to pick up a temperance

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.170
or a demon judgement or something like

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.059
that and all of a sudden like Bob's your

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.420
uncle okay we're at max damage just grab

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.859
these get the heck out of here

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.210
because of the mr. Dahle pickup we are

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.570
just crushing it from a damage

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.260
department as well as our DPS department

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.610
now the odds are next floor we're

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.890
probably not gonna be as strong as we

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.630
are on this floor right now we have 10

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.950
damage in a 7 rate of fire it's pretty

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.390
unlikely we'll get the kind of items

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.360
that allow us to keep up that trajectory

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.890
but for now it's beautiful and all we

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.930
need to do is kind of I mean we can even

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.090
leave this room if we want to but what

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.579
are we looking for uh in terms of items

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.610
honestly I would not mind never getting

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.110
more HP as long as we don't get you know

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.430
shoehorn into deals with the devil that

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.409
are kind of garbage as long as we can

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.680
take only heat like 8 out of 10 or above

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.939
deals with the devil then I'd be more

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.470
than happy to make this happen but

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.840
unfortunately that's a that's an issue

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.509
of access we got to make sure and I'm

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.310
not talking about Access Hollywood I've

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.060
got to make sure the parameters exist to

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:01.500
make that plausible

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.610
so just take out Stephen here figured

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.009
that would probably be the shot to

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.659
finish him off rarely do you get strong

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.729
enough on the first floor to finish off

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.580
the boss before the second boss spawns

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.069
so consider ourselves extremely lucky

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.379
here

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.700
it might even seem like it wasted HP but

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.920
to be honest with you I wouldn't be

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.319
surprised if our strategy here actually

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.180
led to us losing less HP than we would

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.650
have if we hadn't just walked into the

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.519
fire deliberately because we'd be taking

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.079
damage more frequently possibly even

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.819
losing some of our spirit hearts in the

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:35.139
process oh well that's it shows what I

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.489
know anyway get dusted we don't want to

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:37.900
really buy anything on this floor cuz

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.530
it's all question marks as far as the

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.730
eye can see so I'm just gonna grab a key

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.650
we got smart fly which is bad for well

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.859
it's not horrible necessarily but it's

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.919
not on the good side enables Beelzebub

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:55.120
if we get hit early it'll it'll help us

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:57.519
out as long as we don't leave the room

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.469
it'll it'll help us out a little bit but

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.849
you know relative to our actual damage

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:05.439
right now obviously this doesn't seem

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:06.609
that strong but that's life you take the

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:08.319
good you take the bad you take them both

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.669
and then you have the facts of life I've

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:16.109
never seen the show but I believe that's

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:16.109
the theme song I'm gonna try Guppies paw

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:26.379
gimpy spirit of the night you know time

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:27.970
will tell actually like the exact

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.340
opposite of what I suggested

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.040
what's your game playing root cut in or

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:37.720
out half in doesn't count there you go

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.479
he's out um no curse on this floor but

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:45.459
also no damage I love the tiers upgrade

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:48.189
I don't see I mean I don't want another

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.930
tiers upgrade but its Silver Dollar it's

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:53.079
like a reroll machine in every item room

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.400
or something let's buy the key right off

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:58.299
the back is again we don't really care

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.560
about a about a tiers upgrade right now

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.120
we're already pretty close to the cap

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:07.670
Anarchist Cookbook is just garbage

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:09.830
straight-up horrible let's try this

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.440
you wouldn't give me a health down like

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.090
I you could have I was just banking on

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.750
the idea that you you wouldn't have the

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.750
cojones

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.760
okay so we're kind of in a deleterious

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.530
position would be a polite way to

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.600
describe it I'm gonna swing for the

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:28.100
fences here and even if we miss we'll

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.540
land amongst the Stars paid five cents

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.790
for two red hearts we can't use it's a

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:38.750
bad trade the worst deal in the history

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:40.520
of trade ever well we have our work cut

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.229
out for us now it's a harder floor we're

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.520
doing less than half as much damage as

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.770
we were doing on the last floor but we

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.720
are doing that damage slightly faster we

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.400
also have substantially less HP in

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.620
pretty much every department except

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.910
demon hearts in which were tied with our

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.780
previous level of HP with zero but we

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.930
got potential

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.550
we got a guppy item one red heart can

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.310
become three spirit hearts in a pinch

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.200
we've got gimpy if we get hit especially

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.970
we can raise our lock step that could be

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.240
a great long-term thing for us but I

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.680
mean obviously as of right now we went a

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.750
little bit overboard on deals with the

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:19.760
devil but that's that's very me

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.229
it's the kind of guy I am you know I see

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.610
those two lovely Stan Isaac I see those

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:30.650
deals with the devil I take him on the

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:32.390
simple guy I see deals I take we're

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.380
gonna wait to be even yeah we did of

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.410
course it's Anarchist Cookbook

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.270
I was like did we even go into our our

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.070
other item room of course we did it was

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.539
trash we might be able to use it

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.070
depending on you know the size of our

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:45.590
cojones and I assure you they are very

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.890
large not that that's anything to brag

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:53.120
about but there's medically larger than

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:57.110
they're supposed to be and that's all

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.610
you need to know I was thinking like we

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:04.280
could use Anarchist Cookbook to try to

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:07.220
blow up the reroll machine and in doing

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.560
so usually it clumps them in the middle

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.889
but we might get lucky or we might blow

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.380
up none of them a little annoying tears

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:17.440
up great good but we need to kind of go

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.120
over something a little bit better here

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.870
okay give me a seven cent tear upgrade

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.970
that

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.680
also has HP on the other side of it I

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.300
think that's pretty solid the tiers

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.919
upgrade was not that important what was

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.550
much more important is the fact that we

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:33.620
got the HP upgrade right after and again

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:37.070
that's that's kind of a greedier trick

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:39.169
you see an item on sale if it's a

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.729
passive you almost might as well buy it

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:42.729
because the next item out will be on

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:45.440
sale as well

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:48.770
okay so first phase not too difficult

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.900
here I would like him to die so we can

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.580
handle the second phase more easily

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.050
we got the range necessary to hit him

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.790
here I don't know if he has the range

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:59.270
necessary to hit us so it's kind of a

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.830
dream come true I'm not even sure if

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.870
this guy will spawn enemies at this

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:07.220
point so it might be a champion that

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:10.729
just does not do that well shouldn't

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:13.970
have gone up there we're gonna get to 11

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:19.220
cents goodbye the one up but I'd prefer

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:21.800
not to this is gonna be a nasty wave for

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:25.729
us here just try to split the difference

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:27.770
like if you can focus on one enemy at a

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:29.330
time that would be for the best but not

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.860
even one enemy one set of enemies so

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.080
either all the peeps of which there is a

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.660
count of one or all the monsters of

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:38.240
which there is a count of two I'll take

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:41.169
either or dude but just focus on

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:45.130
something died one of the monstros died

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:45.130
two of the monsters have died

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:50.479
what if I can get him to land on the

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:52.520
knob I thought he might be able to break

00:07:50.479 --> 00:07:53.750
the mushrooms for me so we can take our

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.610
deals with the devil here I'm kind of

00:07:53.750 --> 00:08:02.240
hoping this would be like a great floor

00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:03.770
for us to just get a Krampus because we

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.930
don't really want to trade our HP for

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:07.069
anything right now but we handled this

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:09.530
floor better than I would have expected

00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:11.210
given the circumstances I think like we

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:13.009
we're much less strong than we were on

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:14.569
the last floor and yet here we are not

00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:16.190
even really like there's no schedule to

00:08:14.569 --> 00:08:17.919
be behind but we maintained a decent

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:19.970
pace and here we go this is like

00:08:17.919 --> 00:08:26.509
extremely be careful what you wish for

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:28.460
voice be careful what you wish for I was

00:08:26.509 --> 00:08:32.539
very good just focus you know it's easy

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:38.570
dodges and we didn't get a lump of coal

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:41.930
we got Krampus his head I think as much

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:43.219
as you might not like this idea guppies

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:44.660
head is better than Krampus is head

00:08:43.219 --> 00:08:46.880
because we can use this on the ultra

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:48.529
greed fight to give us a lot of HP if we

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:52.670
have red hearts that have been exhausted

00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:54.649
so there's you know that helps let's go

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:58.910
check our curse room we're looking for

00:08:54.649 --> 00:09:03.860
goofy dreams are you a wizard is no good

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:05.990
but I can see forever is solid um money

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:08.209
gives us bombs that seems pretty good I

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.930
know I said it like that it seems pretty

00:09:08.209 --> 00:09:11.149
GERD

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:12.680
you know you got a look at this like

00:09:11.149 --> 00:09:15.380
Maggie's faith might be the right call

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:22.670
as well there the problem is that there

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:24.560
two trinkets but still I will I mean

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:26.570
here's the thing a single penny gives us

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.740
a bomb potentially which we can use to

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:30.740
blow up the slot machine and get even

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:32.510
more bombs like we got a a potential

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.970
mass effect coming soon let's see if we

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:37.370
can make that dream come true let's go

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:40.270
so we should not shy away from using

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:40.270
bombs for combat

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:49.910
and poison not the greatest effect of

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:52.400
the game obviously but it could be a lot

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:54.320
worse we often times actually do end up

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.490
wanting more bombs than we have for

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.900
greed mode now how many bombs do you

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:59.690
need to make greed mode work well

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:01.130
approximately zero but like the more the

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:04.490
merrier you're up to probably around

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:06.140
like 15 or 20 like rarely do you guys

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:08.450
have 20 bombs and then you go I wish I

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.890
had more than this but obviously like

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:12.680
other things that would be huge here if

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:15.020
we could find a way to enable a bloody

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.300
lust to actually do something it's not a

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:21.260
bad item it's just you know drawn that

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:22.580
way it's it's it's in a situation where

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.290
bloody lust can't really provide us with

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:27.500
the kind of strategic advantage I want

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:28.790
but I think this is kind of a perfect

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:36.200
setup right now because we can get

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:37.700
enough bombs out of burnt penny that

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.170
we're not gonna need anymore bomb

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.590
infusion for like the remainder of the

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:41.390
game

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:43.130
then we can take Maggie's faith down to

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:44.870
the next floor hopefully by some spirit

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:46.760
arts to protect our HP upgrades and

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.350
Maggie's faith by itself is worth like

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.660
three or four HP upgrades as long as we

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:52.010
don't find a better trinket for it we're

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.120
better trinket to replace it in which

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:57.290
case we'll be happy cuz we got a better

00:10:53.120 --> 00:11:00.830
trinket and remember I can't stress it

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:02.210
enough we still have gimpy so we're

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:05.660
getting a lot of red hearts just from

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:08.030
killing enemies could use some spirit

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:13.130
hearts for getting hit as well worked

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:15.410
like 15 bombs 15 bombs knock out our

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.970
final wave here revenge fly is finally

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:18.500
getting some work done it's not again

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:20.030
same thing as bloody lust it's not

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:26.150
revenge flies fault that we can't seem

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:28.700
to get hit but so a strange kind of

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:30.680
situation where like your first floor

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:34.310
was your strongest usually things kind

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:36.410
of work backwards from that but I'm

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:38.420
feeling good this run I mean it started

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:40.000
very strong we're almost getting back

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:42.470
then it's like a video game where you

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.850
you start up and it's like hey here's

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:45.500
all your powers and then you go through

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:46.880
like amnesia or something and it's like

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.560
you've forgotten how to do everything

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.270
here's your tutorial and you're like but

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.850
at the end of the last game I was a god

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:56.710
and they're like well things change

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:56.710
this is algae's city

00:11:56.759 --> 00:12:03.449
both of these items are actually very

00:12:00.249 --> 00:12:07.479
good I recognize we have invincibility

00:12:03.449 --> 00:12:12.489
here's how you do this you go a goo and

00:12:07.479 --> 00:12:16.299
a goo he has not paid out hold this for

00:12:12.489 --> 00:12:20.949
a moment then use algae's it gave us

00:12:16.299 --> 00:12:27.099
another algae's I am a genius sin robes

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:32.739
great item check this out

00:12:27.099 --> 00:12:34.749
Guppies paw use it then this pill could

00:12:32.739 --> 00:12:38.259
be an HP upgrade but we're not gonna

00:12:34.749 --> 00:12:39.819
need it yet start with well they're both

00:12:38.259 --> 00:12:42.039
piercing shots maybe bookable Isles or

00:12:39.819 --> 00:12:45.549
the Isle Isle is actually just better HP

00:12:42.039 --> 00:12:49.329
you might as well grab this first to

00:12:45.549 --> 00:12:50.919
speed up its a speed up still have

00:12:49.329 --> 00:12:52.419
algae's I think we'll take this anyway

00:12:50.919 --> 00:12:54.569
cuz it means that the shots that go

00:12:52.419 --> 00:12:57.159
through enemies will do double damage

00:12:54.569 --> 00:13:00.549
again we got 15 bombs we don't need this

00:12:57.159 --> 00:13:05.139
anymore we can take this now do we need

00:13:00.549 --> 00:13:06.909
nun's habit no I don't really care about

00:13:05.139 --> 00:13:10.929
caffeine pill let's throw one of our

00:13:06.909 --> 00:13:17.399
many bombs down here and blow this up

00:13:10.929 --> 00:13:22.899
too as well might as well

00:13:17.399 --> 00:13:25.809
Wow to troll bombs huh lucky me uh you

00:13:22.899 --> 00:13:27.939
know give me another three cent key cuz

00:13:25.809 --> 00:13:34.329
they're cheap throw another bomb in here

00:13:27.939 --> 00:13:40.409
I will get the lucky foot taro cloth is

00:13:34.329 --> 00:13:40.409
so good we gotta try

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:52.330
yes I think we got to keep trying it's

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:53.710
so unlikely but ok so no tarot clot

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:55.779
that's fine this floor still went really

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:58.930
well we have 17 damaged and very little

00:13:55.779 --> 00:14:02.860
of that is actually a nickel and penny

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:04.210
nickel and penny dime ah very little of

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:06.730
that is controlled by bloody lust right

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:08.470
now so we're quite lucky our actual

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:09.670
damages ah maybe more of it than I

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.960
thought was we did play that demon

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:12.820
judgment a lot now that I think about it

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.260
we will take blue baby's only friend but

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.730
it's it's not our most efficient way of

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.230
dealing damage right now which I'm sure

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:19.950
many of you will be happy to hear this

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:22.290
is not the most beloved item in the game

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:25.420
absolutely

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:28.839
mine as well can I don't see why we

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:35.110
wouldn't at this point all right demon

00:14:28.839 --> 00:14:37.990
judgment dude this is optimal for us to

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:40.390
create a so I'm giving them spirit

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:43.150
hearts because we can it's more or less

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:44.770
the exact reasoning there we don't have

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:47.170
any any penalties that we suffer as a

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:50.440
result and we can get we can use our

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:53.980
algae's ruin later retro vision relax

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:55.870
don't do it we could save our algae's

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:59.200
ruin for later uses basically what this

00:14:55.870 --> 00:15:00.280
comes down to using it on ultra agree to

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.050
be very nice especially if we can

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.850
somehow will taro cloth back into

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:07.630
existence but for now let's do the fun

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:10.060
part we got 11 damage we got piercing

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:11.380
shots I'm still kind of amazed we

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.970
managed to get everything out of our

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:16.390
last deal with the devil those were all

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:19.180
8 out of 10 items as requested live my

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:20.980
broken heart open and you ripped it out

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:22.720
not really though I mean I left my

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.860
hearts open because I wanted to get a

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.390
good deal with the devil item in the

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:28.050
game acquiesced which I greatly

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:28.050
appreciate

00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:35.240
you said you shouldn't do it you know I

00:15:32.179 --> 00:15:41.749
got a deal with the dev dumping

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:43.040
something oh geez you know I was a

00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:43.850
little mindful in there I was like these

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.559
are new enemies

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:52.399
they've they are new they've only been

00:15:45.559 --> 00:16:01.309
in the game since 2014 the long distant

00:15:52.399 --> 00:16:03.679
medieval era the buttress of Windsor so

00:16:01.309 --> 00:16:05.809
in terms of like damage and DPS we're

00:16:03.679 --> 00:16:07.490
fine but I always want to hit like that

00:16:05.809 --> 00:16:11.529
next level because of the fact that

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:16.040
ultra greed has the BS super armors so

00:16:11.529 --> 00:16:17.809
anything that can light my fire there I

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:20.509
don't even know what beats super armor

00:16:17.809 --> 00:16:23.899
like highly reduced rate of fire greatly

00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:27.259
increased damage something like that we

00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:33.649
will take Guppies head I think you might

00:16:27.259 --> 00:16:39.559
not love this idea I'm gonna take a lump

00:16:33.649 --> 00:16:41.329
of coal as well really want to up this

00:16:39.559 --> 00:16:43.730
damage so we got tons of bombs use the

00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:47.420
bombs accomplish something

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:50.480
parasites pretty great Maggie's bow

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.869
that'll do yeah let's get out of here

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.910
now

00:16:50.869 --> 00:16:55.100
we need the HP we're not using Guppies

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:56.360
paw anymore so I got no it was correct

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.189
the first time I'm so used to being

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:01.850
wrong when I talk about a guppy item but

00:16:58.189 --> 00:17:03.049
we we're not using Guppies Pawnee more

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:03.379
because we don't have access to it

00:17:03.049 --> 00:17:08.589
anymore

00:17:03.379 --> 00:17:12.409
before is okay ah and synthol is lovely

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:15.409
should probably consider stopping the

00:17:12.409 --> 00:17:17.720
trade of excuse me stopping the trade of

00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:19.250
items or HP to the deal with the devil

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:22.010
and instead just focus on you know

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.970
survival sake so there is something good

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:24.020
about this by the way you might be

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:25.339
thinking what are you doing here we

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.959
could blow up our donation machine and I

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:29.289
think I'm gonna blow it up to get to 15

00:17:26.959 --> 00:17:29.289
cents

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:33.440
even though it's very rude to future

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:37.700
northernlion but did steal Jerry

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.480
Seinfeld's joke you know future

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:41.060
northernlion

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:43.970
and present northernlion are two very

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:46.120
different people I can do things that'll

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:49.430
make future me angry

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:51.650
should I probably not alright good time

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:53.720
for your quality to show up but when

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:55.580
isn't it a good time for equality to

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:58.130
show up you know if that's one of those

00:17:55.580 --> 00:18:00.230
jokes that doesn't make sense but if it

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:02.180
was in subtitles the subtitle would say

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:03.590
Bernie Sanders impression and then you

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:07.600
would be like that's what he was going

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:07.600
for and completely failed to execute on

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:15.710
yeah because equality is some sort of

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:18.740
joke right and look this know what no

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:23.210
see that's not what I mean you're taking

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:26.510
me out of context hey what's Captain

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:29.300
Kirk's favorite word to use when he's

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:36.560
complaining about being quoted you

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:37.580
quoted me out of cond contexts we don't

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.020
really need any of this we could save

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:42.140
money we got one more shop I'd rather

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:44.720
you know that was dangerous that was

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:46.100
just stupid I'd rather use a reroll

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.880
machine like a floor with a reroll

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.880
machine if possible

00:18:51.059 --> 00:18:58.120
because otherwise we're paying to reroll

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:59.470
items which I would prefer not to so

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.790
we're gonna have unless we take a deal

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:03.730
with the devil we're gonna have three HP

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:09.070
for the next four that's good keep in

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:10.080
mind we want to stop spending HP oh that

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:14.410
was close

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:18.100
we're gonna need this HP for the ultra

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:19.750
greed fight the one exception or two

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:22.990
exceptions would be a guppy item or

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:24.280
awesome items of any other sort I don't

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.929
think these items are awesome enough

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:29.830
even though that means science is like

00:19:25.929 --> 00:19:31.720
really good yes hello Luca welcome back

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:35.290
please get your tail out of the

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:48.990
doorframe what's your problem you want

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:48.990
the mouse to be in here I'm outsmarted I

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:57.460
don't think we want any of this it's

00:19:52.809 --> 00:19:59.410
just it's a little too risky save some

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:03.970
HP you know at some point the runs got

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:05.500
to matriculate nothing all right three

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:07.330
bombs left that's enough for rerolls on

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:10.960
the next floor 27 cents puts us in a

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:13.030
good spot or did he outsmart me

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:17.950
he got me to play with the mouse for a

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:22.870
second this could be a good time for

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:25.270
algae's although you kind of look at

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:27.570
this and you go like blank card algae's

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:27.570
right

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:37.210
which might even be better than Guppies

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:40.630
head long term anyway I want to keep the

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:45.300
HP but that's why I'm going for broke

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:45.300
here well that was fast we can't afford

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:52.900
where's the secret room we can't afford

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:55.540
to get rid of our trinket as well but

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:57.370
it's got to be better than this like

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:59.890
safety scissors safety scissors doesn't

00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:09.700
do too much for us I think Jesus juice

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:10.840
honestly just ok a little too late for

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:13.000
the box to be that useful

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.470
I don't think tech X is the if we're

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.880
only buying 2 items on this floor I

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:21.160
don't know if tech X is good enough I'll

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:23.860
just say it now I wish that was car

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:27.960
battery but it still might be pretty

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:27.960
good you know see what I'm thinking

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:34.000
blank card blank room I'm just gonna use

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:34.870
blank rune its de gAHS hoggle ah is

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.910
irrelevant

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:38.320
I'm gonna use my blank card on the way

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:40.690
out here you're gonna be like don't do

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.400
it not trust me I think I can get

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:44.470
through three waves here without taking

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:46.030
damage and then we'll just use algae's

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:47.830
and we kind of like like blank card

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:53.050
algae's should make it impossible to be

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:58.510
hit cat's oh my god I told you I was

00:21:53.050 --> 00:22:00.400
outsmarted get out of here leave no it's

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.510
a greedy you run it's been 22 minutes

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:08.080
how many times if I had to open the door

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:10.060
here this is like there's a king of the

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:12.870
jungle standoff going on you get out of

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.870
here go

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:25.280
distill this office is the least

00:22:21.809 --> 00:22:27.929
desirable room in this entire domicile

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:30.179
if I'm flattered that the cats would

00:22:27.929 --> 00:22:31.890
choose to stay in here but at the same

00:22:30.179 --> 00:22:37.350
time I might just get out into the open

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:44.309
space that's not nearly this hot so I

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:47.250
think nine-volt completely fits the bill

00:22:44.309 --> 00:22:50.340
here dude we are getting outrageous

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:55.350
value on algae's does it normally last

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:57.960
that long cuz I feel like I'm I'm

00:22:55.350 --> 00:23:06.110
ripping the game off like I'm getting a

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:09.980
bargain but if it works like this for

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:13.710
ultra greed I mean we'll get one play

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:15.480
and then we'll get another play button

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:19.590
we just use the room that's a pretty

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:21.570
protracted period of full HP this is all

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:27.210
the money we're ever gonna have here so

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:30.390
I could just drop a bomb geez angry fly

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:32.549
sucks that's not what angry fly used to

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:34.850
look like but I got to imagine that's

00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:34.850
what it is

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:42.960
so just beat this wave check your devil

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:44.820
deal we're well on our way here you got

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.720
to take a guppy item it's like not even

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:50.400
a contest

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:55.679
now we're guts for sale perchance better

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:57.390
trinkets there's a battery charge what

00:23:55.679 --> 00:24:02.400
we can play this guy maybe he'll drop

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:04.980
something yeah two bombs that's probably

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:06.030
what I'll use then and you know okay we

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:08.130
could give us the compass that's

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:10.650
actually worth noting and we're down to

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:12.929
the next floor so just do not use blank

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:15.299
art algae's yet you got a great setup

00:24:12.929 --> 00:24:18.799
you should win you deserve the win you

00:24:15.299 --> 00:24:18.799
played it you played a good game here

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:23.700
that's my interpretation of it at least

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:26.160
I think we played a decent game I'm

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:28.740
gonna wait I would rather use both of

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:30.900
our algae's plays against ultra greed

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:32.520
instead of regular greed plus if we take

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:34.980
damage against regular greed

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:37.380
we're gonna get a damage bonus for each

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:39.690
hit which is gonna make us faster at

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:42.570
killing ultra green later so I think as

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:44.190
much as I want to use the spacebar right

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:45.960
away because it seems like it would be a

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:54.059
prudent use of our resources

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:57.740
quite the opposite I think so we're just

00:24:54.059 --> 00:24:57.740
gonna keep the dream alive here

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:03.750
greed isn't the hard part though keep in

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:06.630
mind we do have gimpy as well so gimpy

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:09.750
is like free spirit hearts if you get

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:10.980
really lucky and free red hearts for all

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:13.470
the enemies would kill so we actually

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:16.400
probably don't want to murder these keys

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:18.960
I would rather he created enemies and

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:22.140
then we could kill them and get red

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:29.010
hearts out of them yeah

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:30.780
relatively smart play I think all right

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:32.850
he's getting torn like Natalie Imbruglia

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:37.280
she was torn in that song I've seen the

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:37.280
music video many many times

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:48.270
just let that linger there no linger is

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:50.930
the cranberries that's a different it's

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:50.930
a different jam

00:25:57.909 --> 00:26:05.179
please okay we got enough of a damage

00:26:03.409 --> 00:26:07.520
bonus its pop this I still don't think

00:26:05.179 --> 00:26:10.490
our damage has ever gotten higher than

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:12.110
it was on the first floor but instead of

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:13.720
finding that annoying I now find that

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:15.740
hilarious

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:19.130
so we'll just stay in there and do as

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:24.940
much damage as we can we can keep him

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:24.940
doing this attack I'm a very happy boy

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:30.620
anything that stops him from jumping

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:32.750
gives us better efficiency so in the end

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:34.429
it was a did we reinvent the wheel on

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:38.570
this run no but I think we played of a

00:26:34.429 --> 00:26:40.280
pretty solid Sampson run you know this

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:43.130
this run we could not have done it in

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:49.309
this manner as anybody but Samson no

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:50.929
question about it you know we're playing

00:26:49.309 --> 00:26:53.650
this run as Lazarus it's got to happen

00:26:50.929 --> 00:26:53.650
much differently

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:03.409
Samson's unique talents lended themself

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:04.970
well here also getting blank card plus

00:27:03.409 --> 00:27:06.979
algae's doesn't hurt so what do we

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:10.149
actually owe a lot of this run to we owe

00:27:06.979 --> 00:27:13.850
a lot of this run to endless nameless

00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:16.039
stem cell oh it's not that bad I guess

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:17.470
but like mostly I'm just covering from

00:27:16.039 --> 00:27:21.590
the fact that I don't know what it does

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:24.259
stem cell not an item - oh God not that

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:26.059
we needed to donate but still endless

00:27:24.259 --> 00:27:27.529
nameless gave us back our algae's rune

00:27:26.059 --> 00:27:29.149
on a refund which allowed us to do this

00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:29.899
so thank you and less nameless for now

00:27:29.149 --> 00:27:30.919
thanks for watching hope you guys

00:27:29.899 --> 00:27:31.940
