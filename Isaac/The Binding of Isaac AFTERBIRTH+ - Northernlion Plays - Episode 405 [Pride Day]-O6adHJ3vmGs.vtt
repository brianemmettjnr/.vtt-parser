##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.929
everybody welcome back to nor the lion

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.759
plays the binding magic after birth plus

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.220
we're moving on to the pride day

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.080
challenge I started one I got two rooms

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.200
in the 8th a granola bar like 15 minutes

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.280
ago started getting granola throat you

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.750
might not know what the heck granola

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.609
throat is I didn't know what granola

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.430
throat was until I started talking all

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.109
day for a living and it's like when you

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.269
apparently like a little piece of food

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.920
you ate like 20 minutes ago for some

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.510
reason just Nestle's itself right there

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.580
in your vocal chords so you think you're

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.080
fine and then you started talking all of

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.930
a sudden you're like wow it was song

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.770
yeah I've got the granola it's less of

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.440
like the frog voice and more of like

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.239
just like sand and your vocal chords so

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.420
I figured you know what we're two rooms

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.070
deep it's not a run that's like part of

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.870
a streak it's a standalone challenge so

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.329
we're probably good to go here after

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.579
Pride Day comes on on streak ona and

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.739
streak own on own and I have it's a

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.030
biblical thing I as a result I have no

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.000
knowledge of the way it's actually

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.770
pronounced because I have Church anxiety

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.870
whenever I end up in church in like ahem

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.880
get some for whatever reason I'm always

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.010
like are they gonna know that I don't

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.700
know anything about this am I gonna be

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.040
like communicated and then

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.200
excommunicated I don't understand but

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.810
either way I figured we just restart and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.590
this is one that should be on the easier

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.140
side ona and streak is tough this is not

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.140
on industry that comes next but on that

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.360
one every time you miss a shot you take

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.520
damage every time you miss the shot you

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.799
take a shot if you know what I mean on

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.680
this one though we start with three

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.460
dollar bill which is mostly pretty good

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:46.170
maybe even pretty great and then on top

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.329
of that we also have rainbow baby which

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.210
is not particularly good but it's not

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.780
bad you know it's better to have rainbow

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.549
baby than not but sure is is it worth

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.229
the item rooms that we lose probably

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.579
three dollar bill might be worth a

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.990
couple of item rooms if you look at the

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.479
expected value in the world's most

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.360
boring way possible is rainbow baby

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.770
no absolutely not so we do have some

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.270
stuff in there we might be interested in

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.280
but we're gonna ignore that for now as

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.330
with a lot of challenges in Isaac this

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.190
one pretty much boils down to do we have

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.200
that is kind of like classically strong

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.310
this is one of those ones that is not

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.020
really a gimmick in terms of the actual

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.570
mechanics and it to be honest to you I

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.160
don't like these ones as much this one

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.680
is more just a gimmick in terms of like

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.080
well we've got a couple of items that

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.610
you know maybe thematically share a

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.420
little bit of similarity for whatever

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.920
reason so we'll Thema run around that

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.310
like life gives you lemons is another

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.830
example it's just kind of like it's okay

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.840
it's nice to have a novelty run but not

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.520
particularly not not something you play

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.860
again multiple times as I guess what I'm

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.420
trying to say there so we got a Guppies

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.770
collar we got the mark I'm going for

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.620
broke on this one I'm mad that the

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.910
brains run ended in despair even though

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.880
I think that was only partly my own

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:08.710
fault I'm gonna pop this mmm one bomb

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:11.350
remaining in theory I think that dull

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.700
razor could be pretty good it doesn't do

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:19.450
anything for us at the present moment

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:22.480
ooh but it might with a theme so let's

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.030
spend all your money on me and spending

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.830
time on me like wow that's pretty good

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.980
as well like Fergie said in my humps the

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.660
Black Eyed Peas doubtless magnum opus

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.200
grab this sorry I forgot I shouldn't

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:41.020
speak Aladdin in videos um SiC transit

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.570
gloria glory fades let's head down to

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.630
the next floor carpe diem seize the fish

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:52.030
we we haven't gotten too many chances

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:54.280
recently to look at dull razor the

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.290
little-known sequel to Hellraiser but

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.090
dole razor is actually great if we can

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.160
get something that really makes it work

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.600
and honestly a theme might be it but I'm

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.820
kind of waiting until we get on a room

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.739
with more enemies on it before I try it

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.690
out here basically it gives you any

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.269
effects you might get when you take

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.230
damage so for us in this case that means

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:16.060
we get the same effects which means we

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.560
could generate black cards off of it

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.120
which is pretty meaningful we can't

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.289
change trinkets I guess we have rainbow

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.330
worm as well that's kind of the other

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:26.860
the other thematic element that makes

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.800
this a novelty so

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.280
every two rooms mm it's worth one bomb

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.780
except we only have one bomb once every

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.020
two rooms we'll be able to take a crack

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.580
at getting some demon hearts which are

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.189
actually really really good so I

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.150
actually think that dull razor I thought

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:46.139
we got something there dull razor

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.099
combined with the Thames is like

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.110
potentially game-winning in and of

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:51.729
itself in fact I might not even say

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.550
potentially I might just say like quite

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:56.199
literally game-winning in and of itself

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.930
we just have to live long enough to

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:02.189
actually make that dream come true if we

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:05.289
can get like nine volt that would be

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:06.789
basically a death sentence for the for

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.639
the challenge like it would get dusted

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:10.360
in extreme fashion with extreme

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:15.430
prejudice

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:17.199
nokey i did not get hurt there and we

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.520
got three demon hearts out of it like

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.259
the other thing is that if this run

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.409
starts to pop in the manner that it's

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:25.569
popping was that a key I heard maybe not

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:27.370
if this run continues to pop in the

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:30.430
manner in which it's been popping we can

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.110
just start walking into enemies because

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.940
especially if we get the ability to use

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.150
this dull razor more than once a room

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.310
well actually get or stand to get as

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.589
much HP back as we spend plus we'll get

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.020
the value of using the the dull razor on

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:46.509
the enemies in the first place but not

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.969
the ideal enemy for this but like pretty

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:52.259
close the hollow would have been 10 in a

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:55.870
10 this is like you know a straight six

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:57.039
if you know what I mean so I'm just

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.589
gonna keep shooting at you one day

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:02.229
you're gonna pop up and then you're done

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:03.879
then we can kill these guys deal with

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:07.449
the devil totally fine we got the red

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:12.759
heart to back it up right now we got

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:14.349
more red hearts I think you know we

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:15.069
could still become guppy as well which

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:17.289
would be nice

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:18.699
so let's work our way down there that

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:21.610
could be our secret room so we might

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:22.960
just need two bombs instead of one key

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.889
to get into the shop with the shop is

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.839
fairly important to me right now because

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:33.159
it holds many items that could

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:36.400
eventually turn into being able to use

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:38.629
dull razor more frequently

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.310
even like a second trinket would be

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:43.849
pretty useful right now I would pay for

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:46.400
mom's purse there we go we got a key we

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:47.599
got some money pretty lucky get let's

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:53.090
just go see what we get in our curse

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:55.310
room got two bombs and curse of the

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.050
tower now curse of the tower is like the

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:59.210
exact opposite of what we want to take

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.529
here you might say oh you'll baby why

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.300
are you being a baby I actually think

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:05.569
that those people like almost don't

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.370
exist anymore if you still watching

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:09.499
Isaac at this point something about the

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.210
series has like an enduring legacy for

00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:12.650
you you know you enjoy watching and I

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.449
feel like I don't need to bring up that

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.879
straw man argument of like well you know

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:18.379
blah blah blah um you know I thank you

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:20.449
for continuing to watch and support the

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:24.830
show dude mom's purse we called it now

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:27.699
we can go back and take the I forgot

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:30.319
what this trinket is actually called

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:32.680
locust of it must be locust of death

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:35.599
right it's been a while

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.789
locust of locust a famine excuse me all

00:07:35.599 --> 00:07:39.949
right well more power to you

00:07:37.789 --> 00:07:41.000
yeah you might say I'm being a baby for

00:07:39.949 --> 00:07:43.610
this but did you see how the brains

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.789
challenge went like I let the game

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:47.689
supply the novelty will just supply the

00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:49.250
entertainment and access to said

00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:53.419
entertainment and I think that works out

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:56.629
better for us so mom's purse may be like

00:07:53.419 --> 00:07:58.669
a solid like b-plus right now something

00:07:56.629 --> 00:08:00.289
like that basically allows us to hold a

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:05.479
trinket which will generate a lot of

00:08:00.289 --> 00:08:07.610
flies for us far from bad we are missing

00:08:05.479 --> 00:08:10.759
out a little bit if we could just use it

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:13.460
once per room we're so unbelievably set

00:08:10.759 --> 00:08:16.520
it's like Tammy's head and mob the void

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:18.409
all combined into one wicked sweet item

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:21.819
which is definitely phrasing I use on a

00:08:18.409 --> 00:08:26.180
regular basis wicked sweep

00:08:21.819 --> 00:08:29.449
we're also gaining like an absurd amount

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:30.889
of demon hearts here I'm not sure if

00:08:29.449 --> 00:08:35.149
it's tied to our luck or just you know

00:08:30.889 --> 00:08:36.709
we're lucky you know our in-game luck or

00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:39.750
our out of game luck if you know what I

00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:43.469
mean cuz you know she's so lucky

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:48.769
she's a star but she cries cries cries

00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:50.850
gets those diamond hot stinking 15 cents

00:08:48.769 --> 00:08:54.529
no joke

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:58.759
dang Keesling sang that at karaoke and

00:08:54.529 --> 00:09:01.589
PAX East you wouldn't peg him for a a

00:08:58.759 --> 00:09:04.350
Britney Spears lucky era fan but there

00:09:01.589 --> 00:09:06.449
he was and you know what he deserves to

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:08.459
do in karaoke whatever he wants to a

00:09:06.449 --> 00:09:10.680
karaoke cuz he also did nothing but a G

00:09:08.459 --> 00:09:12.720
thang with me without there being any

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.310
lyrics on the screen which was very

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.529
difficult and as a result you know you

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:19.319
can acquiesce yourself shut if you got a

00:09:16.529 --> 00:09:20.910
problem with it not gonna buy anything

00:09:19.319 --> 00:09:23.339
here I'm not even gonna buy a key

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:26.610
because the key is not worth the money

00:09:23.339 --> 00:09:28.439
right now in my opinion we are only

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.699
gonna have ice caves - yeah we're only

00:09:28.439 --> 00:09:31.319
have two more shops over the course of

00:09:29.699 --> 00:09:32.910
the rest of the run so unless we get

00:09:31.319 --> 00:09:34.649
like Guppies tail or something we're not

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:39.180
gonna worry too much about it even

00:09:34.649 --> 00:09:43.259
though we did just open a red chest kind

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:45.870
of similarly I feel like you know with

00:09:43.259 --> 00:09:48.680
the hero font here and all the HP that

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:51.449
we've accrued we basically have just one

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.649
it's not my favorite kind of challenge

00:09:51.449 --> 00:09:54.860
because again the challenge is not

00:09:52.649 --> 00:09:57.360
mechanics driven it's mostly just like

00:09:54.860 --> 00:10:01.589
two items that are similar isn't that

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:03.029
veered but it's alright you know it's

00:10:01.589 --> 00:10:04.680
refreshing to have once a little bit on

00:10:03.029 --> 00:10:07.649
the easier side maybe it's a nice thing

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:09.389
to do in advance of us doing the own

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:13.279
on-street challenge which is definitely

00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:13.279
a little bit more on the difficult side

00:10:13.309 --> 00:10:19.230
that challenge could mess with us so I

00:10:16.709 --> 00:10:22.230
know Corey you know twitch.tv slash

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:23.910
Black Flag he's a very very good Isaac

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:25.319
player I believe that ona and streak was

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.160
the only one that he failed his first

00:10:25.319 --> 00:10:29.970
time through

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:37.199
it was either a him or a or cobalt that

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:39.149
said that was the one no cobalt invented

00:10:37.199 --> 00:10:42.470
that challenge I think I've got the the

00:10:39.149 --> 00:10:42.470
history of that right so

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:48.460
yeah I believe so but anyway it's no

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:51.280
joke I mean the brains challenge is

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:52.600
probably a little bit more annoying just

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.760
in terms of like not being able

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.470
especially with the the harbingers cost

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.690
me a lot they gave me a lot but they

00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:00.250
cost me a lot too but anyway well we'll

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:02.110
return to that challenge at some point

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:04.330
and and get it figured out we got it

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:06.520
probably like at least a week of

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:08.410
challenge reduce to do just to get

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.630
everything on lock but certainly I'm

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:14.770
looking forward to doing a couple of oh

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:16.150
you want to come in tomorrow hello I'm

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:18.130
looking forward to doing a couple

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:20.470
refresh runs as well just to remind

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:22.390
myself oh right not the whole game as

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:25.180
challenges to be honest with you though

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:27.580
the it's like inside baseball that no

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:29.650
deal with a double its inside baseball

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:32.410
maybe not everybody cares about keep

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:38.140
myself enough HP so I can actually go to

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:41.290
the boss Trap room if necessary but the

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:46.380
Isaac backlog is really not very long at

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:49.030
the present moment which means that I

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:50.740
haven't been doing like I'm not super

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:53.800
advanced as far as like the challenges

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:55.150
go versus what you're seeing right now

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.230
you know I might be like two or three

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.900
challenges ahead of what you're looking

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:59.980
at right now so it's not like I have a

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.990
ton of challenges that I've done in the

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:06.130
back end and can just get back to it so

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:08.470
I'm looking forward to getting back to

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:11.520
the the Refresh experience has been like

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:11.520
a month of doing challenges

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:18.340
I'm drowsy acceptable I don't know why I

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.810
tried to thread the needle there and

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.110
then stood in place when we got hit

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:22.150
again

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:24.940
it's curse to the unknown curse of the

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:27.880
unknown is like a psychological damage

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:29.560
dude it allows you or it tricks you into

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.490
into playing worse or at least it tricks

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:37.690
me into play away now you want to leave

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:38.190
you know you wanna go you know you wanna

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:43.410
stay

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:46.000
tamo wait why you just got in here dude

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:48.180
you don't forget I didn't I didn't open

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.450
the door and go to mom come here buddy

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:54.690
you banged on the door and I let you

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:57.400
into the office and now you're going no

00:12:54.690 --> 00:13:00.700
can you acquiesce this door for me

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:02.410
maybe I will maybe I won't I mean I will

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:05.500
if you give me the the signal that you

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:07.030
want it to be open but if you if you

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:09.790
just wanted to be open so you can see

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:11.170
outside can't happen if you want to

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.850
actually get out there yourself and do

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:14.620
something then by all means you know if

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:21.040
you're all of a sudden you got a poop

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:32.290
oh he's knocking come on get yourself

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:37.960
away don't vomit near my office chair if

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:45.300
you knock then I will acquiesce do not

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:45.300
poop yourself in here hey hey hey yeah

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.420
said knock knock knockin on heaven's

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.050
door but it didn't really work out very

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:54.670
well

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:56.620
oh the damage on the bright side got a

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:58.810
deal with the devil back dude Judas a

00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:00.520
shadow it's like really good we'll

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:06.670
probably never use it cuz we're gaining

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:10.980
HP too quickly but it's not like it's

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:13.680
bad that it exists I will also say

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:16.660
getting a cube of meat is pretty nice

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:19.030
because when we use dull razor you know

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:21.100
on an occasion or two there we use dull

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:24.220
razor we're not able to finish enemies

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:27.400
off with just the same value now as long

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:29.770
as we're little aware of the situation

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:34.330
we can also duck in there with our cube

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:35.830
of mead get a pretty good shot to take

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:39.010
them out before they have any chance to

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:41.710
back off so crack into then we got a bed

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:44.140
we can say you know I'm so negative

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:46.000
about it we might as well I'm negative

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:49.780
about it because it's a distraction you

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:53.730
know there's no need for that that's

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:53.730
that's the opioid of the masses

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:58.340
you know that's that's the little

00:14:55.660 --> 00:15:02.300
drizzle uh honey while we're clinging to

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:04.760
the wall of a bottomless pit we're gonna

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:06.410
win this run regardless we don't need to

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.450
have three spirit oh it's 3 spirit oh

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:11.660
it's negative 3 spirit arts say it with

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:15.370
me it don't matter we got this I can't

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:17.660
get that black heart now that bothers me

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:19.220
it's trying to kill that invincible

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:23.890
enemy with my Cuba meat wouldn't

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:23.890
necessarily suggest it as a big positive

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:29.960
NL are you ever gonna look up whether or

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:31.760
not luck affects athame you know mob the

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:41.000
void etcetera etc that would take all

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:42.230
the fun out of it dude it's like it's

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.660
like looking up the odds of winning the

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:46.430
lottery I know what a conception I think

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:48.590
they should be forced to and I think the

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:50.150
same way about video games like I think

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:51.860
you should be forced if you're a game

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.600
developer and you have microtransactions

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:58.010
for loot boxes I think you should be

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:59.660
forced to reveal the percentages of

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:01.550
getting each item in those loot boxes

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:05.060
the same way a casino does that being

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:08.330
said when I roll up to which it never

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:09.950
happens but when I'm in Vegas against my

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.480
will and I roll up to a slot machine

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:13.280
I already you know I got twenty bucks in

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.840
my pocket that twenty bucks is gone I'm

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.070
not gonna look up the win rate on the

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:20.030
side of the screen and be like oh this

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:22.670
one's got a you know 0.91 expected value

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:26.330
this one's got a 0.86 like I'm already

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:29.000
I'm already gambling at that point you

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:30.170
know we're splitting hairs some people

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.880
disagree talked about it in a

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:34.910
battlegrounds episode recently so I

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:37.310
don't mean to like dig that up rehash

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:40.280
that old topic but people do disagree

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:41.360
with me to some extent not not many like

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:45.110
it's not like it's a controversial

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:49.760
opinion but I am kind of of the opinion

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:52.190
that loot boxes and games kind of take

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:55.610
advantage of like a a wiring flaw in

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:56.780
human psychology I think there's

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:58.130
something to be said about personal

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.540
responsibility you know there's this

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:02.630
great movie called thank you for smoking

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:04.280
which is very popular but if in case you

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:05.870
haven't seen it I would give it my

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:08.880
personal recommend

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:09.810
it's a tough one I think I'm gonna you

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.340
know what let's do it I don't think

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:13.380
we've done any cheesy boss rush stuff

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:19.110
plus it gives me a chance to talk so

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:21.360
let's go for it but basically Aaron

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:23.220
Eckhart works as a lobbyist for the the

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.420
cigarette industry in that movie and you

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:30.480
kind of see him as like a charismatic

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:32.670
villain and he's got a a nemesis in the

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:35.640
movie as played by the wonderful William

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:36.780
H Macy who is like a Vermont senator

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.580
who's like you know there should be

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:41.700
tighter regulations on smoking and as a

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:43.320
nonsmoker you kind of watch that or at

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:45.930
least I did when I was younger and I was

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:48.330
like you know yeah stick it to him right

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:50.280
like this is a predatory industry then

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:51.600
aaron eckhart kind kind of turns it

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.000
around on him and it's like yeah well

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:56.250
what about you know cheddar cheese and

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.720
then the obesity epidemic like Vermont's

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.340
one of the biggest exporters of cheddar

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.440
cheese in this whole country and you

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.910
know type-2 diabetes and blood pressure

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.230
and blah blah blah and you're kind of

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.670
like okay I see where you're coming for

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:09.150
I still sorta you know you got to treat

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:10.080
them differently I think but I see where

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:11.640
you're coming from personal

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.100
responsibility is important you know I'm

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:17.460
glad we live in a world where you know a

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:19.410
can of soda doesn't cost $8 you know I

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:22.040
think if you if you're an adult and you

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:24.750
know the the risks you should be able to

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:26.400
acquiesce but I know something about

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:28.770
loot boxes and games where I'm like I

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.870
feel like the industry has been

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:32.160
disrupted faster than like regulation

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.200
could be made not that I want it all

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.060
tied up and you know big government

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.920
quote-unquote you know the taxation is

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:41.730
theft etc etc basically I don't know

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:43.500
what I'm talking about however I think

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:45.480
if you if you have micro transaction

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.920
fees from micro transactions for loot

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.260
boxes you should have to put the winning

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:51.180
percentages or the payout percentages it

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:53.310
just allows you to right now there's

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:54.090
like literally no ability to make an

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:55.260
informed decision

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:59.490
it's like putting the nutritional

00:18:55.260 --> 00:19:02.280
information in restaurants I actually I

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:03.870
don't like personally that they put the

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.100
nutritional information in restaurants

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:07.170
because whenever I go out to eat

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:09.030
something that's bad for me I just kind

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:10.410
of I like being like yeah it's bad for

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.380
me but I don't know how bad so there's

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:14.970
like a level of plausible deniability

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:16.020
whereas now I'm like 1300 calories

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:17.900
that's crazy

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:20.150
so

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:21.680
but I think that without the nutritional

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:23.900
information it was like literally

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.970
impossible to make an informed decision

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:28.610
you could logically know like yeah Big

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:30.380
Mac is bad for me or whatever but you

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:33.350
don't know what what the actual like

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:34.610
macronutrient breakdown is right it's

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:36.140
the same way you're like you know in

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:37.670
battle grounds or Counter Strike global

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:40.100
Offensive you're like I'm wasting my

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:43.460
money buying these keys but I don't know

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:45.320
to what extent like my am I really

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:48.380
really wasting my money buying these

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:50.000
keys or am I like is there a modest

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:54.530
chance I could come close to recouping

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.940
my initial investment anyway that's

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.770
that's my two cents in the matter

00:19:55.940 --> 00:20:00.050
I'm not saying you know a game dev

00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:03.880
should be in jail for this but when I'm

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:05.390
like looking at a game with

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.950
microtransactions I'm like why aren't

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:10.220
you telling me to loot the loot drop

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:11.390
rate just seems like you know you got if

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.770
you act like there's something to hide

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:15.410
maybe there's something to hide there

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:17.180
that's not really it's kind of a fallacy

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:19.880
you know that's that's like the Patriot

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:21.470
Act fallacy is like well you can look at

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:23.900
my stuff cuz I got nothing to hide but

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:26.990
in this case I actually think it applies

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:31.360
you know just show me if you want to

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:34.640
spend a thousand dollars online on

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:36.260
in-game microtransactions doesn't bother

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:38.390
me I just wish the drop rate was there

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:40.640
so you know you knew what you're getting

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:43.040
roughly an expected value at that

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:46.850
thousand bucks that's my two cents hey

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:48.050
let me out of this room I forgot we

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:50.990
actually get permanent polaroid

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:52.490
invincibility now so I'm still like I'm

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:54.980
glad we did this room but I'm just kind

00:20:52.490 --> 00:21:00.950
of like I'm over it sure we got homing

00:20:54.980 --> 00:21:03.130
tiers the homing tiers are good let me

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:06.830
out please

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:14.690
pin is there a pin others like a there's

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:21.350
a fake pin how are you still alive this

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:23.450
is too much we haven't lost very much HP

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:24.860
I kind of like I'm getting mine flooded

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:29.269
into thinking I'm playing worse than I

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:31.159
actually am based on the fact that that

00:21:29.269 --> 00:21:32.690
every time I use dull razor it makes the

00:21:31.159 --> 00:21:34.399
sound of me getting hit I'm like man I'm

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:36.970
really stinking to join up but we're

00:21:34.399 --> 00:21:39.649
actually doing like totally fine

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:41.080
yeah whatever hit me you don't have the

00:21:39.649 --> 00:21:45.080
guts

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:46.370
dude do you have it no is the answer to

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:54.769
that question in this case

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:58.159
hey stop jumping okay you can't like you

00:21:54.769 --> 00:22:01.909
can't hurt me at all here I will slay

00:21:58.159 --> 00:22:05.330
you keep in mind that even if we get

00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:07.039
hurt well we have a theme we also still

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:08.480
get a theme it's not like just because

00:22:07.039 --> 00:22:10.159
we didn't use dull razor we don't get

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:13.610
the ability to actually benefit from

00:22:10.159 --> 00:22:15.080
that right so like we're laughing all

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:19.789
the way to the bank basically every time

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:22.190
we get hit here so we get lost flowy and

00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:25.940
we're gonna look for tinted rocks and

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:28.669
then head downwards essentially we're

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:30.289
just kind of running out the clock on

00:22:28.669 --> 00:22:32.419
this was an easy challenge I'm hopeful

00:22:30.289 --> 00:22:34.340
that we get something useful for

00:22:32.419 --> 00:22:37.909
finishing this challenge cuz I honestly

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:41.480
do not recall the most wonderful

00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:43.340
reindeer of all I really think that

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:46.129
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer it has

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:49.610
like the worst message of any song that

00:22:46.129 --> 00:22:51.710
we get children to sing basically like

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:53.450
hey yeah you might get bullied but as

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:56.570
long as you're useful like people will

00:22:53.450 --> 00:23:00.019
eventually come around basically the way

00:22:56.570 --> 00:23:04.159
the song goes is everybody hates Rudolph

00:23:00.019 --> 00:23:08.389
that's not the tune then all the

00:23:04.159 --> 00:23:11.450
reindeer loved him because he saved they

00:23:08.389 --> 00:23:14.779
loved their jobs they shouldn't have

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:15.860
treated him kindly from the start cuz

00:23:14.779 --> 00:23:17.990
that woods

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:19.040
like why aren't they just night here's a

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:21.380
good song for you

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:23.510
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer had a

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:25.640
very shiny nose all the other reindeer

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:27.890
minded their own business because

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:30.230
everybody's got problems then one foggy

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:32.420
Christmas Eve santa came to say Rudolph

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:34.610
with your nose so bright won't you guide

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:38.570
my sleigh tonight then all the other

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:40.580
reindeer looked upon Rudolph with

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:43.280
jealousy because he used his genetic

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:45.220
advantage to improve his position at the

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:50.860
company as they shouted out with glee

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:55.220
hooray Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:56.990
you're promoted to VP of Finance or

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.460
something you know you get the idea I

00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:05.240
just think it's kind of like a bad

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:06.920
message the message is like like here

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:08.210
let me put it this way me here's the way

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.010
it goes right now they're all mean to

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:11.690
Rudolph and then Rudolph bails them out

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:14.870
on Christmas you know what they should

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:18.860
do then one foggy Christmas Eve santa

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:21.970
came to say Rudolph with your nose so

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:27.020
bright won't you guide my sleigh tonight

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:30.170
Rudolph just then rebuked him I've

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:34.190
reported all these jerks to HR you

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:36.920
should have stopped the bullying from

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:39.920
poisoning your corporate culture you

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:44.450
know and then you know just then Rudolph

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:48.230
gave his notice two weeks on the job if

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:50.570
you give me a bad reference I'll sue you

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:52.580
into the Stone Age like everyone's a

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:54.610
jerk to Rudolph at a job that he's

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:57.830
basically born into he has no choice

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:59.090
then they asked him for help he's well

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:02.090
within his rights to be like I'm not

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:06.410
gonna help you Dana you never let me

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:08.080
join in all your reindeer games what's

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:11.300
the lesson they're pretty good for kids

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:13.280
hey be mean to people because they'll

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:16.490
probably give you like one bailout

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:20.300
before they really get mad at you I much

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:22.610
prefer the lesson of like Santa Claus is

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:24.620
coming to town you know he sees you when

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:27.770
you're sleeping he knows when you're

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:29.180
awake he knows when you've been bad or

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:31.100
good so be good for

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:34.040
goodness sake that's a way better lesson

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:36.050
a little creepy perhaps but it lets you

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:40.670
know kids someone's always watching so

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:42.650
be on your best behavior honestly it's

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:44.960
gonna sound cynical but I think that's a

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:47.870
message kids have no morals

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:50.030
they have like a moral compass that's

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:51.380
created by like Disney movies and then

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:52.550
like their own personal feelings and

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:55.160
their parents and stuff like that but

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:58.640
like a child is a tabula rasa when it

00:25:55.160 --> 00:26:00.200
comes to that stuff you know they don't

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:03.200
know what I mean nice and cooperative

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:06.500
you got it you gotta put like extrinsic

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:09.770
checks in there at first that's NL

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:12.400
children are they're beautiful pure and

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:15.860
innocent creatures they were animals

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:18.860
okay that was a teacher I've seen kids

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:21.260
our main dude you got it kids are mean

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:23.330
but they're also pretty dumb so all you

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:26.330
do is go hey don't be mean that's not

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:29.540
nice yeah whatever screw you hey don't

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:31.100
be mean a mythical present-giving demon

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:33.350
is watching and he's not gonna give you

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:36.800
an n64 this Christmas okay I'll be good

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:38.300
you know like we need that sort of

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:40.790
guidance and if you think that doesn't

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:42.500
apply to adults tell me how you drive

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:43.880
normally versus how you drive when

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:48.410
there's a police officer behind you on

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:50.390
the road everybody benefits or society

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:52.700
benefits if everybody thinks that you

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:53.930
know somebody more powerful than them is

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:57.700
just looking over their shoulder a

00:26:53.930 --> 00:27:00.770
little bit that's that's my two cents on

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:04.010
life anyway dude I'm on my best behavior

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:05.420
in public all the time when I was 17 I

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:08.780
could be a little bit of a jerk in

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:10.280
public I'm not saying you should and I'm

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:11.390
not saying I really even well I wasn't

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:13.970
one of those kids you see like going

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:15.560
into Walmart smashing them you know bag

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:18.800
a milk on the ground and then go whoo

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:20.360
whoops loose-lipped you know but now

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.280
there's always I always think about this

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:25.190
there's always a chance that you know

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:26.510

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:28.910

youtuber goes viral you know I think

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:39.560
that's having even a modicum of a public

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:40.850
image is keeping me honest and keeping

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.860
me well-behaved that I think that's a

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:44.929
good thing should you want to do it be

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:46.820
you're innately an amoral creature yeah
