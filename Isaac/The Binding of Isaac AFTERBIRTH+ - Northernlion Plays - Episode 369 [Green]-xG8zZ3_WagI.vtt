make a joke but actually I'm going to

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.950
think it's time to highlight a serious

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.620
issue plaguing I can't think of a single

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.680
city in West Virginia hear me out your

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.629
West Virginia which means good these

include that's a different place

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:03.359
altogether West Virginia's number one

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:06.210
city is Chesapeake Chesapeake I'm sorry

a second West Virginia cities by

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.619
population Charleston of course is the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.630
classic way you always remember it

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.340
Charlestown Morgantown Huntington

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.650
wheeling Beckley mom's burned in

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.180
Parkersburg Clarksburg and Fairmont and

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.320
Harpers Ferry blue field in Elkins in

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.570
Charlestown and Princeton

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.090
you know everybody should know this and

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.000
of course the state bird is a Northern

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.799
Cardinal are you telling me that West

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.600
Virginia has a city called Charleston

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.340
and a city called Charlestown this is

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.470
why I can never take people seriously

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.149
when they're you complain about me

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.829
mispronouncing like something from their

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:52.500
hometown well this is quite the surprise

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:57.560
isn't it obviously we'll take this can

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.560
we we can exit without dying for certain

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:05.210
shouldn't have done that deal with the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.860
devil leave it was worth a try

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.600
in the sense that it wasn't worth it at

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.100
all but like we got brimstone nine lines

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.440
out of this floor regardless so it's

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.680
pretty sick anyway what the heck was I

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.780
even talking about I've recognized that

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.370
we in Canada we have our own weird names

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.470
for things

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:27.440
I would like we have a lot of weird ones

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.819
moose factory Thunder Bay this is where

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.080
I say that something is weird and then

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.540
someone comes in and tells me that

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.870
actually it's like a incredibly you know

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.860
sacred Native American word but anyway

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.660
First Nations Aboriginal Trina Jennifer

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.160
Lopez four kids and I got to take all

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:52.370
their bad access to showbiz uh leave

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:54.620
anything here nothing here apparently a

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.190
town in Newfoundland called dildo is

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.970
that mouse pointer off that screen these

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.590
are weird names

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.670
I still think moose factories the

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.670
weirdest for sure but

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.349
it's got a lot of stuff named after

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.909
England as well there's a London Ontario

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:18.620
there's a York there's a North York

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:20.629
there's a Yorkdale mall I can't think of

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.069
any other English city names there's

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:25.099
probably a Wales somewhere I don't know

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.299
Camden and I ain't talking about New

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.580
Jersey I don't even know where I'm going

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.620
with this if I had to do a power ranking

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.849
of American state cell and I'd like to

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.280
do it because I don't shy away from

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.319
offending apparently like eighty percent

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.700
of my audience base I'm just going to

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.290
tell you right now from a Canadian

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.260
perspective here's some top-tier states

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.319
in no particular order s tier states

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.379
Washington State Big Ups Seattle I like

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.849
you culturally very similar to in fact

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.530
Washington State's is more culturally

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:56.390
similar to Vancouver than our adjacent

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.950
province Alberta California a lot of

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.540
people got bad words for California I

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.459
got nothing but nice things to say I

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.549
hate Los Angeles San Francisco's pretty

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.980
cool and I hear that you know Northern

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:09.019
California is pretty awesome as well New

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.549
York State how could I refuse

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:15.319
can't forget about a New York state of

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:17.900
mind like California a great tradition

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:21.109
in the hip hop industry which is

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.060
obviously a huge criteria for me as a

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.800
hip hop enthusiast of the highest

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.070
magnitude you guys heard of this guy of

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.639
vanilla ice we got some heat protected

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:35.060
also attack well this guy come on give

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:40.940
me money please um plus most populous

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:42.650
city in Canada or the US New York City

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.550
in case you were confused I wasn't

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.889
talking about Rochester Utica to

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.120
Syracuse other cities in upstate New

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.060
York that I'm starting to struggle to

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.570
remember the name of

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.870
where's where's the bolt castle let's in

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:03.250
Rochester I think I'm stalling yeah

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.050
we'll take compost let's do it uh Tyler

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.000
top to your states you know what I'm

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.800
going to give it to Texas here's the

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.860
deal I don't necessarily agree with all

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.200
Texan ideals but I accept that Texas is

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.690
a surprisingly diverse state cultural

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.720
hubs like Austin San Antonio huge city

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.060
in Houston Dallas big city as well it's

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.040
a cosmopolitan place respect that you

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.610
got your own thing going up I respect

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.830
that

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.600
part of the Texas identity is that you

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.420
know you're texting before your American

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.300
that's kind of cool again not you know a

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.160
hundred percent necessarily on my list

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.360
of places to live but I respect that

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.070
nonetheless and I think you've got to

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.080
give them any state that could

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.450
reasonably secede and you would probably

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.770
roll your eyes but just be like well if

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.960
anybody's going to do it that makes

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.300
sense I'll give it to you though I think

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:56.980
if I'm going to preserve the s tier as

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.300
being as being you know very special

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.570
those are my three states New York

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.630
Caliphate forces New York California

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.560
Washington State and Texas

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:09.400
congratulations those are my s2 your

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.080
state I'm not going to go through every

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.550
American state that's just ridiculous I

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.830
think we're going to go eights here you

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.750
got to throw Hawaii in there you know

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.540
not quite s tier because I think it's

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.220
predominantly you know for most people

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.960
it's a place you go for tourism not

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.390
necessarily to live although maybe it's

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:29.080
a dream location for some people

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:30.640
I throw Oregon in there again culturally

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.170
similar to the west coast obviously I

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.970
got my own personal bias in there

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.070
because they it is the west coast so I

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.750
like Portland I played mention gathering

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.260
there once it was a relatively fun time

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.940
I like your bar K and craft beer scene

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:46.150
take tractor beam it's really nice to

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:48.430
yours upgrade actually I'll tell you

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:53.590
what I'll get all of the eastern states

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:55.570
that have robust economies or at least

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.400
large populations that I'm unfamiliar

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.440
with let's throw them in here Illinois

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:03.810
get in here Illinois you got Chicago

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.810
I've never been but I've heard things

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.759
Pennsylvania Philadelphia Pittsburgh I

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.580
hope you're not out there going NL

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:17.389
please name my safe I'll give you one

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:20.360
for Ohio Cincinnati Cleveland you got a

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:23.210
couple of big cities in there if we're

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.340
getting down into life I'm just going to

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.560
avoid offending as many people as

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.660
possible if we're to start with this I

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.030
think you can see we're going to die

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.680
that takes us to six lives and then we

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.960
bust through here again and then we take

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.789
this so we can fly a little light on HP

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.210
but this is like we're in a great spot

00:07:37.789 --> 00:07:42.680
in terms of like damage without a doubt

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:44.630
I'm going to just say it f tear State

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.610
Delaware I know if you live in Delaware

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:49.310
you're like that's not fair we're the

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:53.690
first state you know take it from me I

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:55.520
grew up in a city and our claim to fame

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.530
there are two claims of Fame one is

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:01.639
biggest mall between Toronto and

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:03.349
Montreal second we were the first

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:05.750
capital of Canada back when they were

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:07.340
like you know four provinces and we were

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.509
worried about the Americans invading

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:12.919
some things never change

00:08:08.509 --> 00:08:14.180
oh yeah princely and puberty closing in

00:08:12.919 --> 00:08:15.710
on an HP upgrade that's going to be a

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:19.219
spirit hardness relatively meaningless

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:20.810
but still we gotta explore here it's a

00:08:19.219 --> 00:08:22.099
bad look I'm just going to own up to it

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.919
you know the same thing people would be

00:08:22.099 --> 00:08:27.830
like oh you grew up in Kingston it's so

00:08:24.919 --> 00:08:30.979
small I'd be like hey we've got the

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:35.800
biggest mall between Toronto and

00:08:30.979 --> 00:08:39.620
Montreal if you were do sometimes we get

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:41.659
mid-tier artists that play concerts in

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.760
Toronto and Montreal and then do a

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:44.899
stopover in Kingston for a little bit

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.790
they're like a if we're here we might as

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:49.579
well make some money that ain't so bad

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:51.110
and you know what it ain't so bad you

00:08:49.579 --> 00:08:53.570
get a little bit of the cultural runoff

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:56.029
I liked it I'm proud of where I grew up

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:58.730
I like the town the Delaware you got to

00:08:56.029 --> 00:09:01.399
take it from me probably the most

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:03.230
forgotten American state in the sparkle

00:09:01.399 --> 00:09:06.440
quizzes of can you name 50 American

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:07.850
states right just I'm throwing it out

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.950
there's a couple other ones I got to

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:12.500
give it to you know what I'm going to

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:14.029
elevate you from zis here to ft or Rhode

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.610
Island because I hear that Providence

00:09:14.029 --> 00:09:19.370
Rhode Island has fantastic

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:22.430
Pizza so you're lucky we're it not for

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:23.600
the pizza you know what I'm gonna take

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:25.160
you down to the Z's here because I just

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.230
remember that family guys set there so

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:32.990
I'm sorry you know I'm sure you whether

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:35.300
you're like I would get it a lot sense

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:36.800
you know what I'm willing to take a

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.510
gamble on this this is we're playing

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:42.770
with fire at this point Kevin Federline

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:44.030
style why Rhode Island well it's not

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:46.700
that I got anything against you it's

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:49.550
just you know why does your island to

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:52.120
get to be a state you're the only states

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:55.100
not called Hawaii Island

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.720
it's not called Floridian Peninsula the

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.910
Rhode Island apparently gets to have

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.710
island in its name without ever you know

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:03.590
facing repercussions for it I don't buy

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:07.250
it that's why you're in the Z's here but

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:08.450
you know Providence if used to seed the

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:11.210
world's your oyster as far as I'm

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:12.590
concerned I just want to point out in

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:15.230
case it's not abundantly clear all of

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:17.360
this is hanging cheek except for

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:23.080
Delaware I feel for you but New

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:26.470
Hampshire come on New Hampshire Maine

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:28.730
just become part of Massachusetts

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:30.080
I'm not even know if you're next to

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:33.020
Massachusetts I just know you're in the

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.760
general vicinity just you know forsake

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:37.100
your own individual identity for the

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.839
sake of someone from abroad being able

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.640
to understand American geography that

00:10:38.839 --> 00:10:45.500
much better you know you could say Oh

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:48.400
America we got 50 states but really well

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:50.290
this is I'm a little scared here

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.300
you can cut a couple of those out

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:53.500
without it being like a big deal right

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:57.040
I'm not saying cut them out like

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:58.630
eliminate the people who live there I'm

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.250
just saying you know why not why not

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:02.740
merge like say what you will about

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:03.970
Canada there's only a couple of parts of

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.490
the country where if you were going

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:07.810
through is like if a hoarding expert

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:12.670
came through they would be like okay

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:14.170
come on Nova Scotia New Brunswick get

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:17.320
together you guys like you're going to

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:18.670
become one of the same no nothing but

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.080
respect for my folks down in the

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:23.920
Maritimes I understand you've got unique

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:26.500
cultural identities I'm just saying from

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:28.120
abroad map building perspective it

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.340
called it causes a little bit of a

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:33.780
cumbersome Mis which is not an

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:37.810
expression but you get the idea right

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:39.490
Ontario huge Quebec huge very culturally

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.840
unique is the way I'm going to phrase

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:43.270
that I've been to Quebec many times I

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:46.140
like it it's it's definitely its own

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:49.500
unique area within Canada which is cool

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:52.270
Manitoba enormous Saskatchewan

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:55.750
rectangular also pretty enormous Alberta

00:11:52.270 --> 00:12:01.450
enormous culturally unique we have so

00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:02.940
many spiders on love in life so we want

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:06.340
to kill things as quickly as possible

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:08.410
without using flies and spiders and then

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:10.330
we're doubling our flies and spiders is

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:12.690
this correct like I don't even want to

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:15.730
fight these guys I'd rather just leave

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:17.140
after getting all the stuff that we can

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:18.370
get to try to keep our spider game as

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:21.460
high as it can be British Columbia

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:22.870
obviously huge that's probably not the

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.010
way that you should evaluate the stuff I

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.300
can't believe we're 12 minutes into this

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:27.880
video I'm still talking about this but I

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:30.010
mean look we got brimstone 9lives lots

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.870
of great items compost is you know it's

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:33.190
raising a tomb of the Spider Queen army

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:36.610
for me that's a reference to heroes of

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:38.559
the storm I'm sorry

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:42.129
here's the storm is he like a can't win

00:12:38.559 --> 00:12:43.480
situation man first off I know it's true

00:12:42.129 --> 00:12:45.369
because as soon as I brought this up I

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:49.059
felt a collective eye roll from the

00:12:45.369 --> 00:12:51.220
audience but for people who like MOBAs a

00:12:49.059 --> 00:12:52.989
lot of the touch' pick that up obviously

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:55.149
a lot of the time they look at heroes of

00:12:52.989 --> 00:12:57.360
the storm I go as a baby MOBA I find

00:12:55.149 --> 00:13:00.040
this sentiment very strange to me

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.779
because I don't understand what the

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.519
problem is was playing a casualized

00:13:01.779 --> 00:13:04.629
version of a video game genre that's

00:13:03.519 --> 00:13:07.209
still pretty hardcore

00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:10.420
what what percentage of dota players go

00:13:07.209 --> 00:13:12.759
pro like point zero zero one percent one

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:16.660
in a hundred thousand maybe it's not

00:13:12.759 --> 00:13:18.459
like I'm I play video games to trick my

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:20.170
brain into thinking that I'm

00:13:18.459 --> 00:13:22.179
accomplishing things without actually

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:23.920
accomplishing them and here's the storm

00:13:22.179 --> 00:13:25.629
allows me to accomplish that faster so I

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.549
don't feel like there's any noteworthy

00:13:25.629 --> 00:13:29.410
snob enos that makes any sense there but

00:13:27.549 --> 00:13:31.360
I digress not insulting dota either a

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:32.139
game that I have you know more hours and

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.089
I'd like to admit

00:13:32.139 --> 00:13:35.739
probably other I definitely have more

00:13:34.089 --> 00:13:40.959
hours in rebirth I checked the other day

00:13:35.739 --> 00:13:42.549
I have 2200 hours in rebirth almost 100

00:13:40.959 --> 00:13:45.939
real-time days that's a frightening

00:13:42.549 --> 00:13:49.449
stead but I mean it is also like

00:13:45.939 --> 00:13:53.949
basically my job so I accept that as

00:13:49.449 --> 00:13:56.079
well anyway the point is I hate

00:13:53.949 --> 00:13:57.249
sauerkraut another point is then the

00:13:56.079 --> 00:13:58.449
other thing is people who don't like

00:13:57.249 --> 00:14:00.220
MOBAs just look at it and they see a

00:13:58.449 --> 00:14:03.730
mobile which is actually way more fair

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:04.929
than the alternative criticism play you

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:06.730
can't really win with heroes of the

00:14:04.929 --> 00:14:07.209
storm but I like it I've been having fun

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:09.189
with it

00:14:07.209 --> 00:14:10.959
and I think that's the important thing

00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:12.879
as soon as I stop having fun with it as

00:14:10.959 --> 00:14:15.519
soon as I feel the MOBA salt creep in

00:14:12.879 --> 00:14:18.009
I'm like that's it for me today I think

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:23.169
it's like you have two people with a

00:14:18.009 --> 00:14:26.350
personality like mine have to treat like

00:14:23.169 --> 00:14:28.509
I want to I don't think I should

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:30.790
unfortunately you have to treat MOBA

00:14:28.509 --> 00:14:34.329
like you know like a recovering

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:36.459
alcoholic treats alcohol which I mean I

00:14:34.329 --> 00:14:38.410
actually don't know anything about I'm

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:40.419
assuming that abstinence is probably the

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:42.100
preferred course of action there which

00:14:40.419 --> 00:14:44.470
doesn't fit with my point whatsoever but

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:46.720
you know as soon as you start to feel

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:48.400
yourself relapsing into MOBA salt and it

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.260
comes for everyone

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:53.590
I have never met anybody that played a

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:54.850
MOBA that wasn't frustrated by it as

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:56.350
soon as you feel that mobile assault

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:58.240
coming back which usually happens I

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.870
would say around lost number two for me

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:02.350
right now

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:05.500
I'm like I'm done it's like being in a

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:07.750
casino I'm like it's really fun until my

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:12.310
not even like me casino but unless it's

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:13.540
in Tower unite of course since I feel

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:15.520
that mobile assault come in you know

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:18.520
life's life's too short when I was when

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:20.350
I was 24 playing a lot of dota getting

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.020
that mobile assault and it felt it felt

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:24.730
okay I was like this is my leisure time

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:27.570
no one could tell me I can't hate by

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:29.590
leisure time now I'm like dude

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:30.640
everybody's going to die someday

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:32.830
I don't know if I want to be on my

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:35.200
deathbed being like I spent a hundred

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:40.570
hours being cheesed off at heroes of the

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:42.760
storm but anyway I digress still think

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:45.190
it's a good game a game that does a very

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:47.830
good job of curtailing the MOBA salt

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:52.750
because losing I mean I've had like nine

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:54.580
minute losses that's perfect for me if

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:56.080
you can get that salty over a video game

00:15:54.580 --> 00:16:00.220
in nine minutes you got to take a deep

00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:01.810
look inwards I think it's the thing plus

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:04.000
I don't play hero anyway we don't even

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:05.980
talk about this I still to this day do

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.610
not really understand how compost works

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:11.080
but I think if there's no consumables it

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:13.330
doubles the amount of flies and spiders

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.920
you have and if there's consumables it

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:17.080
turns the Flies and spiders

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:21.820
it turns the consumables into flies and

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:23.410
spiders so I do it I mean there's

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:27.510
nothing to offer in my own defense right

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:27.510
now the run is really good however Oh

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:35.050
however it's not great from a damage

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.660
standpoint which is not allowing me to

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:40.680
keep my fly and spider economy in the

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.680
place I'd like it to be in

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.960
our damage does get better with money

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.490
equals power I've been spending there

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:49.100
was a time where I had like 40-something

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:52.190
cents on this run so I'm not going to

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:55.700
deny I've been a little spendy spendy

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:57.830
bendy but I do have Steam sale as well

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.060
so hopefully we'll find an opportunity

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:01.550
to get that money back and if we can get

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:02.780
a lot of HP I didn't take gimpy so

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:07.640
that's going to hold us back but our

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:10.100
luck is not great either if I if I get

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:13.220
enough HP which should be a great start

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:16.670
thank you I might consider giving the

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:18.560
hush a try we don't have any keys I

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:20.630
might consider giving the hush a try for

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:23.660
the first time on this save file and you

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:25.850
know this is the the benefit of having a

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:28.040
new save file is I'm sort of excited to

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:32.120
fight the hush that hasn't happened in a

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:34.750
long time okay not helped down speed up

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:38.660
lovey shouldn't have you take any input

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:40.430
I mean there's there's some temptation

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.690
here I won't deny it but I think we just

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:43.390
blow them up hopefully get some money

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:49.760
all right

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:51.500
what do we get here I think it comes

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:54.100
down to an experimental treatment or

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:57.620
outbreak and I'm going to go out break

00:17:54.100 --> 00:18:00.220
and to be honest Lee was not even that

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:04.900
close if I if I had more syringes I

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:06.830
would I would give the time of day to

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:10.130
experimental treatment but with no

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:15.470
syringes it was just a little too risky

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:17.690
so I fully intend I intended the wrong

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:19.370
word I fully expect to lose like all of

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:23.570
our flies over the course of this all of

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:26.020
our flies and spiders the more the

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:30.260
merrier but

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:31.910
don't have high hopes for that but all

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.440
we got to do you know this isn't this is

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:36.220
not about our own personal enjoyment to

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:38.870
some extent right now this is all about

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:40.610
knocking this off the to-do list not so

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:41.690
we never have to do it again but so it's

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:43.550
done and we can get the on lock

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:49.970
basically because you know boss rush is

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:51.380
something that I mostly enjoy doing this

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:52.970
should not be the most difficult boss

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.920
rush of all time it's just going to be a

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:56.510
I mean save that for the keeper boss

00:18:54.920 --> 00:19:04.730
rush that's inevitably going to happen

00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:06.410
here at some point but should be it

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:07.970
should be a situation where we want to

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:11.510
pay attention to what's going on around

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:13.340
us because like for example maybe try

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:15.020
not running into those enemies because

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:17.950
every time you do that you just send

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:20.740
yourself yeah see it like the problem is

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:23.000
can't take that much damage right now at

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:25.910
that time you just walked right into it

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.500
well it's actually if we if we fail boss

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:30.860
rush we don't fail to run which is the

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:32.900
nice kind of safety net to have plus I

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:36.500
do feel like boss rush has been sort of

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:38.330
shorter I don't know if it's because we

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:41.270
have less bosses unlocked or whatever

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:44.510
but I feel like we've been getting a lot

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:50.570
less waves but maybe just my waves have

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:54.650
been so good so far and I'll I mean I'm

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:56.120
just making something up that someone in

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:58.100
chat might say at this point but it's

00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:01.730
good for the bit will you rate Canadian

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:03.920
provinces no you see I can rank American

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:06.770
states because I'm largely ignorant and

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:09.260
going almost exclusively off of my own

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:10.429
bias and prejudices and that means that

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.740
I have a level of plausible deniability

00:20:10.429 --> 00:20:14.570
if I start rating Canadian provinces

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:16.160
it's going to get too real you know I

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:20.809
support you no matter where you are in

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:22.940
this country there are some provinces I

00:20:20.809 --> 00:20:26.270
love I love British Columbia

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:28.960
I like Ontario there's some provinces I

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:32.750
wouldn't say that I'm not fond of but

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:35.320
some provinces that I personally would

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:37.480
not necessarily be the number one

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.190
to live there I think Li I don't I don't

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.080
know if I would fit in and Alberta I

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:44.320
know it's a cosmopolitan place just like

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:48.640
Texas but I don't know if I fit the

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:51.670
Albertan mold I fit the British Columbia

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:57.040
mold because I'm like like a begrudging

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:58.900
hipster although I don't ski much at

00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:03.630
least if I if I skied more I'd fit the

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:03.630
mold 100% I would just be the mold I

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:10.240
thought there was oh it's just this guy

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:12.730
no big deal we should have like three

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.920
waves left plus the other thing is I can

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:16.360
I can rank American states and even

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.640
people from outside of America will be

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.960
like I know you know I I get an image in

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.430
my mind when you say next a second an

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.050
image in my mind when you say Carolina I

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:24.700
get no image in my mind and you say

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:26.380
Delaware and thus I agree with you and

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:29.830
now why do you hate Delaware so much I

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:31.750
don't know why don't you I'm going to

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:33.610
make a terrible pun with it name of the

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:35.050
capital city of Delaware which is Dover

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:36.940
you can fill in the blanks for yourself

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:40.510
and then I thought better of it at the

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:47.550
last possible moment hey I'm going to

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:47.550
need you to be the final wave please

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:54.700
how about you

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:03.090
pins no biggie you might be watching

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:05.420
this run thinking that I'm playing like

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:05.420
garbage

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:16.080
cool and I don't even necessarily think

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:20.640
you're wrong I don't think I played as

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:22.350
well as I could have however have we

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.910
gotten a single damage upgrade over the

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:25.190
course of this whole freaking run I

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:27.510
don't believe so

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:29.610
money equals power sure but that's a

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:31.590
little indirect and that one I

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:40.470
I just couldn't see him and I made a Mis

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:46.410
play that's on me oh well uh okay I'll

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:47.520
take a free contract from below still

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:49.410
got one life left

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:51.000
that's a bummer I don't think were going

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:52.500
to fight hocheiser but if we get we've

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.880
already gotten a little bit unlocked on

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:57.990
this run let's let's try to get some

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:59.580
more slightly bummed out the reality of

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:01.440
the situation is we probably didn't need

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:04.710
to take every deal with the devil as it

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:06.300
showed up the other bummer is we like we

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:10.890
blew through our whole stake of flies

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:12.870
and spiders which could have been a big

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.310
competitive advantage for us moving

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:17.000
forward here but you know we'll just

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:17.000
have to rebuild

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:25.890
I give Bob's brain very little credit

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:27.799
for destroying us here I think you know

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:34.830
I got to own up to that responsibility

00:23:27.799 --> 00:23:36.240
myself okay looking all right here we

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:41.909
should be picking up coins but also

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:44.370
getting a fly for a coin seems like a

00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:47.429
pretty solid deal this is what I was

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:49.470
hoping for is like compost nine-fold

00:23:47.429 --> 00:23:50.600
would just be disgustingly good it seems

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:53.760
pretty great

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:57.360
good pills please speed down not that

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:58.860
bad forty-eight hour energy well we know

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:01.620
what everything else is health up we'll

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:08.400
take two to range downs in a fool card I

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:09.480
think we just double grabbed this again

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.309
I don't know this is doubling but add

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.960
add some I guess it's a better way to

00:24:11.309 --> 00:24:14.130
describe it and then we'll take the fool

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.510
card with us we could have converted

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:19.080
everything in there but I kind of want

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:24.330
the fool card could give me a free curse

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:26.539
room basically and not necessarily

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:29.340
expecting like mad goofy payouts but

00:24:26.539 --> 00:24:30.870
whatever we can get in a curse room that

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:36.000
actually provides us with some benefit

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:37.080
is okay in my books and remember we've

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.950
got a hundred percent deal with the

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.950
devil chance so

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:47.960
all right so we're going to lose almost

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:49.990
all of our spiders got a damage upgrade

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:52.700
that may or may not work with the

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:56.930
brimstone we're actually fairly dialed

00:24:52.700 --> 00:25:00.290
in right now and we sort of have to be

00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:02.150
like 5 damage even with brimstone is not

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:05.060
knocking it out of the ballpark at this

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:07.010
point so we're going to have the chance

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:09.800
to do a hush fight but the odds of it I

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:12.020
would say are fairly low the other being

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:14.120
a good idea are fairly low at this point

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:16.550
now sometimes that can stop me and

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:21.590
sometimes it won't like that for now I

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:22.970
think it's done trying to pick up

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:24.200
whatever money we can get as well that's

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:25.820
the other thing I guess if we go to the

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.140
hush fight we're going to like we're

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:30.200
going to spend money which is going to

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:32.300
Mill our damage and start to cost me

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:35.020
even more than where we've already cost

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.020
ourselves here

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:42.000
even outbreak has not been like a ten

00:25:40.409 --> 00:25:44.639
out of ten for us dude this is like

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.250
super great I think okay just walk in

00:25:44.639 --> 00:25:47.789
here this we need to go back to the pool

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.679
card

00:25:47.789 --> 00:25:53.360
dude there's too many batteries I can't

00:25:49.679 --> 00:25:53.360
go anywhere without accidentally turning

00:25:54.169 --> 00:25:58.379
turning a battery into something that's

00:25:56.490 --> 00:26:03.990
not a battery we really want the battery

00:25:58.379 --> 00:26:11.399
right now so like compost compost nice

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:13.919
little spider army without a doubt okay

00:26:11.399 --> 00:26:17.639
that's done what's our card it's another

00:26:13.919 --> 00:26:19.110
48 hour energy I use it pop it again I

00:26:17.639 --> 00:26:20.940
might be using this inefficiently I'm

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:23.309
still not the master of compost although

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:25.110
I do collect my organics and

00:26:23.309 --> 00:26:29.960
biodegradable and deposit them in the

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:32.700
green bin told you to grudging hipster

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:36.899
you know like caring about the planet

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:38.429
doesn't make you a hipster I refuse to

00:26:36.899 --> 00:26:40.080
buy into that notion cuz I think that

00:26:38.429 --> 00:26:44.309
just gives people an excuse to not

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:48.120
recycle recycling is not a it's not a

00:26:44.309 --> 00:26:51.379
cultural or political decision it's just

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.379
putting things in the right place

00:26:53.049 --> 00:27:00.669
I want to be a good influence on you and

00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:03.360
I I don't think I'm always innocent in

00:27:00.669 --> 00:27:05.320
that department you know I did say a

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.700
friend stopped sending me pictures of

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:09.090
your kids I don't care but that's just

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:12.519
that's honestly to a fault okay

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:14.919
you should recycle you should eat off of

00:27:12.519 --> 00:27:17.049
not paper plates whenever possible I

00:27:14.919 --> 00:27:18.970
don't want to I'm not going to be the

00:27:17.049 --> 00:27:21.340
twitch streamer and it would be probably

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:22.869
a mildly beneficial financial decision

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:27.129
to do this so know that I'm not doing

00:27:22.869 --> 00:27:30.129
this to be you know profit seeking I

00:27:27.129 --> 00:27:32.049
suppose is the best word to use I don't

00:27:30.129 --> 00:27:33.669
want to enable your poor life choices I

00:27:32.049 --> 00:27:36.519
make poor life choices as well in

00:27:33.669 --> 00:27:38.679
certain departments last time I like

00:27:36.519 --> 00:27:40.749
deliberately God exercises far too long

00:27:38.679 --> 00:27:42.489
ago for me to even want to admit it

00:27:40.749 --> 00:27:44.980
let's go down instead of going to the

00:27:42.489 --> 00:27:46.929
hospitai get more to unlocked here but I

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:48.789
want you to feel shame about that the

00:27:46.929 --> 00:27:50.950
same way I feel shame about that well we

00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:52.600
got we unlock it lives does that mean

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:54.940
we've unlocked Sheol and the Cathedral

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:56.590
or yes show on the Cathedral I don't

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.759
know we all liked about a million things

00:27:56.590 --> 00:28:03.309
though so that's a start

00:27:57.759 --> 00:28:05.559
mama's boy achieved that's amazing thank

00:28:03.309 --> 00:28:10.779
you compost I thought for sure we got

00:28:05.559 --> 00:28:14.529
hit down there but I guess not because I

00:28:10.779 --> 00:28:17.230
think that and you know this might sound

00:28:14.529 --> 00:28:19.059
ridiculous I think shame can be a good

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:21.009
motivator

00:28:19.059 --> 00:28:22.419
I don't think it's necessarily the

00:28:21.009 --> 00:28:23.799
healthiest motivator but I think it

00:28:22.419 --> 00:28:27.429
could be a good motivator I think a

00:28:23.799 --> 00:28:29.230
healthy sense of shame can be important

00:28:27.429 --> 00:28:32.379
you know you ever seen a show called

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:34.570
shameless it's not a story about a man

00:28:32.379 --> 00:28:36.879
who's got his life together is it the

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:40.120
story about a girl who cried a river and

00:28:36.879 --> 00:28:42.669
drown the whole world he's done he has

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:51.249
he's done it and then been rebuked in

00:28:42.669 --> 00:28:55.749
the final hour excuse me to be shameless

00:28:51.249 --> 00:29:00.610
as a I think being shameless is is to be

00:28:55.749 --> 00:29:02.919
insecure to be honest with you you just

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:06.730
opted out of trying at that point and

00:29:02.919 --> 00:29:08.259
that's that's the sad thing I want us to

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:09.820
know deep down inside that we're trash

00:29:08.259 --> 00:29:11.259
human beings look can always be better I

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:13.629
mean you hear the rant about the cars

00:29:11.259 --> 00:29:16.269
recently anyway not the cars they're

00:29:13.629 --> 00:29:20.289
fine gotta do Birds is cool Jesus

00:29:16.269 --> 00:29:22.059
where's there's no bones I can't really

00:29:20.289 --> 00:29:25.990
do a good cars impression as you can

00:29:22.059 --> 00:29:27.999
tell my best friend's girlfriend

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:31.419
that's not a good Rick oka check and she

00:29:27.999 --> 00:29:32.590
used to be mine but increase into okay

00:29:31.419 --> 00:29:34.539
we should look at the card but we're

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:35.440
actually like we should have look at the

00:29:34.539 --> 00:29:38.879
cards first

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:42.070
we're actually relatively okay here now

00:29:38.879 --> 00:29:44.259
after things look pretty dicey

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:46.119
I'm not going to even say that I played

00:29:44.259 --> 00:29:47.619
badly through the back half of this run

00:29:46.119 --> 00:29:50.740
you know knowing now that we actually

00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:51.759
unlock mama's boy there's really no way

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.980
we could have played better from a

00:29:51.759 --> 00:29:58.090
dodging standpoint so just stack up a

00:29:53.980 --> 00:30:01.600
little extra HP here and go for broke I

00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:05.200
think it's a lot of spiders

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:07.419
I do wish the spiders did a little bit

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:13.679
more damage but I guess they're just

00:30:07.419 --> 00:30:17.220
what I needed I needed Circuit City I

00:30:13.679 --> 00:30:21.389
guess they're just what I needed I

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:21.389
needed buy batteries

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:31.200
all right okay good stuff we've done it

00:30:27.799 --> 00:30:32.370
great work team kind of a scary run at

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:34.679
times there but a fun run nonetheless

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:36.510
forget-me-now has been unlocked the

00:30:34.679 --> 00:30:38.100
negative is appeared that the negative

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:42.860
is superior base well how do we get the

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:44.940
Polaroid I'm losing it's all backwards
