much and then you come in here while I'm

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.650

of context you can be on my lap while I

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.710
play Isaac people would pay good money

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:26.159
for that on a patreon account I'm sure

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.320
however you can not bite my hands when I

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.360
touch the keyboard this cat is so greedy

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.329
for attention he's on your lap and

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.520
you're touching the keyboard of the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.710
mouse he will bite you on the hand it's

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.850
like that hand belongs to me you wish

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.640
buddy but I'm sorry

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.170
evolutions a cruel mistress she didn't

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.280
give you a poseable thumbs maybe you

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.290
should have thought of that before you

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.670
evolved like the ability to jump real

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.159
high yeah we'll take that now you want

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.229
to leave you're becoming a recurring

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.399
character here oh you don't want to

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.490
leave you just want to poke your head

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.079
out it's okay you know what stare at the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.189
door apparently it's more entertaining

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:07.360
than the video he looked at me with the

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.220
knowledge that I just told a joke

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.700
I might be projecting a little bit

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.580
anyway okay okay we would like to be

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.810
able to get a blood bank on the next

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.990
floor the easiest way to do that is

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.220
probably by a secret room the secret

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.420
room has given me enough money to get

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.720
the blood bank on the next floor that

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.050
doesn't happen like according to plan

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.000
that often I'm extremely pleased with

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.760
that you know usually you come up with a

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.230
plan and then you know 30% of the time

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.880
it fails so you get a contingency plan

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:42.480
and you go through things that way this

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:44.500
time it just worked well grab all these

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.420
in fact we're going to have so many

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.709
spirit hearts protecting us on the next

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.380
floor that I'm little scared actually

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.860
the power that we hold you know that's

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:00.790
on people on my power and they won my

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.790
stage I don't know can i maybe I can

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.190
level with people can I interface with

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:11.250
you as if I were one of the kids people

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:13.330
want my power and their one masters

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.750
that's santigold

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.690
they want more station that's Santigold

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:24.489
go live HD 2012 from the Coachella Music

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:27.549
Festival festival it's not how you say

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:30.430
that word I've never been to the

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:33.459
Coachella Music Festival I have been to

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:37.269
the event of the hillside Music Festival

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.890
in Guelph Ontario many many famous acts

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.940
have played there I saw Japan droids

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:47.110
play there I did not see the Arcade Fire

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:50.569
play there but they did play there I've

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:53.420
also seen some wild stuff at hillside

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.099
drum circles yeah now it's just become

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.400
the monologue from the end of Blade

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:03.260
Runner glittering drum circles off the

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:05.150
island stage there's nothing more to say

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.299
about that I'd recommend it well so cool

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.769
town now are there many reasons to go to

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.480
Guelph except for hillside and the

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:15.019
tourists probably not but I think it was

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.239
a good place to live very you know

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.389
progressive thinking fire mentally

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:25.699
friendly close to the former

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:31.039
headquarters of blackberry ever happen

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:33.440
to them Jim Balsillie was going to buy

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.270
the Nashville Predators and now all of a

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.919
sudden nobody's using a blackberry touch

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.460
anymore I don't know her blackberry

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.740
pearl I this is a bit of an aside which

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:46.360
is I think important in these videos at

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:51.380
this point but I took an introduction to

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:54.940
business class in my second year of

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.470
university and it happened like right at

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.760
I'm trying to piece it together has now

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.740
been long enough that I'm like

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:05.120
questioning my own story and whether or

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:07.180
not it makes sense but it was the second

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:14.139
semester of my second year of university

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:16.789
started in like you know January of 2000

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.380
2008 and what you're supposed to do in

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:21.349
the class please like a class that you'd

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:24.770
see in a movie or a TV show depicting

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:27.680
college life right we got 25,000 virtual

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.000
dollars to invest and then whoever or

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.770
however you invested it in the

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.300
performance of your portfolio determined

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.960
part of your mark not all of your mark

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.159
because that would be a little

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:41.449
ridiculous but we'll take both here

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:44.180
because we can basically Wow actually

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.380
works really well unfortunately for

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.340
those of you crunching the numbers in

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.919
your head you might be seeing where this

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:52.280
is going that was also the dawn of the

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:54.169
Great Recession as it is called you know

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:58.370
affects still being felt to some extent

00:05:54.169 --> 00:06:01.849
to this day basically of the 25,000

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.680
virtual dollars almost nobody made money

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:05.449
I believe that in a

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.460
strange twist of fate and even if this

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:08.720
is my memory playing tricks on me it

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.690
makes for a better punchline to this

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.610
story if I remember correctly the person

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.039
who ended up being on top of the class

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.620
leaderboard was a dude who like showed

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:20.780
up for the first couple classes got his

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.280
login info and then never actually

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.380
showed up from the classroom that point

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.650
onwards so his money was just kept in

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.930
cash so he finished with 25,000

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.270
meanwhile everybody else lost like 30%

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:36.830
of their portfolios in six weeks anyway

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:38.530
the point is back in the day my my

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:43.250
business professor very smart lady

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:45.880
occupied a prominent role in the local

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:51.259
business world she was like there is no

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:52.340
safer bet than black bear right now does

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:54.050
the wonder how she's doing she's

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.740
probably fine she had diversified income

00:06:54.050 --> 00:07:00.020
streams besser businesswoman owned the

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.060
winery I do sometimes wonder whatever

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.590
happened to the BlackBerry investment

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.020
probably not a wise thing to joke about

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.000
you know there's a lot of love riding on

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.889
that you know a lot of people lost a ton

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.090
of money when Nortel crashes Wow okay

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:12.710
this is not what you tune in to these

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.380
videos for but I thought the anecdote

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.970
was at least interesting it was a weird

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:21.260
time to take an introduction to business

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:23.000
class I should have just sucked that one

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.530
up not because Bob's brain is bad but

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.289
we've had it enough recently that we

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:28.880
don't have to you know take Bob's brain

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:31.820
on every single run even though I do

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.680
sort of like it most of the time it's

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:37.090
not like I like you or anything and then

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.090
they say Baca is that correct

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:45.259
and then we all told ourselves it's all

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.090
right to spend a few more years in

00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:50.270
school right out the recession and

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:53.180
cruise to that high five figures job

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:57.759
that everybody gets after college and

00:07:53.180 --> 00:08:00.470
here we are thank God for YouTube anyway

00:07:57.759 --> 00:08:02.180
it's got a big horn here I don't want to

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.190
make it too real these videos are an

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:07.039
escape while also being tethered to the

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:08.449
real world of course I'll just be

00:08:07.039 --> 00:08:09.889
straight up with you as well is one of

00:08:08.449 --> 00:08:13.360
the most useless courses I ever took in

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:16.130
my entire you know university career I

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.960
don't I didn't like taking electives I

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.479
understand it I understand you want to

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.440
produce well-rounded individuals and

00:08:19.479 --> 00:08:23.720
especially in today's day and age a

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:27.250
bachelor's degree in many subjects does

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:30.470
not necessarily qualify you for work in

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:31.699
that field to a huge specialized degree

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.229
so be producing a well-rounded

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:35.719
individuals very important as a

00:08:33.229 --> 00:08:37.669
secondary function of the university but

00:08:35.719 --> 00:08:40.430
also I think I'm just going to suck this

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:41.959
up I want the stance it ended up working

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:44.480
out for us but it easily could have

00:08:41.959 --> 00:08:46.040
messed us up as well it did give us

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.860
damages and here's though which is like

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:53.900
the ideal combination at the same time

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:55.940
though ah took so many classes because I

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:58.310
was borderline shoehorned into it that I

00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:01.010
have no interest in whatsoever in

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:03.200
hindsight I did take one awesome class

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:06.020
that was like the history by the way II

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:08.709
really Canadian University what are

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:12.050
these Degrassi classes no like I took

00:09:08.709 --> 00:09:15.740
some intense chemistry biology classes

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:17.240
as well but in between those there was

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:19.760
also like the history of popular music

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:23.810
where our prop would come in and you

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:25.820
know play some NWA and be like you know

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:27.830
here's the roots of early hip hop

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:29.209
culture early gangster rapidly suicide

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.589
landed leeway it's not really early hip

00:09:29.209 --> 00:09:33.860
hop when you consider each Grandmaster

00:09:30.589 --> 00:09:38.209
Flash etc it's any of the idea but I

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:41.240
also took econ 101 and I didn't really

00:09:38.209 --> 00:09:44.000
resonate with that course put geography

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:46.880
like one Oh something what like 101 X

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:51.040
and the X is because I took it by

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:51.040
correspondence wouldn't recommend it

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:59.879
unless you're like really into geography

00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:01.379
in which case go for it but I don't know

00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:03.480
I still don't understand the study of

00:10:01.379 --> 00:10:05.279
geography in the modern day you know I

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.620
feel about geography the way the

00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:10.829
twitchchat feels about biology where

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:12.870
whenever I want to like think about what

00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:15.629
geography entails on a professional

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.889
level in my head I'm just like what

00:10:15.629 --> 00:10:19.439
we've discovered the whole world

00:10:16.889 --> 00:10:21.259
one more geography is there - is there

00:10:19.439 --> 00:10:23.879
to do we've done it

00:10:21.259 --> 00:10:25.379
ask me where any country is I'll point

00:10:23.879 --> 00:10:27.060
it out on a map I don't even have a

00:10:25.379 --> 00:10:30.629
degree and I'd recognize that this is

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:35.100
obviously not actually what the study of

00:10:30.629 --> 00:10:36.689
geography entails at least I recognized

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:40.589
that ignorance twitch chats always like

00:10:36.689 --> 00:10:42.420
how many bones does a pike fish have

00:10:40.589 --> 00:10:49.379
like oh I don't know I never learned it

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:53.069
whoa bio major we haven't seen it I

00:10:49.379 --> 00:10:55.410
think so I'll pick it up I told you many

00:10:53.069 --> 00:11:00.120
times what do you learn in biology show

00:10:55.410 --> 00:11:02.970
up do your work here's how you culture

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.230
agar and then get bacteria to grow on it

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.730
you don't culture agar but here's how

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:08.459
you place agar in a plate and then

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:10.860
culture bacteria to grow on it here's

00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:12.740
how you use the mass spectrometer here's

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:17.250
how to tell the gender of a fruit fly

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:19.139
proper dissection etiquette and then a

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.730
lot of respect for the scientific

00:11:19.139 --> 00:11:23.850
journals in the university libraries

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:26.389
that's the that's the crux of the matter

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.389
right there

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:30.329
for those of you who might be starting

00:11:27.899 --> 00:11:32.100
college in the in the audit I don't need

00:11:30.329 --> 00:11:34.829
to do that after school special like go

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:38.970
to school or say go and go to class if

00:11:34.829 --> 00:11:41.220
you're in school tangent that I do every

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:43.350
time it's gotten to the point where if

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.639
it comes up in twitch chat or if it

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.920
comes up during a stream twitch that

00:11:44.639 --> 00:11:50.519
goes we know go to class I'm serious I

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.809
go to class you'll thank yourself you

00:11:50.519 --> 00:11:54.360
won't you don't need to thank me I'm

00:11:51.809 --> 00:11:58.939
giving you literal advice on the level

00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:02.999
of like drink water consume oxygen food

00:11:58.939 --> 00:12:06.329
fuel your metabolic processes consume

00:12:02.999 --> 00:12:08.610
carbon for its energy you know but I'm

00:12:06.329 --> 00:12:10.649
reiterating advice then maybe you might

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:14.879
have reprioritize at some point in your

00:12:10.649 --> 00:12:19.259
life Rawdon baby this is a dream come

00:12:14.879 --> 00:12:22.829
true and this run actually is good it's

00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:24.480
not great it's it's borderline great

00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:26.040
though I know this is a very confusing

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.199
sentence for me to utter in this

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.870
direction here or in this set up here

00:12:28.199 --> 00:12:33.300
but trusting my save it's not quite

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:39.899
great I don't think it's too far away

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:42.529
from greatness what we need is I mean

00:12:39.899 --> 00:12:45.569
honestly I wouldn't turn on my nose at

00:12:42.529 --> 00:12:47.100
rate of fire rate of fire is 19 right

00:12:45.569 --> 00:12:50.519
now which with triple shot is not that

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:54.389
bad but of course you know we're lucky

00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:56.009
of to Shaun's land one shot landing is

00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:56.850
the standard but if two shots lands the

00:12:56.009 --> 00:12:59.370
dream come true but it doesn't

00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:02.069
necessarily justify you know a tripling

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:06.089
of our rate of fire so it would be nice

00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:11.699
to amp that up a little bit triple rate

00:13:06.089 --> 00:13:12.689
of fire one third of the damage see even

00:13:11.699 --> 00:13:14.550
the song he's only heard the

00:13:12.689 --> 00:13:17.399
introduction of in like a movie trailer

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:21.749
four years ago is that in a movie

00:13:17.399 --> 00:13:25.220
trailer if it's not from a movie trailer

00:13:21.749 --> 00:13:25.220
I don't know how I know this song

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:34.450
it wasn't a high incidence of me

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:36.250
listening to the radio in 2012 I was

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:39.870
mostly recording the binding of issac on

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.870
my laptop that I brought back from Korea

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:51.160
he would whip me off that's a story for

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:54.160
another day though we can do that um we

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:56.920
could go to our boss trap room but for a

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:59.470
single regular chest I think it's not

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:01.600
really worth it get a nice little array

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:03.040
of demonic familiars though I like what

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.779
we got going on here I believe we'll

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.519
have a 100% chance for a deal with the

00:14:04.779 --> 00:14:07.870
devil on our next floor basically what

00:14:06.519 --> 00:14:12.149
I'm doing now is just go into the shop

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:15.910
or at least navigating towards the shop

00:14:12.149 --> 00:14:17.620
the dream there wouldn't mind mr. boom

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:19.209
fresh things we're pronouncing five I

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.380
wouldn't mind mr. boom but we have a

00:14:19.209 --> 00:14:24.040
battery charge in the outside because

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:25.510
you can suck it up but anyway I want to

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.620
donate some more money to the shop if

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:27.730
there's stuff worth buying we might

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.680
consider it because we do want to do

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:33.130
boss rush on this run but if there's no

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:35.110
stuff worth buying then we will not buy

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:37.240
anything but we will buy something

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:39.910
because there's chaos what a strange way

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.870
to utter that sentence paralysis doesn't

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:44.190
matter we still a minute and a half

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:47.320
ahead of schedule and we got a good

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:51.670
reroll or a stat roll I should say on

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:52.990
our void place so yeah this floor has

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.910
improved us and again I think we got

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:57.010
that 100% deal with the devil on the

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:59.410
next chord now this is what you do see

00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:01.450
like sometimes it's been a while since

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:03.610
you've been in the thick of it when it

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:05.470
comes to Isaac yeah good damage what you

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:07.120
should do here is maximize your chance

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:08.260
of greatness by holding on to the

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.630
Hierophant card you might be able to

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:13.500
suck up blank card if it even exists in

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:13.500
the shop at this point

00:15:14.259 --> 00:15:20.529
I don't think it does and then you know

00:15:18.759 --> 00:15:21.790
get multiple uses out of it yeah now

00:15:20.529 --> 00:15:26.439
that I think about I think blank card is

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:30.459
a shop on lock it's fair to say there's

00:15:26.439 --> 00:15:31.779
a certain level of irony I'm getting mr.

00:15:30.459 --> 00:15:33.729
boom in the first chest that we've

00:15:31.779 --> 00:15:36.729
opened after asking for mr. boom

00:15:33.729 --> 00:15:38.259
I wanted it from the boss though I

00:15:36.729 --> 00:15:39.639
didn't necessarily want it from that

00:15:38.259 --> 00:15:43.209
golden chest they could have given us

00:15:39.639 --> 00:15:46.720
you know phaidor Steven or you know

00:15:43.209 --> 00:15:48.129
infamy but didn't cost us all that much

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.559
little scheme of things I think blister

00:15:48.129 --> 00:15:53.459
is straight-up one of the worst trinkets

00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:57.609
in the game just amps up your knock-back

00:15:53.459 --> 00:15:59.379
I've heard not commonly but I have heard

00:15:57.609 --> 00:16:02.129
anecdotal tales of people who think that

00:15:59.379 --> 00:16:03.999
knock-back is like a top tier stat I

00:16:02.129 --> 00:16:05.579
disagree with your assessment of

00:16:03.999 --> 00:16:09.759
knock-back I think knock-back is

00:16:05.579 --> 00:16:12.039
relatively terrible but if you know

00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:13.809
something I don't know then you know

00:16:12.039 --> 00:16:16.509
more power to you in that department so

00:16:13.809 --> 00:16:21.220
we're on danc'd EPS one two bombs gives

00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:22.929
us three keys in a penny and well it's

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.449
actually one bomb gives us three keys in

00:16:22.929 --> 00:16:26.919
a penny which is a great trade

00:16:24.449 --> 00:16:29.919
previously I was going to say that we

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:32.019
should wait until the next floor to use

00:16:29.919 --> 00:16:36.100
temperance but I no longer believe that

00:16:32.019 --> 00:16:37.419
what I do believe in is poor babylon

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:40.239
working out well for us here in

00:16:37.419 --> 00:16:43.569
hopefully picking up some blood bag IV

00:16:40.239 --> 00:16:46.299
bag action don't really want IV bag I've

00:16:43.569 --> 00:16:48.959
made the mistake 40 times to suck up IV

00:16:46.299 --> 00:16:51.669
bag with with void

00:16:48.959 --> 00:16:53.289
admittedly this is a ballsy play for

00:16:51.669 --> 00:16:54.639
someone with only like 20 runs in this

00:16:53.289 --> 00:16:57.819
game it's probably not the right move to

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:59.829
do this hahaha but on the other hand I'm

00:16:57.819 --> 00:17:02.350
going to regardless because I want money

00:16:59.829 --> 00:17:04.199
for our donation machine to take our

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:06.429
shop to the next level a little faster

00:17:04.199 --> 00:17:08.949
I'm going to do it until that play

00:17:06.429 --> 00:17:11.319
because I don't want to lose the black

00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:14.490
card in the process so we can still use

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:17.669
the IV bag to get double plays here but

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:19.360
obviously it's not going to be quite as

00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:20.889
incentivized now that we've cost

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.659
ourselves like five and a half spirit

00:17:20.889 --> 00:17:24.129
hearts in the process let's stand by it

00:17:22.659 --> 00:17:25.990
you know we got progress to make and

00:17:24.129 --> 00:17:28.130
this is one way that we can do it

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:34.340
and I don't think it slowed us down too

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:36.770
much either bomb for three cents I think

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:43.160
we have to unlock lucky pennies I don't

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:44.930
think we've had them yet I'm pretty sure

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.850
the Lucky Penny was an on lock but like

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:49.970
I'm having to dig deep in the memory

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:54.050
banks here to remember if that is indeed

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:55.250
the case the faster we can get that the

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:57.290
better because that actually I wouldn't

00:17:55.250 --> 00:18:00.410
say this is like an 80 or crux of my

00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:02.930
strategy but it is important it's on the

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:05.870
list of things that actually matter like

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:07.490
monstros tooth who cares right somebody

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.990
out there is like I care you know what

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:11.000
I'm glad you have an item that's your

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:13.970
favorite that's bad because that's funny

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.120
but come on on an objective level

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:20.000
monstros tooth really lucky pennies

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.830
though it probably accounted over there

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.800
you know myriad runs they've been on for

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:28.940
like 700 lockups

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:31.670
so I want that aggregate effect sure we

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:33.830
got a range upgrade it's pretty terrible

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:35.480
I'm going to gamble a little bit on it

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:38.510
something good showing up there and it's

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:40.010
HP I'm going to yeah okay we turn that

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:41.480
into luck plus damage I think it's

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:44.270
positive we've had really good stat

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:48.920
rolls but that time we did give up HP

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:50.390
for it and HP could be precious here you

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.260
know what we do not have a guaranteed B

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:54.500
look at that well I don't know what I

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:56.050
was thinking they're mothers all right

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:59.600
thank you

00:18:56.050 --> 00:19:02.320
Book of Shadows is worth picking up so

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.320
we'll do it this way

00:19:03.229 --> 00:19:08.639
so now we have invincible owner oh don't

00:19:06.359 --> 00:19:10.080
blow it up I didn't I was doing the

00:19:08.639 --> 00:19:13.259
opposite thing that I wanted to do there

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:16.469
don't blow it up don't blow it up oh oh

00:19:13.259 --> 00:19:17.999
you know that song don't turn around

00:19:16.469 --> 00:19:20.369
not the one that goes don't turn around

00:19:17.999 --> 00:19:23.909
I don't want to see you oh how pretty

00:19:20.369 --> 00:19:25.440
dudes come on take me to I'm not going

00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:27.149
to say take me to church and sing the

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:31.039
song too many songs this episode just

00:19:27.149 --> 00:19:31.039
take me to 200 cents that's all I ask

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:35.700
it held out we're actually making really

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.499
good progress in that donation machine

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:39.269
but we have slowed ourselves down to the

00:19:37.499 --> 00:19:43.649
point that boss rush is somewhat

00:19:39.269 --> 00:19:46.489
unlikely someone less likely would be a

00:19:43.649 --> 00:19:46.489
better way to put it

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:53.429
we're crushing it in the damage

00:19:48.419 --> 00:19:55.259
Department though oh that's what we need

00:19:53.429 --> 00:19:59.700
yeah the cancer trinket rate of fire I

00:19:55.259 --> 00:20:04.080
guess we're at the camp and this mo

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:06.119
smoking pot dude I don't want to use the

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:08.039
Book of Shadows even though it's

00:20:06.119 --> 00:20:10.080
probably sensible I don't want to use it

00:20:08.039 --> 00:20:11.159
just because we could use it to steal

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:13.729
something good from the deal with the

00:20:11.159 --> 00:20:15.960
devil if there is one which there is and

00:20:13.729 --> 00:20:17.279
we have chaos so the deals the devil

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:21.229
stink right should have thought of that

00:20:17.279 --> 00:20:24.779
paralysis something's wrong

00:20:21.229 --> 00:20:26.369
you can't avoid mama mega anymore it

00:20:24.779 --> 00:20:27.929
doesn't give you multiple effects can

00:20:26.369 --> 00:20:29.879
you avoid the gift to get multiple

00:20:27.929 --> 00:20:34.200
things now ask the question for another

00:20:29.879 --> 00:20:36.839
day because that deal sucks I got the

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:39.149
freaking beam it could have been

00:20:36.839 --> 00:20:40.409
anything but they gave me an item they

00:20:39.149 --> 00:20:41.999
could have been anything and it became

00:20:40.409 --> 00:20:43.830
an item that when you press the spacebar

00:20:41.999 --> 00:20:45.749
it can become anything that's not really

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:47.369
a great deal in hindsight I messed that

00:20:45.749 --> 00:20:52.169
one up somewhere fierce and we are now

00:20:47.369 --> 00:20:55.249
on the low side when it comes to HP with

00:20:52.169 --> 00:20:59.489
no response available so we do want to

00:20:55.249 --> 00:21:02.039
basically relax remember you know we got

00:20:59.489 --> 00:21:03.460
dark bum backing us up here you can give

00:21:02.039 --> 00:21:06.309
us any x-rays

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:07.840
happy the gift does not work multiple

00:21:06.309 --> 00:21:12.730
times I guess they've learned their

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:14.320
lessons it's unfortunate but to be

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:17.230
honest with you I understand this one

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:19.330
boy doesn't necessarily need the the

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:24.760
added benefit of being able to copy

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:26.320
items that can copy items even if the

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.940
fact that it's you know balancing the

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:31.360
single player game and that strikes me

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:32.860
as somewhat irrelevant I understand

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.059
where they're coming from so all of a

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:36.460
sudden it's looking like a terrible

00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:37.840
decision good point

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:41.679
all of a sudden is looking like a

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:43.600
terrible decision to give up like six

00:21:41.679 --> 00:21:46.330
spirit hearts to get IV bag on the last

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:49.240
floor they won't be able to take away

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:50.919
the fact that we did donate a bunch so

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:53.370
at least there is some enduring progress

00:21:50.919 --> 00:21:55.750
but now we need to we need to play well

00:21:53.370 --> 00:22:02.620
and remember the donation machine is

00:21:55.750 --> 00:22:05.799
very very nice you pay into it you know

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:07.330
when you're young and able you draw out

00:22:05.799 --> 00:22:12.610
of it on your runs that are more

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:15.610
enfeebled and right now it's probably a

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:17.140
situation in which we'd rather be

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:22.720
drawing out of it and putting into it

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:26.289
but if we're able to know if we're able

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:27.970
to put into it and still be okay we're

00:22:26.289 --> 00:22:30.640
gonna get those dividends later anyway

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:33.909
so could make the sacrifice worth it

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:35.950
here that's a lot of verbiage for just

00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:40.630
putting like seventy cents into a

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:41.980
donation machine but I got to focus on

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:44.320
the positive here cuz I'm finding myself

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:46.570
in kind of a rough spot this is what

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:49.200
dark bomb is here for as well well

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:51.970
that's the wrong direction unfortunately

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:54.250
we don't need to do boss rush boss rush

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:58.000
benefits us very little except for

00:22:54.250 --> 00:23:00.880
progress and it may become literally

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:04.200
impossible very shortly but of course I

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:07.999
want to give it a try I can

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:10.409
I don't think we're going to make it I

00:23:07.999 --> 00:23:14.549
don't think it's conceivable to make it

00:23:10.409 --> 00:23:19.940
I'm going to try let's go we got nine

00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:21.929
seconds it's a good step one

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:27.090
yeah we're not going to make it that's

00:23:21.929 --> 00:23:28.980
fine that's fine upfront okay we can

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:31.529
think our way out of the situation we

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.940
missed the chest oh that was dumb we

00:23:31.529 --> 00:23:35.359
might not be able to think our way out

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.359
of this one

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:47.610
you on lot something sticky in the

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:51.540
depths oh good super dish my favorite we

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:58.820
have to because you have to put it right

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:58.820
there a little rude wouldn't you say

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:11.310
made it nearly impossible to play okay

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:15.700
so we got the negative yeah I've

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:19.300
completely done this to myself that

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:23.440
blood bank play has honestly never

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:26.190
looked stupider I need to break Bob's

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.190
brain here

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:32.750
it's gone

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:33.860
I don't know how we didn't get hit at

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:35.000
the start of this room by the way you

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:45.290
might be asking yourself the same

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:54.710
question I found pills rested key the

00:24:45.290 --> 00:25:12.760
garbage payout devil like a single red

00:24:54.710 --> 00:25:15.760
heart hate this don't make me go back

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.760
please

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:23.050
single red heart all I ask for ever

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:23.050
single red heart

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:32.570
that's half a red heart

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:33.800
got to admit that's a red start as far

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:36.340
as I'm concerned but it's now we're

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.340
looking for

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:48.470
neither is umbilical cord so I think the

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:50.360
devil card might have saved us there so

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:53.260
I am patting myself on the back and

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:55.640
saying that that was a 10 out of 10 play

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:59.800
thank you for destroying the evil in the

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:59.800
center of the room nothin dude really

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:09.370
Rock tinted double rock tinted it's got

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:12.770
to be good okay I mean it was not risky

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:15.800
but my lord

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:17.750
you got a level with me they're pretty

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:21.050
smart plays to get ourselves out of the

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:22.550
mouth of madness there even if really

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:28.310
not the mouth of madness is more like

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:31.280
the mouth of badness because I add was

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:33.380
in that situation as a result of my own

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:36.020
moronic decision on the blood bank

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:37.430
earlier what do we care about this you

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:39.050
know we'll get a red heart maybe I'd

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:41.960
rather have the stats yeah hook me up

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:45.530
with that sweet shot speeds dead daddy I

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:46.160
didn't feel good saying that okay well

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:51.140
played

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:52.820
good good dodging skills there got a

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:55.490
double key room one of the rare

00:26:52.820 --> 00:27:02.240
potential productive rerolls if it

00:26:55.490 --> 00:27:07.430
happens which it didn't I still I stand

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:08.990
by that as being a pretty amazing couple

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:10.690
of well not couple of floors a pretty

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:15.020
amazing floor in terms of performance

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:16.400
didn't get hit used hour yeah adds hook

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:19.820
me up thank you

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:22.310
used are very very meager resources

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:26.810
properly in it looks like we're going to

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:31.750
be rewarded by leaving this run well

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:31.750
leaving this floor intact

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:41.460
hopefully not syntax ooh yeah okay that

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:43.440
was just an awful i I deserve to get hit

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:45.330
about four times before I got hit there

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:47.250
sometimes you just catch yourself in

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:48.480
this like you know destructive tailspin

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:53.580
and that's what we were in right there

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:55.320
we've got a pull out of it we get to get

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:56.790
ah stamps I forgot we had Book of

00:27:55.320 --> 00:28:00.740
Shadows actually mapped to one of our

00:27:56.790 --> 00:28:03.540
items as well so I'm like on void so we

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:05.850
really should have been using that once

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:13.350
every now and then it is almost too good

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:18.150
to use syndrome but oh okay question

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:20.100
mark card could have some value secret

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:22.830
room it fits the bill as well okay we

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:24.840
have one luck I'm not expecting huge

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:29.720
payouts here if we can get the two luck

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:29.720
while we play the fortune teller

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:38.510
okay so far has done a lot of good work

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.429
for us it's given us a luck upgrade to

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:42.169
make me even angrier as I squander our

00:28:40.429 --> 00:28:46.250
remaining money before going to possibly

00:28:42.169 --> 00:28:49.340
the hush fight okay vibrant bulb has a

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:52.309
certain shouldn't say qua associated

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:55.100
with it we're going to unfortunately

00:28:52.309 --> 00:29:05.240
want to use void almost all the time

00:28:55.100 --> 00:29:08.450
it's available so I don't think that in

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:10.730
particular this is a strong hold but

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:13.130
we'll see definitely we're going to make

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:16.159
boss rush we're going to make the hush

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:19.940
fight despite missing boss rush by a lot

00:29:16.159 --> 00:29:25.549
we don't really want to go back there as

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:26.960
you do for me could be worse I don't

00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:30.890
know I kind of think we're better off

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:32.809
just such a meager Tears upgrade all

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:37.520
three of these are like almost in the

00:29:32.809 --> 00:29:40.580
same camp right now I think I think we

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:45.460
take this because at full charge is

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:45.460
probably a pretty nice all sets up

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:51.559
there's one of our like three spirit

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:53.419
arts squandered already you know what

00:29:51.559 --> 00:29:56.260
yeah we'll get it charged for fighting

00:29:53.419 --> 00:29:56.260
mom let's do that

00:29:59.229 --> 00:30:03.829
and then we'll just try not to use void

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:06.579
until it has to happen I mean this next

00:30:03.829 --> 00:30:08.449
room could be our last room is the thing

00:30:06.579 --> 00:30:13.009
because of the way that the game is

00:30:08.449 --> 00:30:18.229
structured at this point the thing is it

00:30:13.009 --> 00:30:21.979
ah no and none of these are worth it

00:30:18.229 --> 00:30:23.599
either but the thing is you're going to

00:30:21.979 --> 00:30:25.549
be like you should do what it's new that

00:30:23.599 --> 00:30:30.049
is a saving that's something we're going

00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:32.149
to save for when it becomes more easily

00:30:30.049 --> 00:30:34.190
done I mean even this situation we put

00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:36.529
ourselves in here is kind of a nightmare

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:40.129
like we got a beat hush or at least

00:30:36.529 --> 00:30:43.039
attempt to beat hush without a whole

00:30:40.129 --> 00:30:46.369
heck of a lot going for us I don't think

00:30:43.039 --> 00:30:52.789
we're about to get spun we only have one

00:30:46.369 --> 00:30:54.169
syringe so we'll take science shouldn't

00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:57.169
have done that if you want to be able to

00:30:54.169 --> 00:30:59.899
go into our shop now we can do it

00:30:57.169 --> 00:31:01.699
definitely but for a second there's but

00:30:59.899 --> 00:31:05.589
I didn't mean to pick up that half red

00:31:01.699 --> 00:31:10.759
heart all you burn me good that hurts so

00:31:05.589 --> 00:31:13.339
Guppies tale irrelevant to a club's

00:31:10.759 --> 00:31:16.339
quite nice I'm going to donate enough

00:31:13.339 --> 00:31:19.569
money to get you to 200 hopefully so at

00:31:16.339 --> 00:31:22.489
least you make some progress there

00:31:19.569 --> 00:31:23.430
level 3 store upgrade I'm happy to see

00:31:22.489 --> 00:31:24.570
that

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:28.470
[Music]

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:32.850
I mean this is the end I think we blow

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:35.870
this up see what we get lockdown two of

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:38.220
those that's a good start all righty

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:40.019
we're probably not going to use bombs on

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:45.809
hush so let's do the like next-level

00:31:40.019 --> 00:31:49.340
strat of trying to find a crawlspace

00:31:45.809 --> 00:31:49.340
flash black market

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:59.620
could find oh we found it get out of

00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:04.420
here it's a crawl space with three

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:06.730
pennies inside of it you've got to get

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:10.510
yourself three pennies got yourself

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:12.040
stuck in in the home and I guess we will

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:16.240
use bombs because they're sad bombs but

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:25.420
anyway what's the game plan you should

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:27.970
use the void against the hush when you

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:30.820
know you're going to win you can use the

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:33.160
question mark card at any moment to give

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:34.870
yourself probably a pretty nice

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:38.590
permanent polaroid period of

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:39.610
invincibility except it won't be

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:43.270
polaroid it'll be from Book of Shadows

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:45.940
but still same function different name

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:48.810
the other thing is we definitely should

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:48.810
have taken Tarot cloth

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:57.340
but this would be a big wing because if

00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:02.110
there's there's nothing saying that this

00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:03.580
had to be a win we did throw away more

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:07.540
HP than we should have

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:09.760
without a doubt right on a limb and say

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:13.120
that no in the future you might want to

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:18.210
throw away 0 HP instead of what we threw

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:18.210
away which was not zero HP not at all

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:23.080
however a win here would be nice a loss

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:24.370
I think I would just I would shrug my

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:26.410
shoulders I'd be like you know what I

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:28.450
did it to myself we could have had max

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:32.710
HP or close to max HP for this fight but

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:37.170
instead I I went to the ballsy decision

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:37.170
and it was actually very very super

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:43.210
lesson learned and you know a lesson

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:45.900
learned is a lesson earn man I don't

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:45.900
know what that means

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:52.419
I've done the crime and now I'll do the

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:54.809
time that's an expression it sort of

00:33:52.419 --> 00:33:54.809
makes sense

00:33:55.919 --> 00:34:07.539
eight of these back well that one was a

00:34:05.169 --> 00:34:09.310
little scary app that pretty much

00:34:07.539 --> 00:34:13.359
directly contributed to me taking damage

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:14.770
right there well it's going to be close

00:34:13.359 --> 00:34:18.330
we're about halfway through the fight

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:21.669
he's about halfway through his HP a

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:23.740
little bit more than half way now but

00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:27.250
you know the sample size is small enough

00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:29.950
here that all dude that was clutches

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:31.750
pretty fly I want you to know that I

00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:35.080
knew what I was doing there I saw the

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:36.520
pretty fly and I thought maybe there was

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:40.089
a chance I could get back to where I

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:44.409
needed to go wow that's basically just

00:34:40.089 --> 00:34:45.700
the epitome of a dick move oh I really

00:34:44.409 --> 00:34:47.740
thought that wasn't going to catch me

00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:49.659
well you know why you got me fair play

00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:53.429
hush fair play for now we at least got

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:56.409
something new done is apollyon maybe

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:57.460
