##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.300
everybody welcome acting on the line

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.160
please money-wise again truth + it's a

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.750
daily yesterday's daily was terrible we

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.840
came 5058 percentile overall it actually

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.020
tanked my overall average by like point

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.109
six percent which is remarkable it

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.760
really is but I tried I still don't feel

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.920
like I just totally farted it up so I

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.480
must be missing something so obvious

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.160
that I can't even see it which doesn't

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.740
make any sense today's run at least you

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.719
know at first glance seems like my kind

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.550
of run the kind of run I ask for all the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.920
time and above all else I have like a

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.719
Redemption arc here so I mean I again

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.969
feel the need to apologize for

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.160
yesterday's daily performance without

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:50.340
putting too much of an excuse on it like

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:53.239
that was a pretty bad pretty bad video

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.579
that's not the commentary was okay but

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.870
the obviously the performance itself was

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.960
not particularly strong but today's

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.809
daily is a daily that goes to mega satan

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.299
as the lost it goes further than all the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.100
way and it gives you a character that

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.070
really tests your skill while

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.650
simultaneously like is very very strong

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.299
it's what I like about the lost it's

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.640
like actually one of the strongest

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.640
characters in the game if it could pick

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.020
up HP because you're sandbag it's not

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.880
really hamstrung that's what I'm looking

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.770
for because you're hamstrung by not

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.340
being able to pick up HP obviously the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.200
lost it still is a remarkable feat to

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.400
win a run is the loss especially you

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.380
know going to magazine and we're going

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.090
to hope to fulfill that destiny here

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.439
today but especially in the early game I

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.880
got no problem with being the loss we

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.460
are looking for small rock it's not

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.240
going to tank our speed because we do

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.570
have no speed upgrades right now is that

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.759
the way that works I thought it was just

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.170
one not hearts and then you gave me

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.930
hearts and then I'll heart for beating

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.729
you as well okay okay

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:06.000
dolls squandered don't squander it you

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:08.009
got everything you need here bombs we

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.200
should turn we should have turned the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.700
spirit hearts into bombs that's the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.680
right course of action here so this is

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.200
our secret room this is one way that we

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.680
could by the way

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:22.540
at top scores they were in like the 52

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.959
high 50 thousands today so if we want to

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.910
rank well we have to play pretty well

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.379
which sounds obvious but sometimes you

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.700
know I've had good scores on dailies I

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.519
didn't think I did particularly well on

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.900
sometimes you just get like the right

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.580
permutations of things and then ends up

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.310
working out well for you but today we're

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.010
going to have to be good at the video

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.750
game she's not always a foregone

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.060
conclusion for me I think so far

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.819
honestly that ace of clubs play was like

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.380
relatively smart but maybe we should

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.910
have used our bomb one of them at least

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.500
instead to get into the shop and maybe

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.630
it's a special shop who knows either way

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.819
we're not to put out by the situation

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.090
just yet I do want to get a teleport

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:04.540
card and it's okay good for a variety of

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.650
reasons but especially good because we

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.440
can use that as a get-out-of-jail-free

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.489
if we take damage on a big room and one

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.549
of the rooms are most likely to take

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:18.730
damage on would probably be a room like

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:19.930
that we do want this for now it's not

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.090
like we're using our space bar item

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.889
anyway that's another question mark pill

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.870
I think but anyway what I'm getting at

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:30.760
is we want some kind of failsafe in case

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:33.510
things go terribly wrong and cursed

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.299
skull can actually do that unfortunately

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.160
right now to do that is going to be a

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.600
little deleterious because it's going to

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:46.180
re-roll holy mantle the only way we can

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:48.459
teleport is by using our space bar item

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.310
it's not something I feel great about I

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.780
do want to get two more bombs one to

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.329
give us access to Isaac's room and then

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.010
one more to hopefully give us a chance

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.660
to get either a crawl space or a black

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.790
market ideally black market of course

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.069
because everything get in a black market

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.569
is free as the loss let's see how we do

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.280
on this deal with the devil first Ace of

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.790
Spades

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.380
that's a tough situation because I want

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:16.560
to use the ace of spades but I also

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.560
really want the bomb so like

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.370
I'll do it

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.530
the spirit' odds are meaningless it's

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.419
something about it still feels wrong but

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.389
I think that was right and now that

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.190
we've only got two bombs but that at

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.450
least gives us access to Isaac's room

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.919
and maybe there'll be a bomb on him he

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.450
will get one for finishing off this boss

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.889
fight or something who knows plenty

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.900
items can provide you with the necessary

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:42.150
consumable to get the job done there

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:45.730
mom's pill nonsense

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:48.070
okay here's what you do you ignore this

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.750
and you ignore this because we're going

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.280
to try to get deals with the angel and

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.480
since the release of the new booster

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.100
pack deals with the angel that's a

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.730
question mark deal I know it to be

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:03.790
certain the tears down was not even that

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:07.810
bad but since angel rooms are better now

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:09.430
my my hope is that we're going to get

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.600
something excellent out of them there's

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:15.940
really no reason okay so this was the

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:22.510
right decision because it still gives us

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:23.950
access please but yeah I'm hoping that

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.160
the angel rooms will work out for us and

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:29.080
I'm thinking maybe it's possible that

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.330
like we need to buy a bomb basically is

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.610
the way this goes right now but get one

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.460
from our special room here I'm thinking

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.530
it's plausible that maybe some people

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.300
would absent mindedly take dark bomb

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.610
because it's a great item and they would

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.780
find themselves being shoehorned into

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.430
these deals of the devil admittedly

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.110
deals with the devil are great as the

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.710
loss because you get a high damage items

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:53.169
for free but I'm going to try to take a

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:57.580
slightly alternate path here not just

00:05:53.169 --> 00:06:02.590
the not just to like buck the trend but

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:04.150
to experiment a little bit I guess is

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.430
what I'm trying to say here okay we did

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:10.390
get bombs that's good I doubt we'll get

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:12.220
a black market usually like a crawlspace

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:14.260
is probably like a four to one favorite

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.570
or something like that but even a

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.970
crawlspace can be okay and you know we

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:23.260
can go to our shop as well I'd rather

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:24.970
spend one of our five keys then just

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.510
spend one more bomb there's not a good

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.510
idea on my part

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:45.159
yeah never should I use that am i

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:48.240
sweating a little bit yes I probably

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:48.240
could use a bomb

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:59.199
my hunch being I can buy one from the

00:06:54.759 --> 00:07:01.060
shop probably there we go

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:02.439
you just got with these guys it's all

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.060
about the knock back so I'm not even

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:10.990
sweating the time that it's taking us

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:12.610
here okay we've made it we got basically

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.610
nothing for our troubles the bomb was

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:17.139
maybe important but all right so what's

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.509
the game play we'll go a little faster

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:21.669
here hopefully place a bomb bomb has

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:23.529
given us access to a crawl space and the

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:25.020
crawl space is just a crawl space it

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:30.069
gives us game kid

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:31.810
game kid is better for us by virtue of

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:33.430
the fact that we can use it as a once

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:36.520
every six rooms teleport the

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:37.900
invincibility is basically irrelevant if

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.210
we choose to keep curse skull but I

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.740
think being able to teleport is more

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:46.000
valuable than being invincible for part

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:48.969
of a room I think at least we've got ace

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.620
of hearts I will take a night light I

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:53.349
don't think it's particularly great but

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.300
then we got to go the good news is were

00:07:53.349 --> 00:08:02.169
not in a bad situation in many different

00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:04.689
ways here we ask what is the mirror me

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:06.789
that you know what reddit.com slash are

00:08:04.689 --> 00:08:08.139
slash binding of issac I want to know

00:08:06.789 --> 00:08:11.469
what the mirrors mean what is this

00:08:08.139 --> 00:08:16.990
mirror I have a thousand hours I've

00:08:11.469 --> 00:08:19.029
never seen it before yeah but what just

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:20.919
wait a minute this is okay it's a joke I

00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:24.339
don't understand what the mirror does is

00:08:20.919 --> 00:08:25.839
it is it an Easter Egg I mean I feel

00:08:24.339 --> 00:08:29.740
admittedly I feel like an idiot right

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:32.589
now but I want to figure it out limit my

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:35.319
search to our binding of issac relevant

00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:37.650
links from the past week booster pack to

00:08:35.319 --> 00:08:39.419
new mirror thing

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:41.880
apparently when you touch it it changes

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:44.750
your synergy look when you touch it it

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:51.240
randomizes your look based on your items

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:53.390
okay so it's just uh it's just a visual

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:57.330
thing good to know

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:58.890
okay so I am a genius and everybody can

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:01.529
bow down to my omnipotence because I

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:07.980
just got Godhead out of an angel room so

00:09:01.529 --> 00:09:10.589
r.i.p anybody who took dark bomb verb

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:12.060
gives us another full health pill not

00:09:10.589 --> 00:09:14.760
that relevant we still we're not

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.320
crushing it in terms of our ID our DPS

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.730
but the fact that we can home in and

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.950
these shots have a large hitbox now is

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:23.130
really nice obviously so Godhead is

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:24.870
hugely valuable still need a little bit

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:28.260
more to take us like completely over the

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:30.420
top here obviously no the pill rank will

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.650
help them okay let's get out of here I

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.900
was thinking like we might as well come

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:35.339
in here and then if there's enemies we

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:40.260
just teleport out like if we get hit

00:09:35.339 --> 00:09:42.959
what you just teleport out good job team

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:45.240
good job okay so I spend so much time

00:09:42.959 --> 00:09:47.400
dealing with that freaking mirror on the

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.740
last daily I was like what does this

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:53.910
thing do it doesn't change my stats I

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:56.430
want to be a demon honey you can't be a

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:58.380
seaman you gotta be born in the demon

00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:00.810
hood you can mom you said I could do

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:05.010
whatever I wanted and I want to be a

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:06.660
demon alright I don't know where this

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:08.520
joke there's no punch line to this joke

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.470
it's just it exists to allow me to

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.670
construct a ridiculous character and

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:13.080
then there's no framework for that

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:13.970
character we wish to thrive but that's

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:18.390
okay

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:21.080
well I gotta say you know what why did I

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:21.080
not teleport

00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:33.299
either way I gotta say we're playing

00:10:26.639 --> 00:10:38.419
okay today where do I think we're going

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:41.879
to rank maybe 20 okay that's too far a

00:10:38.419 --> 00:10:46.049
few extra bombs and a perk spill

00:10:41.879 --> 00:10:50.970
probably a secret room indeed a secret

00:10:46.049 --> 00:10:53.879
room and compost you got to feel like

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:58.169
game kids good and invincibility is a

00:10:53.879 --> 00:11:00.929
get-out-of-jail-free however compost is

00:10:58.169 --> 00:11:03.269
actually like could potentially give us

00:11:00.929 --> 00:11:04.949
an outrageous amount of damage if we get

00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:07.230
the right sort of permutations I think

00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:09.449
so we'll roll at that we will go battery

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:12.540
baby because why not is basically what

00:11:09.449 --> 00:11:14.249
it comes down to for me if we got the

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:16.319
money in a big way we might as well

00:11:14.249 --> 00:11:17.999
write it turns all consumables as well

00:11:16.319 --> 00:11:20.129
so you got to be careful about compost

00:11:17.999 --> 00:11:22.350
it's an item that you know I still don't

00:11:20.129 --> 00:11:24.839
fully understand embarrassingly enough

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:30.919
but I know when you press the spacebar

00:11:24.839 --> 00:11:34.230
you get the spiders so if it can turn

00:11:30.919 --> 00:11:37.079
consumables into spiders and flies

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:39.449
that's excellent for me because I'm not

00:11:37.079 --> 00:11:42.239
sure if you noticed but like I don't

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:45.899
care about almost any consumable in the

00:11:42.239 --> 00:11:47.339
game as The Lost right now well it's not

00:11:45.899 --> 00:11:52.970
true I mean you just watch me picked up

00:11:47.339 --> 00:11:55.139
pick up money bomb and a key as well but

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:58.439
read hearts in particular are going to

00:11:55.139 --> 00:12:02.489
be like completely useless we're back on

00:11:58.439 --> 00:12:03.929
schedule for timing I think we're just

00:12:02.489 --> 00:12:05.399
gonna take it and then we're going to

00:12:03.929 --> 00:12:07.559
grab all these and then we're going to

00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:09.269
do that we're going to hold per throw

00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:10.199
because we can and unfortunately we're

00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:12.480
not gonna be able to blow up the angel

00:12:10.199 --> 00:12:13.980
statue but we don't need to it would

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:16.019
have been nice to do so but I didn't

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:18.149
have any points at the time or sorry I

00:12:16.019 --> 00:12:19.709
didn't have any bombs at the time it

00:12:18.149 --> 00:12:22.549
does give you more points to blow up the

00:12:19.709 --> 00:12:22.549
angel statue so

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.140
maybe I should use compost first I mean

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:30.120
we're going to be getting a lot of

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.890
batteries is the thing you don't really

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.990
need a fool card to blow this up for

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:38.270
more spiders potentially I want the

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:38.270
bombs but I will compost everything else

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:47.520
the idea is it's a proactive play to be

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:50.070
using compost whereas the game kid was a

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.810
reactive play that doesn't mean people

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:53.370
always act as if like things that are

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:56.160
proactive or better than things that are

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:58.230
reactive I mean that's probably largely

00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:00.360
true unless you're proactive in a really

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:02.400
bad way like what if you're like I'm

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.020
worried about a meteor hitting the

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.720
planet so I built a bunker and use our

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:08.730
life savings honey that was a were

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.020
destitute now we can't buy groceries

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:12.300
well it's always better to be proactive

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:17.610
than reactive right that's that's a

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:18.810
fallacious argument being reactive is

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:21.110
okay that's why we have you know

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:24.180
reaction time

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:27.030
don't proactively slam on the brakes and

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:29.760
go like I could have come over into this

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:31.710
lane although that is kind of the basis

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.770
of defensive driving on a conceptual

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:36.330
level at least by the way I don't

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:37.830
understand I thought curse skull made it

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:40.050
so be teleported every time we use our

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:42.510
space fire item but apparently it's not

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:43.980
the case all right so that was our smart

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:48.510
per throw because we had nothing else to

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:50.880
do with that maybe if you have holy

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:54.960
mantle you don't get acted it doesn't

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:57.240
really make sense to me but either way

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:59.130
the teleport is important I would like

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.690
to have it but we can replace it with

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:02.940
another trinket I suppose and be

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:04.680
completely fine I don't think we want

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:08.850
anything there what we will do is look

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:11.010
for our no we've already been to our

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:13.650
shop I would look for our item room and

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:14.910
then move on from there I mean I guess

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:17.400
we could blow that thing up and maybe

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:20.340
composted is it like a donation machine

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:21.390
for consumable sorta probably not it

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:24.990
probably just acts like a slot machine

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:31.470
if you blow it up it's my guess

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:33.300
I will always pick up anything but read

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.980
hearts or not not always but for now I

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:37.620
will pick up anything but read hearts

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:40.530
and spirits I suppose because we could

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:42.270
still use them and they're still worth

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:44.940
points no matter what like a lovers card

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:49.770
you pop that down for surgeons and then

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:59.370
an ace of clubs hmm got to think about

00:14:49.770 --> 00:15:01.140
that one we're not short on time but I

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:06.990
don't particularly want to take forever

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:08.190
here we should have used compost as well

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:10.890
I think it's always better to use it

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:13.590
when it has a charge instead of always

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:15.360
waiting for consumables but maybe I'm

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:19.670
incorrect in that assessment I'm not

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.670
sure it's this he's not a secret room

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:25.610
Celtic Cross is meaningless but I will

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:29.460
pick it up out of some strange sense of

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:31.170
duty and I was like let's get compost

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:35.580
before we fight these bosses and that

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:36.720
was idiotic unfortunately so I'm holding

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.610
the death card because I think that has

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:40.410
value but I got to move on now and I've

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:41.940
made a big width there I should have

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:45.780
done them the boss trap room like that

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:47.220
was my intention but hey if that's the

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.600
thing you're going to complain about my

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.650
day I'm talking about myself here I'm

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.210
hoping not too many people are

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:52.110
complaining about this so far but if

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:53.550
that's what we're going to find

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:58.160
ourselves complaining about on the last

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:58.160
run life is good as far as I'm concerned

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:11.560
the death card is not traditionally that

00:16:08.139 --> 00:16:13.149
great but in a game like this where you

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.850
know getting hit twice on a single room

00:16:13.149 --> 00:16:18.850
kills us I think it's valuable you that

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:20.769
death card is like a way to get a pseudo

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:22.449
get-out-of-jail-free I also might just

00:16:20.769 --> 00:16:25.889
completely rebuke everything that I said

00:16:22.449 --> 00:16:29.470
and use the death card as a way to get a

00:16:25.889 --> 00:16:31.959
pretty big room killed like quickly this

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:34.000
guy can sneak shops through the rocks so

00:16:31.959 --> 00:16:36.009
you got to be careful there may be

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:42.430
pennies are more valuable to us as flies

00:16:36.009 --> 00:16:45.670
but we'll figure it out one day addicted

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:48.029
1 makes you larger neither that bad

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:48.029
really

00:16:49.319 --> 00:16:53.860
I'm starting to realize one speed is not

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.290
all that much you know we could really

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:58.180
use like the easiest damage augmenter

00:16:56.290 --> 00:17:01.779
for us right now is if we were just able

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:04.419
to get piercing shots because our tears

00:17:01.779 --> 00:17:06.549
are not that good right now you've got

00:17:04.419 --> 00:17:08.890
it or no God in you know I think I've

00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:10.480
kind of I've helped build the narrative

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:12.640
that if you have God head you don't need

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:19.360
anything else it's not true really at

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:24.280
least I will also say I'm not overly

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:26.020
concerned about boss rush right now this

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:28.870
might be one of those runs where the

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:33.640
boss rush is not the right call it's

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:35.950
just so likely we die on it due to the

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:38.799
fact that I mean we have four point four

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:42.539
seven damage and an eleven rate of fire

00:17:38.799 --> 00:17:45.580
and no means with which to escape from

00:17:42.539 --> 00:17:47.110
boss rush if we do get hit once I guess

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.909
we get a teleport card we should try to

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:52.419
go to boss rush and if a miracle happens

00:17:48.909 --> 00:17:56.100
we could live through it and if it

00:17:52.419 --> 00:17:56.100
doesn't happen then we just teleport out

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:05.440
Thank You Godhead Godhead did the did

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:08.500
the deed for us on that one the shots

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:14.190
were not supposed to hit but the hitbox

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:16.660
made them hit it's a troll bomb okay

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:18.760
well again we're kind of in the

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:26.289
situation where we basically have to go

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:26.980
as fast as we can that's always a little

00:18:26.289 --> 00:18:28.809
scary

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:30.130
we completely chose the wrong direction

00:18:28.809 --> 00:18:31.900
if we had some kind of mapping we

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:33.460
wouldn't have to go as fast as we can we

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.299
do want to go to the shop on this floor

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:36.039
though because the chance of getting

00:18:34.299 --> 00:18:39.010
something useful is magnified by the

00:18:36.039 --> 00:18:40.450
fact that we definitely will not have

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:44.409
green because we already fought greed in

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:46.240
the secret room so but it is it's a

00:18:44.409 --> 00:18:48.520
bummer to be this far into the daily and

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:52.929
be like yeah oh my best damage dealer

00:18:48.520 --> 00:19:03.370
probably attack fly but you know what

00:18:52.929 --> 00:19:05.470
thank God we have a tax lie but we would

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:07.179
like to go slightly faster because of

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:08.890
the whole like we got to go thing what

00:19:07.179 --> 00:19:10.860
hurt people there I don't know what it

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:13.659
was but I like it

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:19.289
we will take 9 volt we're not going to

00:19:13.659 --> 00:19:19.289
take the jar hang demand is also useless

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:30.789
fishtail + compost that's the dream so

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:33.850
what every time we generate flies we now

00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:38.020
generate twice as many maybe spiders - I

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:41.200
don't know so pop here a font double it

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:42.760
up I know we lost some things in the

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.240
middle there but I'm completely ok with

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:46.570
that

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:48.460
ok with 9 volt this means we're getting

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:52.539
a lot of flies I don't know if we found

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:53.770
the if we found the seam we found the

00:19:52.539 --> 00:19:57.039
keys for the kingdom or something like

00:19:53.770 --> 00:20:00.280
that but we've got like a strictly

00:19:57.039 --> 00:20:02.260
better version of Guppies head now dolt

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:04.059
smelted both of our trinkets that's

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:05.679
pretty solid we probably should have

00:20:04.059 --> 00:20:07.960
smelted the golden key if I'm being

00:20:05.679 --> 00:20:10.500
honest what are we hoping to get out of

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:13.450
a golden key it's late in the game

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:18.340
it's a great opportunity to use one of

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:22.960
your many bombs I think are pretty flew

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:31.050
pretty fly blocked that shot so that not

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:31.050
that one though you got to go like no oh

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:39.580
that one actually kills me inside I had

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:47.920
it under control like a hundred percent

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:50.110
oh dude that one like after I died I got

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:53.020
like a pain in the back of my skull and

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:58.200
that is the pain of idiocy that hurts me

00:20:53.020 --> 00:21:04.150
because I had such a good position going

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:06.310
either way it is what it is came top

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:08.290
1,000 but we were I was gunning for like

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:11.200
a top 100 there and it all came crashing

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:14.260
down oh oh that hurts

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.820
I wasn't trying to get close was trying

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:17.980
to get close to place a bomb I wasn't

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:20.200
trying to get close to use the orbital

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:22.540
that's a bomber at least the rank is not

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.590
terrible but thanks for watching hope
