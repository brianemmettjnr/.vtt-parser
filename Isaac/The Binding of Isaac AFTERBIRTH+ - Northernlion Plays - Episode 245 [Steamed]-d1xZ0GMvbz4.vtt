##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.380
everybody welcome back to northernlion

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.950
checks to make sure there is a recording

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.590
being made right now yeah okay sweets

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:13.139
it's me I'm playing Isaac I like Isaac

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.389
oh no we don't want to have any kinds

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.039
leave the freaking continue this run you

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.600
get you know this is the one that we got

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.539
rerun on which is why we have a million

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.680
in 1% right now there's also why the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.760
streak is going to end so you know what

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.150
we've been doing Eden runs for a while

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.529
let's go back to some randoms

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.380
so we can mix it up a little bit and

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.160
Kane is actually like pretty close to my

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.399
Platonic ideal for randoms you know why

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.280
v18

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:45.360
a and cp6 ah he starts with 4.20 damage

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.039
I can't believe that don't ever speak to

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.829
me I can't believe that this late in the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.719
game I'm still coming up with reasons to

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.010
like shuffle my power rankings of

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.260
characters but 4.20 damage is a

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:03.600
legitimate excellent reason to be happy

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:07.110
to be Kane the dude is strong why he

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.540
gets the damage bonus and like Lilith

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.369
doesn't is beyond me maybe there's

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.369
another character he starts at 4.20 I

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.259
thought but you know I think Kane is is

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.390
doing decent as is but you know I'm not

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.890
going to complain about it cuz worth

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.310
benefiting from it right now so I'm

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.439
going to pull a little tip out of the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.130
player unknowns battlegrounds toolkit

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.630
here and abuse our surroundings to get a

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.369
little bit of extra damage that didn't

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.630
put us at any risk whatsoever it's there

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.420
never really considered it but many

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.890
monstros got a little advantage there

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.110
because this shot height is so high that

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.220
you can just launch bullets over rocks

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.149
maybe leave yourself safer than you

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.329
otherwise would be but we're probably

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.880
going to be fine either way I met an

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.840
individual today if you're watching

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.420
these but you're probably watching the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.119
videos kata now we're out I exercise my

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.579
constitutional right to vote and I voted

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.439
early because I thought that it would be

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.509
smart to beat the crowd but then it was

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.799
really crowded and I was like voting on

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.860
a Saturday what do you think of buddy

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.379
but either way that's so tangential of

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.660
the story then we got a sandwich

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.530
afterwards and there's a nice gentleman

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.050
served

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.180
he said do you make youtube videos and I

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.770
said yes and he said hey I love your

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.080
videos and I said thank you

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.910
and I said have a nice day and that was

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.380
that and I was waiting outside for Kate

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.550
who was catching a Pokemon playing some

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.420
Pokemon go and a car drove by and this

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.800
is where you're going to think it's

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.780
getting a little suspicious but a car

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.100
drove by and a nice gentleman in the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.380
passenger side rolled down his window he

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.420
didn't roll it down you know it's 2017

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.340
to use the automatic windows but he said

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.900
are you northernlion and I said yes I am

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.430
and he said it would be cool be parked

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.370
and took a picture and I said that would

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.709
be completely okay and thus that is what

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.850
happened we do get a card out of taro

00:02:52.709 --> 00:03:00.840
cloth so I'm like a high on life right

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:04.350
now I feel like I might actually be the

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.959
most popular entertainment producer on

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.430
planet Earth is this what like Leonardo

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.120
DiCaprio feels when he walks outside

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.100
it'll use the best oh stop it you that's

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.319
you didn't have to say that obviously

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.700
I'm being like 80% facetious here I

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:22.530
didn't mean to give you my key you owe

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.690
me that key I want one more sense so we

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.280
can get car battery when the floor has

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.570
been really good so far but car battery

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.079
would would be nice as well let's see

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.030
what we get from our boss I guess but

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.489
yeah I mean first off if you are those

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.940
people or one of those people thank you

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.890
you made my day secondly that

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.480
straight-up does not happen very often

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.000
and it was remarkable to me that it

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.670
happened in such quick succession and

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.709
then when the second gentleman drove off

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.299
he shouted out of his car window you

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.049
missed a tinted rock and I was like you

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:57.060
know what you're a true fan so I shot

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.230
his tires out and left him to bleed out

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.730
on the sidewalk no of course not I

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.709
laughed and then the people around me

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.450
were like what is this weirdo laughing

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.060
at and I went back to the station I

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.500
normally hold in society which is people

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.940
being like what is this weirdo do in any

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.200
way what we got here did I already place

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.729
the bomb there I might have you know

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.010
let's just get back out here that's fine

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.959
we did very very well on this floor and

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.520
latchkey by itself is a good pickup as

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.169
well let me close out of this window

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.760
just so I don't get like an unwanted

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.940
message or something like that

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.470
yeah so a taro cloth is killer right off

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.030
the bat we do have an arcade chance here

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.000
as well we got to luck we didn't really

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.650
improve our damage too much but only

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.490
directly because mini monster was

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.710
actually a pretty decent indirect damage

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.170
upgrade not quite as good as maybe like

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.670
a monster Rose lung but certainly not

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:52.290
bad we do actually get the arcade that

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.270
we qualified for it got to be a little

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.810
careful dude I was just going to say I

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:00.150
feel like we're due for small rock why

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.440
is our speed low we didn't get anything

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.900
that raised our speed our speed

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.150
shouldn't be lower maybe I'm

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.730
overthinking it anyway it's kind of bad

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.800
because we wanted some spirit out to

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:15.510
protect us while we did this but at the

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.790
same time small rock is always welcome

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:22.110
unless it makes our speed impossible to

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:23.970
manage but it didn't 6.23 damaged us is

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:28.650
definitely worth the cost of doing

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:30.570
business here an arcade with two HP not

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.870
really so much worth the cost of doing

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:36.630
business but life goes on horse is not a

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:40.770
good pill but it's good ish when you

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:42.780
know that it's coming when you have no

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.670
idea that it's coming it's an explosion

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.290
you know when you got an idea that it's

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:49.560
coming you can plan for it and release

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.880
it at the right time what do you mean it

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.800
sounds like I'm talking about sexual

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.800
intercourse that's gross and you've got

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.180
a sick mind buddy

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.770
almost the sick of that dude I meant

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.780
today shout it out of his car window you

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:09.750
missed attended Rock I'm joking it was

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:11.670
good-natured I hope all I'm saying is

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.430
that when you know you're about to know

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.740
okay sure I don't have any bombs cuz I

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.930
spent them all but I do wait wait wait

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.240
what do you please fly into here secret

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:25.260
room there you go okay

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:29.310
I don't need a range upgrade so I don't

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:38.070
really feel too invested in that trinket

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:38.820
they're bombs I was thinking we could do

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.650
some funky stuff

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.480
of course now that I have the I know

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:47.190
there's a toad to draught they're na'vi

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.990
okay may-maybe navi it's navi right i it

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.820
would have been fine if they had just

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.170
named it something more original i'm not

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.590
trying to insult intended

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:59.130
but there's already a navy you know

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:04.530
that's where the seals come from we

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:06.930
didn't get car battery this is the right

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.430
play I'm not too I mean is that a that's

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.780
the second secret room okay I'll pay

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.640
five steps to go to the second secret

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:18.720
room and now there's an eSports team

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:21.600
Navi makes it very confusing to remember

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.700
how the fairy name from Ocarina of Time

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:32.550
is pronounced made just me possibly just

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:35.280
me I really like the sound that Minnie

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.810
monstro makes it's like it's in a rap

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.000
music video it's going to go that I

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:41.370
can't do it properly I understand

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.540
apparently that's like a gang call sign

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:51.720
I'm not trying to ruffle any feathers

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:54.120
here the moon tough call talk I think

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:56.490
I'd rather keep one read hard head down

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:59.550
to the next floor is a little dicey I'll

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:02.100
admit I think we got you know high hopes

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:04.380
keeping ourselves going here it's a good

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:07.830
room appreciate the money I got no bombs

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:08.910
but Lisa shut sour look listen up you

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.560
know because we already found the secret

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:13.560
room you're just hanging out of a room

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.690
I've already seen not providing you the

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:18.420
benefit I require right now this is good

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:19.289
gravy right here so we do want to buy

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:22.169
champion

00:08:19.289 --> 00:08:27.029
else or as I've decided in the moment

00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:29.729
champion belt and as I've decided to

00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:33.089
adjust it again champion Pro V which is

00:08:29.729 --> 00:08:35.070
branded or the was not champion Pro V is

00:08:33.089 --> 00:08:39.750
not a brand of shampoo Pantene pro-v is

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:43.169
a brand of shampoo have we solved the

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:45.839
split ends problem see I opted out of

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:48.360
the split ends problem I was in Excel

00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:50.279
floor when I when I started shaving my

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.139
head or rather my genetics opted out of

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:55.649
the split ends problem for me so thank

00:08:52.139 --> 00:08:56.190
you for that I suppose I will take

00:08:55.649 --> 00:08:57.959
Taurus

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.490
zero point eight speed is really bad

00:08:57.959 --> 00:09:05.850
that was that was a bad decision on our

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:08.579
part but it seems like hair scientists

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:10.410
the world over just cannot solve the

00:09:08.579 --> 00:09:11.329
problem of split ends we're still

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:14.160
dealing with it

00:09:11.329 --> 00:09:16.290
laboratories full of surprisingly

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.880
attractive scientists and I'm not saying

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.250
scientists aren't attractive I'm just

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:23.339
saying these are models is the

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:25.019
difference I'd rather be with the

00:09:23.339 --> 00:09:26.880
scientists honestly because we could

00:09:25.019 --> 00:09:28.079
have a conversation after and I'd be

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.250
like what do you think about string

00:09:28.079 --> 00:09:31.699
theory and they'd be like you know

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.699
nothing

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:38.339
excuse me NL don't stigmatize all models

00:09:35.579 --> 00:09:39.839
as any okay but like I mean this but but

00:09:38.339 --> 00:09:41.610
then excuse me those two potential

00:09:39.839 --> 00:09:45.990
scientists is no but I didn't mean I'm

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:53.370
sorry okay I'm sorry I made a promise to

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:56.250
mesh to white let's go we've actually

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:59.850
been to probably every special room here

00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:02.069
which is really nice as long as we don't

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:04.310
encounter all that looks extremely

00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:07.050
stupid as long as we don't encounter

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:10.649
homing bombs or at least too many homing

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:13.500
bombs we should be pretty much good to

00:10:10.649 --> 00:10:16.019
beat this one that was easy enough dude

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:17.490
we need speed upgrades like I will maybe

00:10:16.019 --> 00:10:18.689
I should have taken that HP yep but I'm

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.949
not sweating too much because of our

00:10:18.689 --> 00:10:23.579
relatively low deal with the devil

00:10:19.949 --> 00:10:26.759
chance regardless but we need speed

00:10:23.579 --> 00:10:29.459
upgrades we need tourists to activate

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:31.440
faster and we need to be able to dodge

00:10:29.459 --> 00:10:33.540
on route to torus activate

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.810
so there is still champion belt back

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:40.709
there amazingly Lisa it's amazing to me

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:44.579
we have not managed to gain two cents to

00:10:40.709 --> 00:10:46.160
buy champion belt did find the second oh

00:10:44.579 --> 00:10:49.560
this is good stuff

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.180
Yara it's going to give us two black

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:54.529
loons algae's that's what we're looking

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.529
for cause algae's is safe right now

00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:02.129
there's more that is more Yaris there's

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:03.540
another year there's an a was a was is

00:11:02.129 --> 00:11:05.639
I'm just getting used even though it is

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.199
boss rush get-out-of-jail-free we've got

00:11:05.639 --> 00:11:09.990
a de gAHS there I could tell because our

00:11:07.199 --> 00:11:11.069
spirit art went up that's pecan oh so

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.420
now they're a walls are looking for

00:11:11.069 --> 00:11:16.889
black markets specifically or

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:20.009
crawlspaces that's an on sous as a hog

00:11:16.889 --> 00:11:21.120
Alonso case we got yara algae's and

00:11:20.009 --> 00:11:26.790
black runes

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:29.490
we're so unlikely to get anything

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:31.589
special out of here but I should go

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:33.329
explore I'm going to level with you I'm

00:11:31.589 --> 00:11:35.720
thinking that we won't take yara I'm

00:11:33.329 --> 00:11:38.279
thinking I'll take double black rune

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.959
whether or not we get a year later is

00:11:38.279 --> 00:11:43.319
largely irrelevant to me but what is

00:11:39.959 --> 00:11:44.579
highly relevant to me is using black

00:11:43.319 --> 00:11:46.620
room to give us some statistical

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:53.329
upgrades because we really could use

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:55.980
speed and I think that fairly plausible

00:11:53.329 --> 00:11:58.410
you get a speed upgrade pretty early see

00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:00.350
like that I I'll admit I position does

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:04.529
badly there but I could have dodged it

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:07.230
if I'd had more speed so this I feel

00:12:04.529 --> 00:12:08.819
like we're not going to get nearly full

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:10.380
value out of many of these runes but

00:12:08.819 --> 00:12:13.199
that's why I popped algae's right there

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:16.410
sure it only allowed us to get a a mimic

00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:17.730
and the mimics shocked but if we don't

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:19.769
use it we're going to leave some rings

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:27.800
behind here so similarly I'm intending

00:12:19.769 --> 00:12:31.199
to take double double Wow okay

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:34.110
black rune so I'm going to open these up

00:12:31.199 --> 00:12:35.550
now use the gyro rune to give us three

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:37.980
extra stone chests which give us an

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:39.209
emperor card an emperor card and of

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.559
course an emperor card so we know that

00:12:39.209 --> 00:12:42.420
we don't care about that last ones but

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:44.030
only doubles what's in it so I mean to

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.860
be honest Li - Emperor cards for

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:47.390
SiC it does save us from having to

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:49.460
backtrack but was it worth losing the

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:50.840
heiress and not have to backtrack no but

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.790
if one of those had Stephen in it

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.960
we'd be crushing it right now we would

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:57.980
have gotten Stephen and then three other

00:12:53.960 --> 00:13:02.360
items and gold chest items ain't nothing

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:05.480
to mess with I'm really I'm playing

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:08.300
around with the idea that it's not

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:11.660
always the right call to roll era into

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:13.520
perpetuity there is a lovely item don't

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:15.710
get me wrong you lovely trinket I should

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:18.500
say I don't think it's always the right

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:21.650
choice I think almost always it's the

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:22.070
right choice so I'm thinking here's what

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:26.120
you do

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:32.140
you got to hit the button and we do want

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:35.260
the bomb but I'm going to go tinted rock

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.260
lucky yes

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:47.800
that was almost extremely my bad but I'm

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:51.190
not interested okay um and then post

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:52.240
curse room uh well you know what we

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:54.040
should actually just use the emperor

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.210
card right out of the curse room first I

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.670
was like we'll go curse room and then

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:58.810
we'll walk back to the mob trap room and

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:03.510
then we'll teleport back but I think we

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:05.530
should just do it like this instead it

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:09.120
you just flying around or you got

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:11.620
something for me just flying around

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:14.860
that's fine you know you got to do

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:16.960
something keep yourself busy I don't

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.520
know the grand experiment here might not

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.810
have worked out that fantastic way for

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.540
us but it doesn't seem like it turned

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:26.740
out badly the thing is there was nothing

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:29.290
to suck up to begin with but we want to

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:31.000
use black rune to get maximum suck so if

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:33.600
we can find a library that's a good

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.240
opportunity for a little suck action

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:40.830
look it's on intentional vulgarity

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.830
alright my favorite Jamiroquai song

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:50.680
apart from that obviously uh ba thrush

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:53.980
basically fits the bill two to four

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:55.870
items actually you can have six items on

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:57.970
boss rush I think metal played just

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:59.530
defended us from getting hit is that

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:01.300
really what metal plate does and I've

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:05.680
just never noticed that it's kind of

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:11.500
like a decent infamy or maybe just

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:13.360
literally infamy either way we're on

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:16.330
paper bombs Russia and if we can get

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:18.750
black room to work on boss rush then the

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.750
world's our oyster

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:26.880
secret room thank you got to pay more

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:28.740
attention to look listen many many times

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:31.260
in the past I have squandered it's

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:33.840
wonderful gift steam sales beautiful

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:35.720
that is not worth losing here luck

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:40.140
upgrades I know

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:42.180
Taurus was still the wrong call but I'd

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:45.060
still believe that you will be here give

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:51.750
me a sign give me something I can suck

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:56.610
up with my black room Oh baby baby get

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:58.230
out of here Noby come come now the e Our

00:15:56.610 --> 00:16:01.440
Lady peace anybody Canadians will know

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:03.090
that one Canadians of a certain age my

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:06.300
favorite Ray Romano

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:08.340
television program aired on TNT for two

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:10.980
seasons before it was unfairly cut short

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:13.400
for whatever reason freaking Everybody

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:16.170
Loves Raymond there is 490 seasons

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:20.910
Ray Romano tries to make some actual

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:24.840
good you know pizza art they go where's

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:26.820
Robert bring bad rabbit the road no

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:28.710
Robert Barone a men of a certain age but

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:33.440
there isn't an actor whose name is Scott

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:33.440
Bakula is that not cool enough for you

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:45.870
there's one continent away from being a

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:48.390
Transylvanian count that would be Scott

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:50.600
Dracula we got it take it that's a

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:50.600
no-brainer

00:16:52.220 --> 00:17:00.420
we're like mad slow

00:16:55.620 --> 00:17:01.710
I'm not mad because I'm slow I think

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:04.140
metal plate just stopped us from taking

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:06.030
damage again it took a run where it's

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.500
not plausible for me to dodge for me to

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:09.350
appreciate an item I probably should

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:13.530
have been liking for a long time but

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:16.010
that's just a hunch that that's what it

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:16.010
actually does

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:29.740
gang golden bombs are good we do need to

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:31.059
go to the shop if we want to get the

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.620
value out of picking up the quarter

00:17:31.059 --> 00:17:34.240
otherwise the quarter might as well not

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.799
exist I know that's our secret room

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.690
don't patronize me

00:17:35.799 --> 00:17:39.190
what we do have now is a 100 percent

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:44.559
chance of getting a deal with the devil

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:46.030
which would be amazing if we can get a

00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:48.309
little closer to that Goffe dream blood

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:50.350
clot is good enough I had a feeling we

00:17:48.309 --> 00:17:54.100
might run into will cramp Oh territory

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:55.799
that's fine lump of coals good and we

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:58.600
can suck up Krampus head

00:17:55.799 --> 00:18:01.630
that's a tears and damage upgrade

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:03.820
normally could not ask for more in this

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:07.030
case and could ask for like slightly

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:08.200
more like some speed perhaps you know

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:16.120
what I'm going to I'm going to go for

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:23.620
broke here I'm going to suck up the key

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:27.460
piece I want speed badly is this a good

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:31.030
use of black room no but it is an urgent

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:33.370
use of black room there's no key piece

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:35.740
from this guy every time you make that

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:38.679
same mistake so I'm just doing this to

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:41.710
save time because we could have used our

00:18:38.679 --> 00:18:43.840
unlimited bombs to do this easily but

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:45.880
whatever I know I said we had to go to

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:48.580
the shop I still believe in my heart of

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:52.419
hearts I would like to do that but we

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:54.850
got a sadly also take advantage of our

00:18:52.419 --> 00:18:57.020
boss rush opportunities here where is he

00:18:54.850 --> 00:19:02.870
going

00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:07.250
he's just flying about okay it's a bad

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:09.950
time for the curse of the lost but at

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:15.620
this point you know I've got a pretty

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:18.890
good mental map of how a floor should

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:21.610
look not like it's a crapshoot to some

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:24.140
extent you know you just got to choose

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:27.140
direction it seems like it could be the

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:29.960
right way but when it comes to dead ends

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:31.610
and building a mental map out of those

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.200
dead ends we should have some good

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:35.720
instincts at this point we've been doing

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.880
this for long enough so there's a room

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:43.760
that I would consider non-compulsory

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:45.800
this item is good enough and we only a

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:49.640
Jamica we only have the one syringe I

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:51.440
think so here's up still great and the

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.870
tiers up is still great because it

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:55.970
stores the value if we ever break the

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:58.250
tiers cap I'm going to be happy that

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:58.820
that exists I know we're leaving keys

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:02.480
the keys

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:05.900
you know it's collateral damage starring

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:09.230
Tom Cruise Jamie Foxx who is the girl

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:14.140
the female lead in collateral I think it

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:17.210
was Will Smith's ex-wife Jada

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:21.740
pinkett-smith I believe is that the case

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:24.590
also rare a pre Avengers turn from Mark

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:27.530
Ruffalo dude 2004 how good was that year

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:31.100
for him Eternal Sunshine of the spotless

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:34.090
mind and collateral like come on birth

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:34.090
of a superstar right

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:49.029
keep it going here we are in a very good

00:20:45.519 --> 00:20:52.960
spot 7.23 damage with a tear cap rate of

00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:54.519
fire there's very little to complain

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.789
about in that department our HP is

00:20:54.519 --> 00:21:00.309
relatively good in fact I would go so

00:20:57.789 --> 00:21:03.039
far as to say that effectively that's

00:21:00.309 --> 00:21:04.419
pretty good to not not only like our run

00:21:03.039 --> 00:21:08.080
is where it is right now we also have

00:21:04.419 --> 00:21:10.720
for luck which is awesome but for luck

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:12.820
Oh way better than four loko am i right

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:16.509
fellow dare advocates but on the other

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:22.359
hand some speed would be nice but not of

00:21:16.509 --> 00:21:27.970
that variety go ball your kill them

00:21:22.359 --> 00:21:31.299
you're killing me with timing here we

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:39.480
might be in unable to kill mom in time

00:21:31.299 --> 00:21:45.700
territory right now that's not helping

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:49.409
or is it hurt me hurt me more yep this

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:52.590
is our game plan now this is my life

00:21:49.409 --> 00:21:52.590
thank you

00:21:55.010 --> 00:22:00.360
we got a check we got a check as we

00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:03.540
might not make it anyway okay that's

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:10.650
fine you didn't really love it we can do

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:14.640
this we can do this hurt me more hurt me

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:17.210
more there were those who said it

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.210
couldn't be done

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:23.940
you got it you just got to do this

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:24.900
unfortunately no matter what it is yeah

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:27.780
I see some good stuff

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:29.370
you got a black routed I didn't realize

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:35.940
that after we black ruined it we would

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:41.090
have to fight so maybe that was bad but

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:41.090
we did get a very nice speed upgrade

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:55.830
so yeah I mean I might be an idiot our

00:22:53.179 --> 00:23:01.470
HP is actually not that bad I mean it

00:22:55.830 --> 00:23:06.840
looks bad but I feel like if we just

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:10.440
catch the if we catch enemies at the

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:14.100
right time with five luck we alright

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:16.830
you're okay now that's too much we might

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:18.990
be able to make a same work for us given

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:20.549
the right circumstances here so I'm

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:40.980
thinking like if you find a fistula you

00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:43.129
can make it pop the creep down I can

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.129
wait

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:57.850
wrong time to make a stand here keep in

00:23:52.360 --> 00:24:09.270
mind we won't have 12 damaged forever 12

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:13.290
damage is just for now even no problem

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:20.920
so we shouldn't get too attached to that

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:23.740
you jerk however every other set should

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:28.690
also be the same as what it will

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:32.290
eventually be did you see that he took a

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:34.240
shot from beyond the grave and as much

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:39.370
as the inner frat boy and me respects

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:41.560
that that's not okay

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:50.770
alright so things are actually becoming

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:53.980
quite dangerous right now I have the

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:55.540
utmost faith in my attributes I don't

00:24:53.980 --> 00:25:00.820
necessarily have the utmost faith in

00:24:55.540 --> 00:25:04.090
myself but now I know what it takes to

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:08.590
win a run statistically the certain

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:15.160
degree of confidence we are above that

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:17.470
level of attributional okay metal play

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.640
may have just saved us I don't know what

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:21.600
I'm saying anymore by the way

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.600
okay pop up please

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.529
don't what

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:41.409
like the fire bounced off an invisible

00:25:32.529 --> 00:25:42.970
rock or something like that good blue

00:25:41.409 --> 00:25:46.770
candle play though these guys have got

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:46.770
to go they're the most dangerous game

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:55.890
this might be the right time to go for

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:59.559
Anna same play lots of weak enemies but

00:25:55.890 --> 00:26:02.919
you know a same might give us some HP

00:25:59.559 --> 00:26:06.429
but not getting hit will definitely not

00:26:02.919 --> 00:26:10.200
take away our HP which strikes me is

00:26:06.429 --> 00:26:13.380
maybe the smarter gamble in today's

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:13.380
uncertain economy

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:21.850
hopefully that deal with the devil is

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:23.950
still open for us this is our moment we

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:25.840
got it back we got it back I told you

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:27.130
I'd get you that was not very smart of

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:31.480
me but look at that look at that we got

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:34.020
it back we didn't get it back that time

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:36.669
though okay that was dumb

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:38.289
we got it back and simultaneously lost

00:26:36.669 --> 00:26:43.919
it that's why you can't get in too fast

00:26:38.289 --> 00:26:46.720
or you're just going to lose it again it

00:26:43.919 --> 00:26:49.710
could be said that I've made some

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.710
mistakes on this run

00:26:56.140 --> 00:27:07.300
yeah all I really thought he was going

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:10.210
to dust his own friend there perfect

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:15.940
instead we can dust him doesn't bother

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:18.760
me that was not very smart but here we

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:21.190
are thank God for a theme at least

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:24.010
working out occasionally got to be

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:26.200
getting close we're done oh those Midas

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:28.030
touch okay it's beautiful so yeah you

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.830
know some bad plays in there I would

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:31.740
never dispute that we're going to be up

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:34.990
fairly tight in this one

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:37.140
phrasing maybe and you know what I'm

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:39.760
glad that we're still alive many reasons

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:42.700
avoiding embarrassment but also a good

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:44.140
chance for redemption you know even if

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:46.210
we played badly to put ourselves in this

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:47.590
position we have to play well to get

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:49.060
ourselves out of it so there is a chance

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:56.880
for us to demonstrate that we're not

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:56.880
actually stupid now that sucks

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:05.800
saved please okay bad floor for curse of

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:08.440
the unknown as well but it's important

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:10.660
every time you get hit don't use Midas

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:15.070
touch as much as you use a thing like

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:17.440
let a theme have a chance before you go

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:19.000
for the Midas touch kill maybe one day

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:23.080
we'll enter that point we do have five

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:30.670
luck Oh Taurus is also such a good - tie

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:32.350
for God dude with tourists we should be

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:36.220
getting thanks for the poop we should be

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:37.750
getting myriad opportunity to use Midas

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:39.520
touch as well if only we need like the

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:41.920
virus or something to go along with it

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:46.030
and then you know nothing could stop us

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:51.700
the world is our Arboretum that's good

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:52.800
still waiting on a spirit hard had to be

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.940
done

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:59.050
17% chance of a deal with the devil

00:28:54.940 --> 00:29:02.620
strikes me as a little better than a 9%

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:08.770
chance unlimited bombs we've had like

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:11.310
three floors in a row Oh Nobby just

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:11.310
pointed it out

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:16.550
might as well grab the money we couldn't

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:19.400
fight hush we probably will choose not

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:22.420
to oh that's the stuff okay one black

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.420
heart let's go

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:35.510
so oh I tried so hard and I may have

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:42.560
even gotten so far I think you know what

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:46.180
happens in the end beautiful didn't beat

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:49.520
the odds did get a shot speed increase

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:51.830
at least we basically broke even

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:53.660
although I did pick up a half heart I

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:55.610
should not have or a full full heart I

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:57.890
should not have I did I almost call it a

00:29:55.610 --> 00:30:01.750
full shark yes I did I did almost call

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:01.750
it a full shark you caught that huh

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:12.230
this is still like one of my favorite

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:14.720
kinds of runs I would prefer you know if

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:17.510
we're going to be a glass cannon I want

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:21.560
to be like one of those World War two

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:24.980
ERA like mortars launcher you know I'm

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:29.390
not talking about a trip I am NOT

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:32.500
talking about the trebuchet mean what

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:32.500
can I say I walked into that

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:53.450
only two of them perfect okay it's a

00:30:50.299 --> 00:30:55.580
tough call dude you got a secret room

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:58.100
for me oh let's go we just won the game

00:30:55.580 --> 00:31:01.370
Thank You health uphill you're too good

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:10.100
to me you really are this has been bad

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:13.520
play by the way recognize that I'm going

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:15.919
to have people yelling at me that Navi

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:18.470
pointed to another door in there before

00:31:15.919 --> 00:31:19.880
you do so it's the same secret room it's

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:26.960
the same secret rooms as two different

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:28.640
apertures via which to enter it poor

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:30.410
play here got a little bit of a rerun

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:34.040
hangover or something like that it seems

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:36.860
but the utmost faith in our ability to

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:38.360
take this to conclusion notice they

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:43.549
didn't say it will win but cuckoo no I

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:45.200
think we got the win I would like to

00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:46.520
play better though we did sort of get

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:52.970
carried but if you can get carried by a

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:56.330
single health upgrade maybe it's not

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:59.299
getting carried at all let's go we do

00:31:56.330 --> 00:32:01.040
need to open that you know what I would

00:31:59.299 --> 00:32:04.000
love to see right now and you're going

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:09.520
to think this guy's out of his mind

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:12.110
nothing huh I would love to see IV bag

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:15.830
well preferably with something like the

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:21.600
wafer but I believe in the potential

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:25.240
power of IV bag second secret room

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:27.760
Blackheart I wonder could I redeem

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:31.470
myself by fighting Hoshi on this run

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:31.470
would you consider that a redemp-emp-emp

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:48.510
and be like definitely do not do that

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:54.550
yeah okay with No Deal we can't do that

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:58.860
I what was I think you're gonna go fight

00:32:54.550 --> 00:33:01.360
the hush with 4 HP so little brazen

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:05.040
that's okay we redeemed ourselves with a

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:07.930
pretty good mom's heart fight there um I

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:10.450
also have to say that that dodge was

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:13.170
pretty sweet I will to my own horn

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:14.890
slightly about that you idiot ghosts

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:19.090
fell into my trap

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:22.900
you absolute morons no secret room here

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:28.420
sadly you know the value of the Navy is

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:29.860
not just finding the secret room it's in

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:36.580
knowing which rooms the secret room is

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:39.040
not in end up saving you some bombs and

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:43.780
it means it shoot quickly our big

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:51.010
weakness for us right now what do you

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:53.080
got what you got Joker King being

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:54.640
conception is actually dope it's just

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:56.920
way too late for us to actually get

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:58.030
value out of it so unfortunately I'm

00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:00.870
going to have to say no but I do

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:00.870
appreciate the offer

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:13.659
now does look listen show you which one

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:16.870
of those blue fires has like spirit arts

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:19.450
in them or those generated at the time

00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:20.800
of you know finishing the explosion oh

00:34:19.450 --> 00:34:23.409
that's good stuff

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:27.270
no damage multipliers five point eight

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:27.270
one damage don't mind if I do

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:31.600
so yeah we might have gotten carried to

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:34.120
survive the womb and to survive ba

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:37.240
Suresh to be 100% honest with you but

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:38.560
now it looks like we're set if you're

00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:39.630
ragging on me for believing that ki

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:43.360
behind

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:45.190
explain yourself you think we're going

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:48.490
to find ten locks down here we already

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:49.440
got the the trinket that lets us open

00:34:48.490 --> 00:34:52.060
stuff for free

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:54.669
there is one valid example we could

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:56.320
accidentally take bombs or key and then

00:34:54.669 --> 00:34:58.450
we would have slightly less bombs

00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:04.330
although still more than we already have

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:12.940
so it's I feel you on that one this run

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:14.770
is very very good now but you still like

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:16.170
to not take damage here that's not good

00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:18.760
enough

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:21.010
with five luckily be expecting some

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:26.230
drops on the next floor oh there was a

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:27.820
secret room there nothing you can give

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:31.180
me here is interesting luck upgrades

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:32.890
maybe are the best and points of course

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:34.360
but we're not doing it daily where's our

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:35.920
second secret room buddy I'll do one

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:40.420
more room if we get a second secret room

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:45.220
you flying over here

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:47.580
I think he's flying over here nope he

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.580
tricked me

00:35:49.989 --> 00:35:59.450
now he's playing the long con on me I

00:35:56.019 --> 00:36:01.849
think ideally we don't want him to

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:03.859
teleport before we get to our tourist

00:36:01.849 --> 00:36:06.910
payout because we're going to get so

00:36:03.859 --> 00:36:09.499
much damage out of the Midas touch

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:11.029
we probably skipped like at least a

00:36:09.499 --> 00:36:15.999
third of this phase which is the most

00:36:11.029 --> 00:36:15.999
difficult phase as a result of that

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:26.490
nice okay cool now it seems like we're

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:27.750
steamrolling and really we owe most of

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:30.390
that the crickets head of them being a

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:33.180
hundred percent with you crack it crack

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:35.579
it crack it crack it all good stuff our

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:40.200
shot speed can absorb that it it lost a

00:36:35.579 --> 00:36:42.740
lot but I can live with it but dead

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:44.790
onion is so good at least if you can

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:47.310
make it work for yourself and don't even

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:52.050
get me started on dead I like this item

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:54.329
is giving us 22 damage I don't know if

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:56.190
it can get higher you know remember that

00:36:54.329 --> 00:37:03.750
Kanye West song I don't know if he can

00:36:56.190 --> 00:37:05.730
get in higher please stand still because

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:08.430
I really would mean first off yes I'd

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:13.670
like to murder you there is that seedy

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:17.940
little element of it but oh yeah

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:19.589
wouldn't mind being able to see how high

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:27.839
dead I can go let's say you can go into

00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:29.250
the low 30s yeah 30 pointing I guess it

00:37:27.839 --> 00:37:30.329
goes until you get double damage I don't

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:32.670
know how many times I've run that

00:37:30.329 --> 00:37:34.910
experiment for myself come to the same

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:40.160
conclusion

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:40.160
lovers actually a valuable card perhaps

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:46.950
you might suggest the right play with

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:48.990
ship to move is to get we should have

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:50.849
taken triple-a battery ages ago now but

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:54.450
it's only in hindsight that we can say

00:37:50.849 --> 00:37:56.040
that data minor is bad okay I know

00:37:54.450 --> 00:38:00.210
you're going to say use it once it's

00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:01.890
it's actually bad it's a bad item you

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:03.750
don't have to feel bad for liking it but

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:07.579
it's a bad item i someone's got to take

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:07.579
a stand for these shitty items okay

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:15.580
I think the right play with ship de Loup

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:17.590
is to use it to get the jump on enemies

00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:21.580
as opposed to using it when your damage

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:29.980
is at its peak better in my estimation

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:32.260
to just roast an enemy than it is to

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:33.220
worry about whether or not you're at the

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:36.400
damage cap

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:38.200
I actually thought there was basically

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:40.270
zero percent chance you were going to

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:48.220
live through that but you know what fair

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:50.740
play you got me and now we are going to

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:59.260
get the Royal you this is an exception

00:38:50.740 --> 00:39:00.910
let's get to 30 get back to 30 I don't

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:06.760
know we might have botched it either way

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:09.369
this guy's dusted and no void portal

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:10.600
good run at the end things got a little

00:39:09.369 --> 00:39:11.470
tight there for a while but for now

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.460
