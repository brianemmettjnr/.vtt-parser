00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.179
hey everybody welcome back to the line

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.529
please binding lines guys really plus we

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.420
don't have to talk about yesterday's

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.360
daily who cares about yesterday's daily

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.450
yesterday all my troubles seemed so far

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.019
away now they are just here to say here

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.980
to stay

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:21.990
what is this I got a tweet earlier today

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.930
someone said today's daily it was all

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.490
food the person who beguiles me on the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.800
leaderboards they said today's daily you

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.289
might seem a little familiar and I

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.640
thought to myself what are you talking

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.980
about what does that mean it might seem

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.559
a little familiar now I realize we have

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:45.059
like seven familiars conjoined we can't

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.450
shoot we can't shoot only only the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.670
familiars can shoot all right this is a

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:54.000
waking nightmare but at the same time

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.620
kind of a cool concept for a daily

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.090
because I mean let's be honest I could

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.289
use a little fuel myself and we could

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.160
all use a little change

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.409
we got the bean in our first floor item

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:10.460
room I'm just going to go fight the boss

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:13.140
quickly - oh my god champion little horn

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.270
it's the most annoying of all the little

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.740
horns but you could do worse on bosses

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.930
on the first floor we just need like if

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:26.850
rotten baby can land more flies faster

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:32.310
I'll be extremely happy but it is the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.960
worst version of little horn because of

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.150
the fact that you get contact damage

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.040
from touching the bombs but okay okay

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.119
okay we need weed like small rock

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.380
although I guess - now that I think

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.899
about it it doesn't affect us at all

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.909
except for helping Robin baby we

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.310
probably want to reroll the bean but

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:53.360
maybe you take the bean and then re-roll

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:56.219
the d4 instead I'd rather save a bomb

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.210
okay sac dagger is acceptable because we

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:04.890
can use that to deal damage and we get

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.380
black rune and black rune I mean

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.090
normally you'd want to use that too

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.590
let's see if we get small rock here I

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.540
don't really want to lower our speed but

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.879
you got to do what you guys

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.980
okay crack into it alright that's not

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:21.739
actually that what we did get a secret

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.969
room in a roundabout fashion people save

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.109
our bombs even though we could get more

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:29.689
money there um and I guess I'll see

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.890
what's going on in the shop maybe could

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.659
have gotten something half-price so this

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.349
is okay what do you use black room for

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:39.109
you could use it to suck up mom's heels

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.049
and mom's heels should provide us with

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:44.030
no benefit so it seems like a good suck

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.560
however I'm not gonna I mean you know

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.200
this already because I've already done

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.970
it but I'm not going to do that maybe

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.609
the mom transformation on this run would

00:02:49.970 --> 00:03:03.019
be more useful than not an average run

00:02:52.609 --> 00:03:04.790
and beyond that I think that we probably

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.090
want to use black room for like a bigger

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.980
stat game I'm not sure what stat gain we

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.269
would even want to see but I think we

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.450
want to use black room for that I

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.430
actually feel like we're we're kind of

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.190
doing pretty well today I think there is

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.489
a chance that some people would have

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.049
lost earlier on this run you know on the

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.690
first floor it's not necessarily a

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.150
difficult start but it's like weird

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:33.260
enough I did almost say novel but it's

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.829
it's weird enough to be a little bit

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.329
putting you off balance I think I

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.549
actually think that the bean might be

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:43.040
better than box of spiders here and the

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:46.659
word in the topsy-turvy world but in a

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.659
way I think that almost benefits me

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.030
because I can use this to my advantage I

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.560
like playing off balance you know I've

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.180
lived my whole life off balance I've

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.729
also lived my whole life like there's no

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.799
tomorrow we're going to take mob the

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:04.340
void at the very least it does make

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:09.290
rotten baby better we could always black

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:12.349
rune where we have here mama mega I mean

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.989
mono mega you know you've got a case for

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.459
mama mega here because obviously it

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.539
we've got golden bombs so you want to

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.370
take advantage of that but obviously

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:21.739
mama mega does give you the immediate

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.600
access to boss rush but boss rush should

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.000
be like actually zero

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.370
percent a problem for us at least right

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.530
now it doesn't you know past returns and

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.820
no guarantee of future returns but we're

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.440
killing enemies pretty quickly it's

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.610
going to become more of a problem if we

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.960
have to like just want to see if mob the

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.900
void will actually work for us and it

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.110
seems like the answer is no it's going

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.790
to become more of a problem later when

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.960
it comes to like trying to kill enemies

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.030
despite the fact that we really only

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.740
have our orbitals dealing damage and our

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.690
own damage doesn't really scale us very

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.540
well where the heck is the secret room

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:01.880
that's what I asked myself here but I

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:07.370
don't really see a great reason to to

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:09.320
take momma mega right now so you know

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.790
what let's go for a stat gain we got a

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.290
speed upgrade which I actually think is

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.790
pretty important although not

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.930
necessarily the be-all end-all we've

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.210
done well on this floor from a

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.890
consumable standpoint and the very last

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.260
thing that we'll do well we have a you

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:27.320
know the time available to us is find a

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:32.870
second secret room hopefully and that's

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:37.520
many many rooms but sadly also a

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.810
relatively good chance to die so I think

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.690
we should just we should take a very

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.390
nihilistic approach to this run a was on

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:47.420
sous another de gAHS aroun a wat so guys

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.130
what we should use one a was and then

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.310
it's a waz are on sous I think it'd take

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:56.180
a was motel you might as well just take

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:58.250
it down here yeah I mean on a was is a

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.260
better ceiling of usefulness than on

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.900
suits on juice is always just going to

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.460
show you where you're going and only

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:09.530
will it show you where you're going if

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:15.410
you have if you have no curse or no you

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:17.360
know curse of the lost but I don't know

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:20.150
man this is a weird one but what I mean

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:23.240
by taking a nihilistic approach to this

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:27.140
run is I sort of feel like every second

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.940
of this run is a gift if we die we die

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.340
and that's

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.580
a natural part of life in this

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:38.900
experience here this isn't an Isaac

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:42.380
daily this is a this is a lost daily

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:44.810
where we can't shoot I think just if we

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.580
make it to the mob fight let's just call

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.990
it this way if we win the mob fight I

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.700
think we got a great chance of ranking

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.990
well today and this is like one of my

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:56.360
favorite kinds of dailies you see I am a

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:58.220
strange man you could tell because they

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.750
didn't say it's one of my favorite kinds

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.810
of dailies I said this is one of my

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.820
favorite kinds of dailies like I'm out

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.190
of Bram Stoker's Dracula or something

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:11.450
like that

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:12.230
either way it's it's strange it's

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.900
off-kilter

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:20.480
but it's not oh it was a little dicey

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:25.070
it's not unpowered 'fl it's just a

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:26.750
little weird like BFF sac dagger okay

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:30.910
you very nearly took some extra damage

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.910
there but BFF sac dagger is so good

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:38.810
provided that you can avoid running into

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.010
enemies and getting yourself hurt okay

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.240
obviously we don't need that the more

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.640
deals with the devil the merrier

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.350
no but a speed upgrade is actually great

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.750
as well and we'll go looking for our

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.640
item room and also know we've already

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.500
been to our shop about champion belt and

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.720
why am i buying champion belt because

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:57.290
you know deep down inside of myself I do

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.880
feel that maybe rotten baby is going to

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:02.240
end up dealing all of our damage so I've

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:04.160
got to throw as much advantage towards

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.030
rotten baby as possible so that it can

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:10.400
continue to win me the game from afar

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:11.690
you might be saying by the way hey idiot

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.200
in first stuff I don't respond to

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:17.060
comments like that that's you got to

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.010
start it by saying hang out I'm a big

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:22.940
fan but you're an idiot why didn't you

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:24.980
do this so the the idiot comment and

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:29.300
this one I think comes down to the d4

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:32.210
you might say I mean we don't need tier

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:34.280
effects obviously and it does nothing

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:38.660
for us but give us some red hearts that

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:41.990
drop so I'll take it but I'm assuming

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:42.470
that we'll gain perhaps quite literally

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:46.010
nothing

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:47.060
that I think it pertains the D for you

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.920
might be saying why didn't you just

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.900
reroll your whole run with the D for it

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.090
probably would have given you the

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.920
ability to shoot you might be right but

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:57.110
I thought we've had runs before where

00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:01.310
we've tried that and it turns out that

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:04.370
no it doesn't actually give you the

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:05.990
ability to shoot like we've literally

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:09.080
done it on dailies before we're talking

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:15.440
like a year and a half ago I think I'm

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:16.970
not convinced that we'd be able to shoot

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.080
I think we might actually just reroll

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:23.030
into something where we can't do

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:25.100
anything all right I mean we're in a

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:26.840
good spot we've lived through the third

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:30.650
floor obviously our damage penalty

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:33.050
should be zero that's not a secret room

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:38.540
that's like a tailor-made secret room

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:40.460
there this should be or could be a

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:42.080
second secret room well what do you

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.730
brain what are you talking about that

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.860
could be a second secret room you use

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:49.700
your noggin for two seconds here there's

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:51.820
our regular secret room and the second

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:56.300
secret room seems like a little bit too

00:09:51.820 --> 00:10:00.080
strange to use here we'll just head down

00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:02.690
the position is too numerous it's too

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:05.930
ambiguous the floor had too many big

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:08.810
rooms for us to be confident so we do

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:12.830
want to do that room but it's very funny

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:15.290
to me that you know yesterday's run will

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:17.960
probably end up having a lower score

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:20.000
okay don't get too cocky I suppose but

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:22.220
there's a chance the yesterday's run

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.990
will end up having we don't really want

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:26.890
that if we effectively roll that I'd

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:28.880
love to because we're already the lost

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:30.620
for all the advantages we had on

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.930
yesterday's run a decent chance that

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.790
today's run outranks in terms of points

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.800
now we'll have to live through boss rush

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:40.250
to make that happen and in fact may need

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.540
on a cosmic level that's the beauty of

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:45.670
the eihwaz room here

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:49.340
I could go to boss rush take an item if

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:52.400
it's good enough to take and then choose

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:55.470
not to do boss rush I've just treated it

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:58.170
as like a guarantee of a poke

00:10:55.470 --> 00:11:00.030
go seems like amazing to us here I've

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:01.800
just treated it as like a guarantee we

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:04.380
have to do boss rush because it's worth

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.970
points but on a daily like this it might

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.590
actually be the more sensible approach

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:11.580
to not do boss rush

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:14.100
we got enough bombs let's go for it to

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:16.370
not do boss rush and use this eihwaz

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:19.910
room is kind of like a

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:19.910
get-out-of-jail-free card

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.080
don't let the spider get you now that

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.030
you've got the keys of the kingdom you

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:30.150
can't die it's like Nicolas Cage and

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:34.920
City of Angels you know once he leaves

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:37.440
heaven to be with meg Ryan you know it's

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:42.110
bull it's an important decision-making

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:42.110
process thank you very much dry baby for

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:48.330
saving my life and possibly the whole

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:53.180
run rotten baby thank you as well good

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:55.410
work it's always going to be like

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:59.130
miscellaneous shots that seem like the

00:11:55.410 --> 00:12:01.440
hardest to dodge I don't know we should

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:05.580
we've got 1.5 speed we should backtrack

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:08.760
that's not even negotiable should we

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:12.810
backtrack now why not

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:14.550
it's kind of how I feel about that go do

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:17.280
everything on this floor again we're

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:20.880
going to make boss rush as long as we

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:23.460
keep up a half-decent precedent of you

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:26.910
know running into enemies with sack

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:29.580
dagger but we are coming a little closer

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:31.650
to our own death why did I I was like we

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:33.240
already have Ouija board and I mean we

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.710
do because we're the lost but what do we

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:39.150
care about Ouija board we can't shoot

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:42.710
anyway we have ghost baby even that's

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:46.950
not I mean basically worth anything

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:49.020
because it's ghost baby okay so let's do

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:53.400
our special rooms here these are these

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:57.120
are important definitely had to kill

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:58.860
that guy without getting hit that went

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.060
very well we killed them both before

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:02.810
they could attack but that's not going

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.810
to happen every time

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:10.230
bombs are the scary part here okay

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:12.030
that's good we'll just leave we got zero

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:17.910
points for picking that up more or less

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:19.890
so wouldn't recommend it personally not

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:21.840
very concerned about a secret room I'm

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:27.860
very very concerned about just stayin

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:34.170
alive ah stayin alive stayin alive ah

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:41.160
stayin alive was weirdly like in pitch

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:44.220
but six octaves too low I mean come on

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:47.270
I'm gonna bury give just going to say no

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:50.520
Krampus please ooh

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:52.320
may I at least say I'm not picking up

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:54.600
items we don't need you says as he picks

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:59.700
up lump of coal but I don't know man

00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:01.950
it's hard to say no to that one we

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:04.320
should say like the greatest thank you

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:06.930
in Earth's history for the fact that

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.610
sack dagger exists on this run

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:12.570
I don't like enemies with high shot

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:14.670
speed you know we got to choose the

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:17.240
right moment to tackle them but I don't

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:17.240
like it

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:28.780
I do want the trinket wonder it would be

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:32.290
worth just getting out of here via one

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:35.160
of these jokers I mean they're already

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:37.870
long since dead at this point but you

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.910
know I find myself as the run gets

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:42.010
deeper and deeper I find myself getting

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:48.430
more and more anxious actually about how

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:49.510
things look on this run and now I'm like

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.370
maybe we should just let the wall

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:53.830
masters take us away maybe we should let

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:56.020
them give us the beat boys and free my

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:57.370
soul because I want to get lost in the

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:59.650
rock and roll interest away

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:02.110
I apologize by the link of the

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:03.760
commentaries been on game it's been on

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:08.290
topic and that's not something I pride

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:11.950
myself on you know this isn't a this

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:13.750
isn't a debate please stay on topic this

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:16.830
is like an anti debate this is where

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.830
reason goes to die

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:28.360
be a great time for dry baby to crack

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:31.480
some fools but it's on the the

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:35.710
commentary has been on topic because you

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:37.780
know the run is top you know I'm

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:40.900
actually very content with the beam I

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:42.550
think we've done probably the right

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.860
choices spacebar item although box of

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:48.340
spiders you know maybe has a tendency to

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:53.800
be more useful or more useful more

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:59.650
frequently rather I might as well give

00:15:53.800 --> 00:16:01.810
exhaustive dude but I would like

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:04.290
something that does damage to like

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:08.260
everything in the room if possible

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:11.040
forget-me-now I mean it is the right

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:13.750
choice from a point standpoint and

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:16.180
straight up if you if you take that

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:19.180
approach if you take forget-me-now and

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:21.220
you you know do boss rush forget-me-now

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.690
teleport out and do it again you deserve

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:25.240
whatever score you get on today's daily

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:29.530
because you're a god you're a god of

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:39.310
Isaac I was so happy when I realized

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:44.470
that was our charmed gaper oh the choke

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:49.380
caper men is the most useful of all the

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:49.380
polka go things that we can get

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:56.440
okay we're good Holley though a belly

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:59.470
button to trinkets we really don't care

00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:01.540
about Bob's bladder but certainly we'll

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:04.180
take up his tail to try to get the guppy

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:06.100
dream to come closer here and I'm out

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:08.470
I'm out to the next floor is the right

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:09.850
call say what you will about it and do

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:13.630
what you want do what you want with my

00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:16.390
body but at the same time yet you have

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:17.829
to agree it's the right choice I mean

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:19.660
it's the wrong choice from a point

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:24.610
standpoint but this isn't about points

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:28.650
you know this is about nutrition this

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:32.170
run is sick what makes you larger

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:34.090
something's wrong this run is sick you

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:37.590
know we can't shoot we got a serious

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:37.590
peer deficiency at the present moment

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:45.490
we're fine we're fine and you're saying

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:47.050
well if you wanted to save money just

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:47.679
stop buying medicine no you don't

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:49.630
understand

00:17:47.679 --> 00:17:51.190
we need the medicine without the

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:55.120
medicine this running is just going to

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:57.600
get sicker and the medicine in this case

00:17:55.120 --> 00:18:01.120
is going as fast as possible

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:05.380
or at least doing as few rooms as

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:07.510
possible because every time the longer

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:09.460
we survive the more points we're going

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:10.480
to get the more the more floors we get

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.860
to the more points you're going to get

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.390
sure the more rooms we do the more

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:15.400
points you're going to get but every

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:23.350
room carries like a 2% chance that we'll

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:24.520
die as a funny item right there we don't

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:26.230
need mom's purse although it does take

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:28.800
us closer to the mom transformation I

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:31.540
think that's worth approximately nothing

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:35.770
so I think we're basically just straight

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:38.610
out here and you know what I will say is

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:41.410
that I've spent a lot of time in Isaac

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:44.590
using orbitals when I shouldn't be using

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:47.260
orbitals and I think today's run is the

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:50.650
reckoning you know it's the run where it

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:53.110
all comes together as a result of making

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:56.260
all these mistakes now we're in a good

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:58.400
spot I know what I'm doing with these

00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:02.360
items

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:05.240
and sack dagger it's like you know

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:09.500
folded Japanese steel in my hands like

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:11.390
it's it's a specialist tool now I don't

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.890
believe I always get confused I don't

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:14.270
understand the concept of the reroll

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:16.090
machine in here it's like if you had

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:19.010
this and butter you could get some

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:23.300
incredible stuff going on but because we

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:25.070
don't have that you know I used it and

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:28.130
then what is still the same items in

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:33.710
here so we'll go fight mom she should

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:36.080
hopefully die before I was going to say

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:40.280
before she gets to do an attack but

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:42.380
you're slightly off there and then you

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:44.929
out of these I mean rune bag is lovely

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:48.230
and the occasional algae's would be nice

00:19:44.929 --> 00:19:51.140
shoopdawhoop is also great we'd rather

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:52.670
has a minder we rather I mean I guess

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:58.360
the question is does shoot it would work

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:58.360
if shooter would shoopdawhoop works I

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:04.730
think we want to take that gives us some

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:07.280
attack otherwise we probably want the

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:10.220
mind or maybe rune bag but let's start

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:12.140
by using a was and it is going to give

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:14.059
us access to the next floor thank you by

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:16.610
the way being you've been very useful

00:20:14.059 --> 00:20:18.230
for us and I am forsaking some points

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:20.960
it's possible that was cheap - Boop

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:23.179
we could have bought all those enemies

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:24.830
but I'm going to very much play a little

00:20:23.179 --> 00:20:27.350
bit of a conservative style here you

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:30.170
know northern line the dude who plays

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:33.170
Issac conservatively that's what he's

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:35.330
renowned for but they're even no matter

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:38.750
how good your run is there's a really

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:41.920
good chance you die on boss rush if you

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:46.600
can only get hit once without dying so

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:49.640
admittedly you could have done it until

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.720
we got hit once and then taking the

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:54.020
eihwaz right now but even that

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:56.990
introduces a small margin of error I was

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:59.420
somewhat uncomfortable with let's see if

00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:03.130
it's per throat it's not per throw it

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:03.130
said I think it was zero

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:10.460
and I really do feel comfortable but I

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:12.020
was horrible damages

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:15.260
I really do feel comfortable with my

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:19.059
choices on this run we do have the hush

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:22.730
fight that will appear for us as well I

00:21:19.059 --> 00:21:27.320
will not be doing the hush fight in all

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:31.030
likelihood this thing's got to go man is

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:31.030
like a whole room of combat down there

00:21:32.289 --> 00:21:39.169
thank you dry baby that was extremely

00:21:35.059 --> 00:21:41.330
clutch if we get a chaos card I would

00:21:39.169 --> 00:21:44.720
probably do the hush fight but even like

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:52.850
in that scenario I'm not convinced that

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:57.020
it's the right clay double card is very

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:58.700
good well it's very good if we use it

00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:01.900
and then we use you up the loop I got to

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:01.900
remember we can't fire tears

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:10.600
on this guy I can't really use sack

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:13.540
dagger very much like on occasion

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:16.290
perhaps but most of the time wouldn't

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.290
recommend it

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:27.760
okay one more boss it's a bad one thank

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:29.260
God for shoopdawhoop bean might have

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.150
handled it decently as well but thank

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.840
God worship the movement all right we're

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:42.390
out of here

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:46.150
good work team that was a self-sacrifice

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:49.780
thank you bad bro your sacrifice will

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:52.330
not be in vain I very much appreciated

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:53.770
so what did I say earlier I was going to

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:56.650
say we're going to rank well if we beat

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:58.930
mom I'm I mean the run is good enough

00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:01.660
that I don't necessarily feel that

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:05.890
that's actually true anymore I feel like

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:07.210
beating mom is just it's just okay on

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:08.710
today's run like we probably cracked

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:10.150
into the top thousand as a result

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:11.890
there's a lot of good Isaac players out

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:13.540
there there's a lot of clever Isaac

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.080
players out there must have learned from

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:16.390
the best

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:22.800
am i right I'm not talking about me I'm

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:28.600
talking about Cobalt anyway yes the rare

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:30.580
feigned humbleness important asset in

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:33.640
the twitch and YouTube community and I

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:34.960
just played you like a fiddle kind of

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:37.810
like I'm playing this run like a fiddle

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:39.040
although perhaps it's a little too real

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.570
because if I was playing a run like a

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:42.610
fiddle it would probably like screech

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:46.030
all over the place I played clarinet in

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:49.270
high school feel like I would probably

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:51.460
remember basically zero of how to play

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:53.560
clarinet now so a fiddle is like no

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:55.420
champs I don't have any acumen in that

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.610
instrument we saved the stars card

00:23:55.420 --> 00:24:01.180
instead of the devil card I think it's

00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:05.560
kind of an obvious choice here the

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:08.860
reason we saved the stars card he can't

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:12.540
be hurt with the sack dagger

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:12.540
we saved the stars card because

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:18.710
if teleports us if we get hit once which

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:20.450
could save the whole run so come on

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:21.970
surprising deal with the devil Duffy

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:26.930
transformation that might do nothing

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:31.520
halo at least in stats and we'll head

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:33.560
downwards I mean we just can't do the

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:35.360
hush fight no matter how much the game

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:38.000
is trying to it's like hey look you're

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:43.780
alive and doing relatively well the hush

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.780
fight is its own beast lovers card I

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:51.940
don't think that would have killed us

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:54.350
okay I'm glad we don't have to find out

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:55.970
it's like the opposite of that Savage

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:57.710
Garden song whoo I want you I don't know

00:24:55.970 --> 00:25:00.860
if I need you who I'd die to find out

00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:04.970
and that is that and this one is like oh

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:08.960
I don't want you I know I don't need you

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:12.290
and I would die if I found out that's

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:19.790
like a reference of 20 years way too

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:29.720
late oh you moron that's me I am The

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:30.950
Moron he's done it that was the the

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.430
enemy that had the biggest chance to

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.430
ruin our lives

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:40.130
Tintin rock back there I don't know why

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:41.960
I'm rushing as if it matters I mean I'm

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:43.640
not rushing just to finish the run

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:47.380
quickly I'm rushing for survival

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:47.380
purposes it's productive rushing

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:56.900
however on soos yeah use on Jews right

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:58.340
now so we know where we're going at

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.720
least and we're looking for guppy stuff

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:02.050
you've got 100% deal with the devil

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:05.480
chance by the way which is nice but I'm

00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:09.350
taking it way too fast on rooms that do

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:10.580
not need to be handled quickly we just

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:12.850
need to go back and get the starters

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.850
card

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:19.549
like there's no reason for us to rush

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:25.070
through combat we should handle combat

00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:28.899
like delicately mom's heart is the next

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:28.899
boss fight it's going to be a doozy man

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:35.529
still hoping for smaller rock it does

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.940
make shiftable better now I am like

00:26:35.529 --> 00:26:41.389
happy I took all the damage upgrades

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:42.830
because at least it does help ship it

00:26:41.389 --> 00:26:45.470
will pop off

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:49.429
I mean mob the void we took for free so

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:51.169
it's not like that's a major cost or get

00:26:49.429 --> 00:26:52.899
for us I didn't want to pick up headed

00:26:51.169 --> 00:26:55.490
to keep regice wasn't paying attention

00:26:52.899 --> 00:27:03.080
okay okay okay let's just do it

00:26:55.490 --> 00:27:05.389
beat mom's heart it's really really

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:08.210
hoping we weren't gonna have to fight

00:27:05.389 --> 00:27:10.970
one of the turrets so but we would just

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:13.940
bypass that whole awkward phase but no

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:23.960
such luck this is like it's really the

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:28.070
rotten baby show right now just paying

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:36.320
attention if you get hit there's no

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:39.110
shame consider popping the stars card we

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:41.990
chose not to because we were already

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:43.639
close to being done and then we get

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:45.799
succubus which is great in the shovel

00:27:43.639 --> 00:27:49.850
which is unnecessary but we might as

00:27:45.799 --> 00:27:53.240
well pick it up and use it once and now

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:54.620
we're up to the Cathedral what an

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:57.260
interesting situation we find ourselves

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:58.970
in am i right or am i right I didn't

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:02.059
even look at like the top scores today

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:04.429
but I imagine there's going to be good

00:28:02.059 --> 00:28:11.090
scores at the top because there's always

00:28:04.429 --> 00:28:13.250
good Isaac players but I imagine just by

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:15.679
virtue of being alive up to this point

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:18.190
we're probably going to be ranking

00:28:15.679 --> 00:28:18.190
pretty well

00:28:20.679 --> 00:28:29.120
and you never know all driving so clutch

00:28:24.159 --> 00:28:36.879
you never know what room could bring you

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:39.440
down come on

00:28:36.879 --> 00:28:42.200
gonna have to wake up pretty early in

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:44.149
the morning to get that one by me and we

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.860
did leave a lot of points on the table

00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:48.559
but we left them on the table for a good

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:51.559
reason in my opinion this was not a good

00:28:48.559 --> 00:28:58.970
run to try you know your your hand to

00:28:51.559 --> 00:29:01.789
use in boss rush and if you did the hush

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:05.539
fight again I cannot stress enough that

00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:06.080
you are an Isaac God we're going to be

00:29:05.539 --> 00:29:08.720
guffy

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:11.230
I don't know again if that does anything

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:14.149
for us but we are going to be Guffey and

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:18.230
contract from below me I guess is good

00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:19.340
it works on the I'll be on the Chester

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:24.440
on the dark room I'm going to pay

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:26.210
attention like at all sure double chests

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:28.220
do we care about getting to to speed

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:29.659
that's an interesting question I don't

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.919
even want to do a special room at this

00:29:29.659 --> 00:29:33.139
point I don't think we care about to

00:29:30.919 --> 00:29:38.269
speed let's leave ourselves some points

00:29:33.139 --> 00:29:41.090
here great work great work team we are

00:29:38.269 --> 00:29:42.799
generating the occasional fly I'm not

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:44.899
sure what's doing it chipton what I

00:29:42.799 --> 00:29:46.340
suppose is probably doing it just yet

00:29:44.899 --> 00:29:50.769
another reason why this ended up being

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:50.769
like a pretty sensible choice

00:29:55.930 --> 00:30:00.320
that's not bad

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:04.280
despite of what they tell us I'm sorry

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:11.360
code didn't know every time the charm

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:20.120
gaper is no no chance to live man is too

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:23.300
pure for this world and certainly you

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:25.700
know if we end up beating the chest on

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:27.860
this run I'm going to look at it and be

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:35.720
like I'm back baby I think we should

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:38.780
take that because this is not a saint

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:42.170
your Grandpa's run you know unless I'm

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:44.780
your grandpa because this is my run so

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:46.490
you got to get those angel fetuses taken

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:50.000
care of it's also all of our familiars

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:53.750
generate flies for us so now that the

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.360
Angel fetuses are dead it's my favorite

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:58.970
Nine Inch Nails lyric none of the angel

00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:01.810
fetuses are dead we are absolutely okay

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:09.320
and we should have a chance to win here

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:11.420
pretty pretty handily you get like a

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:14.930
half second period of invincibility

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:18.400
where it makes a ton of sense to use the

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:18.400
sack dagger

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:28.000
leprosy we get hit it creates a familiar

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:31.510
for us which I believe effectively means

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.010
it does nothing right now unless it

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:34.690
would work with holy mantle but I don't

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:39.040
believe it does so you don't forgive me

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:41.110
but I am trying to preserve that's not

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:47.350
that bad preserve some degree of

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:49.870
pointage here so I'm not going to take

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:56.740
an item that as The Lofts doesn't stand

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:59.850
any chance to give us anything now the

00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:02.890
double gate fight is is one of the worst

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:04.390
that you can get down here but it's all

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:06.760
about picking your shot if you can pick

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:12.250
your moment I'm going to be in a good

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:13.600
spot more flies please more flies all

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:16.120
there we go double items

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:20.680
Samson's chain and mini monstro I'll

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:22.360
take any familiar at this point like I'm

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:24.910
not in a position especially mini

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:26.800
monster seems awesome for me we're never

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:28.240
going to get it in line once we move on

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:34.330
a room because it's so far back in the

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:35.530
familiar order but oh dude please even

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:37.780
though smart fly is never going to

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:40.720
really do anything for us or it's never

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:46.000
really going to do much for us I'm still

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:49.680
pleased with this existence I'm stunned

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.680
that we have not been hit on this room

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:59.940
okay we got lucky because he would have

00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:05.180
been a lot more of a jerk deal with

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:08.340
people lived stay loose

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:16.140
he'll pop up not like we're on a time

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:18.420
limit anymore there we go now that we

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:27.960
know where he is he's easy to take care

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:30.210
of again any familiar um I don't believe

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:31.800
that varicose veins can do anything for

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:33.930
us otherwise I'd be all over it because

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:37.980
actually like varicose veins dull razor

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:41.070
is a cool combo we don't have dull razor

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:45.560
actors but you get the idea you okay I

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:47.850
mean the straw more than once per room

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:53.130
give this a little test drive on this

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:56.250
room down here as opposed remember we

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:59.160
still have I mean it seems fine to me

00:33:56.250 --> 00:34:01.110
I don't think 20/20 does anything but

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:07.770
Capricorn will help the straw out and

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:10.250
our flies I suppose you know what better

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:10.250
safe than sorry

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:19.380
thank God we saved our we saved it long

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:25.140
enough to be able to use it they're all

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:27.000
absolutely if sad bombs now with sad

00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:28.050
bombs maybe we should take twenty twenty

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.570
I'm going to be honest oh I think

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:32.250
shoopdawhoop is the right call here the

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:34.980
straw is also great but we don't need

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:38.190
the HP out of it so I'll take twenty

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:40.020
twenty along with sand bombs and then

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:41.610
like if we're on a room in which we

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:47.429
don't have shoopdawhoop that's probably

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:51.200
our cue to use sad bombs it may always

00:34:47.429 --> 00:34:51.200
be our cue to use sad bombs

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:59.590
because they're amazing and also will

00:34:56.379 --> 00:35:03.340
generate flies for us it's always nice

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:05.650
on a run like this when you have like an

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:07.060
ever now we've already been there oh we

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:09.160
have not already that was on the

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:10.720
Cathedral you dummy

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:13.060
we get five bombs out of this we'll take

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:17.500
it but when you have an ever increasing

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:26.230
chance to get a win like this run is

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:28.090
really only gotten stronger which is

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:30.670
pretty important for me I think we're

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:34.330
going to leave this feeling great about

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:36.369
how things went you know we took a bit

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:37.480
of the conservative approach but at

00:35:36.369 --> 00:35:39.700
least we didn't take a conservative

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:41.050
approach and fail we took a conservative

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:43.000
approach and we won we'll take a speed

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:45.790
upgrade fro and we'll take another

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:49.840
familiar like let's not that was just a

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:51.580
total whiff on shoopdawhoop there but we

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:54.099
finally have a Charmed gaper that may

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:55.599
live for longer than two seconds don't

00:35:54.099 --> 00:36:01.359
give me the delirium flow that would be

00:35:55.599 --> 00:36:04.450
an insult let's go top two waters 69th

00:36:01.359 --> 00:36:05.980
is perfect and our time is 59 how is

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:08.099
that even possible it's like one of the

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:10.660
best scores we've had in weeks

00:36:08.099 --> 00:36:12.970
damage penalty zero I mean that'll do it

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:14.980
I suppose I guess the trick to rank him

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:16.630
well if you're me is just not being able

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:18.130
to take damage or you'll die but for now

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:19.330
