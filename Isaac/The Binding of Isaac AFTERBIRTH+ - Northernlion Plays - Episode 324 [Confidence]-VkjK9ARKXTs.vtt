##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.389
everybody welcome ignorant lamb please

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.140
mining has gastric plus on the last

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.540
episode we died and I hated it because

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.710
we never cut any up crates so we're

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.570
gonna move over to eating runs for the

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.460
time being I get sick I even do right

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:20.010
animals get sick over and um's do 1800

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:23.180
g9c 8 BR with we have to look at stats

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.420
again this is this is really bad

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:30.810
terrible rate of fire much worse damage

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.940
bad luck like this has got every Fu

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.670
written basically all over it right here

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.710
from the get-go so the d4 on the other

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.710
hand is like an incredibly good items I

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.140
just want to run something by you there

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:51.390
thank you for the melancholic music

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:56.550
kicking in before I started 1 hp 14 rate

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:59.340
of fire 2.57 damage some evens out there

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.309
don't have access to the advantages that

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.350
you and I have please donate your HP to

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.240
Eden today so that she can go into a

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.920
curse room possibly accrue some

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.610
advantages that will help her later in

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.549
life for only one breakfast today you

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.920
can support an Eden give them the access

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.710
to the resources that you and I take for

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.740
granted on a daily basis please it's in

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.090
you to give alright let's begin again

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:31.770
because oh my god

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:34.110
why well it's 1.89 damage this is this

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.000
is out of control you know when I say

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.869
like you know when you lose an Isaac you

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.350
tend to lose more right after I believe

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.810
it but this is getting ridiculous man

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.299
tiny planet is obviously not great in

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.590
our present situation I'm more concerned

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.200
about the fact is that we had three

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.079
damages it twelve rate of fire and then

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:00.509
our first v8 roll gave us 25% better

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:03.030
rate of fire but a 50% damage penalty so

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.530
like we need to reroll again now we've

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.360
got the same rate of fire but much

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.119
better damage okay this may actually be

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.200
a winnable run now I know you're going

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.410
to say NL you haven't looked at your

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.060
speed stat yet and

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.340
would be correct and now I am looking at

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.290
my speed stat and I'm saying 0.64 speed

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.580
is not very good that is it is

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.240
potentially bad enough to cause us a lot

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.770
of problems so I am genuinely concerned

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.580
about that but I believe in the power of

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.030
this run now

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.090
so I mean you never excused me of not

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.140
trying to be entertaining here this

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.000
start here we could have died on that

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.940
very first room I don't think that would

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.930
have been that out of the question so

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.730
we've done a good job not to do that

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.980
this is the best way for us to get like

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.820
a maximal advantage here oh that's so

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.800
good so now we have nine damage with our

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:58.150
weird holy met not only mental tiny

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:01.180
planet abomination here still if I'm

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.890
being yeah why not I'm being 100% honest

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.010
with you I don't want to re-roll again

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.480
I'm actually like beyond content we've

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.180
got an above average rate of fire and

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.780
like triple average damage sure our

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.540
speed stat is actually horrible and it's

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.610
possible or even probable that by just

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.890
consistently reshuffling our stats with

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.959
the v8 we could eventually get to

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.560
something that's objectively better than

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.270
what we presently have but dude I don't

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.230
know if I want to play with fire you

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.040
know what happens when you play with

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.810
fire you get a multi-million dollar

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.200
special-effects contract special effects

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.989
contract with the Hollywood film

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.300
industry or you get burned it's one of

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.280
the two sometimes both I suppose oh we

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.320
got that vapor okay so now that we have

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.410
dev a fir'd I will reroll that was

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:54.760
terrible we got a worse rate of fire and

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:57.520
worse damage okay okay now our damage

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.780
has improved somewhat although it's like

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.459
a third of what it used to be in our

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.250
rate of fires like average but our speed

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.720
is slightly better we got to go deeper

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.970
that's what I'm talking about we've done

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.370
it okay now never touch the v8 again

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.959
it's a great item because of what it

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.720
just did

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.850
we've got more damage a slightly better

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.799
rate of fire and actually functional

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.500
speed as a result of the aggressive v8

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.140
rolls we've done it and I mean that

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.340
sincerely we've conquered every

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.230
disadvantage that we

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.980
could have conceivably had we have an

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.780
amazing start to to a tiny planet run

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.699
I'm not going to say that you know we

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.220
can only go up from here but you know

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:38.440
we've got a homing tiers tiny planet and

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.050
great future prospects this could

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.990
actually be not just a good run but a

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.540
really fun run as well and we do get an

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.949
extra spirit heart so it's a little bit

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.949
more plausible and might actually be

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.660
able to justify picking up some deal

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:57.570
with the devil love here I want to see

00:04:52.660 --> 00:05:00.370
like piercing shots don't take that yet

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:04.360
we did not get piercing shots instead we

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.690
got a Krampus fight and I can make that

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.070
work

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.290
tiny planet with love of coal is

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:12.490
extremely good and that's exactly what

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:14.470
we got here so I mean we're way ahead of

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.760
schedule that much should be abundantly

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.710
clear we're at three minutes here so

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.600
that's what happens when you get the d8

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.280
and crickets body early on it basically

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.580
has created a situation in which were

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.190
you know in a fantastic spot Clancy

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.620
delete this item from existence nephew

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.169
it doesn't belong in Isaac it has no

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:36.729
purpose it's literally a troll item that

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:37.960
is it had one look I've really gets this

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:39.729
item too much I shouldn't even talk

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.010
about it but it's self-indulgent and I'm

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:48.910
indulging baby it's the chocolate cake

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:51.400
for the young man sold come get dusted

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.419
much appreciated with the dust say okay

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.940
there goes our deal with the devil

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:58.020
chance because I'm a moron just break

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.400
the flies open the flies are enemy now

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.720
the Flies are the hardest enemy we've

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.270
ever faced because we can't break the

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.750
freaking golden poops maneuver properly

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:10.720
I just don't understand Plan C it's a

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.789
it's an item that I fundamentally just

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.310
do not understand the design process

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:18.310
behind unless like the only thing I can

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.169
think of is like Lola epic troll in

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.910
Emily okay well you got you got some

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:25.570
people once and then now it's time to

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:27.070
delete it from the game nephew we've

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:30.400
done it

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:33.160
oh but if Jupiter and Saturn aligned in

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.350
the 4th shadow of the Cassiopeia cluster

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.580
then you can use Plan C with Lazarus

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.780
ready to kill Abbas that you were

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.640
probably strong enough to kill anyway

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.130
but only by pressing your seat look I

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:45.370
know I I love this game too and I want

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:49.420
to defend every aspect of it but Plan C

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:51.760
is irredeemable especially because it

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:55.240
shows up so freakin like I would almost

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.080
rather that it just opened and said

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.720
gotcha

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.460
from a red chest instead of giving me

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:04.780
Plan C because they functionally have

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:06.760
like exactly the same value to me at

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.710
this present moment in my life ok

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:13.270
euthanasia is a great pick up stop

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:15.610
walking into enemies I get it

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.740
you're like I want to use my orbital to

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:20.440
deal a bunch of damage but you know you

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.060
have 10 damage here ok so now I'm

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:26.680
realizing there's an issue with this run

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:32.050
and it's our rate of fire not rate of

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:36.400
fire high range of fire I actually

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:38.440
cannot reach the enemies okay so I've

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:42.490
had our damage so we can get through

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:46.660
this room apparently you can just wait

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:50.950
it out and eventually the doors will

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:52.990
open but what's particularly heinous

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.370
about this situation oh I think we might

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.900
be able to do it here what's

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:58.960
particularly heinous about this

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:01.320
situation is how I'm constantly going to

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:04.900
have to dodge the shots as they come in

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:07.210
where the bad folks go and they die they

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:11.280
don't go to heaven where the Angels fly

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:15.250
the go to this room on the catacombs one

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:19.510
see you again forth jeweler weave dummy

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:22.120
we could die now actually because of the

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:24.280
thank God for the HP but because of the

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.600
statistical decrease in where our HP

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:29.010
actually stands right now we're not in a

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.010
great spot to be honest with you

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.839
still like you know despite being really

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:36.190
happy with this run every once in a

00:08:34.839 --> 00:08:38.200
while something happens it just makes

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:40.330
you go hmm great really makes you think

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.330
you know still ten rate of fire five

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:46.060
damage with lump of coal it's not bad

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:50.650
but it's I hope it's a setup for our

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:53.110
next role because this role is not

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:56.110
getting the job done I don't even know

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:58.480
if a range upgrade does anything with

00:08:56.110 --> 00:09:02.830
tiny planet except make the tiers

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:04.690
survive longer so it's possible the

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:06.940
range upgrade in general was completely

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:08.170
unnecessary like that I shouldn't have

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:12.430
used the d8 is what I'm trying to

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:13.630
suggest but you know desperate times

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:16.029
seem to have called for desperate

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:17.740
measures shot speed up with an emperor

00:09:16.029 --> 00:09:21.459
card which we can't really take and then

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:23.500
a reroll we're savage much better speed

00:09:21.459 --> 00:09:31.750
it's probably an okay trade-off in the

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:34.089
present moment our speed was relatively

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:36.220
bad you know damage is a stat we always

00:09:34.089 --> 00:09:37.870
want to go up speed is more of a stat

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:42.339
that like we want to get over a certain

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:44.680
threshold but ah geez we these are the

00:09:42.339 --> 00:09:46.510
worst enemies man they completely

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:49.029
compromise your ability to dodge with

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:51.700
tiny planet there goes our deal with the

00:09:49.029 --> 00:09:55.480
devil chance yet again but we can make

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:56.709
it happen here I don't understand this

00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.300
guy but we're going to play him anyway

00:09:56.709 --> 00:10:00.300
because this is the moment of redemption

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:09.480
sometimes we give him one bomb and he

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.800
gives us one bomb back sometimes we give

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.230
him one bomb and he gives us two bombs

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.030
back sometimes we give him one bomb and

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:17.940
he gives us sad bombs maybe that's how

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:21.330
we understand him so our luck stat is

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:24.480
above zero I'm sorry dude

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:29.400
I just don't respect you is like the big

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:31.110
problem here there full heart it's a

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.730
half heart okay so we I mean we don't

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.920
have to do this this way but I'm going

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:37.860
to do it this way anyway because I'm a

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.210
silly boy oh that was not what I meant

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.260
to do I meant to go down to one red

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:45.840
heart but you know what that's our

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:48.930
second euthanasia or sorry ii spun pick

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:51.120
up right there and nisha sweet that's

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:52.170
what I was going for all right spirit

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.880
odds you know we're going to get spirit

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:56.120
hearts here is your first spirit alright

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:59.190
there's kind of a weird looking one but

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:02.630
why am I talking like this because I've

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:05.640
ruined my whole run on purpose

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:07.020
look at this smug son of a bitch this

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:10.760
one is completely my fault

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:12.960
like there were infinite bad plays there

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:15.570
let's make the dream happen this is

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.640
where we stop the slump seven eight ftca

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.710
to eight lemon party

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:23.750
let me guess nothing we come in here in

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:26.600
a big box just pops Elvis as you died I

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:29.070
think it's like you know where is weird

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:31.800
we've gotten rid of the pressure that

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:36.030
previously was on it's not like there

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:37.770
was much but there was some and my brain

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.870
subconsciously is like I don't want to

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:41.730
win I don't want to go back to that yet

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:44.010
I want to have some fun but like that

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:45.330
tiny planet run was fun I just resented

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.950
the fact that I was unable to hit some

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.860
enemies and I rear old out of my god

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:51.690
tear tiny planet starts to take some you

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:54.930
know trash to your nonsense instead

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:59.690
because I had to but the game is

00:11:54.930 --> 00:12:01.860
somewhat innocent whoo

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:05.910
this is it we got to make it happen on

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:07.680
this one I think this is you know get

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:10.440
get all the bad luck out at once again

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.360
not saying there wasn't personally

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.400
directed terrible play there as well but

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.900
you can't get three losses with one

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.290
character in one video we've done it

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:20.220
before

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:23.820
it's soul-crushing especially coming

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:27.900
after a loss that admittedly that Judas

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:28.860
loss that we just had was actually 100%

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:32.550
the game's fault

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:34.470
I didn't play the best I've ever played

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:36.360
in my life but I played well within the

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:38.730
bounds of normalcy

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.920
we just got nothing that gave us any leg

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:42.660
up on the competition that we took the

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.980
wrong deal with the devil with curse of

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:48.210
the blind I suppose and it was all

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:52.020
downhill from there but it's up to us to

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:54.720
build back from that said that narrative

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:57.210
of negativity and instead build a

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.910
narrative of Nativity I don't know what

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:02.150
that means outside of you know the

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:05.190
nativity scene but I'm assuming it's a

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:09.330
positive thing most of the time I don't

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:11.130
know hey GB bug I'm gonna need you to do

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.570
like all the damage here because I

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.220
haven't really complained about this

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:15.720
start but it's definitely like something

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:18.540
I want to complain about

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:20.880
we have about average damage technically

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.860
a little bit less but I'm not gonna you

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:25.140
know put on airs too much about that the

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:26.850
real problem is 14 rate of fire it

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:29.130
should actually be like illegal for this

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:30.720
game to spawn you was under well over I

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:32.490
guess but it should be legal for this

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:38.910
game to spawn you with over 12 rate of

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:40.860
fire 10 knees acceptable that's the

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:42.630
average and then it seems like every

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:45.960
other run you're starting with like 12

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:48.650
13 14 12 I could even if you didn't show

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:50.850
me the stat screen and you gave me 12

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:52.830
well at least we got one of them you

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:54.780
gave me 12 rate of fire I would probably

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:56.130
be like yeah this is about average the

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.110
stat screen is doing the in that

00:13:56.130 --> 00:14:04.440
situation cuz I I know what I'm getting

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:05.910
into but 14 you know you don't don't pee

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.150
on my back and tell me you're putting

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:10.130
lotion on it

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:11.480
I can't see I don't have eyes back there

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:12.710
you're taking advantage of a trusting

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:16.010
individuals that make you feel good

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:24.590
about yourself well it shouldn't you you

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:28.100
weirdo well unlike the end of that death

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:31.160
that we just had kind of like that as

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:33.560
well but we have a pretty good chance of

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:36.590
getting a deal with the devil I think we

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:40.760
had one spirit heart I hope we had one

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:43.520
spirit heart it's a second secret room

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:44.810
probably hopefully just like pumped full

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:49.070
of red hearts would be the ideal

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:50.930
situation I'm gonna tell you what I'm

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:52.790
gonna blow you up see what I get

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:54.320
Oh pinkie eye is actually when we have

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:57.650
very poor damage pinkie eye is

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:59.570
completely acceptable to me we did catch

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:04.910
him for like a quarter of a second there

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:06.260
so I'm alright with the with the usage

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:08.090
although I wish he'd stuck around a

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:11.660
little bit longer just blow yourself up

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:15.980
usually his bombs now explode so they

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:17.390
can't hit him I think oh no I'm just

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.950
talking out of my butt I thought this

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:21.080
champion version was like insulated

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:23.090
against self-immolation no breathing

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.750
doesn't give an effort because as I'm

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:28.100
bleeding

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:30.230
oh mylanta you got a mob the voids you

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:38.360
just a shadow throw down a temperance

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:40.640
card you know we're not gonna live by

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:42.430
doing this but we can at least kill kill

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:45.770
ourselves in such a way that we get some

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:48.230
resources back and get a much much much

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:50.060
deserve it in my opinion stat increase

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:53.930
as we head down the next floor so we're

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:56.210
kind of rushing now against all odds

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:57.500
we've created a run in which our stats

00:15:56.210 --> 00:16:01.670
are actually quite good we have 10

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:04.340
damage and 10 rate of fire this early on

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:07.640
it's a lucky time in a young boy's life

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:09.290
now the real kicker is trying to make

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:13.420
sure that we get mobbed the void to pop

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:15.800
and the faster that this can give us

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:17.000
basically like one and a half demon

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.500
hearts the

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.720
happier I'm going to be but we are

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.440
actually in a dominant position now just

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.230
going to show you like how

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:26.720
transformative haha Judas the shadow can

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:29.480
be by itself to be honest with you and

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:31.790
we're making good use of we don't need

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:34.460
that we're making good use of crack the

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:35.870
sky as well an item that I unfairly kind

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:39.860
of treated like garbage but it is

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:41.720
actually fairly useful Wow so we G board

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.130
is just okay which is why we're not

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:46.100
going to take it but blood of the martyr

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:48.680
I think has n plus 2.5 to in this

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:50.210
situation is very useful and honestly I

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:53.600
would be stunned if this isn't us

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:59.390
getting back on the horse because we

00:16:53.600 --> 00:17:00.980
have the best of my instinct here put

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:02.950
together a run that's actually quite

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:09.380
nice right now in fact it was from like

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:11.240
being really bad to being like well

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:13.400
above average and I don't mean that as

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:15.380
like a it sounds like a slight to say

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.850
someone's above average I'm not feeling

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:19.550
that above average right now you know I

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:22.339
studied like crazy for this this midterm

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:26.030
that I just wrote got my midterm mark

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:29.870
Becca a 72 class average 81 last

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:32.120
semester I was I wouldn't say destroying

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:33.880
the curve but I was above the curve this

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:36.890
semester I'm bringing the curve down

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:38.930
doing people a favor harder class but

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:40.520
and you know luckily people tell these

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:42.020
stories they're like you know you got to

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:44.540
remember when you go to college you go

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:46.310
to university you're not a you're not

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.750
going to get A's all the time I already

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:49.190
had that humbling experience in

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:50.630
undergrad so mostly I just kind of

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:55.370
looked at that and went I should try

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:57.770
like 9% harder to catch up there but so

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:59.780
on just a sobering moment man this run

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:02.060
now does not feel like that this runs

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:04.300
like hey the class average was an 80 and

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:06.830
you got a 110 because we're had

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:10.580
basically above average in every single

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:12.050
stat we're holding the Stars card for I

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:14.270
mean to be honest with you not much

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:16.730
reason right now because if we wanted to

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:18.650
do boss rush we could just do boss rush

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:21.310
or we could get another teleport card in

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:21.310
advance so

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:25.790
and then of course there's the other

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.870
aspect we have a lot of keys and then

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:28.130
there's the other aspect

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:31.330
apparently our items not going to do

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:34.340
that much for us anyway but let's uh

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:36.410
let's renew our focus here on this run

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:39.500
you know because you could have a great

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:41.360
setup and then squander it or you could

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:43.820
have a bad setup and ride it to

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:47.050
greatness it does appear right now that

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:51.830
this one it's going to be tough to lose

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:55.280
the real like the most stable marriage

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:58.250
of items in Isaac is items or builds

00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:02.210
rather that give you the ability to

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:03.740
generate your own hearts especially if

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:05.450
they come with corresponding damage

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:08.330
upgrades like ours did like we're in

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:09.770
such a good spot as a result of this and

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:11.450
and this is honestly only going to make

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:14.300
it better so sack of sacks of course is

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:18.350
lovely we will put down temperance and

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:21.380
then go to town thanks to restock we

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:23.240
should maybe just be able to like do

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:25.040
this forever and we sort of have the

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.570
time to do it forever as well we didn't

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:30.590
need to do that it kind of squandered it

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:32.750
but anyway bye Pandora's box see what

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:37.240
you get it's a range upgrade which is

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:39.530
trash but it's fine life goes on you

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:41.150
don't have Steam sale ok so then we

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:43.670
can't do it forever but we did it for a

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:48.620
decently long time there I wouldn't mind

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:50.770
getting getting a nine-volt actually

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:52.880
works well you know for room charges

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:55.340
allows us to use them quite a bit more

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:59.510
frequently to room charges are the ideal

00:19:55.340 --> 00:20:01.790
but you can't always get what you wanna

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:03.680
but if you grind sometimes with the

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:07.390
temperance card you just might find

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:12.020
temporarily you can get what you need

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:14.810
with some contingencies ok

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:17.180
you are already done you just don't know

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:20.300
it yet 72% deal with the devil chance

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:22.310
with a rate of fire increase oh and sac

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:25.370
dagger it's like this running we can

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:28.220
just sit back throw hand surfing out the

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:30.740
window one hand out the window one hand

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:33.510
around the shoulder of a beautiful babe

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:35.910
one hand on a cold one two fingers in

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:37.080
on the steering wheel one hand on the

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:40.010
radio dial

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:43.640
just cruising listening to some tunes

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:51.090
also yes I am Goro from Mortal Kombat

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:54.419
just relaxing in the summertime we're

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:57.059
actually almost twice as fast as I

00:20:54.419 --> 00:21:00.360
normally expect to be on a decent run

00:20:57.059 --> 00:21:02.490
and that's really you know twelve damage

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:05.580
and our tears not even being like just

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:07.590
tears like it's got a big ol basically a

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:09.900
beam that allows us to destroy groups of

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:11.820
enemies extremely quickly plus our HP is

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:14.850
good I would like some permanent deal

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:17.549
with the devil access if possible don't

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:19.710
know if that's going to be that's going

00:21:17.549 --> 00:21:23.790
to be doable sach daggers also like it's

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:27.179
the greatest like bayonet basically it's

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:30.809
a backup weapon for us that it does its

00:21:27.179 --> 00:21:34.020
job you can't get to that I'm a little

00:21:30.809 --> 00:21:34.710
surprised not mad though just just

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.809
surprised

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:38.940
now sad bombs was the run that we

00:21:36.809 --> 00:21:41.790
squandered and we'll be yelled at for

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:43.919
appropriately in the comments so I am

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:45.450
missing sad bombs there's a song that

00:21:43.919 --> 00:21:47.190
goes I ain't been missing you at all

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:52.470
from the 1980s I can't remember who was

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:53.669
fine but neither can he so it goes I

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:58.020
even missing you at all

00:21:53.669 --> 00:22:00.750
missing you same to then gone away and

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:05.520
then gist of the song is he's a liar

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:08.130
he's missing her like crazy but I mean

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:10.040
I'm going to rework the lyrics to about

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:12.660
sad bombs because I am missing it at all

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:14.250
but then you know the gist of the

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:17.840
original song also touches on that it's

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:17.840
like an ironic sort of situation

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:23.740
we uh that was a terrible sound that

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:25.179
came out of my throat well stick with

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.900
the stars card we don't really need ace

00:22:25.179 --> 00:22:28.510
of spades

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:30.360
out of all of them I'm sorry I got

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:33.460
really loud there out of all the

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:35.500
upgrades or new new things that came out

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:39.010
of after birth plus I really do think

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:44.140
that I mean Plan C of course I got no no

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:47.620
love loss for but I really just do not

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:49.480
care about the existence of ASA spades

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:52.330
ace of clubs Ace of Hearts and Ace of

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:54.250
Diamonds I get it there there are

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:56.890
actually some situations in which it's

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:58.270
like sort of useful there's probably a

00:22:56.890 --> 00:23:00.190
few situations at which is very useful

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:02.580
that I've just never encountered but for

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:05.500
the most part you're like okay I got

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:09.460
three pennies I'm going to turn them

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:14.200
into three keys what an amazing get this

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:16.150
is great though the I mean not every

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.980
trinket I guess has to be amazing but it

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:20.290
also I really thought I was going to

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:23.080
have an instability still the other

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:25.470
thing is that for whatever reason to me

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:27.780
it seems like the ace of blanks show up

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:30.610
probably twice as often as they should

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:33.760
obviously it didn't in that example and

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:35.020
is it just to prove me wrong perhaps we

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.970
all know that how the troll engine works

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:42.040
so have stars stars get-out-of-jail-free

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:46.450
I I don't really care about get out of

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:47.890
jail free but I think I'm gonna okay I

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:49.000
do care about get out of jail free I'm

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:51.520
going to explain why in the least

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.429
complex convoluted way possible we can

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:56.350
use a teleport card to get out of boss

00:23:54.429 --> 00:23:58.300
rush and then pick up get out of jail

00:23:56.350 --> 00:24:00.250
free assuming we bring it down to this

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:01.720
next floor and then use that to fight

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:04.570
mega saving and that's at least

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:06.970
something to like live for on this run

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:08.470
that isn't just like you know we're

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:12.640
going to win so because we can throw in

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:15.210
an extra element of like of uniqueness

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:19.410
I'll always buy polka go honestly it

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:22.540
almost always seems to be useful at

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:24.130
least temporarily but I think that's

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:26.500
that's one of the better shop additions

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:29.160
I might it might just be biased because

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.160
like when you get

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:35.180
when you get nan a subs you tend to use

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:36.470
them right away and thus they don't

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.660
stick in the consciousness that long

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:40.400
it's because they're like actually so

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:43.220
good thought maybe that might open the

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:45.620
deal with the devil when you get a subs

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:47.900
you hold them forever and you sometimes

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:50.620
in fact I would say often times don't

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:52.790
get any use out of them at least I don't

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:54.380
so it's not so much that I think that

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:56.630
they're effective useless I think their

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:59.210
effect is almost useless but they're

00:24:56.630 --> 00:25:00.350
really insidious part is that they get

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:04.340
your hopes up so you think you got

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:05.990
something good and then it's like ah you

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:13.580
got 18 keys we'll check it out now you

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:15.860
got 21 keys piece of clubs I mean you

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:19.220
can't really take that as an example of

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:22.490
how often it shows up a lesser person

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:24.920
would but I above all outs I respect the

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:27.470
integrity of probability and stats and

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:34.730
I'm doing my Tom Waits impression again

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:37.790
I knew a statistician he always drank

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:40.220
coffee when he did his t-test that's a

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:43.210
surprisingly good joke that is not that

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:47.030
funny but is at least a little clever

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:51.080
telepathy is actually really fun and and

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:52.850
quite good as well probably we should

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:56.120
not just squander it by immediately

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:59.510
walking into enemies but this is a fun

00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:01.280
and fast-paced run it's fun for the

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:03.440
whole family except this game man

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:06.160
presuming is like a Peggy 18 rating but

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.160
you the idea

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:11.570
no this is probably T 14 it's definitely

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:14.600
not e although sometimes I'll be honest

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:21.440
with you I'm like guilty of I mean we

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:22.910
can't really we have a wisest no what

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.350
are you gonna do I mean I think we take

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:28.059
get a jail free I'd rather take get out

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:28.059
of jail free and maybe fight mega save

00:26:29.559 --> 00:26:33.350
sometimes I forget - the game has like

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:35.450
biblical overtones

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:38.929
like literally direct references and

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:42.950
also like some gross stuff I can't want

00:26:38.929 --> 00:26:45.200
the Flies honestly and I'm like good

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:50.960
should be ready to eat people look at

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:58.820
the game and they go rated e are you on

00:26:50.960 --> 00:27:01.000
e see good good joke never ever touch me

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:04.429
again unless you're prepared prepared

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:09.799
unless you're prepared to feel the cold

00:27:04.429 --> 00:27:11.659
hand of justice so I think we don't need

00:27:09.799 --> 00:27:15.309
to generate this many flies to make the

00:27:11.659 --> 00:27:15.309
to make the run pop but

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:24.520
I'm an idiot you know you've got a great

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:26.230
run though when you're actually mad that

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:30.250
you have the chariot because it does

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:33.130
less damage than your actual your actual

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:40.750
tears which is why I use it again

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:42.570
immediately of course to clubs dude

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:46.300
we're getting there

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:50.830
eventually 99 bombs exclusively through

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:53.530
the use of torque loves its acts like

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:55.090
out of control every sack gives us a

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:56.590
chariot card I don't know if that's like

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:58.420
a new deal that they're doing here like

00:27:56.590 --> 00:28:02.380
Franklin Delano Roosevelt style or

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:05.740
something but getting like a chariot

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:06.940
card per wave could be worse although

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:12.910
when we use the charity we're not

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:15.520
generating any we're not generating any

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:17.350
demon hearts which is kind of I wouldn't

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:20.140
suggest it's essential at the present

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:24.490
moment but it's part of the it's part of

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:26.260
the game plan for certain I still don't

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:30.010
understand but you can get two charges

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:31.930
per room on on each boss rush wave few

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:33.730
charges per wave I should say which is

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:35.020
why I'm trying to take advantage of it

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:38.440
here looks like there's two separate

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:40.690
play payout areas now I don't know if

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:44.460
that's a bug or what but like you know

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:46.080
sometimes we see that we don't have a

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:49.810
partner

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:54.360
sometimes at the elack's my only friend

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:58.600
is a deal with the devil that given me

00:28:54.360 --> 00:29:01.240
brimstone anyway sometimes we see that

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:04.660
the sack boy or the the sack of sacks

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:07.600
here only pays out on the second tick of

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:10.170
payouts here I feel like I'm taking

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.170
crazy pills

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:17.830
okay okay okay okay okay it's like I

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:20.660
know you've given me many chances to not

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:25.610
take damage we're finally going to take

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:28.820
advantage of those chances now hey man

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:31.010
it's just non-stop hang the man now like

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:34.330
we took we did like the exact opposite

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:38.090
of what my intended plan was we took

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:39.620
get-out-of-jail-free down here see

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:41.960
that's the second payout I was talking

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:43.580
about algae's Cleaves officers so we

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:45.110
actually can't teleport out and then

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:47.900
come back in here and get it except we

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:49.820
totally can because we're before 20

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:52.430
minutes which rarely happens all right

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:54.050
we roll dude I'm soaked so we like

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:58.870
rarely use our own tears but Jacobs

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:58.870
ladders lovely and and we out basically

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:03.110
should have gone to the boss Trap room

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:04.490
but we traded one HP away that's why we

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:06.740
couldn't go to the boss Trap room before

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:10.060
so that's fine that's fine

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:12.620
we do have a bead on the gup-e dream

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:13.690
okay yeah you know absolutely I'll take

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:18.260
piercing

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:20.690
I'll take piercing shots here I really

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:25.160
need to stop recklessly taking so much

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:26.900
damage oh no I actually used on soos

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:28.970
like I was the smartest man in human

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:32.660
existence that I was like check it out I

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:39.470
got on soos nothing can stop me I can

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:42.800
see the whole map for once now that this

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:44.600
this run really has a great chance to

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:47.000
break our slump that doesn't even exist

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:49.940
yet it's like a pre-broken it's a pre

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.390
slump slump break which is the ideal you

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:55.010
know I've gone through a slump recently

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:56.600
it ain't as fun as you might suggest

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:58.820
that it would be I don't know why you'd

00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:00.350
suggest it's fun but it's it's not as

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:02.420
fun as you might suggest it would be I

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:03.800
promise you that we're playing pretty

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:07.820
badly but if we get the result I think

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:09.980
that's going to be enough give me

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:11.840
get-out-of-jail-free you know we're down

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:15.140
here for a reason we're going to fight

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:17.720
mega satan then we're going to go to Y

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:19.160
star wid what did you say hey it's been

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:21.320
a while since I looked up my most recent

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:24.210
Howard Dean memes we're going to go to

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:27.180
Washington ever better go to DC

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:30.260
take back the White House whoa shouldn't

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:35.310
joke about American politics you know

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:40.680
what is it been it's been almost 10

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:42.810
months since the American election now

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:44.850
it's like 7 yes in seven months since

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:46.920
the American election which means we

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:50.340
should be starting to talk about the

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:53.790
next American election maybe like 6

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:55.620
weeks from now so you know don't don't

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:58.260
joke about it you're going to be hearing

00:31:55.620 --> 00:32:01.380
enough about it I'm sure already I've

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:05.180
got a four-year election cycle in a six

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:05.180
year news cycle about the election

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:10.080
there's something like just put Jerry

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:11.430
Seinfeld News behind that one might not

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:14.430
be funnier but it might have a little

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:17.490
bit more punch when you're through but

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:19.920
in film film thumbs did you hear the one

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:28.710
about the sandwich that I but I'm the

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:31.620
last step thing I mean I know it's a no

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:36.110
it's an old it's a hacky joke basically

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:36.110
what's the deal with airplane food but I

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:41.790
think I should be like uh there should

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:45.240
be comedy joke James you know how

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:47.130
there's already you know game jams

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:49.200
there should be comedy joke jams where

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:50.580
you make jokes around a theme and I

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.770
think that it could be a really good

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:55.950
test of a comedians ability to make a

00:32:52.770 --> 00:33:01.320
joke about airplane food and have it

00:32:55.950 --> 00:33:02.850
actually be funny if you can manage to

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.350
get that like you you're in a

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:05.640
scholarship to Second City or something

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:08.220
like that I don't know second city is

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.030
like a real if it's a school but as far

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:11.400
as I'm concerned they should start

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:13.200
offering scholarships if someone can

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:15.120
construct a funny joke about airplane

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.620
food in the year 2017 because the whole

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.870
audience is going to be working against

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:21.270
you they're going to be like all an

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:22.230
airplane joke make me laugh man tell me

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:25.230
something about the differences between

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:29.880
men and women while you're at it my wife

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:32.640
likes to shop so much I said honey you

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:34.730
know you didn't marry a bank good

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:38.070
officer

00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:39.990
don't get out downtown down steps to

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:45.720
them anyway

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:47.520
I really liked the conversations that

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:50.910
came out of that video last week where

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:52.710
Jerry Seinfeld denied a hug to Ke$ha we

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:54.780
didn't get into it properly on the NL s

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:59.340
s because everybody except for Dan on

00:33:54.780 --> 00:34:01.410
the NL s s agreed with the premise that

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:02.640
Jerry Seinfeld should be allowed to deny

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:04.860
Ke$ha a hug

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:10.740
I don't really want to mine look go

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:13.590
ahead so we'll press release let's go

00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:18.149
let's go for both it's a decent damage

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:19.860
upgrade um I I was surprised actually

00:34:18.149 --> 00:34:21.710
because my ears my philosophy doesn't

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:24.570
see the video go C is hilarious and

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:26.880
insightful in in some ways in the human

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:30.300
psychology I guess on a very pop level

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:31.950
but Jerry Seinfeld's giving an interview

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:33.659
and he's like I'll be able to the oven

00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:35.940
are that one recently and then Ke$ha

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:37.169
multi-platinum recording artist Kesha

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:39.750
comes up and goes oh my god I love you

00:34:37.169 --> 00:34:41.429
can I have a hug very totally normal

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:43.830
interaction not using that voice because

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:46.080
I'm against Kesha in this situation is

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:49.770
this a normal way that some a fan would

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:52.860
meet a person you know be excited about

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:54.510
it and Jerry Seinfeld goes no thank you

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:56.280
and he puts his hand up and then she

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:58.350
goes please and he goes no thank you

00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:00.000
and then she goes just a little when it

00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:01.740
he goes no thank you and he like stepped

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.750
back and kind of put his hand up like

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:05.070
that's the last time I'm gonna say no

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:08.820
thank you wrong I have to call somebody

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:11.610
right and then she's like was sad and

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:13.380
walked away but I kind of as much as I

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:15.090
think that I mean he's a little bit of a

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:16.500
weirdo for not accepting the hug and I

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:19.350
know that he didn't know was somebody

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:21.180
that was that was famous but you know

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:23.520
even still even if you knew that she was

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:25.590
Kesha I think you know dawn I was real

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:27.900
dumb I think Jerry Seinfeld's got the

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:29.010
where's my where's my I get a jail free

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:32.250
card that's an important part of the

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:35.250
process here I think Jerry Seinfeld was

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:40.440
well within his rights to to do that you

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:42.390
know she asked can I give you a hug

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:43.890
Jerry Seinfeld is you say can I have a

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:46.350
hug but like that's not that relevant

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:47.310
did I actually forget it I'm well no no

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:53.940
no it might not

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:56.670
forgotten it um I think I forgot way to

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:59.100
go buddy way to go but yeah um she she

00:35:56.670 --> 00:36:00.750
said hey you know can I have a hug

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:05.310
and he said no she asked him a question

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:09.840
and and he replied to it with an answer

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:12.000
he said no and then she asked again and

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:13.560
he said no I'm good and then she asked

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.470
for a third time and he was basically

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:17.610
like have you not heard me I'm not going

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:18.930
to give you a hug you know you never

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:20.040
know you might be a germaphobe or

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:21.900
something like that it provokes like

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:25.260
incredible anxiety he might just not be

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:27.270
a hugger so I was surprised like you

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:29.790
both Nick and I were like you know she

00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:31.980
asked and he said no I think Jerry's the

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:34.200
kind of weirdo admittedly but he's in

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:35.550
the right in this situation and Dan was

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.230
like you know doesn't that reveal the

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:40.260
kind of person that Jerry Seinfeld is

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:44.700
like you won't give a hug to a fan yeah

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:47.390
but I mean I would do it I in someone

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:50.850
came out to me I was like I'm a big fan

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:53.970
can I have a hug I'd be like yeah no

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:56.910
problem I'm not much of a hugger but you

00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:59.280
know I'm okay with it and then the

00:36:56.910 --> 00:37:01.050
difference is like well there's two

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:02.400
differences first off Jerry Jerry

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:05.250
Seinfeld's net worth is something like

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:06.570
860 million dollars so like he can

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:09.650
afford to make enemies but then the

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:12.540
other one is like he might actually just

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:14.790
hate hugs and even if he doesn't and he

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:16.080
just doesn't like Ke$ha you know he's

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:18.480
within his rights she made the situation

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:20.190
weird to begin with that's my

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:22.020
perspective I might be I might be

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:23.460
overstating it to suggest that Nick and

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:25.680
I were in the minority we were just in

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:27.510
the minority on the show sorry we were

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:29.190
we were in the majority on the show and

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:30.960
I have seen people that are like you

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:32.640
should have just given her the hug I do

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:36.000
agree that he comes across like a jerk

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:37.680
by denying the hug but you know without

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.380
getting to inside baseball here whenever

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:42.450
usually unless I forget from time to

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:44.700
time but when I meet people at

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:46.440
conventions and they say hey you know

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:48.540
can we take a picture

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:50.400
I always if they're standing next to me

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:51.840
I go is it okay if I put my arm on your

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.190
shoulder is it okay before my arm around

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:55.290
me because you never know people might

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:57.150
like hate being touched or something

00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:59.100
like that you make sure you draw that

00:37:57.150 --> 00:38:00.600
boundary before you interact with them

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.850
and the Kesha's point

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:05.040
she did ask before she just lunged it

00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:07.050
Jerry and wrapped him in a bear hug but

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:08.970
at the same time you got to accept no

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:10.500
for an answer so we ended this episode

00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:13.140
with the wind I'm happy with that a

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:14.220
