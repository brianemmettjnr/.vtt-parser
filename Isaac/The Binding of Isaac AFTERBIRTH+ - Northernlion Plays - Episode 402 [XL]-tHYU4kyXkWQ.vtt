##

00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.950
everybody welcome back on the line

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.170
please planting vines Gasper plus let's

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.880
do I mean we did it like a refresh run

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.800
and I felt nice about it let's do a

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.090
challenge this time keep pouring our way

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.400
through these it's going to take some

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.520
time but we're we're getting there

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.359
xxx xxx xxxx L I don't remember this

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:28.349
challenge b1 9 X 9 C 60 let's remind

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:31.410
ourselves Issac xxxxxx seconds put like

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.360
many X's all floors are the size of

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.120
Excel floors but does not combine the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.500
floors due to the floors being much

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.090
bigger it makes important rooms like

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.170
treasure rooms and shops significantly

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.879
longer to find oh ok well it's not that

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.879
bad it goes all the way to mom's heart

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.579
it seems like completely acceptable as

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.050
far as like winning a run goes let me

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.489
just turn on cheat engine here show it

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.859
so I am sure that we only get good items

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:01.520
and ok there you go that was a joke I've

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.379
told this story many times but you know

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.330
it is bizarro world sometimes when you

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.490
work as like someone who makes videos

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.049
for YouTube I'm a very simple guy I

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.810
don't even edit videos but there was a

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.400
time I guess like two and a half years

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.580
ago now and I had like a triple digit

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.590
streak going in Isaac I have one dude

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.090
made a very public post on the binding

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.920
of issac subreddit that accused me of

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.890
cheating with something that he thought

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.290
was proof and then I was like hey if you

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.670
actually test it it's not proof and

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.979
you're talking out of your butt and he

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.390
was like ok well like I'm sorry I made a

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.659
mistake but I don't see why you're so

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.820
mad well you know you kind of called my

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.000
integrity any question publicly there

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.100
why would I I'm doing just fine being

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.869
bad at the game I don't need to put on

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.180
airs to make myself look good at a video

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.100
game in fact I think it's time to all

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.770
that goes on we've come to realize that

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.140
if I was better at a video games it

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.219
might actually you know reduce my charm

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.460
a little bit I think the northernlion

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.700
brand is being very very clever but kind

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.439
of stupid not stupid necessarily but a

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.709
dim-witted might be a better way to

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.000
describe it they do I want the wit

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.910
cranked up to like 12 and

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.520
the observance cranked down to like you

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.110
know four that's my west of loathing has

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.090
been so perfect for us it was this video

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.680
I'm trying to think of the Isaac back

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.600
law is not as long as it has been

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.120
because I didn't record any for like two

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.160
weeks and it felt weird to not be

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.640
playing any Isaac over the course of

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.050
like the first half of August but anyway

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.130
hopefully the West and loading videos

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.420
are still running because that series a

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.740
lot of fun but I think it's why west of

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.020
loathing works so well is that the game

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.790
is largely on Rails and funny so all I

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.239
have to do is read somebody else's jokes

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.739
and everyone goes this guy's hilarious a

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.580
very privileged place to be in and I

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.890
appreciate that

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.330
alright to spirit hearts probably should

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.290
have saved those for the next floor but

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.989
let's be realistic

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.720
I'm not going to intend to do very much

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.760
backtracking over this challenge no

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.500
backtracking that's unnecessary at the

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:08.680
very least so item rooms of course are

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:10.870
necessary but will probably go for that

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.640
item rooms of course are necessarily are

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.580
necessary especially in the early game

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.680
but we'll see we finally unlock smaller

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:22.060
rock as well so it might seem like kind

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.880
of a minor thing like track nine from

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.070
the Red Hot Chili Peppers 2003 album by

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.360
the way but it isn't a minor thing like

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.370
track nine from the Red Hot Chili

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.720
Peppers 2003 album by the way it's

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.760
pretty major because it means we you

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:38.500
know one more damage upgrade in the pool

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.840
by the way album by the way all it's

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.380
from 2002 so that's my bad and then

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:49.780
track listing minor thing track 14

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:52.110
that's like way down there let's go back

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.110
here

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.380
track 14 dude I'm actually on if I may

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.960
I'm kind of impressed with myself that I

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.080
got to track 14 in an album when I was

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.390
like 14 years old well it's not that

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.800
like when I was 10 you buy an album he

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.420
only listened to the single we didn't

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.890
have iTunes back then you buy the wild

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.720
wild west soundtrack you listen to track

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.490
one side one wild wild west you know

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.800
that's what I got the album for I'm not

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.900
here to listen to you know the symphony

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.640
when Jim West takes on you know general

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.870
ear wax or whatever the heck is name is

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:27.390
I guess you know I started getting into

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.880
the album sort of thing is I got a into

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.820
my teenage years that makes sense why by

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.870
the way I don't know mostly like

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.550
listening to music back then you had

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.810
some inertia you just put the album on

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.040
and then go to the other side of the

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.260
room and you're like do I really want to

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.990
get up and go to the CD player that

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.180
seems a little oh I got to rip the CD

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.770
into Windows Media Player that's a lot

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.950
of work I'm not sure if I'm down for

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.470
that

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.470
we live in a comparative Golden Age now

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.870
I'm still old though and I know that

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:02.760
this is kind of like an an overdone bit

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:05.070
but I downloaded an app on my PC and it

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:09.480
kind of weirded me out because I thought

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.940
apps were only on iOS like I thought

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.130
that on PC we called them like

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.500
executables so I had to search on my

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.810
laptop I was like you know I have google

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.400
play music why I would just walk into it

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.480
for a key I have a google play music

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:28.350
subscription because it's like cheap and

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:30.630
also why would I ever buy a contraband

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.850
the best of men at work for like ten

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.500
dollars when I could just pay $10 a

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.850
month and listen to only that

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:40.350
exclusively right it's like the

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:41.850
Photoshop principle but I wanted to get

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.740
it on PC because everyone made fun of me

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.290
for having a Google Play Music Unlimited

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.740
subscription and then using Spotify the

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:51.120
free web Player version for all my music

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.010
when I was you know and I'm programming

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.060
for example and then I got Google Play

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.770
Music and it was like do you want to

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.450
download the Google Play Music app and I

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:01.320
was like I don't know that's kind of a

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:04.060
crisis for me if I was using this on my

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:07.310
Apple product I would say yes but

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.800
no I still have not come forward into

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.510
the modern age I suppose I also Kate

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:16.040
makes fun of me I don't know how to

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:18.560
close applications on on the iPad you

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.900
know we've had an iPad she's had one

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.530
longer than then we have had one but

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.390
I've been using this iPad since like

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:28.280
2013 maybe I do not a clothes anything I

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.960
just hit the home button and go back to

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.510
the main menu and there's probably like

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:36.380
80 processes open in the background this

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:39.740
is also kind of hilarious because I've

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:43.340
built for a class of mine I've built a

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:46.340
game that ran on iPad in fact it not

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.350
only did it run on iPad it only ran on

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.300
iPad because it was locked to the iPad

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:53.419
resolution it was an iOS development

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:56.660
course so I actually know more about

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:58.970
writing an application to run on the

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:02.180
iPad than I do about how to like do the

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.410
iPads version of alt f4 I'm creating a

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:09.200
very strange

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:12.140
skill set I think you might double tap

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.940
the home button and then like slide up

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.030
words on things you want to close but

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.290
let's be honest that's pretty advanced

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.270
how's the challenge going so far

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:23.570
honestly Cissy Long Legs is a really

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:26.169
nice item for us to have we're kind of

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:30.590
passively generating some spiders here

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:31.790
it's not ten out of ten but with one

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.790
good deal with the devil it could be

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:36.320
done at a 10 and we are taking longer

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.669
than I would like but not necessarily

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.660
longer than I'd expect to do this

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:41.169
challenge this is one of those

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:44.030
challenges that I have actually no

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:46.430
memory of whatsoever so I'm pretty sure

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:48.680
that it might have been on the easy side

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.120
the relatively you besides the first

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.950
time we did it this would have been a

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.340
great time to get Duffy's head but I

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.340
digress

00:07:55.139 --> 00:08:03.120
I know there's to me like is the same

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:04.860
thing I know I'm becoming a little older

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:09.060
because I blame people other than myself

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:10.800
for my problems now like let me let me

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:13.099
give you a thought experiment you're

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:16.409
watching a video on a touchscreen device

00:08:13.099 --> 00:08:18.150
how do you make it go from the small

00:08:16.409 --> 00:08:20.610
video player to full screen now

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:23.039
statistically probably like 75% of you

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:25.680
were like oh you do like a reverse pinch

00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:28.199
you put your fingers yes sure why not

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.819
you want to get nuts you put your

00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:31.620
fingers together in the center of the

00:08:29.819 --> 00:08:33.209
screen and then move them outwards to

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.550
like as if you're doing like a weird

00:08:33.209 --> 00:08:37.409
snack and then some of the other people

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:38.880
said no you tap on the video player and

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:41.550
then you click on the arrows and it

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:43.620
makes it fullscreen I'm okay if both of

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:46.260
those work when only one of them works

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:47.610
I'm like oh who's the UX designers of

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.800
this company I got to talk to them

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:51.600
because this is outrageous that like

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.000
this easily it leads to me being made

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.470
fun of by my wife in an emasculating

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.899
fashion we're watching something on

00:08:55.470 --> 00:09:00.300
YouTube you know maybe Dan Gees link

00:08:57.899 --> 00:09:01.740
plays Pub G with randoms for example and

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.600
then I want to put the video in full

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.100
screen and I'm trying to do the the tabs

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.430
like the the pinch-to-zoom

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.329
and then she's laughing and go and

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.860
that's not how you do it

00:09:09.329 --> 00:09:13.170
then she taps on it and there's a little

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.790
video player control come on we should

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.709
have like a universal standard and

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.209
before you go Enel what you want me to

00:09:16.709 --> 00:09:19.709
hold your hand for you well you know you

00:09:18.209 --> 00:09:22.019
want me to hold your pee pee when you go

00:09:19.709 --> 00:09:25.680
to the bathroom first off who's offering

00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:27.860
secondly you know they have like AI a so

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.660
standards for writing the freaking date

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:32.630
we need some ISO standards for video

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:35.310
player controls that's all I'm saying

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:37.110
I'm not saying it's like a war crime or

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:39.149
something like that but now you can't

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.949
get ISO certified as a manufacturing

00:09:39.149 --> 00:09:43.920
company if you write your dates in like

00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:45.149
the day month year format and you're

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.620
going to make fun of me say it's

00:09:45.149 --> 00:09:48.420
outrageous that I think video players

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.100
should have standardized controls it's

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:53.100
like you know why not just make it so a

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:54.959
1 a VCR just google it if you don't know

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:58.410
what it is I'm just joking you know what

00:09:54.959 --> 00:10:01.800
it is presumably not a laser disc on a

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:03.390
VCR the play button is the triangle to

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.519
which we're all familiar with but o on

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.410
the blu-ray player no we don't use that

00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:08.240
button anymore we use a big you know a

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.550
green

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.020
button that says pee on it oh why don't

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:15.410
you just learn what it is for it because

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:18.680
we're trying to simplify it okay it's

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:20.300
kind of like I always feel like there

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.709
should be like standardization is

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.750
important and I know that sounds boring

00:10:21.709 --> 00:10:25.610
because everyone's like I want to you

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:27.649
know express myself I'm expressing with

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:30.170
the full capabilities and now I'm living

00:10:27.649 --> 00:10:32.330
in correctional facilities some don't

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:34.550
agree with how I do this but I feel like

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:37.850
at least within a country there should

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:40.760
be standardized road signs I grew up in

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:42.230
Ontario and anytime you tell people

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.580
about driving Nate no matter what you

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:44.839
say you're like I Drive by the rules of

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.910
the road they go I'll get off the road

00:10:44.839 --> 00:10:50.240
grandpa if you go I speed sometimes they

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:53.029
go arrest this man I passed all of my

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:56.330
driving tests on my first try and in

00:10:53.029 --> 00:10:57.890
Ontario that's probably the norm but I

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.120
know in some places it's not but I just

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.320
want to give you a feel for the idea

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.649
that I'm not like the world's worst

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:06.589
driver or anything like that but in

00:11:03.649 --> 00:11:09.470
Ontario sometimes you're driving you

00:11:06.589 --> 00:11:11.029
come across a flashing green light what

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:15.170
is a flashing green light mean in

00:11:11.029 --> 00:11:18.290
Ontario that means on a three light

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:21.230
traffic light you have a protected left

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:24.890
turn which is important because you all

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:26.300
that actually work you know some lights

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:27.529
don't have that fourth spot but they

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.760
want to give you a moment when you can

00:11:27.529 --> 00:11:29.810
turn left without being worried about

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.579
traffic that's coming the other way

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:34.160
otherwise like only one car would fit in

00:11:31.579 --> 00:11:35.930
on each light good to know right very

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.320
important thing to know for the rules of

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.089
the road

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.160
both book of belial and book of shadows

00:11:38.089 --> 00:11:41.480
very interesting I think I'm going to go

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.240
Belial because I could use the damage

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:46.250
for now you know what a green light that

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.740
flashes in British Columbia means it

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:50.810
means those lights are controlled by

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:53.510
pedestrians so the pedestrians push a

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:55.579
button to cross the road the light could

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:57.260
suddenly change the amber and then to

00:11:55.579 --> 00:11:59.779
red to give them a chance to cross

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:02.720
that's the kind of thing I mean I

00:11:59.779 --> 00:12:03.890
personal responsibility for sure that's

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.660
the kind of thing though I think they

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:07.190
should tell you when you when you cross

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:09.079
the border should be like by the way

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:10.880
have you ever driven in British Columbia

00:12:09.079 --> 00:12:14.089
before because green lights that flash

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:15.860
here do not mean turn a headlong into

00:12:14.089 --> 00:12:18.560
traffic the other people have a red

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:20.810
light it means that like her turn red at

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.740
any moment I just don't understand I

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:23.510
guess there's only a

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:28.910
of different modes of input-output on a

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:31.040
on a traffic light but BC like Andrew

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:32.870
Horgan played John Horgan John Horgan

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.400
look I should know our premiers name but

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:36.340
we did just have an election that ended

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.680
in weird fashion you got to talk to

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:40.700
Kathleen Wynne and get this sorted out

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:44.630
that's going to lead the people getting

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:46.970
killed dude especially as more and more

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:48.710
people free free British Columbia two

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:50.720
heads Ontario because it's affected the

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:56.540
average housing price I digress anyway

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:58.190
the point is I hate sauerkraut that's

00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:01.880
really what I'm trying to tell you we're

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:04.400
almost done with our second floor here

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:09.410
it is getting a little a little

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:15.800
outrageous one day though we'll be free

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:16.940
to do what we want any old time it

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.280
almost feels like we should be fighting

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:24.800
mom at this point but no just just

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:27.680
little horn there is this aching little

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:30.500
horn keeps on popping shooting bombs

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:34.870
he's tempting me to use my own but I

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:38.270
won't do linking to okay there's like a

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:40.700
2005 era block party reference like even

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:42.380
three silent alarm but people know who

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:45.080
block party is that's a relatively

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:47.570
universal you know universally

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:49.070
recognizable reference I think to some

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:51.020
extent all right we're going to go deep

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:52.460
here and be a little risky we're going

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:56.330
to take Guppies head for the guaranteed

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:58.550
damage output combined with the mark for

00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:07.580
the guaranteed like we have extra damage

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:09.140
now hello Tom oh hello Tom all okay so

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:12.530
we got much better damage and we have

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:14.990
Guppies paw every single room ten out of

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:16.430
ten item in a shop would be a hive mind

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:18.560
at this point if we can make it happen I

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:20.900
can't believe I've exhausted like two

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:23.390
anecdotes to their fullest and yet here

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:25.190
I am on the third floor out of eight

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:27.700
that's like we're a quarter of the way

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:27.700
through the run

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:32.220
that's why you know they call it the

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:35.880
blues now if that's why it's a challenge

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:37.350
to begin with if I had to guess what

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.300
does xxxxxx

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:41.220
I'll give you maybe like a 1 makes you

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:43.530
larger pill I don't know when those were

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:46.260
added but these are after birth

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:49.650
challenges so like you know a year or so

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:54.180
after the game's release so as good as

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:57.630
our damage is it's not really good

00:14:54.180 --> 00:15:00.560
enough to clear these rooms quickly the

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:03.570
thing with its the the problem with

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:07.110
everything being XL is that essentially

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:11.430
it's not maybe not then it's not just

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:13.140
that you have bigger floors it's that

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:14.520
the way the floor architecture works

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:16.710
that's more likely to give you bigger

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:18.480
rooms as well bigger rooms have more

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:20.700
enemies especially if they have enemies

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:23.670
that generate other enemies it can be a

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:26.150
dang nightmare to get through it by the

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:28.770
way whenever I joke about being old I

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:30.270
always wanted I want to hedge my bets

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:33.960
there and say that I know I'm not old

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:36.180
you know if you were to watch a Pixar

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:39.540
movie that chronicled someone's life in

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:41.670
a montage and then like I haven't seen

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:44.130
the start of up but I imagine that the

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:45.420
way it goes is that first you you meet a

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:46.800
young man and then you see him at

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.210
different phases of his life that have

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:51.090
turned them into the grumpy Gus that you

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:54.360
see in front of you today I would only

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:56.220
be at like stage 5 of 8 days you know

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:59.910
you'd see me as a kid then you'd see me

00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:01.620
like I don't know why am i driving my

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:03.570
first car or something like that then

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:05.400
you'd see me going off to college then

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:09.240
you'd see me getting married I'm in like

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:11.400
the pre kid pre middle age sort of era

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.260
of that montage I'm not even like I

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:17.040
might be halfway through the montage

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:19.500
right now but I am old enough that the

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.970
world has changed from at least a little

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.230
bit for my formative years which is

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:25.950
really what I'm using that as shorthand

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:28.760
to document I suppose solo while you're

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:33.260
looking looking at me so weirdly buddy

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:36.260
you think your robe in Kent years I'm 28

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
Tomoe

00:16:36.279 --> 00:16:41.259
I'm not going to you know belabor you

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:43.810
with my cat stories because like who

00:16:41.259 --> 00:16:46.720
wants to hear other people's cat stories

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:50.170
videos absolutely stories not really but

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:53.110
this homo buddy is like the neediest kin

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:55.300
of all time you it's almost like I feel

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.829
like we've accomplished what we should

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.509
have accomplished as pet owners

00:16:56.829 --> 00:17:00.999
it was Tomo when we got him he was a

00:16:58.509 --> 00:17:03.069
little standoffish and then like he

00:17:00.999 --> 00:17:06.459
didn't really like people he didn't love

00:17:03.069 --> 00:17:09.579
Ruka that much and now like just by

00:17:06.459 --> 00:17:12.130
overloading him with attention he can't

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:13.630
live without it now which he might see

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:14.169
is like a sign of weakness but it who

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.669
cares

00:17:14.169 --> 00:17:18.100
it's not like you have to go out in the

00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:19.329
wild any time soon you know if he ends

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:22.839
up living in the wild we got bigger

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:25.510
problems like what nuclear bomb hit he's

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:26.949
a cat he's like a you know a living

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:28.840
ornament and I don't mean that to be

00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:30.820
insulting I he's his own boy he can live

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:33.549
his own life as well but you know it's

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:38.620
not like he needs to have the call of

00:17:33.549 --> 00:17:42.760
the wild or something like that grab

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:44.620
this grab this living ornament was

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.450
probably the reroll as well

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:49.830
living ornament was probably the wrong

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:52.390
word to be honest with you I do not like

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:55.690
the broken modem I think that it is

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:57.549
basically it it throws off our

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:59.380
equilibrium and it's not good enough to

00:17:57.549 --> 00:18:01.870
justify putting us on the back foot like

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:04.419
that but yeah now Tomo you like you

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:05.799
wants pets all the time any such your

00:18:04.419 --> 00:18:08.320
little cutie

00:18:05.799 --> 00:18:11.730
you've become properly socialized

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:13.000
haven't you more or less more or less

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:18.460
okay

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:21.700
the runs going okay we actually should

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:23.950
probably take the emperor card could

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:25.270
save us a lot of annoyance it would be

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:26.980
the way that I would describe it because

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.659
I mean but I mean this is really one

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:30.669
where patience is the name of the game I

00:18:28.659 --> 00:18:33.880
think if we just if we play our game

00:18:30.669 --> 00:18:37.720
it's just Isaac with more rooms like we

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:39.220
we know how to play Isaac the only thing

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.500
that could really get up our butts and

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:45.309
kill us which is a very weird turn of

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:46.570
phrase there is if we get impatient and

00:18:45.309 --> 00:18:48.940
starts to make mistakes that we

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:50.200
shouldn't make we probably if I'm

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:54.640
leveling with you

00:18:50.200 --> 00:19:03.280
that idea to take to take anti grab but

00:18:54.640 --> 00:19:05.230
here we are these bomb down here

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:07.780
normally I'd like on an average run

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:10.840
couldn't give two shakes of Atomos tail

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:13.060
about trading two bombs for four bombs

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.920
but on a run like this I think those

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:16.630
kind of transactions can can impact

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:19.420
their quality of life especially because

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:22.660
rooms with portals or spider generators

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:24.850
can slob my knob as far as I'm concerned

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:26.470
we can throw a bomb down and take them

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:28.390
out in a reasonable length of time as

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:34.060
opposed to you know struggling with it

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:38.220
absolutely sign me up

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:38.220
signed sealed delivered I'm yours I

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:45.610
can't I know this is getting like a

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:47.410
little I know you said this before but I

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:51.730
can't believe we're on the third floor

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:56.320
of the game it just it shouldn't call it

00:19:51.730 --> 00:20:01.510
xxx XL they should call it xx xx SLO W

00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:03.850
this is extra slow yeah we can take it

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:05.920
we're probably not too interested in

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:07.060
playing a blood bank and it's an even or

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.650
sorry it's an odd numbered floor to

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:13.450
begin with so we can't play a blood bank

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:15.670
sure yeah dude tiny planet why not so

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:17.110
anti grab tiny planet huh that's what

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:23.050
we've chosen to do to ourselves on this

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:26.160
challenge well so be it if this a Nova

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:29.800
Scotian grocery store because so be it

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:34.530
so these is a it's not just Nova Scotian

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:38.230
but it does exist in Nova Scotia so I

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:40.650
actually for what it's worth think this

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:40.650
is better

00:20:43.929 --> 00:20:51.230
it's not meaningful and I think it's

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:53.210
better because it gives us a better

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:55.190
ability to hit enemies versus the anti

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:56.690
grab because even when we miss they get

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:58.039
a second chance at coming around here

00:20:56.690 --> 00:21:00.650
now I'd rather just like shoot and aim

00:20:58.039 --> 00:21:02.270
at them directly but anti grab by itself

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:06.590
eliminates that ability so we're kind of

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:07.640
stuck with what we got here but I got

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:09.230
faith we're going to make it through

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.940
this you spend a lot of HP on the last

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:13.160
floor but we're not taking very much

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:15.380
damage the HP that we spent was spent

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:25.010
productively so what am i complaining

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:30.230
about John come on take them out finally

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:31.850
ok so we have found our uh our boss room

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:33.590
we found our item room we found our shop

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:35.000
this hopefully things start to move

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:37.429
pretty quickly on the next floor because

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.570
I'm going to I mean another ideal shop

00:21:37.429 --> 00:21:41.090
item by the way before I get distracted

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:42.740
would be any kind of mapping to save us

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:44.059
some of these rooms not just to speed up

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.620
the run but to minimize the amount of

00:21:44.059 --> 00:21:47.240
combat we have to get into before we get

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:50.000
super strong like maximize the

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:52.669
concentration of good news you want to

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.010
leave now I thought you wanted done you

00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:58.520
want a more attention so we'll use

00:21:55.010 --> 00:22:00.740
strength right here hope for a deal with

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:03.610
the devil but don't anticipate one

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:03.610
necessarily

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.639
we're actually dealing like a decent

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:15.100
amount of damage with the strength card

00:22:09.639 --> 00:22:16.750
going here make sure you're releasing

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.250
the shots in time for them to actually

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:25.389
hit because the shot speed is pretty

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:27.759
slow right now lar that'll do it we got

00:22:25.389 --> 00:22:29.919
super lucky speed upgrade is whatever

00:22:27.759 --> 00:22:32.230
but the deal with the devil for a guffy

00:22:29.919 --> 00:22:34.120
item in particular is strong hopefully

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:36.429
we can manage to snag this last guppy

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:38.590
item and probably not on the next floor

00:22:36.429 --> 00:22:40.360
but hey you know big floor a lot a lot

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:41.799
of opportunities and we got another

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:44.320
spirit heart which is also very valuable

00:22:41.799 --> 00:22:46.330
but now this is where things might start

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:48.820
to pop off so you grab the Hermit card

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:50.379
you come down here we got 44 cents you

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:57.669
pop the Hermit card and hope to not

00:22:50.379 --> 00:23:00.279
fight greed please okay I kind of like

00:22:57.669 --> 00:23:05.889
it I think it's worth getting the potato

00:23:00.279 --> 00:23:14.470
peeler because a single orbital can also

00:23:05.889 --> 00:23:16.440
deal a lot of damage certainly I would

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:18.730
say humbling bundle is probably worth it

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:22.360
which you might have expected based on

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:24.399
the fact that I just bought it there's

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.720
options as tempting but I kind of want

00:23:24.399 --> 00:23:29.919
to go for something a little greater

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:31.960
because and immediately useful in the

00:23:29.919 --> 00:23:33.940
form of blank card because we can't take

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:37.090
advantage okay I do think nine-volt is

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:41.460
kind of like a nice a nice compromise

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:43.720
here item room is right there but I am

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:45.940
hoping still to maybe come across

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:49.240
mapping in there somehow piggy bank is

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:52.210
not amazing of course but it does exist

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:54.100
let's work our way in the opposite

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:55.480
direction if possible from from the

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:59.259
origin point of this floor and maybe

00:23:55.480 --> 00:24:04.809
we'll get lucky and find a way to finish

00:23:59.259 --> 00:24:07.000
this off but as is I'm okay with what

00:24:04.809 --> 00:24:08.649
we've gotten from this floor I do sort

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.899
of wish we've gotten a little more

00:24:08.649 --> 00:24:15.600
immediate use out of the shop but hey

00:24:10.899 --> 00:24:15.600
humbling bundle is not bad certainly

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:24.160
and nine-volt not incredibly useful on

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:28.960
probably our average room but if we ever

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:31.120
end up replacing guppies head there's a

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:34.660
decent chance that ends up being pretty

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:37.090
great for us you've got a double key

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:38.860
room would i reroll my whole run it at

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:40.270
some point why not right you might as

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.950
well take a take them up on the offer

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:47.860
here we're not going to have that

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:48.970
opportunity just yet though justice got

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:54.420
a spirit heart out of it which is

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:56.770
actually very nice and then a death card

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:58.360
we should go for it

00:24:56.770 --> 00:25:01.270
I don't expect it to be good but we got

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:03.460
to take every opportunity here that's

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:07.840
quite a lot of money which is maybe like

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:10.350
the the ideal get there don't just throw

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.350
stuff away

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:23.610
this has me itching for like real damage

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:25.140
upgrade because we're doing a lot better

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:26.790
with this Empress card I don't want to

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:29.820
run away with it right now like a song

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:32.130
by the far side but at the same time I'm

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:33.600
missing this damage potential and I'm

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:36.210
looking forward to hopefully getting to

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:38.220
that point in the future magician not

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:40.080
bad but I think the death cards a little

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:42.980
bit more potent because hopefully we can

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:46.410
just walk into this room and kill a dead

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:48.450
monkey yes two extra bombs I saw it

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:50.310
coming but I didn't didn't turn away

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:53.550
fast enough we got to check this for

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:55.950
like an emperor card not necessarily bad

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:57.180
honestly but not what we're looking for

00:25:55.950 --> 00:26:00.150
God you got me focused too much on

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:02.580
strategy now it's probably will blow

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:04.800
this up it's gone forever now it's

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:08.880
moving box which i think is horrible

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:11.250
more or less in retro vision which is

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:17.220
not worth anything and then moving boxes

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:23.670
also not worth anything so we'll just

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:26.360
move along in a way this is the most

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:28.860
challenging of all the challenges

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:30.120
because I find myself I'm not fighting

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:33.240
the game anymore you know when you're

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:34.500
fighting an obstacle you kind of have a

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.640
chip on your shoulder and you go I'm

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:38.730
going to beat this obstacle this

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:41.400
obstacle is not better than me on this

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:44.100
one I have to beat my own brain I have

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:45.720
to continually remind myself and not

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:48.180
just remind myself but put it into

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:50.670
action that we need to you know play

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:52.290
smarter which is not always easy you

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:55.050
know knowing the right decision and

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:57.000
making the right decision are not always

00:26:55.050 --> 00:27:00.300
one in the same you know we all know

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.640
flamin hot cheetos not great for us do

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.660
we eat them yeah many of us do myself

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.180
included

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:07.410
I don't need flamin hot cheetos but

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:11.610
that's only because they don't have them

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:15.150
in Canada I have had them once in the

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:17.760
United States of America did it open my

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:21.090
eyes I I mean to some extent I was like

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:22.710
these are good I I wouldn't say it's a

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:24.929
life-changing experience

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:27.120
it did change my life I'm just saying

00:27:24.929 --> 00:27:30.720
for your lives maybe not quite as much

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:33.990
okay so let's go in here Guffey please

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:35.669
no guppy moon card takes us to the

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:38.190
secret room up here we don't really need

00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:44.399
any more money is my guess so we'll save

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:46.590
our bombs instead I do want that hermit

00:27:44.399 --> 00:27:49.830
card the key is meaningless but being

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:53.659
able to potentially skip like 20 rooms

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:53.659
is is extremely meaningful

00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:02.980
have there always been dis many enemies

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:04.570
that take forever to kill an Isaac or is

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:09.400
it just because of this run is so dang

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:11.560
long well we don't really want to go

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.230
that way probably instead we'll go this

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:17.680
way

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:24.280
alright Joker card will be amazing ace

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:27.150
of clubs less amazing hangman that's

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.150
just perfect timing

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:37.870
well I'm still holding that hope not

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:41.740
necessarily that the run pops off but

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:42.820
that my own brain avoids self-sabotage

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:45.820
here because the only thing worse than

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:49.200
you know doing this challenge once we'll

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:49.200
be doing it twice you know what I mean

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:53.380
you know I should put on the facade of

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:55.420
like oh what an interesting challenge

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:59.620
but mostly I just find myself annoyed

00:28:55.420 --> 00:29:01.780
dudes give me head trauma over this you

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:06.040
know you can you can waste my life force

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:09.220
but once you start asking me to clear a

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:12.640
bunch of rooms willy-nilly like I'm

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:15.750
going to have a problem so our hermit

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:21.040
gambit obviously did not work out 100%

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:25.990
we find ourselves still searching pretty

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:27.750
much every room on this floor I think we

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:30.370
should go left

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:32.440
imagine that left is West they always

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:35.110
tell you go west young man and by day I

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.910
mean like fictionalized versions of your

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:39.360
parents from a movie that takes place

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:41.980
around the turn of the 20th century

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:45.660
which I think accurately describes most

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.660
people watching this if I had to guess

00:29:53.030 --> 00:30:00.270
the Dodgers are I wish we didn't have to

00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:01.680
oh okay I know I didn't finish the

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:04.380
sentence because I had nothing to finish

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:06.060
I'm just waiting for the magic mush I'm

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:08.250
waiting for the small rock I'm waiting

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:09.780
for the day when they're going to throw

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:13.940
it back to you by now you should've

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:13.940
somehow realized what you got to do

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:24.600
secret room little surprise but dude

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:27.480
that's like enough HP to carry us for a

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:32.700
few floors here okay we got high outs

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:34.110
this is caves two caves two are gonna be

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:39.180
the caves and the kids you know the

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:43.470
caves of 2xl is putting us through hell

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:46.170
and the Kaazing other caves - I don't

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:49.470
believe the caves the caves two caves to

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:51.560
kiss two caves the caves it - okay thank

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:51.560
you

00:30:55.040 --> 00:31:04.040
and all the caves behind the you a

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:06.920
basements okay I'm going to not first

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:08.600
off don't want to get sued secondly not

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:10.220
a good joke thirdly we're about to be

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:15.860
guppy so we have to stop complaining Oh

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:18.020
has he done it he has not done it but he

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:19.070
did get death touch which I don't know

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.840
why I said it like that

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:23.960
borderline insensitive but on the other

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:27.050
hand great item especially with tiny

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:28.940
planet maybe not especially but tiny

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:30.920
planet is especially lucky to have it I

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:32.600
guess I should say at this point we

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:35.000
might as well like pay five cents for

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:36.860
three flies locked upgrade bothers me

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.960
about zero percent and dude were so

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:40.820
lucky again at least in terms of the

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:43.070
speed of which or the rate at which we

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:45.410
can find these item rooms the item room

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:49.490
itself not quite ten anat and in case

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:54.020
that's not pardon me abundantly clear

00:31:49.490 --> 00:32:00.670
but on the other hand here we are so

00:31:54.020 --> 00:32:05.750
this is depths one nowhere to have baby

00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:08.180
nowhere to run after the caves to wits

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:12.290
the generator that did it at that are

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:14.180
did that it at the depths one dams allah

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:16.820
that's love gun by kiss dude I'm sorry

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:19.970
but on a run where we spend so much time

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:23.870
in a holding pattern like this my brain

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:28.070
starts to wander might not be a healthy

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:30.380
habit for survival on this run but it's

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:32.300
pretty healthy for keeping my morale at

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:35.270
a level that's like above zero because

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:37.250
you know I don't want to be the first

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:41.660
element in an array in a sea-based

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:43.700
language sure we're not going to play a

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:48.710
blood bank same principle as last time

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:51.170
we just have no reason to in fact we

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:55.180
have we have an incentive not to rather

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:57.890
would be a apt way to describe it I

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:59.090
don't mind fighting pride because oh

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:02.600
that I mean we shouldn't just walk into

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:05.780
him but if we had gotten yeah stars card

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:07.100
is very useful if we had gotten the

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:09.740
Anarchist Cookbook

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:12.980
look then we would have bookworm right

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:14.840
now which again it adds up is what are

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:16.039
the Politis thing I can really muster

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:18.260
about that it's probably not going to

00:33:16.039 --> 00:33:20.809
change the game at this point too much

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:22.850
at least but anything it allows me to

00:33:20.809 --> 00:33:24.650
get through enemies at a slightly

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:26.750
increased speed is fine by me

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:28.940
I will use two keys to get four bombs

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:31.900
because again the bombs are kind of like

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:34.039
a precious ability for us to

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:41.750
short-circuit some of these enemies we

00:33:34.039 --> 00:33:45.679
don't really want to face yeah

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:47.179
absolutely so we're still kind of on the

00:33:45.679 --> 00:33:48.890
razor's edge here like if I could give

00:33:47.179 --> 00:33:55.490
the the run credit for something at

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:59.419
least it's a run in which we've a run in

00:33:55.490 --> 00:34:04.309
which we've managed to stay kind of like

00:33:59.419 --> 00:34:06.650
tents which i think is good for oh just

00:34:04.309 --> 00:34:08.210
ricocheted off the wall it's kind of

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:10.490
good for entertainment purposes now a

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:13.310
lot of that tension is I wouldn't say

00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:17.149
manufactured but just bad like there is

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:18.889
no reason for me to walk into enemies as

00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:20.600
often as I have except for a lingering

00:34:18.889 --> 00:34:22.100
kind of frustration and existential

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:24.500
anyway because of the fact that I can't

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:27.050
hit enemies with our tears despite you

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:28.639
know very much wanting to we are getting

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:30.619
through them a little bit faster than we

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:33.350
used to though thanks mostly to desktop

00:34:30.619 --> 00:34:35.690
I mostly I mean entirely but at least

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:37.760
this wasn't one where like hey you have

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:39.560
no chance to lose but you also have no

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:42.730
damage so the runs going to take twenty

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:45.470
years but you're never going to actually

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:47.210
feel like you're powerful you know

00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:48.340
you're still okay now you're being an

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:50.750
idiot right now

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:52.580
taking a little bit of damage is a

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:56.149
luxury that will afford you because you

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:59.920
played this game a lot and you know when

00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:59.920
to hold em know when to fold them what

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.920
you want to know you want to know what

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:09.500
happened there

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:12.140
I thought because I've forgot that I was

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:14.150
holding the Empress card but I was not

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:16.520
holding the Empress card instead I was

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:18.859
holding a very valuable card the Stars

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:20.270
which we could have used on our next

00:35:18.859 --> 00:35:22.369
floor but you know what maybe this is

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:25.329
the rock bottom that supposedly you have

00:35:22.369 --> 00:35:28.010
to hit to get better now I'll stop using

00:35:25.329 --> 00:35:30.829
my orbital for all of my damage I'll

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:32.390
focus on dodging and we'll you know it's

00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:33.079
up to us at this point to remake our

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:35.480
lives

00:35:33.079 --> 00:35:39.770
I want that card back though cause it's

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:42.380
like really good I'm also I'm looking

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:49.390
for a second secret room at the present

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:53.210
moment because even though it's a

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:54.950
prodigious use of bombs second secret

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:57.260
room be real nice but you know what

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:59.690
unnecessary as well all right so we've

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:03.190
spent like eight bombs and we got

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:03.190
nothing at all

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:16.600
a little bit of a bummer so you know

00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:18.190
what I'm hopeful we'll beat the odds get

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:20.670
yet another deal with the devil and this

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:23.110
one will be Abaddon which is just like

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:26.490
universally great for us right now and I

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:26.490
even remember the name of the item

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:39.550
please let's go no deal with the devil

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:40.060
we get gish we can make this we can make

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:41.560
it better

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.940
that's what Kanye West said and those

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:45.100
are the rules by which I've chosen to

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:46.630
live my life curse of the unknown that's

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:50.260
all right we got one and a half HP we

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:53.160
can I can count that did you hear this

00:36:50.260 --> 00:37:02.190
cat in the background I'm sorry

00:36:53.160 --> 00:37:02.190
let me back in okay fine hey hello Tomo

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:07.960
Enzo Tomo you want to be my good luck

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:11.200
charm how many Isaac episodes have you

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:12.490
done since I've been gone 20 nope this

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:16.480
is the first one buddy

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:19.140
we're still on Episode one side one

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:19.140
track one

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:32.550
you have a what is it buddy wish he just

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:37.740
came in jumped up and then now you want

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:40.290
to leave again maybe he doesn't want to

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:42.540
come in he wants me to go out that might

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:44.040
be the secret there dude no no no I

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:45.450
don't want to actually see if that's a

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.220
bomb because it could be a live bomb

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:52.050
which might prevent me from getting a

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:55.200
payout here the devil fine card old okay

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:56.910
I was scary for all that we got a devil

00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:00.950
card in black bean you might think I'm

00:37:56.910 --> 00:38:05.040
disappointed you would be correct about

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:07.290
that bad but certainly not that great

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:08.850
either two spirit hearts might even be a

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:11.580
better play than small rock at this

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:14.330
point a toe ball don't go back there my

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:14.330
tombow friend

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:25.000
come on Swan dumpy item helped up there

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.589
we go full health

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.839
they even got it filled up it's nice

00:38:26.589 --> 00:38:35.800
okay pin is going to be here several

00:38:28.839 --> 00:38:38.400
pins they will be destroyed dusty they

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:40.869
can't stand up too much scrutiny like

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:42.130
deaths touch tears pin apart I think

00:38:40.869 --> 00:38:46.109
it's the first time I've been hit on

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:46.109
this room in like a year and a half

00:38:46.349 --> 00:38:57.880
might as well okay

00:38:55.270 --> 00:39:00.940
so again I think it is sensible although

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:04.030
kind of annoying to use a bomb to get

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:05.920
access to more bombs and we're going to

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:08.190
have these two bombs because I'm a silly

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:08.190
boy

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:16.820
man what a challenge this is actually

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:18.620
the first challenge out of all the ones

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:20.120
we've done where I'm like I never want

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:24.500
to see this one again as long as I live

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:26.150
I think if you get the right setup for

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:30.710
this like if you get any kind of mapping

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:33.560
you're like I'm fine but if you find

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:35.540
yourself in this position where you're

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:41.630
like fairly strong but just taking

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:43.610
forever just a bad role also none of our

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:47.300
skulls payout with anything useful

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:48.740
anymore it's just mush ease I see you

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:53.570
down there Tom well you can't go down

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:55.100
there here comes the Sun do-do-do-do so

00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:56.690
I think we hold the Sun card use it on

00:39:55.100 --> 00:40:02.300
the loom one to make sure we make it

00:39:56.690 --> 00:40:04.490
through that floor a little faster no

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:05.690
well actually it gets us closer to

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:08.210
stomping things which is at least

00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:09.650
interesting saves us the bombs from

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:14.930
trying to blow up skulls if we can make

00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:20.660
it happen early enough all right how I

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:26.810
got out of the way of that one yes tell

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:31.490
mo you have anything to say to the

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:33.500
people of YouTube tell mo the one time

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:34.520
he doesn't yell right is when I go for

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:38.260
the call-and-response

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:38.260
making me look like a dang fool

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:43.950
I'm trying I'm giving him the the Tomo

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:47.440
eyes hello

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:52.140
Telmo sound like we're gonna miss boss

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:57.880
rush take some time to talk to my son

00:40:52.140 --> 00:41:02.020
Jesus Christ you're killing me here with

00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:03.750
these like no skull payouts alright

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:10.590
thank you thank you

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:14.380
last time to make plans well keep moving

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:18.550
alright buddy you can leave but if you

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:22.320
want to be led back in I'll do with but

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:22.320
I'm gonna be like mildly upset

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:29.910
he's a Tomo born under punches

00:41:33.299 --> 00:41:41.200
please oh my god that need like a range

00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:45.220
upgrade we're not we're not extending

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:46.479
our sites enough oh that's a double

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:49.710
tinted rock which means I actually

00:41:46.479 --> 00:41:52.650
cannot access it at the present moment

00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:58.599
but that should give us like it

00:41:52.650 --> 00:42:01.440
literally cannot give us small rocks so

00:41:58.599 --> 00:42:02.829
it must be given us some spirit hearts I

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:09.099
hate you

00:42:02.829 --> 00:42:13.890
I'm actually like furious this is as

00:42:09.099 --> 00:42:13.890
furious as I get I am so mad right now

00:42:15.569 --> 00:42:20.640
okay that time he's dead so all we got

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:20.640
to do is walk

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:35.830
I don't know if we can afford to go into

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:41.200
the curse room I would actually rather

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:46.090
be called a like a loti betta garbage

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:47.470
man then go into the room contribute to

00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:51.210
our death and then have to do this

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:51.210
god-awful challenge ever again so

00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:04.400
especially having been hit a couple of

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:05.270
times we still got a beat mom mom's no

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:08.960
joke dude

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:10.940
okay now I'm actually quite frightened

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:14.480
but we must have had some spirits

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:16.100
because we're still not using our red

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:18.560
hearts but we might be on one red heart

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:21.710
which puts us in like lethal range from

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:24.830
one enemy if things go wrong we don't

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:29.450
need any of this they can't even be lock

00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:34.180
up graves please I just walked right

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:36.680
into that oh it's all falling apart Oh

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:45.320
si big superfan it's an all stats

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:46.940
upgrade we have HP now we have to then

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:49.330
we have to at least check the curse tree

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:53.570
I don't love the idea of doing it

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:56.680
and now I like particularly hate the

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:56.680
idea of doing it but

00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:08.090
the lowest we could be ad now is one red

00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:10.700
heart so just come back okay we did need

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:12.950
that so I think her head I think we're

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:18.470
now at two full red hearts which is

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:21.950
really low that is not a lot of value

00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:26.090
here please give me two bombs

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:27.010
I would like to access is that a shop is

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:28.820
that our shop

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:31.100
imagine how much different this run

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:33.050
might look if I hadn't stupidly used

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:37.480
that card on the last floor for no

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:43.430
reason at all this is big no greed

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:48.920
spirit heart battery charge sure why

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:52.880
thank do we benefit at all from box of

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:55.060
trinkets suppose we should use it we're

00:44:52.880 --> 00:45:01.250
not doing anything else with the money

00:44:55.060 --> 00:45:04.070
lebowski let's see what we can get now

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:05.690
not not really worth it probably should

00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:07.750
have generated a second trinket instead

00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:11.020
of two more flies with Guppies head but

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:15.710
kind of ancient history at this point as

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:17.270
is the start of this run well we're

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:20.290
probably not getting the deal with the

00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:20.290
devil on this floor now

00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:28.970
I think we have a pretty simple finish

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:36.390
all we need to do right now at least

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:38.310
leave this without dying

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:40.800
I'll take damage and be okay with it but

00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:43.620
we can't die then you pop the Sun on the

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:48.690
first room of the womb one it tells you

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:50.490
where to go you go there thank you for

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:54.270
the two-spirit arts you go there

00:45:50.490 --> 00:46:02.700
and like life is but a dream right we've

00:45:54.270 --> 00:46:07.980
only got two more floors to go we are

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:12.050
going the right way do you hear that

00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:13.890
there is a Tomo boy at the door he

00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:17.630
wishes to be let in

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:17.630
I'm sorry Telmo it's crunch time now

00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:23.670
this room is not in a good place for me

00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:27.120
right now you know what you got two

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:29.400
bombs we're never coming back this way

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:31.220
we got to check on this I didn't realize

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:33.060
we had three hearts actually by the way

00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:34.890
we could have figured that out because

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:38.160
now that I think back we were unable to

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:39.870
get to the boss Trap room which means

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:43.470
that we must have had at least two

00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:48.870
hearts at that point luck foot probably

00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:51.000
not super meaningful but tower kind of

00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:55.470
like a last-ditch card we could use to

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:57.950
maybe hurt mom's heart if we were in a

00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:57.950
pinch

00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:05.470
actually fine getting through this floor

00:47:02.859 --> 00:47:06.670
in like a sensible amount of time it's

00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:08.049
quite nice we also have a hundred

00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:10.059
percent chance we deal with the devil

00:47:08.049 --> 00:47:18.880
okay shouldn't a walk into them but and

00:47:10.059 --> 00:47:20.950
then we pull I am an actual moron man no

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:25.750
now now is not the time

00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:28.569
homo don't use the tower

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:30.490
I find myself like hovering over the Q

00:47:28.569 --> 00:47:32.829
key like using the tower is a smart idea

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:35.980
it's not a smart idea it's a very bad

00:47:32.829 --> 00:47:39.519
idea you did fine there just let that be

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:41.799
your like defining element here sure we

00:47:39.519 --> 00:47:44.769
could take all these but I'm not gonna

00:47:41.799 --> 00:47:48.760
I'm going to take a Thames because it

00:47:44.769 --> 00:47:51.339
could help us get some HP back the moon

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:54.390
card is a teleport which could help a

00:47:51.339 --> 00:47:57.099
little bit it's already kind of power

00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:59.519
well let's go for it I don't think I

00:47:57.099 --> 00:48:05.710
care about the the duct tape right now

00:47:59.519 --> 00:48:07.500
instead moon me up buttercup baby this

00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:13.480
will be a great time for health upgrade

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:17.380
or oh my lord

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:24.029
magic mush Domo what is it buddy you

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:30.369
sold like attention-starved right now no

00:48:24.029 --> 00:48:34.930
no thank you don't let him trick you

00:48:30.369 --> 00:48:37.059
okay he sounds like like he's in misery

00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:40.329
he's not a misery he just knows this is

00:48:37.059 --> 00:48:45.839
the best way to get pets is to to meow

00:48:40.329 --> 00:48:48.339
like that oh my god he's losing his mind

00:48:45.839 --> 00:48:53.039
tinted rocks this is a tinted rock

00:48:48.339 --> 00:48:53.039
paradise sadly we have none

00:48:55.620 --> 00:49:01.210
we're still like very very far from

00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:10.540
being out of the woods I am a scared boy

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:12.520
right now he has actually done it don't

00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:14.980
even start with me by the way we got

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:16.480
carried by Guffey it's a 45-minute run

00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:20.160
to get to the womb - ain't no one

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:20.160
getting carried this late in the game

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:26.890
first things first this is the realest

00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:29.440
you excited Tom oh we're going to beat

00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:31.390
the challenge and by we I mean I mean me

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:33.070
like you didn't really have any positive

00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:40.060
or negative influence on it one way or

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:44.290
the other we can fly that's right tinted

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:46.960
no tinted I like the way your room looks

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:52.300
but there's no tinted you go to the hill

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:54.510
miel crickets head I almost walked right

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:57.340
into that that would have been well

00:49:54.510 --> 00:50:02.410
foolhardy let's not be too hard on

00:49:57.340 --> 00:50:07.590
ourselves lemonparty actually a very

00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:09.940
good pill for our offensive-minded

00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:11.830
purposes right now I think we're going

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:15.400
to coast this one into the finish but

00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:17.080
dude this was not a great reminder of

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:21.070
what the best the challenges have to

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:26.680
offer is this was like kind of a little

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:28.300
bit not that good required a little bit

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:29.950
more sustained focus than I like but I'm

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:31.480
not complaining too hard you know it's a

00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:32.830
one in done once you finish it it's gone

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:38.410
forever dude

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:42.060
locusts to famine long time no see like

00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:45.630
a TV show starring Mischa Barton and

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:45.630
Rachel Bilson's

00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:57.810
please you can't give me a dead end

00:50:55.380 --> 00:51:00.810
I've just gone through like 15 rooms I'm

00:50:57.810 --> 00:51:03.180
sorry it's actually against the Geneva

00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:06.450
Convention for you to give me a dead end

00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:08.940
here hey Tom all you can't be on the

00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:10.860
computer body because you're being a

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:12.450
silly boy and Roca stepped on the

00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:14.940
computer during the battlegrounds

00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:16.620
recording it made me a very odd happy

00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:19.770
individual this is like a new record for

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:20.820
cat interruptions by the way I recognize

00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:22.620
there are some people they watch these

00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:24.240
videos and go why doesn't he keep the

00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:26.480
cat's out of the room when he records

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:30.180
because it adds the entertainment okay

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:31.980
in my opinion at least where you're

00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:34.710
watching videos of a grown adult man

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:38.250
playing a video game like you want me to

00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:40.890
kick my son out of the room I'm already

00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:46.580
wasting you know the prime years of my

00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:46.580
life playing this dang XXXL challenge

00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:58.890
okay we pulled ourselves out of what of

00:51:56.820 --> 00:52:00.960
what was temporarily like a bit of a

00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:05.810
spooky situation in there but here we

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:12.750
are generating flies bombs are

00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:17.340
relatively irrelevant finally please no

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:20.010
spirit heart but you know the thought

00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:22.740
that counts is every time we we enter a

00:52:20.010 --> 00:52:25.970
room with like four rooms coming off of

00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:30.800
it I'm just like oh good a new floor

00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:30.800
like this could actually go on forever

00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:38.910
I'm begging you for freedom and mercy

00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:42.390
from this challenge why not make an

00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:44.010
xxxxx xxxxx l challenge where every

00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:47.380
floor is twice as large as they are in

00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:49.799
the XXL challenge you know

00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:52.140
as long as we're approaching

00:52:49.799 --> 00:52:54.460
ridiculousness

00:52:52.140 --> 00:53:09.309
might as well take it to its illogical

00:52:54.460 --> 00:53:17.319
conclusion right come on come on finally

00:53:09.309 --> 00:53:20.769
okay it's the final room this could

00:53:17.319 --> 00:53:22.829
still go wrong if it does I really do

00:53:20.769 --> 00:53:27.180
have no one to blame but myself but

00:53:22.829 --> 00:53:29.650
that's probably not going to stop me I

00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:34.990
don't think that even hits mom's heart

00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:37.000
but you got a check he's done it no

00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:37.930
escape this is the ax dude you made it

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.910
you earned it

00:53:37.930 --> 00:53:42.160
get the heck out of there we got gold

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:43.150
