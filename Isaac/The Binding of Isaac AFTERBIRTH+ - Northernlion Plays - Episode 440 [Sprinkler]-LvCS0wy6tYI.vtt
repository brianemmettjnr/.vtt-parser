00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.720
hey everybody welcome back and relay and

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.660
please binding of issac afterwards plus

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.330
we just did an eve run but I can't

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:15.120
resist the temptation to fill out the

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:17.609
evening note so did has oh is our seed

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.830
today I hope you don't mind I hope you

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.880
don't mind now wrote down the words no I

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.970
hope you don't mind the fact that we're

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.789
doing a another Eden run sorry another

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.960
Eve Rijn I should say we also I mean we

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.610
have a good excuse in that we could

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.870
finish things but we also have a good

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.610
excuse in that try like this I think

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.530
don't burn up my invincibility time

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.750
thank you we also have a good excuse in

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.489
that we just got the razor blades so we

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.600
can actually like experience that for

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.129
the first time which is why we probably

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.399
should have picked up that HP instead of

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.410
being an idiot and just ignoring it okay

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.850
fair enough

00:00:51.410 --> 00:01:00.539
you boy if I had a rap name it would be

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.449
like young distracted I'm not

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.739
I don't always diligently pay as much

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.240
attention as I should

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.180
it's not because I'm lost in thought

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.950
thinking about you know TV show or candy

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.250
canes or whatever the heck outs people

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.200
are into these days although I do like

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.759
both artificial mint flavors and I do

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.930
believe that we are in the golden age of

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.500
television right now I mean have you

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.299
seen young Sheldon it's masterful it

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.369
reminds me of a young distracted if I

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.820
might say so myself it's just I don't

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.070
know my brain it tries to run two

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.500
processes at once and usually that just

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.320
means that it's running like 40% of each

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.420
one hopefully it doesn't end up being

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.150
too much of a problem right here so

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.920
greedier it's an easy start for us you

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.180
know what we do well we first off

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.740
celebrate the fact that we have five

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.740
point eight six damage which is pretty

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:56.399
good we also buy a key in between our

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.130
first couple of waves here like our boss

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.939
wave and our final normal mobs and

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.840
that's fine

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.840
we'll do that

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.509
hopefully we get like a rate of fire

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.660
increase cuz that pretty much gives us

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.010
the keys to the kingdom I don't know

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.810
what the keys to the kingdom are by the

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.370
way I say it all the time I know what it

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.410
means I know what it infers the keys to

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.150
the kingdom is like you know you're

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.390
driving the bus if your kingdom was a

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.200
bus you got the keys you can now do it

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.300
originally this was gonna be a joke

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.590
about how by the time you know you need

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.940
the keys most of these buses will

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.849
probably have keyless entry but it

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.709
doesn't really make sense either I don't

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.299
understand being honest with you and I

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.640
when I say this I have a car that has

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.620
keyless entry it also has you don't put

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.350
the keys in to start it I don't

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:48.310
understand how it doesn't just get

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:50.110
stolen cuz like it's kind of like not

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.989
bad Brown nugget here we'll give it a

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.269
try at least see how it works

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.010
Oh actually it's kind of bad because it

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.540
only recharges I thought every time we

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.790
killed a wave it would allow us to spawn

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.760
another one still not necessarily

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:07.209
terrible but in fact it might very well

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.769
be quite good but the way I understand

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.500
that the door is only supposed to unlock

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.959
if it senses the keys are nearby and

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.299
it's only supposed to start if it senses

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.579
the keys are nearby but I wonder like if

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.859
I was in the store you probably couldn't

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.840
just open my car and take it but if I

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:24.700
was like thirty feet from my car and you

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.519
were five feet from my car I don't know

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.109
maybe you could I don't I hope that

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.579
doesn't make me liable like by it by

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.690
coming up with this obvious loophole I

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:35.799
voted the warranty or something but I

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.200
always wonder about that like what I'm

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:41.230
if I'm if I parked on the street and I'm

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.850
walking back to my car I never unlock it

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.060
in advance I always wait till I'm like

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.109
up against the door cuz I'm worried that

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.340
someone could just open the door push

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.780
the start button and drive away and

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.519
maybe eventually it would be like keys

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.350
not detected and it would stop but I

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.109
just prefer to avoid that hassle to

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.920
begin with if you know what I mean I

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.139
think we're gonna go with the razor

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:04.239
blade even though Brown nugget I don't

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:05.760
know it's kind of fun isn't it weird

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.930
deals with the devil right off the bat

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.190
rarely these days do we start with the

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.540
deal with the devil that's like 10 out

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.540
of 10 it seems

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:25.340
I think you roll mr. Dahle it's a

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:27.620
sizable it's a sizable tears upgrade

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.060
sure you can get a lot of value out of

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.940
the razor blade as well and that's not

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.810
even like an exaggeration for the

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.790
slightest degree if we picked up red

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.170
hearts we can use them maintain our

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.450
Whore of Babylon state and maybe get

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.040
like huge damage bonuses but I kind of

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.170
like the idea of trying to make the

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.990
brown nugget work here

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:50.090
maybe it will maybe it won't maybe it'll

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.440
do what I don't say you will save some

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.820
some c'est la vie

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.500
I don't remember the lyrics to c'est la

00:04:52.820 --> 00:05:00.410
vie by bewitched not as well as I'd like

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:01.430
at least bombs please okay I guess I

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.930
should have been more specific

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:07.670
bombs I can use probably not worth it

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:12.470
probably not worth it but may be worth

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:14.180
it so admittedly the run it's making me

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.680
look a little foolish right now but I

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.320
don't mind looking a little foolish in

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.600
fact many would say that that's almost a

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.520
professional obligation of mine to make

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.320
myself look a little foolish on occasion

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.520
and to be honest with you I don't

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.020
disagree with you I still have faith

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:36.740
that by the end of this run we'll be

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:38.120
looking smart although at the present

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.680
moment we're not quite there although

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.190
you know to be honest the rate of fire

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.320
is like pretty good the damage is pretty

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.120
good we do find ourselves in a weird

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.240
spot if we lose Whore of Babylon though

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.100
and that could happen with just like an

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.580
accidental consumable pickup or

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.230
something so be careful I figure you

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.020
know what we should probably also start

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.550
dropping the brown nugget flies like

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.630
closer to dead center so they have a

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:07.430
better chance to hit most enemies but

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:10.640
the thing is the waves should get easier

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.650
as time goes on that's not a good place

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:16.910
for that because of the fact that

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:18.560
there's just more flies around so our

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.750
first couple of waves we're kind of

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.860
fighting them by ourselves but the final

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:26.270
ones should be I'm hoping like 50 50 a

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.660
50/50 split between me and my you know a

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:34.900
low

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:39.980
fly labor here we'll see it's just it

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:42.140
pardon me I don't know what I got hit by

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.750
there maybe it was a bullet that kind of

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:47.230
blended in with my own bullets and as a

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:50.410
result I have no no reason to be upset

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:52.850
okay this is getting a little dicey

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:55.550
there were some blue fires but we need

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:58.550
bombs to make those actually come to

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.410
fruition for us we also just want to

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.030
fight the next wave like immediately I

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.400
think this was a bad plan

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.110
you got a no window the hold of know

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.360
when to fold them know when to walk away

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.980
know when to run I think this is a

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.400
situation in which we should run away

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.330
from me baby run away run away from me

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.050
baby

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:21.050
run away things about to be crazy just a

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:28.340
run away baby I've actually got no plan

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:30.800
run away fast as you can the flies just

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:33.650
are they doing my damage like the tears

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.900
look the same I'm just kind of surprised

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.640
at the it seems like if they were doing

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.830
my damage every shot would be worth like

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.330
or every barrage would be worth like ten

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.910
shots but I'm not sure if that's coming

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:46.640
to fruition here deal with the devil you

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:48.380
gotta go Abaddon if you're going Abaddon

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.230
you got to take one more items so we'll

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:53.120
take seven seals will take Abaddon which

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:56.630
is obviously like a really really nice

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:59.419
damaged item for us sprinklers pretty

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:02.240
good and the person who made the item

00:07:59.419 --> 00:08:04.220
Stewart is means you know followed each

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.730
other on Twitter for a hundred million

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:09.140
years

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:11.120
I'll final take it so I always I always

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:16.190
like to throw some rep there wherever

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:17.960
possible can't get a bomb huh so sure I

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:19.730
think that that could be an okay item

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:23.410
for us obviously champion belt probably

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:23.410
a little bit more Markey but that's okay

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:31.229
I shouldn't take strange attractor but I

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:33.419
don't know what's good for me so we

00:08:31.229 --> 00:08:36.360
might want to you know it's kind of the

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:39.690
same thing with sprinkler that it is

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.849
with brown nugget once we go we want to

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:44.779
keep going so we should get everything

00:08:41.849 --> 00:08:50.430
taken care of first

00:08:44.779 --> 00:08:53.459
yeah I don't know how this is gonna

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:57.120
affect sprinkler or strange attractor

00:08:53.459 --> 00:08:58.080
for that matter but we should give it

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.550
the old college try

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.000
the other thing is you know I respect

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:05.279
sprinkler as an item it might not be the

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.270
most powerful item in the game but it's

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:14.810
extremely unique and as a result I've

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:18.690
got I've got a certain fondness for it a

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:21.779
certain junus a quad a certain issue

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:24.570
sweet engine gar song a certain um

00:09:21.779 --> 00:09:29.160
should food rayon gateau chocolate civil

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:31.950
play 9th grade French class man always

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.860
preparing me for a world in which I want

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:37.709
croissants a world in which I am a young

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:43.200
boy and a world in which I endlessly

00:09:37.709 --> 00:09:45.600
describe apples Lapham a Rouge I don't

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.529
know what bizarro world of France and

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:52.170
Orca Beckett thought I was going to but

00:09:48.529 --> 00:09:54.660
by the way it's a little noisy I have

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:56.790
noticed that I've determined that

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:59.490
there's one big negative with the

00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:03.180
sprinkler strategy and that's that it's

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:05.640
a little on the noisy side it also

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:09.600
appears to have destroyed the brain of

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:12.930
the gates sorry the cage so I am pretty

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:17.820
sure that we are ok here I'm not gonna

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:20.019
use my final uh my final charge I think

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:22.459
we should save it

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:24.529
so the only thing that would really I

00:10:22.459 --> 00:10:26.810
mean first off getting like car battery

00:10:24.529 --> 00:10:27.860
or something would be hilarious but the

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:32.660
only thing that would make this better

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:36.139
is if we got homing tears I'd be willing

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:37.399
to give that a shot we're not flying but

00:10:36.139 --> 00:10:40.069
I kind of just want to go for a max

00:10:37.399 --> 00:10:41.899
damage I think gives us a little HP in

00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:46.160
the process as well all right what do we

00:10:41.899 --> 00:10:47.930
want here we could use the HP to be

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.059
honest with you nine volt would maybe

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:52.279
give us one extra sprinkler per wave so

00:10:50.059 --> 00:10:54.290
I'm willing to give it a shot and then I

00:10:52.279 --> 00:10:57.290
guess maybe we'll buy a key for our next

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:59.569
our next extravaganza this is a cool

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:03.709
greed mode run well it better be greedy

00:10:59.569 --> 00:11:06.439
or I'm gonna be cheesed how can I tell

00:11:03.709 --> 00:11:09.709
if it's greed or greedy er I don't know

00:11:06.439 --> 00:11:12.680
if I can well if it's greed at least

00:11:09.709 --> 00:11:17.209
it's fun and you know that's uh that's

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:19.069
why we're playing Isaac still five cents

00:11:17.209 --> 00:11:22.550
for a key we'll take them up on that

00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:27.680
deal this run is not really about

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:32.000
donations if we can sweets but we don't

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:33.920
have to in order to get value out of it

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.420
do we not have charm tiers on the end on

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.009
the sprinkler itself I kind of thought

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:39.500
it inherited every tear effect maybe

00:11:37.009 --> 00:11:43.250
it's just red overrides it for some

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:44.809
reason yeah we should probably throw our

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.370
sprinklers down closer to the center now

00:11:44.809 --> 00:11:47.420
if we can get the nine volts why we

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:49.790
already have the nine volts sorry if we

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:52.189
can get the triple a battery trinket we

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:56.149
can start rocking like five or six

00:11:52.189 --> 00:11:59.509
sprinklers per wave the one thing that's

00:11:56.149 --> 00:12:03.139
a little scary about this is that we're

00:11:59.509 --> 00:12:05.990
not gonna get a bunch of sprinklers for

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:08.389
the greed fight so we do still need the

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:12.410
like tangentially to our existing run we

00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:14.569
got to make a working a working and

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:16.550
winning run here at some point that

00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:20.440
requires maybe only one sprinkler to pop

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:23.590
I am a moron man

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:25.090
okay drop this down here we just killed

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:28.720
this wave mere moments ago so I'm not

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:33.300
too concerned about this one and there's

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.300
probably scolex is popping up or yeah

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:40.210
you know you don't seem charmed I know

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:41.290
sometimes people say you know charm to

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:43.360
make your acquaintance they're not

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:45.760
really charmed I don't think in the

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.170
sophisticated world people go hey charm

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.680
to meet your acquaintance in and out of

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:52.210
their mouth they shoot three bombs in

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.530
the general direction of the person

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:56.980
they're speaking to it seems just a

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:58.600
little flippant to me quite a brazen

00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:00.100
approach to the overall situation then

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.390
again I don't run in circles where I say

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.790
charm to make your acquaintance very

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:08.470
often I'm very much more of a nice to

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:10.000
meet you guy occasionally I do say

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:12.460
pleased to have met you but only when

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.870
I'm miss speaking and I feel weird about

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.850
it later I go is that a weird thing to

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:17.830
say it's not a normal expression people

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:20.650
say evaluate that conversation in my

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:27.700
head for a few years after the moment of

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:28.870
conception I guess we'd like lump of

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:34.300
coal even though I don't think it even

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:36.390
works here we're not really amassing a

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:39.160
lot of money like every floor word

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:42.190
earning about as much as we're spending

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:47.560
you know we can keep that at maintenance

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:51.310
but it's not gonna win us any major

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:53.350
prizes I think seven cent items so it's

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:57.340
a random item essentially for seven

00:13:53.350 --> 00:14:00.730
cents okay it was pretty not good I

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:02.740
think I'm just gonna leave we don't have

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:04.930
enough bombs to make that happen that

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.640
was extremely lucky and by that I mean

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:09.360
entering the second secret room in case

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.360
it's not abundantly clear

00:14:13.949 --> 00:14:18.759
okay I think this works for us

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:22.199
we don't really need the range up

00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:27.040
obviously you get a fire rate increase

00:14:22.199 --> 00:14:28.689
stronger flies three cents for a spirit

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.600
heart is not a great trade here

00:14:28.689 --> 00:14:32.949
Samson's chain is not take a balloon my

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.169
opinion at least not in this situation

00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:38.319
let's uh we got a key already of course

00:14:35.169 --> 00:14:40.809
let's check this biank we actually like

00:14:38.319 --> 00:14:41.559
actively don't want this but I took it

00:14:40.809 --> 00:14:46.029
regardless

00:14:41.559 --> 00:14:47.679
I guess we'll give it a shot I wasted

00:14:46.029 --> 00:14:50.279
like two charges by not popping the

00:14:47.679 --> 00:14:52.839
sprinkler down before I hit the button a

00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:55.029
bit of a silly decision I'm honestly

00:14:52.839 --> 00:14:56.589
like I'm enjoying the run so far I think

00:14:55.029 --> 00:14:58.689
the sprinkler strat is cool and I don't

00:14:56.589 --> 00:14:59.980
think I've ever had like consistent

00:14:58.689 --> 00:15:02.769
multiple sprinklers probably because

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:05.290
sprinkler came out after I was done with

00:15:02.769 --> 00:15:07.389
green mode just the easiest way to get

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:11.999
many on the same room for items like

00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:14.919
this uh but no spirit all right there

00:15:11.999 --> 00:15:16.360
but I'm a little concerned about the way

00:15:14.919 --> 00:15:19.689
that we kind of like to hit our victory

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:26.189
condition because we do have to kill a

00:15:19.689 --> 00:15:28.540
boss who's pretty freakin annoying and

00:15:26.189 --> 00:15:31.989
as much as I would like to have an

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:34.119
intersecting grid of turrets with

00:15:31.989 --> 00:15:35.610
frickin laser beams on their heads I

00:15:34.119 --> 00:15:41.350
don't think we're gonna get there

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:43.779
necessarily it's the first time like

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:45.399
none of that is worth it I think alright

00:15:43.779 --> 00:15:47.980
so right thirty-five cents just give me

00:15:45.399 --> 00:15:50.110
some bombs please so I can actually use

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:53.169
the reroll machine without spending all

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:56.410
my money on me and spending time on me

00:15:53.169 --> 00:15:58.749
I'll take PFF remember I'm in it to win

00:15:56.410 --> 00:16:00.489
it literally I'm in this to get the win

00:15:58.749 --> 00:16:06.970
I'm not even worried about donations

00:16:00.489 --> 00:16:08.630
I just wanted synthol we can make this

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:11.240
happen we can make this happen

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:14.750
so I was hoping for poop or fires my

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:16.430
favorite game show Cooper fire we're not

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:19.819
gonna make it happen are we I got a I

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:21.649
gotta embrace the fact that we am making

00:16:19.819 --> 00:16:23.240
this happen what I am gonna do is play

00:16:21.649 --> 00:16:27.110
the shot of the slot machine four times

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:33.050
and maybe we can win the dollar we got a

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:36.440
key that's worth like 5 cents come on

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:39.380
I'm gonna stay at 10 cents that's a

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:42.579
wicked bummer man because I love synth

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:45.350
well as an item you know that it's true

00:16:42.579 --> 00:16:48.100
we're on the shop already oh no this is

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:53.149
uh it turns out we didn't need the key I

00:16:48.100 --> 00:17:00.980
am a scared boy how do we finish this so

00:16:53.149 --> 00:17:06.319
quickly come on well I'm gonna gonna try

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:09.980
a little frightened to be honest with

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:17.390
you don't really love my my chances here

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:18.770
I think it also like finish this run way

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:21.589
faster than I expected

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:24.049
which is actually a testament to the

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:25.549
quality of our sprinkler strap and the

00:17:24.049 --> 00:17:28.880
fact that we have essentially piercing

00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:30.320
shots but those like really really

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:34.340
expedite the process of getting through

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:37.039
a room being said though it's really

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:41.960
like sprinkler Strad is why we're able

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:43.789
to get through this as quickly as we are

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:48.549
cuz we're crushing the waves but I'm

00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:51.200
very much concerned with the idea that

00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:52.760
life is gonna be pain for us when we get

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:56.270
down to the next floor our HP is not

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:59.240
killing it either well here's a question

00:17:56.270 --> 00:18:00.740
for you do we have blue baby I mean

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.970
obviously we've never beaten greedy or

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:04.669
with blue baby we've only done like two

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:06.230
greedier runs to begin with so that was

00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:08.409
the last sprinkler I feel comfortable

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:08.409
using

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:15.830
that's the last frickin sprinkler the

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:20.990
next chart should be for save and you

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:24.260
can use it on ultra green make the boss

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:27.230
fight y'all safe-haven don't be slow no

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:29.200
no no no okay it's a weird parody listen

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:38.210
there is an attempt an attempt was made

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:40.190
something great please sure let's try it

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:47.410
I actually don't care about donating

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:47.410
anything I think we go for broke on this

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:53.420
okay that was good we got two birds

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:54.980
stoned at once I don't think I want we

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:58.070
have three scents to play around with in

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:59.660
my mind right now we have no sense to

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:02.420
play around with in my mind right now

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:12.290
okay okay we're gonna try experimental

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:14.360
treatment wasn't worth much amen there's

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:17.990
nothing to buy like the best thing to

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:21.650
buy is the coin purse maybe we can get

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:23.780
some stats out of it sure I mean that

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:25.220
actually did nothing for us I'm drowsy

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:30.440
would have been good for the final boss

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:33.200
fight but well here we go I don't love

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:35.660
our odds here but we'll see I mean the

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:39.380
the stats are good our HP is garbage but

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:43.030
the stats are good speaking of which

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:45.560
ended up being like a really really good

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:47.030
death card way better than I would have

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:50.480
expected to have a chance to take

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:55.150
advantage up here but I'm gambling on a

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.150
a greed mode loss here I think

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:04.559
we can obviously stay pretty far away

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:06.090
you know Whittle them down there and the

00:20:04.559 --> 00:20:08.460
crowd-control shouldn't be much of a big

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:10.830
deal but to be real with you I don't

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:12.360
really love my odds of I don't really

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:14.250
have a lot of confidence in my ability

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.899
to dodge the attacks from ultra green

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:18.809
because it's just been a hundred years

00:20:15.899 --> 00:20:22.980
since I fought it I well regularly at

00:20:18.809 --> 00:20:24.570
least I think we almost have to beat

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.340
greed without getting hit and we already

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:31.860
got hit once I'm not giving up by the

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:35.270
way still going at it here it's not

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:35.270
quite sure if we get if we got the tools

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:43.320
don't really mind the keys even if they

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:45.720
get away again we got good crowd control

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:47.610
the little Harbinger is doing good work

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:49.380
for us as well or you know the seal or

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:50.820
whatever the heck it's called sin Victor

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:55.470
came up with the name little Harbinger

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:57.960
and I'm I'm for it not just cuz I got

00:20:55.470 --> 00:21:02.279
you know I got to support my boi of

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:06.450
course just liked it more as a name and

00:21:02.279 --> 00:21:08.580
it could be a good item the worse your

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:13.200
run is the better that item is it's

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:15.149
probably my my honest assessment I'd say

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.350
if we get through this without getting

00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:21.450
hit one more time

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:24.390
we got an okay chance obviously I'd love

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:26.279
to it's very stupid to stand there we

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:28.500
got lucky though obviously I'd love to

00:21:26.279 --> 00:21:33.379
pick up another spirit heart somehow I

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:36.379
don't think it's plausible that was

00:21:33.379 --> 00:21:36.379
maybe

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:48.160
we're gonna have to HP left I got to

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:50.260
remember how does the onk work obviously

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.610
it responds you miss blue baby does it

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:54.250
respond you in the same room or do you

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:58.690
fall back one room I think you fall back

00:21:54.250 --> 00:22:02.910
one room which is bad for us but you

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:02.910
know don't don't write yourself off yet

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:10.210
it's only in your head to feel left out

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:12.610
or look down on just try your best try

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:14.740
everything you can and don't you worry

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:18.640
what those bitter hearts are gonna say

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:20.610
it just takes some time little girl

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:23.280
you're in the middle of the ride

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:28.500
everything everything will be just fine

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:31.990
everything everything will be alright

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:39.240
should not have stood there we are done

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:44.230
aren't we no well it's a learning lesson

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:46.390
we're still gonna try but I don't give

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:48.160
myself great odds unfortunately did we

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:52.630
get any stat bonuses for being blue baby

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:56.340
I mean I'm assuming no and the answer is

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:57.990
no how do we actually win this one

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.610
we probably should have selected better

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:01.980
items synthol i don't think would have

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:04.740
done it by itself but you know it could

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:06.240
have contributed to us getting oh Jesus

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:09.450
it could have contributed to us doing a

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:12.630
little better I am actually getting

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:15.180
stomped on like quite literally his feet

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:19.830
are stompin on me keep in mind I'm

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:22.650
