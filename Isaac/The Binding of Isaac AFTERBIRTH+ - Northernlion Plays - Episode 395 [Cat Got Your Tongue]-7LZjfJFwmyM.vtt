00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.560
hey everybody we're back with challenges

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.370
I lost the suicide King challenge last

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.920
time because I am an idiot but this is

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.190
cat got your tongue we're gulp stir but

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.500
we can only attack via flies and Guppies

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.090
hairball don't forget about Guppies

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:25.710
hairball how in the world can we lose

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.019
this I'm not even it's a pack yeah we

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.039
got it I'm not even trying to be like

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.790
overly cocky

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.579
I actually am just a little confused

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.460
about the conceivable ways that this run

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.670
could end in a loss I guess one is early

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.450
we fight bosses who are too tough to die

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.950
to like six uh flies we got pretty lucky

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.360
that that actually worked for us even

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.980
though it turned out to be garbage and

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.629
then we have to use Guppies hairball to

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.300
deal damage and you know life's in a

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.870
terrible spot there I suppose

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.440
yeah like like right now for example

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.170
okay never mind

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.440
I completely understand how we can die

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.440
now

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.689
he got melted we're extremely lucky I

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.840
actually thought that might be the end

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.820
of our run I've never had like a I've

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.189
gone from zero to 60 and 60 to zero in

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.570
record time we I was like how can I lose

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.670
and then I was like oh wait there's

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.460
literally no way for us to win but there

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:30.540
is a way for us to win we just have to

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:33.360
spin around really fast and use Guppies

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.200
hair ball to land some shots this is our

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.090
moment

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.040
oh look at that it works it works okay

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.920
so we need to make very good use of our

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.899
flies ideally if we could also get any

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.200
other orbitals I'd be extremely happy

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.040
and this is like a bit of a big ask to

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.159
be honest but if we could somehow get

00:01:52.040 --> 00:02:00.240
other orbitals I'd be real stoked if we

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.890
get sach dagger we win and in my opinion

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.570
at least I also said that there's no way

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.200
we can lose our last run and then I lost

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.360
now I did take arguably maybe like one

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.220
of the top 5 worst items to have with my

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.870
reflection and ipecac I mean my

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.519
reflection is already one of the top

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.620
like three worse items to have with a

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.500
macaque to begin with and then you know

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.409
to add in a little Loki's horn action

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.940
might have been a little overkill but

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:25.650
dude it's my favorite men at work songs

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.090
so I'm going to try to pay tribute to it

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.430
whenever possible let's go all dude

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.590
first off I'm getting a cramp in my hand

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.879
because this is the most exercise I've

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:42.360
gotten in well honestly years but I'm

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:44.940
also getting into a sick and that's sick

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.790
with two seeds and no K's flipping

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.440
rhythm here look at this it's like I've

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.060
you know walk without rhythm and you

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.150
can't attract the worm you know what I

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.760
mean black powder is actually like a ten

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.349
out of ten get for us so I'm going to

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.480
continue to explore here we only have to

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.930
go to mom's heart this is like the

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.599
easiest game of our lives right now I

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.090
actually hate you I don't want you to

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.400
drop HP I want you to drop a key you did

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.959
not drop a key why do I want a key well

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.420
we have twenty-nine cents but we can't

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.650
go to the flip and shop what am I

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.919
supposed to do with twenty-nine cents

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.840
but no shot with which to deposit my my

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:23.010
money into I mean not even deposit

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.549
because that implies the donation

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:31.319
machine you know to look good to use

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:33.569
other things that would be sick trying

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:39.290
to think do we get um you know that was

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:44.129
so bad if we use whoa

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:46.199
blackmarket please if we use flies to

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:49.019
kill enemies and we have infestation to

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:51.840
do we get spiders out of our enemies

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.750
that have died I'm going to guess that

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.430
the answer is yes I know if the spider

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.280
kills an enemy you don't get them but

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.220
why wouldn't a fly give you the spider

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.060
vermin best day I hate dude it's not

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.200
fair

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:16.120
thank you I don't see why not I guess oh

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:17.410
we got a real orbital it's I mean I

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.760
don't need to tell you that this is

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.380
harder than it looks because most of you

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.360
out there have probably gotten real

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.750
platinum God for yourselves this is a

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.280
tricky challenge right here starting

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.200
with guppy is obviously like

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.290
outrageously good I should probably be

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.930
using black powder a little bit more

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.600
than I am but I'm also scared but now

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.880
that we have orbitals dude I'm not

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.890
saying I'm the cop who can't be soft but

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:48.700
I am pretty jazzed about this whole

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:50.140
situation oh mylanta I also wouldn't

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.419
mind you know what would actually be

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:57.130
swell right now and I say swell now

00:04:52.419 --> 00:05:00.790
because I'm I was born in the 1950s what

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:04.210
would be sweet would be if we could get

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:06.639
a what's the is it toilet paper that

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.890
causes your your orbitals not to rotate

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:13.030
anymore that would actually be like a 10

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:17.880
out of 10 way to make this run pop like

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.880
a like dr. pimple popper all we need

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:26.419
is that exact trinket and nothing else

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.000
nothing no nothing compares to number

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.520
two dude have you ever watched those dr.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.590
pimple popper videos I know that

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.030
everyone goes like ooh gross and it is

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.210
gross because you're watching a doctor

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:40.340
like excites blackheads that have

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.680
existed in a person's nose for like 20

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.600
years it's gross but I think it also

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.169
speaks to there's like there's some

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.790
Universal objective truth in dr. pimple

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:51.610
popper videos the reason they're

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:57.320
entertaining is because we're like

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:59.030
hardwired to want to resolve tension so

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.210
you see this blackhead and you're like

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.340
that blackheads gotta get taken care of

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.960
you know that sebaceous cyst has got to

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:09.370
be removed and then it gets removed and

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.750
you go ooh but you leave the video

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.210
knowing that the world is a better place

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:17.530
because of the fact that that cyst no

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:20.960
longer exists that was really lucky

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:24.169
we're taking so much damage here to be

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:27.050
fair fighting a lot of enemies who

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:29.900
explode makes it very difficult for me

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:34.250
to sneak in there I'd rather take damage

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.900
at this point I can't believe we got out

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:40.490
of it but I'd rather take damage at this

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:43.940
point then then use my bomb the bomb

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:46.160
could be 10 times more precious I really

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.800
think that you know in in fiction

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.229
there's like 12 different or four by 12

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.150
I mean four apparently different styles

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:54.680
of conflict man versus man man versus

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.000
some self man versus nature I always

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.240
forget the other one man versus the

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.360
unknown or something man versus game of

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.610
course I shouldn't spend so much money

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:07.550
but I'm gonna because I want that spirit

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.940
heart that's like man versus nature

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.410
right there

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.840
because we've all been in that situation

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.820
you know the problems tomorrow and I got

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.210
a zit and then to watch dr. pimple

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:20.950
popper excites that evil from a person's

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:24.850
body it's just a lovely experience I

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:28.060
would recommend it I don't I don't spend

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:30.550
my nights watching popping videos but I

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.860
understand their their intrinsic value

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.780
to society so I'm being real dicey here

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:38.260
memories being real dicey for two

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:42.040
reasons one is I want the blood bag and

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:44.260
I want it like a lot because the speed

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.840
allows us to use black powder more

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:49.960
efficiently 1.3 speed is not quite black

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:52.210
powder level like happy to be using it I

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.880
guess is what I'm trying to suggest it's

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:57.480
doable we can make some tiny circles

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.800
with black powder but you know we're not

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:03.600
nobody's getting rich off black powder

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.600
here is what I'm trying to suggest Oh

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:15.370
dude be careful the other reason is

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:18.280
because the money is still useful for us

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:22.630
when we go to the shop oh we've done it

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:24.430
we very very mildly done it I think when

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.680
Guppies hair ball hits enemies it

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:29.320
generates flies you know I'd let have

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:31.979
loved going through the game again

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:38.680
because I'm learning new stuff like that

00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:41.110
all the time I had no idea that Guppies

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:44.520
hair ball had any chance to generate

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:46.960
flies please just die I mean like oh you

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:49.300
why why would you do me like that

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.100
haven't you heard the Tom Petty song the

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.670
Tom Petty song goes don't do me like

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.790
that

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:56.530
you've done me like that pheromones it

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:59.620
might surprise you but I'm still not

00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:02.680
that perturbed by this situation maybe I

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:08.740
should be definitely it should be but

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:10.660
like I'm I'm not that scared dude for

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:14.790
reasons that should become abundantly

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.790
clear you're about to pay out right

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.860
all right maybe stay on 3hp for now

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:24.440
you've learned your lesson to some

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:27.370
extent probably lucky to be alive but

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:31.070
challenges kind of absolve you of

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:33.020
mistakes in some way because like of

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:36.260
course you're going to take damage we're

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:38.029
using a Guppies hairball to hit like

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.890
every enemy on the map now what we

00:09:38.029 --> 00:09:41.570
probably actually want to do instead and

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:44.120
we were so excited to get orbitals why

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:46.520
did I ever stray from this but what we

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.470
should probably do is just use all of

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:51.980
bandages to do like some hit and runs

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:53.750
here we do have old bandage as well

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:57.970
which I didn't comment on but it's

00:09:53.750 --> 00:10:04.610
actually a really good pick up for us as

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:08.899
a result of its ability come on as a

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:11.510
result of its ability to keep us in the

00:10:08.899 --> 00:10:17.740
game after we take some silly damage

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:19.940
which happens fairly regularly my lord I

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:22.730
mean we do want to check it and we don't

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:25.150
want to check it it's a constant you

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:28.150
know duality of our existence here oh

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:28.150
dude

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:32.779
only when you start doing this run do

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:36.530
you realize how many enemies in this

00:10:32.779 --> 00:10:38.770
game want to explode and ruin your life

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:41.330
[Music]

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:43.490
we got to be very carefully again I know

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:46.670
this is probably like the ideal room to

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:48.830
use bombs on I'm choosing to avoid doing

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:50.660
that because our bombs could be precious

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:53.450
later is that a misallocation of

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:57.290
resources I don't know as the freaking

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:59.150
Treasury Department I have no idea I'm

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:05.290
just I'm just the on-air personality

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:05.290
here okay that was really really good

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.279
now I haven't touched on it much because

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:11.410
I've been looking for more cutesy or

00:11:09.279 --> 00:11:15.459
glamour is kind of like finishes here

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:18.399
but being one of the best things that we

00:11:15.459 --> 00:11:22.620
could actually get is just more damage

00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:27.490
which is I'm very excited to be using

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:29.079
this is a terrible fight from the

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:32.550
perspective of not wanting to take any

00:11:29.079 --> 00:11:32.550
damage they'll just leave it at that

00:11:33.089 --> 00:11:38.310
thank you old old bandage you've done it

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.959
he's done it it was so worth taking

00:11:41.709 --> 00:11:45.639
damage just to finish that off and we've

00:11:43.959 --> 00:11:47.620
done it we got some HP we gotta go to

00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:49.240
our shop here but yeah more damage is

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.310
just really good for me because it means

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.170
our flies have the chance to kill

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:54.699
enemies before they kill us before the

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.060
enemies kill us not our own flies that

00:11:54.699 --> 00:12:01.959
would be betrayal of the highest order

00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:07.259
let's go now again our bombs are pretty

00:12:01.959 --> 00:12:13.569
precious so for me to use two of them I

00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:18.670
got very lucky I got very lucky that

00:12:13.569 --> 00:12:20.649
they were they pay dividends I guess is

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:22.120
what I'm trying to say and I'm also

00:12:20.649 --> 00:12:23.889
going to continue to be a little bit of

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:26.949
an idiot we did get a speed upgrade by a

00:12:23.889 --> 00:12:29.620
magic mush but like why not go a little

00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:33.310
bit deeper here already missed use one

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:35.050
of these hearts but go down a one not

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:39.370
even one and a half just go down to one

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:42.339
then we played these guys like ugh am I

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:48.360
trying to say here a blood bag would

00:12:42.339 --> 00:12:48.360
still be really nice IV bag not so much

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:54.459
[Music]

00:12:52.339 --> 00:12:59.600
I guess the other thing that we can do

00:12:54.459 --> 00:13:01.939
is try to stand okay try to stand in

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.639
front of enemies and let Guppies

00:13:01.939 --> 00:13:10.480
hairball tear them up and try to use

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:10.480
that to generate more uh more flies I

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:15.470
don't know either way we only came down

00:13:14.149 --> 00:13:17.629
here as we wanted to go to the shop and

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:19.819
mission accomplished the shop does not

00:13:17.629 --> 00:13:21.769
have greed as the two of hearts which

00:13:19.819 --> 00:13:23.660
could save our run moving box which I

00:13:21.769 --> 00:13:25.939
think is basically garbage for us in

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:27.589
this unique situation and we'll use a

00:13:25.939 --> 00:13:30.680
bomb to get into our secret room which

00:13:27.589 --> 00:13:34.610
is going to contain possibly some

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:36.230
trinkets spirit hearts etc etc depending

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:38.329
on how we play our cards right do it

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:39.920
honestly do it's the trick if we ask for

00:13:38.329 --> 00:13:41.600
it no way yeah it is

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:46.610
I got it wrong it's not roll of toilet

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:48.620
paper it's duct tape but still I thought

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:52.999
that said get dusted it said go outside

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:56.449
so we have actually a fairly easy wind

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:57.259
right now and it comes down to the

00:13:56.449 --> 00:13:58.100
simplest thing you could possibly

00:13:57.259 --> 00:14:01.429
imagine

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:03.350
not The Sun Also good but we basically

00:14:01.429 --> 00:14:04.429
are just going to use the emperor card

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:09.949
and this is looking like it could be a

00:14:04.429 --> 00:14:11.839
to challenge video the rare to challenge

00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:14.029
gets walk right into that the rare to

00:14:11.839 --> 00:14:16.850
challenge video so what's the game plan

00:14:14.029 --> 00:14:18.259
it's actually so simple even a child

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:19.779
could understand it which is good

00:14:18.259 --> 00:14:23.420
because I'm going to have to explain it

00:14:19.779 --> 00:14:25.939
we're going to beat this floor ideally

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:28.189
and then we are going to use the emperor

00:14:25.939 --> 00:14:31.100
card and we are going to basically walk

00:14:28.189 --> 00:14:35.209
into mom's heart on mom until she dies

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:39.550
and then we have won the run so that's

00:14:35.209 --> 00:14:41.720
the idea at least potentials I'm

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:43.429
pitching this like it's a Kickstarter or

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:45.559
something but puts potential concerns

00:14:43.429 --> 00:14:47.480
well we don't have a ton of HP so if

00:14:45.559 --> 00:14:50.529
things start to go wrong they can go

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.529
wrong pretty quickly

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.960
I remain not fully convinced about

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.970
duct-tapes

00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:00.510
despite asking for it specifically by

00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:03.360
the wrong name I think it is easier to

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:05.520
hit enemies with duct tape but it also

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:11.190
requires an adjustment to previous

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:12.330
strategy but I think the cat got your

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.920
tongue challenge is going to go down

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:18.480
here and this is one of the harder ones

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:21.500
so I'm I wouldn't say overjoyed with my

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:23.820
performance but I'm feeling fairly good

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:26.670
ok just let the Flies take these guys

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:28.650
out we want to be at full HP by the time

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:30.570
we leave this floor so just I mean

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:33.720
that'll basically do it I will use a

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:36.000
bomb here I will use a bomb here please

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:39.450
would okay that's really good we're

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:45.200
going to almost certainly oh my god be

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:48.000
completely fine war fight just dust him

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:51.120
we got WAY longer invincibility than I

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.160
would have expected now this is black

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:55.230
powders time to show what he did like

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:58.230
evasive maneuvers I've never seen that

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:59.910
he stood still it was the greatest bait

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:01.740
the world has ever pulled so we got a

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:03.480
second level bandage girl she will

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:06.270
actually shoot but it's mostly

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.560
irrelevant because I know what I'm doing

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:09.090
on this run at this point we're just

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:12.600
getting the heck out of here and it's

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:14.670
going to be one more thing on lock is it

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:17.390
a guppy item you get a guppy item for

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:17.390
cat got your tongue

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:28.570
look at that the damage is real

00:16:32.769 --> 00:16:35.899
well the foots coming down yeah yeah we

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:39.230
did it

00:16:35.899 --> 00:16:41.510
okay now love jeopardize it by possibly

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:44.029
doing boss rush grab this check it out

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:46.970
boss rush when we got nothing Val value

00:16:44.029 --> 00:16:48.260
nothing the value sorry you say that's

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:55.010
the end of the cat got your tongue

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:56.089
challenge Oh algae's quality ruined all

00:16:55.010 --> 00:17:02.329
right so that was easy

00:16:56.089 --> 00:17:07.819
Demoman so that's what dr. fetus remote

00:17:02.329 --> 00:17:09.860
detonator seems easy enough if the

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:11.510
challenges are really fun not all of

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:13.610
them are ten out of ten but now that I'm

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:16.010
like mainlining them it's good to

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:17.870
remember most of these challenges were

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:21.679
worth doing at least one some of them

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:23.240
like what's like computer whiz or

00:17:21.679 --> 00:17:29.120
whatever tech savvy is that what it's

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:35.120
called it's like a little too easy but

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:37.669
still apologies mostly they're just like

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:39.380
a challenge run is basically like a cool

00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:41.210
eden scene for most of these like

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:43.250
starting with dr. fetus and remote

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:46.360
detonators that's essentially being Eden

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:49.160
and getting some cool combos here so I

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.870
wouldn't say I'm the happiest camper you

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.179
know I'm just because I feel like we're

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:57.050
not guaranteed to win here but no we're

00:17:53.179 --> 00:17:59.870
in a good spot proms are key mostly

00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:01.370
irrelevant actually like beyond

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:03.500
irrelevant cuz we don't need any bombs

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:04.730
we also probably don't eat any keys

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:07.370
because of the fact that there's no

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:10.309
shops or sighs there's nothing but shops

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:12.710
so in all likelihood you know we might

00:18:10.309 --> 00:18:14.090
end up using three or four keys for

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:17.240
shops and then the rest are just like

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:18.800
golden chests if they exist we need the

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:21.890
money though why not

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:24.620
we need the money stiva

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:26.330
poverty they say is the song that you

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:30.140
sing when you're trying to evoke images

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:32.809
of the 1920s that end camptown races

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:33.919
sing this song that I was so happy when

00:18:32.809 --> 00:18:35.149
people tweeted me and they were like

00:18:33.919 --> 00:18:38.229
there are comment

00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:40.940
on camptown races on YouTube that are

00:18:38.229 --> 00:18:43.249
like oh I was born in the wrong era they

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:45.109
don't make music like this anymore you

00:18:43.249 --> 00:18:45.589
go back to like Gregorian chants I'm

00:18:45.109 --> 00:18:47.899
sure

00:18:45.589 --> 00:18:50.389
not that there's recordings of like real

00:18:47.899 --> 00:18:56.149
era specific Gregorian chants we get the

00:18:50.389 --> 00:18:59.119
idea you get the idea okay double key

00:18:56.149 --> 00:19:00.589
rooms Stephen it's like a high-quality

00:18:59.119 --> 00:19:04.700
item room thank you very much for your

00:19:00.589 --> 00:19:05.960
service there I don't think I like let's

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.119
perform the live there's going to be a

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:11.539
pop quiz hotshot Dennis Hopper in speed

00:19:08.119 --> 00:19:12.259
style okay what are the ideal items for

00:19:11.539 --> 00:19:14.960
us right now

00:19:12.259 --> 00:19:18.080
that are specific to this challenge the

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:20.029
answer is every single bombs energy I

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:22.929
would love to come across every bomb

00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:26.239
synergy that's ever existed

00:19:22.929 --> 00:19:29.469
now hilariously the one I don't want is

00:19:26.239 --> 00:19:33.469
the one that's here that's bogo bombs

00:19:29.469 --> 00:19:35.149
it's actually not bad because it would

00:19:33.469 --> 00:19:37.849
allow us to get some use out of remote

00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:40.879
detonator it's just not necessary in the

00:19:37.849 --> 00:19:44.239
least and and probably not worth paying

00:19:40.879 --> 00:19:45.679
for the odds of us wanting to put our

00:19:44.239 --> 00:19:47.269
own bombs down on the ground or pretty

00:19:45.679 --> 00:19:48.469
low let's see if there's any deal with

00:19:47.269 --> 00:19:51.229
the devil synergies that work here

00:19:48.469 --> 00:19:55.070
you've got to go dark deuce is the rule

00:19:51.229 --> 00:19:57.320
I don't make the rules that's a lie I'm

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:59.450
basically the person in charge of making

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:01.539
the rules because I record these alone

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:03.799
in my office away from the cold

00:20:01.539 --> 00:20:05.839
realities of planet Earth so I can

00:20:03.799 --> 00:20:09.320
pretty much come up with ever whatever

00:20:05.839 --> 00:20:14.450
arbitrary rules said I'd like to the

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:16.279
virus I hate it stop is can someone

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:17.659
insert hand clamp emojis in between

00:20:16.279 --> 00:20:20.330
every words that I'm saying here I want

00:20:17.659 --> 00:20:24.019
the correct kind of emphasis stop giving

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:25.909
good items speed down graves say it

00:20:24.019 --> 00:20:28.549
louder for the people in the back that's

00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:31.599
right I'm on Twitter I understand the

00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:34.039
way that people say messages on Twitter

00:20:31.599 --> 00:20:37.779
you say once more for the people in the

00:20:34.039 --> 00:20:37.779
back you use the Handclap emojis

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:45.390
we have like four rooms so there you go

00:20:42.799 --> 00:20:47.399
Yara this is like probably one of the

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:50.279
first 10 rooms I've gotten on this

00:20:47.399 --> 00:20:52.679
savefile that's exciting news until they

00:20:50.279 --> 00:20:56.730
have 15 cents I'm not going to feel much

00:20:52.679 --> 00:21:00.090
of a compulsion honestly to to slow down

00:20:56.730 --> 00:21:01.380
like milk every little bit of the value

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:04.409
we can get out of this go to the shop

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:07.110
etc etc I apologize it shouldn't seem

00:21:04.409 --> 00:21:09.539
like I'm just trying to steamroll these

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:11.490
rhymes the fact of the matter is most of

00:21:09.539 --> 00:21:13.909
these runs start a little stronger than

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:16.980
average albeit a little weirder as well

00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:20.340
but they also don't go as far as the

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:23.039
average run so if it seems like they're

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:24.990
going quickly I don't necessarily

00:21:23.039 --> 00:21:27.809
disagree that sort of trying to fit in

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:29.070
to per episode whenever plausible all

00:21:27.809 --> 00:21:30.419
right we're I'm flooded caves through

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:39.149
this one goes to Mom's heart so it's a

00:21:30.419 --> 00:21:41.130
one of the slightly longer ones and it's

00:21:39.149 --> 00:21:43.370
looking good the fact that we can come

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:45.779
back with with dark Judas is a big

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:48.149
benefit for us we have a haggle eyes

00:21:45.779 --> 00:21:51.480
room which is actually like straight-up

00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:54.179
garbage when we have unlimited bombs

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:56.429
there's not much purpose for a haggle

00:21:54.179 --> 00:21:58.139
Aza room but it does give me the

00:21:56.429 --> 00:21:59.549
opportunity to bring back a meme that's

00:21:58.139 --> 00:22:06.870
been dead for like 10 years

00:21:59.549 --> 00:22:08.100
good news Huggle of rooms still old not

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:10.830
hope one day I'm going to wake up and

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:12.600
just be able to sing hasn't happened yet

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:14.639
every once in a while I get one note and

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:21.600
that's a that's a miracle in and of

00:22:14.639 --> 00:22:23.789
itself cool I like these odds look at

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.980
that I don't actually know what dear

00:22:23.789 --> 00:22:27.750
science the fourth album from New York

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:29.039
city-based collective TV on the radio

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:30.700
does for us and the whole scheme of

00:22:29.039 --> 00:22:33.230
things but I'm going to take it

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:37.490
wait with bombs I should say I don't

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:40.940
know what it does HP nope I think it's

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:42.559
like a myth of chessboxing that blowing

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:44.270
up blood banks is more likely to give

00:22:42.559 --> 00:22:46.280
you HP than blowing up like a slot

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:46.910
machine for example but I hold out hope

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.590
anyway

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:53.000
it is in keeping with the theme of the

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:56.690
item now can we find a shop I've been

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.429
ignoring shops like this whole time just

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:59.780
like I've been ignoring schnapps for my

00:22:58.429 --> 00:23:00.410
whole life it's just on there it is

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.299
right there

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:03.860
we just don't consume that much schnapps

00:23:02.299 --> 00:23:08.660
in North America it's a very European

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:18.320
drink we're more of a jenkem crowd up

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:19.880
here now just keep moving right up and

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.780
on the internet for a while I know what

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:25.490
Gingka

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:26.840
can't get won by me so the real value of

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:29.750
the virus is something I haven't even

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:32.240
touched on like at all yet and that's

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:34.910
the ability to get demon hearts out of

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:39.200
it but I'd rather just never take damage

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:43.460
if possible obviously that's a little

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:45.650
bit of wishful thinking but I don't

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:47.390
trust the virus to pay out as much as

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:50.059
we're liable to take damage dude I

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:51.980
actually lost my mind there yet I've

00:23:50.059 --> 00:23:55.580
messed up the gurdy dodges I fought

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:57.500
dirty probably like closing in on 1,500

00:23:55.580 --> 00:24:00.830
times and take any damage against Gerty

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:02.450
makes me a very sad man makes me

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:03.890
question what I've done with my life but

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:05.210
then you know as soon as you go to the

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:09.679
next floor those questions will be

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:11.510
washed away and I'll move along here so

00:24:09.679 --> 00:24:14.450
we're roughly at this point halfway

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:16.760
through this run this is that there's

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:18.200
only some challenges I remember this

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.700
distant from having done them the first

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.410
time this is not one of them I'll just

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:25.010
level with you and it's because it's

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:27.260
very much on the easier side so now that

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:29.330
we got the yarrow room we can well I was

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:31.630
pretty bad we could remember some Gareth

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.630
straps

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:43.010
what are good Yarra stress it's a great

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:44.539
question you see what I'm trying to do

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:47.470
with the virus here I would never

00:24:44.539 --> 00:24:51.789
recommend this in a million years

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:51.789
unless you're as stupid as I am

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.880
you're a stretch I mean usually you wait

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.289
to use the air until the chest which we

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:05.059
are not going to old that was my bet

00:25:03.289 --> 00:25:06.909
which we're not going to achieve on this

00:25:05.059 --> 00:25:09.080
run the bid just will not exist for us

00:25:06.909 --> 00:25:10.520
that's a bummer because I thought I was

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:20.360
a genius for what I was doing there

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:22.850
turns out I'm actually a fool you just

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:29.899
fart right off mr. doing it's a double

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:32.029
tinted rock let's go okay in another

00:25:29.899 --> 00:25:33.620
universe that gave me like four demon

00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:35.029
hearts what I did with that temperance

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:39.110
card but you know what that universe

00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:41.059
also never got a second season of

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:42.440
Arrested Development so let's just be

00:25:41.059 --> 00:25:45.399
happy in the universe that we live in

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:48.710
it's surprisingly uncool of some of them

00:25:45.399 --> 00:25:51.590
to bombs I don't at this point what do I

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:52.730
care about bombs we don't have we don't

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:56.779
need two bombs because we have unlimited

00:25:52.730 --> 00:26:03.190
bombs bombs burgers great show never

00:25:56.779 --> 00:26:06.740
seen a full episode lock upgrade another

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:08.059
tinted another spirit heart that's not

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:10.250
going to be a secret room I'll probably

00:26:08.059 --> 00:26:14.059
just pay to like I'll pay my HP to go to

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:18.649
the room relatively unconcerned about

00:26:14.059 --> 00:26:20.000
the cost of living there especially

00:26:18.649 --> 00:26:22.730
because we have dark dude it's just like

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.320
waiting in the wings that time I cared

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:25.850
because it's for bombs I'm not sure if

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.830
you know this but for bombs is twice as

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:30.409
many as two bombs and as a result I

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:32.510
think it was a very shrewd move for us

00:26:30.409 --> 00:26:34.429
that time to pick up those plus it has

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:36.260
absolutely nothing to do with the fact

00:26:34.429 --> 00:26:38.539
that those were on the way to the exit I

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:44.020
assure you that's a that is a slanderous

00:26:38.539 --> 00:26:44.020
lie my laziness knows no bounds

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:49.750
get thousand and then you find me the

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:51.490
secret room and then you find me the

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:54.090
secret room and then you don't find me

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:54.090
the secret room

00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:03.520
we got a demon heart out of a skull I

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:04.960
don't know why I kind of backed myself

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:06.880
into a corner there because I was like

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.230
we got a demon art out of a skull and

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.570
then in my head I was like yeah that's

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:13.179
what they can drop so like it's not

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:16.929
really that big of a deal is it not not

00:27:13.179 --> 00:27:21.160
that unusual anyway the guys great rune

00:27:16.929 --> 00:27:29.500
Joker to a hearts and basically the

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:38.140
irrelevant but ghost baby you want a

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:39.730
mediocre item here is ghost babe you can

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:42.460
get it from the deal with devil if you

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:48.910
don't fight him if I end in this case is

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:54.670
a Krampus it is ghost babe negligible

00:27:48.910 --> 00:28:00.610
damage gives no advantage ghost baby

00:27:54.670 --> 00:28:02.410
will who probably bottom third of items

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:03.910
ghost baby okay the DuckTales thing is

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:06.880
just not working we're forcing it it's

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:09.730
bad it's a bad look but you got to give

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:11.230
me a second to like have enjoyment on

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:13.960
this run because it's going to be over

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:15.820
before we know it it's like Adam Duritz

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:17.620
of the Counting Crows set originally

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:18.880
don't it always seem to go you don't

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:23.370
know what you got the looks on they

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:23.370
paved paradise put up a parking lot

00:28:25.309 --> 00:28:31.190
but I got to be honest with you I

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:33.289
understand that the song is called by it

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:35.539
might be called no parking lot or

00:28:33.289 --> 00:28:37.159
something like that but the song says we

00:28:35.539 --> 00:28:40.009
paved paradise and put up a parking lot

00:28:37.159 --> 00:28:43.070
have you ever tried to drive in a

00:28:40.009 --> 00:28:45.980
downtown city core sometimes paradise

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:47.919
is a parking lot if you don't want a

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:52.269
parallel park you know on the

00:28:47.919 --> 00:28:54.950
intersection of les 4th and Broadway in

00:28:52.269 --> 00:28:56.899
the middle of rush hour sometimes the

00:28:54.950 --> 00:29:00.070
parking lot could be paradise I'm not

00:28:56.899 --> 00:29:02.210
saying we should be paving over you know

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:04.399
farmers and farmers who are putting away

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:05.869
that DDT and not caring about spots on

00:29:04.399 --> 00:29:10.700
their apples leave me the birds and the

00:29:05.869 --> 00:29:12.799
bees please I'm just saying the

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:14.059
sentiment of the song rings true except

00:29:12.799 --> 00:29:16.220
for the fact that I think they should

00:29:14.059 --> 00:29:18.889
just add an addendum like don't it

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:21.499
always seem to go you don't know what

00:29:18.889 --> 00:29:24.049
you got till it's gone we pay paradise

00:29:21.499 --> 00:29:26.029
and put up a parking lot but there's no

00:29:24.049 --> 00:29:31.100
reason to come here because the parking

00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:33.619
lot can be good in busy places it even

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:37.909
sounds better that way and I will accept

00:29:33.619 --> 00:29:40.999
no dissent I also like I don't mean to

00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:46.070
be rude because you can play this game

00:29:40.999 --> 00:29:47.119
all day and what I mean by that is like

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:48.440
you know people will be like all the

00:29:47.119 --> 00:29:48.940
vegetarians I don't want to harm animals

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:52.100
Oh

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:54.049
have you ever worn a piece of clothing

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:56.049
that has leather in it have you ever

00:29:54.049 --> 00:29:58.850
used those on mower did you not

00:29:56.049 --> 00:30:00.710
accidentally kill many birds or well not

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:03.649
birds but bugs with your lawn mower

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:05.600
without even knowing so you could be

00:30:03.649 --> 00:30:07.730
like yeah well Adam Duritz and you know

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:09.830
Vanessa Carlton or Michelle Branch I

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:11.149
don't remember I know Joni Mitchell did

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:12.889
it originally for Joni Mitchell's like

00:30:11.149 --> 00:30:17.990
actual hippy so I'm going to cut her

00:30:12.889 --> 00:30:21.279
some slack but like I want to if Adam

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:23.870
Duritz is going to get all the credit

00:30:21.279 --> 00:30:25.460
for saying everyone goes oh he's so

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:27.590
right why are we paving paradise putting

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:29.389
up a parking lot I want to see this dude

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:31.999
like what do you drive if you drive a

00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:32.929
Ford f-150 we got to talk Adam because I

00:30:31.999 --> 00:30:35.179
don't think you should legally be

00:30:32.929 --> 00:30:37.879
allowed to sing that song anymore I'm a

00:30:35.179 --> 00:30:40.399
big fan of Mother Nature also I fly 90

00:30:37.879 --> 00:30:43.370
times a year and this is not me doing

00:30:40.399 --> 00:30:45.320
some what about ISM because you know I

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:46.940
fly a lot but I'm also not taking your

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:48.649
money for a song called we paid paradise

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:51.080
and put up a parking lot I want to

00:30:48.649 --> 00:30:54.799
compare carbon footprints with Adam

00:30:51.080 --> 00:31:00.789
Duritz because I think he might be a

00:30:54.799 --> 00:31:03.289
charlatan that's all I'm suggesting okay

00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:04.999
I'm not trying to be rude to the man I'm

00:31:03.289 --> 00:31:06.590
just suggesting that his art is a lie

00:31:04.999 --> 00:31:08.269
and he shouldn't be allowed to sing the

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:10.429
song anymore unless he has a lower

00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:14.179
carbon footprint than me that's the way

00:31:10.429 --> 00:31:17.019
I measure the size of my genitals carbon

00:31:14.179 --> 00:31:19.460
footprint more like carbon wait a minute

00:31:17.019 --> 00:31:22.960
dad thought I was being a genius there

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:26.799
read mom is going to be a dang old

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.799
nightmare to fight here

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:35.410
how do we do this it's not that bad

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:35.410
actually

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:43.330
please come closer

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:58.299
it actually is exactly that bad a single

00:31:55.330 --> 00:32:02.980
orbital would cause this to be so much

00:31:58.299 --> 00:32:08.470
easier at this point this is what we've

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:12.809
been saving our bombs for our garbanzos

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:12.809
oh that would have been good

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:20.230
almost Goddard it wasn't worth taking

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:22.350
damage there a damage was accidental

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:22.350
though

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:37.820
come on there we go well I hated just

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:40.120
about every second of that fight let's

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:42.290
compromise our run potentially by

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:44.300
needlessly taking some items that add

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:46.070
very little to our overall chances here

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:49.240
I'm not going to fight boss rush because

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:49.240
I mean come on

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:54.110
Deborah's going to move along you know

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:56.390
what this is our final floor so we're

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:58.670
actually in a great spot there was no

00:32:56.390 --> 00:33:00.440
need truly to take our deal with the

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:01.790
devil on the lessor to take the deal

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.290
with the devil items rather on the last

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:05.660
floor obviously you want to check the

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:08.600
deal like like the same way you check

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:10.910
the rhyme tip if you're on point that's

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:13.430
right back in the days in the boulevard

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:16.220
of Linden we used to kick routines and

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:19.250
their presence was hidden it was I the

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:22.220
FIFO and me the abstract the rhymes were

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:24.770
so potent that I think he says the

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:26.570
brothers rode the Zack I don't know what

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:28.460
that is usually you look it up on rap

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:30.980
genius and then they go well q-tip grew

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:32.810
up in the boulevard of Linden and that a

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:34.700
train in the neighborhood is called a

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:37.580
Zack and like that means that they went

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:42.830
home well let's see you know so let's

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:46.730
check the rhyme genius okay check the

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:49.670
rhyme I know we used to kick routines in

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:52.100
the presence was Fidan I know we kicked

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:54.050
the man Styles too so step off the

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:57.580
Frankfurter yeah the rhymes were so

00:33:54.050 --> 00:34:00.260
roughing that the brothers rode the Zack

00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:02.870
there's no genius annotation for that

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:05.290
one or I can't see it because I have

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:08.360
flash disabled oh here we go

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:10.940
the tribe's rhymes were so fantastic

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:15.800
that everyone on the block was on their

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:18.679
jock Bozak is hood hood slang for ball

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:20.570
sack the rhymes were so roughing that

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:24.679
the brothers rode the Zack dude I never

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:26.300
would have expected that when they say

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:27.710
the rhymes are so rump in the brothers

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.540
Road the Zack what they're actually

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:33.350
saying is the rhymes are so rump in the

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:36.169
brothers Road their ball sacks that's

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:38.929
out of control honestly I thought this

00:34:36.169 --> 00:34:41.429
was a pg-13 rated Tribe Called Quest

00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:44.279
stream here and all of a sudden

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:46.139
talking about riding ballsacks I'm not

00:34:44.279 --> 00:34:53.190
sure the advertisers are friendly

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:55.559
anymore so one of my favorite recurring

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:58.289
segments and Isak episodes is

00:34:55.559 --> 00:35:00.329
northernlion looks up lyrics to rap

00:34:58.289 --> 00:35:03.980
songs on rap genius and finally

00:35:00.329 --> 00:35:03.980
discovers what they actually mean I

00:35:05.749 --> 00:35:09.990
think it's a valuable part of my growth

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:12.059
as a human being to learn what I've been

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:12.960
you know rapping in the privacy of my

00:35:12.059 --> 00:35:15.150
own car

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:16.829
I don't rap in the privacy of my own

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:17.549
home because my wife would hear me and

00:35:16.829 --> 00:35:19.650
laugh at me

00:35:17.549 --> 00:35:22.829
instead I wait til I buy groceries by

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:27.269
myself and then I know this is a what

00:35:22.829 --> 00:35:31.140
Luchini poem for this before as I call

00:35:27.269 --> 00:35:32.460
it the give Lynda special okay we got

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:34.440
our secret room here we're kind of I

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:36.180
mean weird killing time to be honest

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:37.859
with you because we're going to win we

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:39.960
got two bosses to fight if we die we

00:35:37.859 --> 00:35:46.789
come back as dark Judas I think I think

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:48.329
that was this run so I just by the way

00:35:46.789 --> 00:35:50.609
don't hate me

00:35:48.329 --> 00:35:54.450
I just realized that with dr. penis you

00:35:50.609 --> 00:35:56.579
actually can press the spacebar to blow

00:35:54.450 --> 00:36:00.210
up the bombs whenever you want it's a

00:35:56.579 --> 00:36:02.069
great time to figure that out that would

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:05.220
have made the fight against regular mom

00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:09.200
so much easier regular mom also my

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:09.200
favorite show on the Hallmark Network

00:36:10.619 --> 00:36:16.259
so yeah we we could have done a lot

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:18.210
better on this run but we even we'd 17

00:36:16.259 --> 00:36:21.630
