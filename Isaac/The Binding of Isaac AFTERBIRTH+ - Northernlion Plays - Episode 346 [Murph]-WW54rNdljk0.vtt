00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.089
everybody welcome back to northern land

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.280
please binding of issac afterbirth plus

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:11.420
again we're getting a nice little pseudo

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.740
streak going on here with no vain

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.949
compromises good rate of fire

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.070
okay damage speed is acceptable spacebar

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:24.900
item is is mildly better than acceptable

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.340
I would suggest it's pretty okay I wish

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.340
it did more damage like the fact that it

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.380
kind of didn't kill that champion in

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.309
negative 10 seconds I think tells you

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.399
everything you need to know about the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.809
damage that black hole did but it also

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.090
saved me from having to worry like

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.579
basically at all about my survival here

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.789
so I'm relatively Pro black hole I think

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.379
it's a it's a balanced item a well

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.989
balanced item I should say cuz all items

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:56.129
are balanced in their own unique way but

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.620
I can tell alright yep I knew it

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.129
Twitter what do you think kind of

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:06.900
existence I lead that I want Bloomberg

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:11.520
tech news playing constantly in the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:15.560
right sidebar do you think I'm like

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.560
venture capitalists in Silicon Valley

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:23.780
I've recognized I do work in in tech in

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.780
like the most tangential way possible I

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.270
basically am like an idiot wait a minute

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.740
this breaks rocks right who works with

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.299
computers and as a result are you

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.040
targeting I don't understand if you're

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.470
targeting me with these advertisements I

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.509
don't I'm not in the kind of position to

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.729
buy you know snapchats new IPO it's I

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.229
recognize that maybe a lot of people are

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.640
interested in it but at the same time

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.110
you don't need to autoplay it at least

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.500
give me a play button or something like

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.659
that

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.310
I'm not salty that the that the news

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.969
exists I'm just salty that you choose to

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.969
autoplay it without my without my

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.040
permission or without my authorization I

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.810
want to phrase it in a way that's good

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.759
here but

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.220
I don't know maybe Bloomberg's giving

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.430
you jim cramer style mad money for that

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.910
George Clooney style money monster for

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.770
that I saw that movie on an airplane as

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.560
I see many movies in this day and age

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.700
and I thought that it was this is the

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.040
least interesting thing we've ever done

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.830
in an episode I thought that George

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.040
Clooney's money monster with Julia

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.920
Roberts was a solid five and a half to

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.850
six out of ten not a memorable movie but

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.470
at the same time a relatively enjoyable

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.390
experience at the time that I did not

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.850
feel like I wasted my time watching how

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.610
about that Gene Siskel that is your real

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:54.690
name that is a huge speed upgrade man

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.430
and I actually feel like pretty good

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.280
about the quality of this run right now

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.019
now that we've got a little bit of HP

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.430
the finger does damage over the rock as

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.370
you can see so I'm kind of using it as

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.380
like the world's worst spectral tear but

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.170
especially against champions it seems

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:18.690
advisable to not put myself too far into

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:20.700
harm's way here yeah piercing shots is

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.310
also lovely okay well there's another

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.940
this is in Bloomberg tech this is a

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.940
Skype message

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:37.280
at some point you got to learn to blame

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:39.470
yourself for having Skype open actually

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.450
like by the time you're watching this

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.040
the Skype framerate slowdown should be a

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.890
thing of the past which is going to be

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.590
like you know sad it's going to be a

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.750
passage of time but effectively I

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.690
haven't been using this computer since

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.069
2012 but like parts of this computer

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.890
have been part of my recording setup

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:03.299
since 2012 I got a new computer that is

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:05.489
a hundred percent brand new which is

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.560
exciting because this is kind of like a

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.180
Frankenstein's monster sort of sort of

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.280
situation and I would never recommend

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.230
this at least if you use your computer

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.709
for work it ended up I shouldn't have

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.599
picked that up

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.400
it didn't matter but I still shouldn't

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:21.479
have picked it up it ended up working

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:24.750
out okay and I do mean okay it wasn't

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.780
seamless but dude like I tried to save a

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.070
little bit of money on my last computer

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:36.479
maybe two years ago if you remember the

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:38.280
mr. green man debacle buy why do I feel

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:43.530
like my rate of fire got worse there but

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:45.270
it didn't I'm just losing it by by

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.770
taking some of the parts of my old

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.610
computer and moving them into this one

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.810
like for example I think I took my

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.940
solid-state hard drive that had the OS

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.270
on it now we don't need to do a fresh OS

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.710
reinstall we'll just port over the

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.900
existing hard drive it's called all

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.910
sorts of like driver conflicts and stuff

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.830
like that

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:07.289
this thing's had like four video cards

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.630
in it and that's not even an exaggerated

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.979
there might be an underestimation or an

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.330
underestimate of the number of video

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:13.830
cards that have been in this thing so

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.630
take it from me if you're like if you're

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.610
watching this in your a youtuber a

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.380
twitch streamer just like the

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.910
performance of your PC is integral to

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:27.449
your existence just get a new one dude

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:30.539
people will tell you as people people

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.289
will min/max the creation of a computer

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.510
and that's a good thing because

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:35.160
computers are expensive and I think for

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.690
the ease for the average user I'm not

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:41.080
saying I'm an above-average user just

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.550
I'm an aberration as far as users go

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.409
for an average user it's good you know

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.120
if you can save a few hundred dollars by

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:47.860
reusing parts from your old PC and your

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.389
new one then go for it and if you're

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.169
like a computer engineer or you've got

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:55.780
the skills to handle this module early

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.789
go for it but if you're only pseudo

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.189
technically literate on a hardware level

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:01.840
which is how I would describe myself if

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:07.030
I'm being flattering on a you know

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:11.469
self-portrait level then just you know

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:13.960
go for brand new it'll pay dividends in

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:15.750
terms of like your mental health I

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.159
promise but anyway we should have a new

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:22.330
set up and hopefully everything there

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:28.000
will be working completely fine when

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:35.039
that happens I'm going to give you one

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:37.690
spirit art I gave you one and a half

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:43.960
should not have done that in case that's

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:49.409
not abundantly clear now I'm a very

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:49.409
scared individual I have Bob's brain

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:56.650
stay away from me please

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:58.449
I have Bob's brain and a half of a

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.909
spirit heart but you know what this is

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:02.379
the kind of this is how you test your

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:08.979
mettle it's also I can test your chest

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:12.370
love lists wonder it one at a time one

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:18.360
at a time very easy one at a time two at

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:18.360
a time that time good work team

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.900
there's no way that's going to be a

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.730
secret room but I have to check because

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:27.670
it looks like a secret room is this

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:29.410
always the magician now this card is

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:34.840
different okay so we're going to come to

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:39.090
the big room pop our death card my

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:43.680
favorite form of pasta pop a death card

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:46.480
you should why would I why do this is

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:53.220
the question that I find myself asking

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:55.840
right now this was not necessary I was

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.260
why invite this stress in your Isaac

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.660
life

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.950
I even like it's so predictable that it

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:03.430
could have happened oh I thought I would

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:06.100
be at one spirit heart instead of a half

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:13.570
spirit heart it's a little bit of a of a

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:16.350
cop-out I think half the spirit artist

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:21.310
is worse and it's probably much worse

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:26.260
but it's not that much worse we're faced

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:28.780
with a with a an enviable situation here

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:31.510
because I have to do more rooms to get

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:35.560
to the shop every room that we do gives

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:40.720
us a fairly decent chance to die this is

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:42.310
actually like a very pleasant room as

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.960
long as their range can't affect me I

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:46.300
think we'll get a full black hole charge

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:51.340
the big positive here is that the black

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:53.020
hole is very good at keeping us going as

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.670
long as we have it active whatever room

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:57.520
we use it on we're pretty unlikely to be

00:08:54.670 --> 00:09:00.430
hit I think and we can also use it to

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:06.780
destroy rocks although that's highly

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:06.780
secondary all right

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:13.280
obviously I do want to look at that but

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:15.230
we can't necessarily justify it right

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.610
now in theory like once we make it to

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.780
the shop we should be fine here and then

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:21.710
we can all look back on this and laugh

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:25.250
and go ah ha ha ha remember that time NL

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:27.350
tried to cheat the system and almost

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:29.840
died in the process by being an absolute

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:34.910
idiot we'll all look back on that as a

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:39.230
glorious little endeavor in our shared

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:40.580
history together I don't even know what

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:46.910
I'm saying anymore I'm just I'm scared

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:48.440
ok handled this room properly I don't

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.910
care about saving bombs I care about

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:53.270
like giving myself the least chance

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:55.520
possible to get hit little baggie is

00:09:53.270 --> 00:10:01.190
almost untaken belitz not like I'm too

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:04.070
attached to the magician card but little

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:06.920
baggie itself is just awful

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:09.470
please oh that hurts and also that

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:14.020
mushroom could have killed us we have a

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:14.020
spirit heart that's all that matters

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:22.100
watch out Bob's brain went by the Steam

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:27.830
sale 2 lakh upgrades so we should be

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:29.630
fine in here I'm not taking a blue

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.770
candle at least not intentionally black

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:33.110
hole's been doing fine

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:37.180
we have eased ourselves out of what was

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:39.350
destined to be a terrible situation

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:41.930
seemed destined to be a terrible

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:44.180
situation at least 12 cents we got so

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:49.220
many bombs you might as well you know go

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:51.920
for broke here buy a couple of items

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:53.300
ideally okay we'll get chaos and we'll

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.080
buy this and we can still afford one

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.080
item after that

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:03.120
keep throwing bombs we got 15 cents

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:07.050
actually dude absolutely contract from

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:09.570
below I actually think we should go for

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:14.760
loss fly as well and the reasoning there

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:17.670
pretty much just comes down to come on

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.770
you phased over but you won't phase back

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:21.420
maybe it used a rock or something on the

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.220
way I'm not sure anyway

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.630
I basically did that to try to get some

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.190
more money to buy more items but this is

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:28.800
fine especially we can get some more

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:30.630
reroll machines we essentially navigated

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:37.680
out of my own idiocy which is always

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:39.600
nice I I really would love some VPS

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.250
we're one item away from becoming guppy

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.840
one thing I didn't even mention because

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.250
things got dicey right after this

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:48.180
happened but we beat the odds on our

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:50.760
last floor and got a deal with the devil

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:53.370
that we deserved I mean we can't do much

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.600
else - that's a good stuff we can't do

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:55.830
much else to give ourselves a better

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.050
chance of getting a deal with the devil

00:11:55.830 --> 00:12:00.750
in that situation - you know blowing up

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:05.510
the shopkeeper before we fight the boss

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:07.920
on that floor but I digress the point is

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:09.090
could still be a while if the gup-e

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:12.390
transformation is going to happen it

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:16.260
could still be a while very surprised

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:17.820
that's not our secret room continue to

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:21.240
be surprised that's not our secret room

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:22.440
I was going to say I'm wary because I

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.950
think it might actually get the

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:27.750
mushrooms here technically we don't need

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:29.070
dark Prince's crown I put on my nerd

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:31.950
voice for that which is actually just

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:35.340
made my normal voice technically we

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:37.800
don't need dark Prince's crown well if

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:40.560
you look at the stack of the instant was

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:44.340
put on just after the initial cast so it

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:46.350
gets popped first so unfortunately your

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:48.300
dispel doesn't count in this situation

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:52.020
but you know I can call a judge if you

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:52.710
want that's me being pedantic but also

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:55.230
correct

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:56.940
it matches the gathering which is a an

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:58.980
obviously fictional circumstance because

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:00.810
most of the time it's somebody else

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:02.070
explaining the rules to me and they go I

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:05.400
can call a judge if you want and I just

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:08.130
go add I mean I believe you I don't

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:10.200
think that you're lying and if you're

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.960
lying I mean I'm just going to let you

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.690
have it

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:15.940
seems like you need it if if you're

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:18.610
willing to lie to get ahead in our Magic

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:21.240
the Gathering game you know what the

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:23.950
wins yours oh the wins all yours buddy

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.610
that mushroom is a little a little divot

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:27.250
out of it

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:28.780
so I again made potentially a stupid

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:31.300
decision essentially I've traded three

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:33.640
spirit hearts away for the privilege of

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:35.830
the having item rooms on the womb we're

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:41.310
making a lot of very fast and loose

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:43.180
decisions on this run our damage also I

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:45.190
have a couple of things to talk about

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:47.230
here first thing our damage continues to

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:48.280
be terrible secondly we have chaos so I

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:50.020
was talking about our deal with the

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:54.520
devil as if that's our only guppy chance

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:57.400
but in actuality it's not we can get

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:58.750
guppy items essentially anywhere I do

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.090
want to go to the curse room though if

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:03.460
we can swing it but the the real problem

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:08.970
right now is more this damage in DPS

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:15.160
sort of side of things it's it's lovely

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:18.730
that were little frightened again it's

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:20.260
lovely that we're able to get these

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:25.180
guppy items anywhere but it's also very

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:27.610
scary right now because our HP is bad

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:32.620
and our DPS is bad now my HP being bad

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:35.770
is genuinely of oh you idiot I could

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:37.990
have kicked it out but like you made it

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:40.500
tough on me didn't you our luck is 2

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.500
right now

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:52.810
just worry about flies look I exactly I

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:54.340
thought there was a pretty good chance

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:56.500
we would get an HP upgrade here but that

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:58.780
judgment paid out with a troll bomb this

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:01.000
is why when you like make decisions in

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:05.200
Isaac you should make them being a

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000
little conservative because instead I've

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:10.780
chosen to make them like as aggressively

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.420
as possible here I hate I hate that you

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:17.050
did that to me there and it's created a

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:20.950
bad situation I think I would almost

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:23.220
rather open these and look for spirit

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.220
hearts

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:38.240
they're so slow-moving and yet I'm like

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:40.880
mine flooded beyond belief we can't stop

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.470
the finger from dealing damage dude we

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:46.430
got a spirit heart out of it I'm losing

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:50.150
my mind we're so lucky we can't stop the

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:51.410
finger from dealing damage so we have to

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.660
be very careful with enemies that

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:57.290
explode or otherwise present a hazard

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:58.780
upon death we don't want to accidentally

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:01.130
kill them when they're close to us

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:02.570
basically is what I'm getting at here we

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:04.640
also don't want to take this pill we got

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:07.790
to play way way way more conservatively

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.050
here we don't want to take the pill

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:12.140
because the pill could very easily

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:14.270
result in our deaths or at least

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:17.540
contribute to our deaths I don't think

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:20.090
we can use the black hole properly here

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:21.440
and we have fallen behind schedule I

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:25.190
will take credit for falling behind

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:27.500
schedule because I have squandered some

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:30.620
of this run at the same time I am a

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:40.070
little cheesed off that we continue to

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:42.430
have base damage at catacombs to the

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.430
shop

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:49.529
could do some great things to me just

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:55.050
make sure you're staying away from the

00:16:49.529 --> 00:16:59.779
mushrooms which could explode how did

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:59.779
you live like one sustained black hole

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:06.870
and then also a Bob's brain shot like

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.490
right to the dome piece either way we're

00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:11.910
making it we're making it I'm a little

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:13.410
offend my personality a little muted on

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:15.660
this run because I've been so scared the

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:18.750
whole time but I've done it to myself

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:21.720
look of belial is fine but not

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:28.679
specifically what we want and this is

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:30.390
double Baccano runes and a health

00:17:28.679 --> 00:17:32.309
upgrade pill I took the pill on a whim

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:34.920
and that's not skill that's entirely

00:17:32.309 --> 00:17:37.950
luck thank God it happened when it took

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:40.220
my god thank God it happened when it did

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:42.870
though so let's get stacked here

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:45.240
compound fracture we got no restock so

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:48.540
we're not going to get anything else but

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.860
this is still very good Bob's brain has

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.300
almost killed me that's the most

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:54.240
embarrassing thing for me because Bob's

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:56.250
brain is like it's a pussycat as far as

00:17:54.240 --> 00:18:00.570
items go how many times we've been down

00:17:56.250 --> 00:18:02.390
this you know Bob's brain Road you guys

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:05.460
don't explode huh

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:07.320
more times than I'd like to admit to

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:09.720
still take damage from Bob's brain is an

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:15.630
admission of great personal shame do we

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:17.610
know this tell appeals sure we have

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:19.980
still not improved our damage but

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:23.510
compound fracture is a good item no

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:27.690
question is that hard it is our HP up

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:30.980
okay everything is very very slightly

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:30.980
coming up millhouse now

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:38.320
empress to a club to a club that we just

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:41.200
got 25 bombs their error room please

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:43.570
no error room also completely fired we

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:47.080
actually have two HP upgrades i'm lovin

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:48.040
life dude this run has been it's been

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:53.070
taking its toll on me

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:55.299
it said goodbye too many times before i

00:18:53.070 --> 00:19:01.000
can't believe it was that floor when we

00:18:55.299 --> 00:19:07.630
smelt it i think there's an off chance

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:10.870
we can make boss rush i really don't

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:18.000
know how much we want to invest in that

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:18.000
opportunity i was terrible

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:32.559
don't kick my bomb you kicked my bomb

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:34.030
mom like again i don't know if it's a

00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:38.590
bug or it's working as intended but

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:41.640
there used to be like the fact that you

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:46.059
get to charges every wave in boss rush

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:48.040
this bad dodge admittedly if you get to

00:19:46.059 --> 00:19:51.070
charges every wave that's effectively a

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:55.059
black hole every wave of boss rush not

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:56.650
like not to well no it's black hole

00:19:55.059 --> 00:19:58.480
every two waves I guess my math does not

00:19:56.650 --> 00:20:02.230
check out brains a little fuzzy this

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:08.740
morning apparently just hold it together

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:10.750
here I'm not necessarily seeking the

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:12.640
boss room right now but I wouldn't turn

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:15.370
it away I'm hoping we get some shops on

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.240
route on route I don't know that's one

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:17.679
of those words people tell you you're

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:22.210
saying it wrong even though there's two

00:20:17.679 --> 00:20:26.500
genuine pronunciations except into a

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:28.650
little vintage Michael kinda well we'll

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:32.860
definitely fight the first boss

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:36.310
and it's one of the more annoying bosses

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:38.620
in the game but we've kept him oh I

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:40.930
guess he's so strong and fast that he

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:42.370
has the capabilities to get out of the

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:44.950
event horizon of a black hole

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:46.150
sure yeah that makes perfect sense I

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:47.590
understand where you're coming from on

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:49.120
that one yeah I mean like haven't you

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:51.190
seen the movie interstellar look I

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.780
realize I'm being needlessly pedantic

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:55.510
about the situation in general but at

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:57.760
the same time come on here how was the

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:59.980
enemy able to navigate outside of a

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.840
black hole that's the value proposition

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:05.050
of a black hole if you didn't want it to

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:07.210
be pedantic then don't call it a black

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:10.360
hole call it like a hot tub drain or

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:14.680
something like that I could escape the

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:16.930
bounds of a hot tub drain I love as I

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:20.470
play Kimmie conception by the ways is

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:21.760
swell especially if we can get an arcade

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:23.830
on this floor with the blood bank in it

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.750
but I love that I can tell how Austin's

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:28.510
battlegrounds games are going while I'm

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:32.910
playing Isaac because the Bob's brain

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:35.290
damages I'm genuinely apologetic but

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:37.750
it's like Austin started playing

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:39.910
battlegrounds then 11 minutes later

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:42.820
doesn't mean it's a bad run just you

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:45.250
know means that he died Austin is now

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:46.980
playing super hexagon then office is now

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:48.970
playing player unknowns battlegrounds

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:51.340
it's good you know you need something in

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:52.960
the something in the background to help

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:54.090
you out when you when you die in that

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.620
game I wouldn't know because I've never

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:57.700
was a little dicey died and player on

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.560
those battlegrounds in fact I've never

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:02.830
done in any video game in history I

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:06.910
think that dying is for babies honestly

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:13.590
if I'm just being 100% with you virtual

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:13.590
dying at least let's crack it sure

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:21.450
described Scorpio as like positively an

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:22.799
item that exists not really had that

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:26.700
process now playing player I know the

00:22:22.799 --> 00:22:29.190
battleground not necessarily a good item

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:32.429
but sure you know if we have 3.52 damage

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:34.700
I'm not going to turn up my nose because

00:22:32.429 --> 00:22:41.190
I have a problem with his baggy clothes

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:43.049
he was a sculpting young his ogre was

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:46.200
may do that doesn't really make sense

00:22:43.049 --> 00:22:49.350
but it's kind of clever it wasn't good

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:54.419
enough for him and now he's losing the

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:58.549
streak the audience interest piqued um

00:22:54.419 --> 00:23:02.039
does the old vintage is he wanted one

00:22:58.549 --> 00:23:04.799
dude how can you leap away from the

00:23:02.039 --> 00:23:07.409
bounds of a black hole it's sucking you

00:23:04.799 --> 00:23:13.759
in madness imprisoning me all that I see

00:23:07.409 --> 00:23:18.629
absolute failure stay on target

00:23:13.759 --> 00:23:20.610
if 98 cents so the actual game plan here

00:23:18.629 --> 00:23:24.450
is you take petrified poop we don't want

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:29.759
more money we want more spirit hearts

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:31.860
which can sometimes show up on on poops

00:23:29.759 --> 00:23:33.450
I don't know petrified poop changes the

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:35.190
odds or if it just gives you a better

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:36.779
chance of getting a payout which in turn

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:41.490
gives you an absolute better chance of

00:23:36.779 --> 00:23:43.950
getting a spirit heart oh my god not all

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:50.279
of this damage is my fault and I'm not

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:52.289
trying to shirk responsibility but at

00:23:50.279 --> 00:23:54.240
some point you got to look at a run like

00:23:52.289 --> 00:23:59.100
this and go what are we supposed to do

00:23:54.240 --> 00:24:01.049
with 3.5 damage there's I unless like an

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:02.789
will more damage into existence it's

00:24:01.049 --> 00:24:04.740
kind of hard I've just walked directly

00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:08.179
on this bike that time so that's not

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:08.179
really making a good case for me

00:24:09.879 --> 00:24:16.999
but sincerely like this run is not

00:24:14.989 --> 00:24:17.509
giving me a whole heck of a lot to work

00:24:16.999 --> 00:24:20.419
with

00:24:17.509 --> 00:24:23.989
should we have given up you know some of

00:24:20.419 --> 00:24:31.159
the HP that we took know that

00:24:23.989 --> 00:24:33.619
doubtlessly no but I dispute this being

00:24:31.159 --> 00:24:35.239
entirely you know oh look at this run

00:24:33.619 --> 00:24:37.099
and I was taking so much bad damage I

00:24:35.239 --> 00:24:39.049
don't see it that way at least I don't

00:24:37.099 --> 00:24:40.819
see it fully that way a lot of the the

00:24:39.049 --> 00:24:43.039
Bob's brain damage don't even talk to me

00:24:40.819 --> 00:24:47.839
because that I'm as upset as anybody

00:24:43.039 --> 00:24:49.309
could be about that damage but some of

00:24:47.839 --> 00:24:54.319
this damage is well within the bounds of

00:24:49.309 --> 00:24:55.789
reason of course the the somewhat ironic

00:24:54.319 --> 00:24:57.919
thing is that Bob's brain and black hole

00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:59.239
are actually a good combo so I do

00:24:57.919 --> 00:25:02.929
believe that taking them was the right

00:24:59.239 --> 00:25:06.469
decision just would have been better if

00:25:02.929 --> 00:25:08.239
I'd taken less damage from Bob's brain

00:25:06.469 --> 00:25:10.309
itself which I I know I have every

00:25:08.239 --> 00:25:12.019
capability within my within my body to

00:25:10.309 --> 00:25:17.779
do because we've done it a million times

00:25:12.019 --> 00:25:24.379
before please please thank you that was

00:25:17.779 --> 00:25:25.819
good I had like a flash of inspiration

00:25:24.379 --> 00:25:27.469
there and I was like there's going to be

00:25:25.819 --> 00:25:28.699
a guppy item in that golden chest then

00:25:27.469 --> 00:25:31.519
there was not and now I just feel

00:25:28.699 --> 00:25:37.969
betrayed gotta save our keys to some

00:25:31.519 --> 00:25:40.479
extent we're borderline screwed on the

00:25:37.969 --> 00:25:40.479
next floor

00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:47.609
sounds like a name of a really

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:52.440
exploitative adult website but we are

00:25:47.609 --> 00:25:54.389
like actually in a really really bad

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:58.399
place on the next floor we we need to

00:25:54.389 --> 00:26:02.429
stack up absolute HP any form of HP

00:25:58.399 --> 00:26:04.139
stack it up stack it in let me begin if

00:26:02.429 --> 00:26:11.190
we don't get some fuel we're not going

00:26:04.139 --> 00:26:14.700
to win damage tears up something from

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:17.700
the shop stuff yes this is me attempting

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:22.409
to make a freestyle rap parity of jump

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:23.970
around for some reason we only have one

00:26:22.409 --> 00:26:27.960
key one key is enough to get into the

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:29.970
shop this actually I mean this is no

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.979
good but we'll take it because I'm an

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:34.349
idiot and we'll also take our key as

00:26:31.979 --> 00:26:35.460
well and then we'll grab the world card

00:26:34.349 --> 00:26:37.320
and just use that to find our secret

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:39.989
rooms but I'm going to donate a little

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:42.869
bit of money but not until we play this

00:26:39.989 --> 00:26:45.029
joker right here I want to play the

00:26:42.869 --> 00:26:46.529
blood bank some more if possible because

00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:47.669
there's a chance we can get a dark bomb

00:26:46.529 --> 00:26:50.580
out of that and that would be a huge

00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:54.629
help not out of the blood bank

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:57.239
specifically be not out of the blood

00:26:54.629 --> 00:26:59.090
bank specifically but out of the cambian

00:26:57.239 --> 00:27:03.149
conception plays from the blood bank

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:07.729
enabling them okay so that's 63 cents so

00:27:03.149 --> 00:27:07.729
the the secret room was close it was

00:27:08.299 --> 00:27:18.570
like maybe here I've lost sight of it

00:27:16.679 --> 00:27:21.679
which i think is fair given the

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:26.220
circumstances but annoying nonetheless

00:27:21.679 --> 00:27:27.899
there we go another spirit heart and an

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:30.330
eternal heart so you know what screw

00:27:27.899 --> 00:27:32.849
came being conception which is a great

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:34.619
item and I don't mean that I mean that

00:27:32.849 --> 00:27:37.289
it's a great item what I don't mean is

00:27:34.619 --> 00:27:39.710
screw that items but we're going to be

00:27:37.289 --> 00:27:42.239
moving onwards here instead because I'm

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:45.450
happy with the hall that we picked up we

00:27:42.239 --> 00:27:47.429
have basically doubled our HP any time

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:49.739
you find yourself in the ability with

00:27:47.429 --> 00:27:51.389
the ability to double your HP we haven't

00:27:49.739 --> 00:27:52.919
even fought mom yet I just realized but

00:27:51.389 --> 00:27:55.190
any time you find yourself with the

00:27:52.919 --> 00:27:56.540
ability to double your HP

00:27:55.190 --> 00:28:02.210
got to remember that probably means your

00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:05.470
initial HP was pretty bad you can double

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:08.900
your HP by getting a single HP upgrade

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:10.690
in this case though we got two HP

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:18.110
upgrades thank you very much

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:18.530
no krampus please no krampus please No

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:20.750
Deal

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:22.250
that's not really what I meant but thank

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:24.290
you for no krampus at least we will keep

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:27.440
our HP alive to the next floor which is

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:30.860
looking a little suss for a while there

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:33.260
two millennia lies it runs cardroom

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:35.090
Excel so we're in like almost exactly

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:38.630
the same situation where I find myself

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:42.500
being like well we might be able to make

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:44.920
the hush fight work but do we really

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:49.480
like is the juice worth the squeeze

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:52.370
Tammy's head which honestly seems like

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:53.840
it's a testament to how bad our damage

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:56.630
is right now that Tammy's head seems

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:58.880
like exactly on par with black hole

00:28:56.630 --> 00:29:01.910
because if our damage is like a 4 out of

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:03.080
10 not oh not an absolute 4 but a 4 out

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:07.010
of 10

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:09.620
we probably go with with Tammy's head

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:11.090
because it's great instead we were like

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:15.470
well the black hole at least keeps

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:18.440
enemies mostly locked down so it's hard

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:24.320
for me to say no to black hole right now

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:29.000
the synergy exists on Sue's please the

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:33.140
yarrow rune does also exists so I'm

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:36.730
happy if we can make it to the chest

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:36.730
there I'm at least a happy camper

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:45.570
a bizarre archetype that's been popping

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:48.510
up in Isaac way in way more frequently

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:50.580
lately it's just like no damage

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:53.880
we finally got damage rate as I was

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:56.910
about to pop off on from a discourse

00:29:53.880 --> 00:30:01.140
standpoint but I guess because there's

00:29:56.910 --> 00:30:03.810
like so many well it first off it could

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:06.420
just be a sampling error could be

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:09.810
variance basically like I think because

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:11.730
rarely our damage ups being added it's

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:14.880
like peer effects and space bar items

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:18.180
are the the most common items it seems

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:19.860
at least so there's very few like raw

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:22.260
damage upgrades that seem to be added

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:24.180
and it gets into the pool for damage to

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:26.880
the point that it's a little you know I

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:29.730
think it is by by flooding the market

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:31.560
it's made the the runs a little weaker

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:34.860
on average overall which is fine but

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:38.220
dude to to not get any damage upgrades

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:40.350
by what is essentially the eighth floor

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:42.720
of the game thanks to the excel floors

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:45.060
here is a little uh it's a little crazy

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:48.120
of course then like I look like a little

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:50.070
baby because we all now were guppy and

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.630
we can fly and we didn't get a damage

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:53.910
upgrade on this floor as well but I

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:55.530
digress dude there was there was a lot

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:57.420
of tough situations in there that we did

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:59.910
not necessarily have to live through so

00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:02.730
now we'll be fine and you know it's a

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:04.710
good first run of the day because the

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:06.390
odds are and I'm dooming myself by

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:08.520
saying this obviously but the odds are

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:11.460
it probably won't get tougher than this

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:14.760
today which is good a lot of this pain

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:17.130
was self-inflicted in hindsight was

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:19.110
Bob's brain the right pickup I say yes

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:19.770
and I mishandled it that's my position

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:22.470
on the matter

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:25.800
that's my Council of Nicaea on Bob's

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:27.900
brain I could have done a lot better

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:30.630
with it we're not going to make the hush

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:34.100
fight not that I would necessarily deign

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:34.100
to do that in the first place here but

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:40.309
given how things have been on this run

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:42.480
foot anyway you get the idea

00:31:40.309 --> 00:31:44.309
you might be saying NL you're getting a

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:46.500
little cocky for someone who's you know

00:31:44.309 --> 00:31:49.830
not got a whole heck of a lot of HP yeah

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:51.450
but like it's 9 lives in Guffey and

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:53.790
we've got a space bar item that at this

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:57.960
point if we have it for a boss probably

00:31:53.790 --> 00:32:01.679
allows us to to kill the boss without

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:03.390
getting hit it is conceivable that we

00:32:01.679 --> 00:32:06.420
could die I mean our raw stats are still

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:09.900
not that good is really what it comes

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:11.400
down to whether there should be item

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:18.660
rooms down here we've melted that

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:22.230
trinket long ago so watch out number 2

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:24.900
combined with all I didn't even see I

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:29.160
got tricked by my own black hole there

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:30.450
number 2 combined with black hole is

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.860
pretty good because it sucks the bombs

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:33.690
away from you right as they could have

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:37.650
hit you okay

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:39.120
respect and appreciate we could still

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:42.049
lose this up stats are not that good was

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:47.160
what I was just saying there but I think

00:32:42.049 --> 00:32:48.330
we're likely going to be beyond okay we

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.730
don't need too much more I mean the

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:52.610
extra spirits are bouncy it's very

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:55.970
generous of the game and I appreciate it

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:58.140
in fact there should be two item rooms

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:58.980
for us on this floor the only question

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:04.980
is whether or not we're going to be able

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:07.080
to find any of them excuse me so you

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:08.840
didn't happen to see anything at all did

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:11.070
you

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:12.570
it's a deep cut from Austin Powers

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:15.570
that's how you know on the super fan

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:17.520
goes to powers con every year it's not

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:21.049
to be confused with the other powers con

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:26.090
which is the super fans of the

00:33:21.049 --> 00:33:31.860
PlayStation Digital Show powers we got

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:37.340
Dark Matter great Andrew birdsong and

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:37.340
also a decent damage upgrade year

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:43.470
I do still want to go to the item I mean

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:47.509
we've explored it literally it's got to

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:50.789
be like 85% of this floor why stop now

00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:57.659
grabbed we got 100% devil deal chances

00:33:50.789 --> 00:34:00.330
don't grab the HP just yet this should

00:33:57.659 --> 00:34:02.940
be easy dude copy just transforms

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:07.799
pun intended I suppose the the runs so

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:11.629
quickly you know what this is the kind

00:34:07.799 --> 00:34:14.220
of run where this makes perfect sense so

00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:16.679
what are we going to do with Plan C of

00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:18.450
all things I mean I guess I'm going to

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:21.329
use it too especially with our HP being

00:34:18.450 --> 00:34:22.859
bad I'm going to use it to kill every

00:34:21.329 --> 00:34:26.879
boss that we come across for the rest of

00:34:22.859 --> 00:34:28.919
the game seems appropriate and

00:34:26.879 --> 00:34:30.960
applicable to me so we do get to item

00:34:28.919 --> 00:34:38.490
rooms second item room another goofy

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:43.169
item shade is basically not worth

00:34:38.490 --> 00:34:44.700
anything but life goes on we became

00:34:43.169 --> 00:34:46.649
super guppy which of course I'm very

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:49.290
pleased by you dropped a trinket that's

00:34:46.649 --> 00:34:50.280
actually very good but with ten lives I

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:53.460
don't think we care about our

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:55.050
survivability that much well ten nine

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:56.159
lives and then a question mark I don't

00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:59.790
think we care about our survivability

00:34:56.159 --> 00:35:01.770
that much instead excuse me

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:03.569
instead we're basically just going to go

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:06.270
find the boss press the spacebar and

00:35:03.569 --> 00:35:08.940
they may die and this is basically hell

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:11.640
freezing over we have gotten to the

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:16.200
point where we are using Plan C on a run

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:19.200
you know the plot has been lost it's a

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:22.400
new era what is left here a single poop

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.400
perchance to dream

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:33.520
I don't know why I'm worried about

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:35.710
picking up HP seems a little ill-advised

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:37.450
ok 26 Keys is actually nice because it

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:38.920
means we get like a second era rune

00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:43.050
which I don't even know how we'd make

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:43.050
that happen but with Kaos who knows dude

00:35:43.619 --> 00:35:48.760
means that we might be able to double

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:50.619
twice and still have enough keys to open

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:55.059
everything I guess we do want to live

00:35:50.619 --> 00:35:56.890
long enough to be able to make sure we

00:35:55.059 --> 00:36:00.430
make to the boss fight the use Plan C

00:35:56.890 --> 00:36:02.109
although if we use Plan C on on a room

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:04.690
that's annoying that like there's no

00:36:02.109 --> 00:36:08.410
it's not written in the code that it has

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:09.880
to be used on a boss I'm assuming it

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:11.470
recharges by the way that it's not like

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:13.089
a forget-me-now although it looks

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:16.030
exactly like forget-me-now but that's

00:36:13.089 --> 00:36:20.319
you know a topic for another day I

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:27.910
suppose not exactly it is a different

00:36:20.319 --> 00:36:29.349
color but I think I think it's reusable

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:37.329
if you can only use it once we're going

00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:39.059
to find out pretty quickly for now it's

00:36:37.329 --> 00:36:41.410
like it's a new day

00:36:39.059 --> 00:36:42.430
Huna maybe this is going to be the day

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:45.400
of strange

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:50.680
Isak choices maybe I'll end up using the

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:52.450
clicker today I know you're saying NL

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:55.210
don't be ridiculous but Plan C is the

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:56.530
item that I've railed against like more

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:58.349
I don't like using the word railed in

00:36:56.530 --> 00:37:02.910
that way it opens up all sorts of

00:36:58.349 --> 00:37:02.910
Pandora's box double entendres but

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:07.869
sounds like an adult-film series where

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:13.260
people have intercourse on a train is

00:37:07.869 --> 00:37:15.790
all I'm trying to suggest farmers but

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:17.799
Plan C is probably my least favorite

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:20.170
item in the game and we used a glass

00:37:17.799 --> 00:37:22.950
cannon not too long ago either it's like

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:26.670
it's just proof that anything can happen

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:29.589
although it still probably shouldn't

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:30.970
anything can happen but it probably

00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:33.160
shouldn't all right so let's give it a

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:36.700
try here get dusted young

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:40.960
we used it and no we did still die and

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:42.640
we lost Clancy but still we use that

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:44.079
should be an achievement honestly to

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:46.900
justify its existence

00:37:44.079 --> 00:37:49.059
we used Clancy effectively I thought we

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:56.289
could use it more than once but life

00:37:49.059 --> 00:37:58.170
absolutely goes on okay this this I mean

00:37:56.289 --> 00:38:05.380
could be worse let's be honest

00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:08.230
pentagram bomber boy is very scary but

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:11.619
the the tears up from the screws is is

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:14.859
welcomed the damage up from pentagram is

00:38:11.619 --> 00:38:17.470
nice at this point it basically comes

00:38:14.859 --> 00:38:20.019
down to we're racing against time to try

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:22.359
to live here we got nine plus lives

00:38:20.019 --> 00:38:26.289
though well no we have 8 plus lives

00:38:22.359 --> 00:38:27.490
technically remember we lost our space

00:38:26.289 --> 00:38:29.500
bar items so we couldn't roll mister

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:31.509
boom but I kind of like the idea that if

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.619
we survive for six rooms without taking

00:38:31.509 --> 00:38:36.190
damage

00:38:32.619 --> 00:38:41.799
we'll get oh hey dark bum from kmb and

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:43.750
conception dad's a surprise I like the

00:38:41.799 --> 00:38:46.329
idea that we'll get some invincibility

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:48.910
here if we play our cards right belly

00:38:46.329 --> 00:38:51.279
button is a second trinkets you know

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:56.470
what let's give it a shot it was not at

00:38:51.279 --> 00:38:58.359
all even close to worth it but at this

00:38:56.470 --> 00:39:02.859
point we can afford the to roll the dice

00:38:58.359 --> 00:39:06.789
a little bit ultimately this ended up

00:39:02.859 --> 00:39:10.359
being a fun run and it is still indeed

00:39:06.789 --> 00:39:12.519
not over but ultimately this did end up

00:39:10.359 --> 00:39:14.170
being a fun run I have found myself a

00:39:12.519 --> 00:39:16.240
little frightened on a couple of

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:18.430
different occasions we have and Unruh

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:19.539
missed us or I'm loathe to say it

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:22.630
because I want to take a hundred percent

00:39:19.539 --> 00:39:25.210
credit for the win here but the game

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:27.309
that was so bad did save us on a number

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:29.980
of occasions like perfectly time to

00:39:27.309 --> 00:39:34.180
spirit our drops we finally eventually

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:36.009
got damage but it was it was not an easy

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:37.359
one especially like we were not carried

00:39:36.009 --> 00:39:39.160
at all through the first few floors

00:39:37.359 --> 00:39:41.230
we've now created a run where apparently

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:43.210
I can just take damage willy-nilly and

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:45.030
it's no problem like oh yeah number 2

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:47.070
bomber boy

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:49.050
with Bob's brain and I'm not even

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:51.600
sweating it so that's just basically the

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:53.910
run getting super lucky and I'm

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:56.370
extremely thankful for that because if

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:58.260
it had proceeded on the quality that it

00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:59.670
was stuck at for a long time I think we

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:03.270
would have just been completely screwed

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:04.950
but instead word we're getting more on

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:06.390
the chest than we got on like the entire

00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:09.150
run leading up to the chest

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:11.160
and we look like we're gonna come out

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:13.500
with six wings in a row and Franciso

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:16.080
although from a commentary standpoint a

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:20.430
little say me from a game standpoint

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:21.840
mildly zany we got and what bothered my

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:26.490
mind is that it was actually productive

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:28.200
we got productive use out of out of Plan

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:30.450
C it wasn't just shoehorned in it

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:34.310
actually cost us almost nothing to kill

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:38.120
Isaac instantly so not saying it's good

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:41.700
the run basically changes 0% by us

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:46.050
choosing not to use it but we did get

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:50.190
value out of it on a very very forgiving

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:51.900
way we got value out of it the Flies are

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:53.550
going to dust you food I'm very sorry to

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:58.410

of bad news but you didn't get dusted

00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:03.000
