00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.350
everybody welcome back to the land

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.899
please binding of issac answereth plus

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.429
we're doing random hardmode runs right

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.920
now building a pseudo streak that is

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.780
basically irrelevant and we're Samson

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.070
what do we need of Samson here basically

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.380
the same thing we did on that Eve run

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.430
for C ad BLT B that's not a

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.380
bed-and-breakfast

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.170
that's a bacon lettuce tomato and

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.359
breakfast which sounds perfect to me

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.119
right now I can get down with the bacon

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.710
sandwich I'm you know ivory evaluated

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.149
some of my nutritional choices in my

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.250
life I'm living healthier but I can't

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.440
deny that two pieces of white bread with

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.390
length four slices of bacon sandwich

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.140
between them Oh

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.940
sounds mighty delicious right now you

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.170
could excuse me here I'm just going to

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.719
go make that I'm not going to make it

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.579
cuz here's the thing with bacon I know

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.739
that let's just head this off of the

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.750
past you know those who the bacon

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.879
narwhals at midnight you know okay I

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.539
know the bacon is especially for like a

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.640
while it was like an internet meme that

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.990
was like you know the best meat on the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.869
planet I don't think bacon is the best

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.670
meat on the planet but I do like it

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.820
but the problem is for sandwich

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.710
ingredients it's it's in kind of a weird

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.840
area wouldn't you say I hope so because

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.770
I'm asking you two right now

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.140
I don't want to cook two strips of bacon

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.610
fresh to put them on a sandwich man if

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.390
that was wait what I would have been way

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:34.920
happier but it still could be worse like

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.810
marginally worse maybe possibly it's an

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.670
okay floor food for stuff but we're not

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.060
going to be able to activate some bloody

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.960
lusts too much on purpose here at least

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.250
look I don't want to if I'm making a

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.450
sandwich part of the reason I'm making

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.520
the sandwiches because I love it and

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.409
it's the greatest food product ever and

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.930
the other reason is because I want a

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.790
lunch that's past you know I want a

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.380
lunch I can just grab some you know

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.689
cured meats out of the fridge put a

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.280
little bit of sliced cheese on it get

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.049
some bread maybe toast the bread if I'm

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.930
feeling particularly artisan and then

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.939
we're good to go right I don't want to

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.710
have to cook the ingredients separately

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.599
so you might say NL you're being a big

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.340
old baby why don't you just have the

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.850
bacon precooked and then put it on the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.270
sandwich

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.910
you know at construction time it's not

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.590
the same is it you want that nice crispy

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.690
base say what you will about a fast-food

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.240
establishment but they have you know the

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.180
means of production to get that done

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.990
ASAP you know they have a fresh bacon

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.450
available for you whereas I at home III

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.710
have northern I have northern apparently

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.080
no I have neither the time nor the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:41.580
desire which to get that done they've

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.690
got a competitive advantage over me and

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.360
that's why I'm never going to open a

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.520
Wendy's franchise for now though oh okay

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.160
yeah good really that was just to get

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.260
the extra damage was worth it you know

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.720
one spirit are down the drain 40.5

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:59.880
damage up for two remaining rules tena

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.160
attend decision on my part should really

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.800
focus here I want to enter the next

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.560
fight having at least half of the spirit

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.300
hard left just gives us the ability to

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.680
take one hit against both of these

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.150
bosses and not be compromising our deal

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.100
with the devil chances which actually

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.600
because it could still be over there we

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.230
go because it could still be two more

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.710
floors before we get a blood bank and

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:29.190
thus the ability to like activate IV bag

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:32.120
whenever we so choose I think to just

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.940
get strong the more traditional way is a

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.170
probably our best option right now now

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.630
what a surprise glass gray wolves

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.630
playing player unknowns battlegrounds

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.110
must be nice playing some battlegrounds

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.750
well you haven't played enough player

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.020
unknowns battlegrounds yet Austin you

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.240
got to play a game that you've already

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.710
played a hundred thousand times

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.210
for YouTube and twitch I don't

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.170
understand like don't you ever get sick

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:02.250
of it don't you ever want to play

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.230
something new you find yourself going NL

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.820
come on buddy what about Isaac you're

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.920
missing out on the joke here I'm aware

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.920
of that here I'm a self satire

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:21.170
I'm a self spare tire if you could just

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.730
die as quickly as possible give us a

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.200
deal with the devil with mom's knife I

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.300
would be a very happy man

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.550
I'm not going to demand it but I do

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.070
think I'm entitled to it as the number

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:36.380
one member of the Isaac fan club magic

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:38.630
mushroom oh I mean I actually think

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.790
ghost baby is worth nothing in this

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.630
situation we could have taken it without

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:46.580
much of a cost but we could also just

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.690
not take it and have zero cost and

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.170
that's probably for the best because

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:55.010
it's not very good so we are at seven

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.000
point three five damage base this should

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.640
give us enough money to get something

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.290
from the shop we don't really want to

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:06.140
get things from the shop we want to try

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:08.360
to get an IV bag if possible but we're

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:11.180
in a very very good spot now just like

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.970
the last run although the last run it

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.530
did occasionally get a little mylord did

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.250
occasionally get a little tricky towards

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.600
the end there

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:22.790
mom bags fine we were sort of low on HP

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.800
and also ended up killing like literally

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.270
everything remaining on the post-it note

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.060
that we could conceivably do within the

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.400
same run we sort of were a little bit

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.950
you know the run if I may use late 90s

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:38.450
parlance was a little whack for a while

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:40.970
but once we managed to get things

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:46.160
connected it started to just crush it

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:49.220
Gary Vaynerchuk style and we're uh we're

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.780
doing all right here dude I believe that

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.210
that is the second secret room but I'm

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:57.410
not willing to gamble my last remaining

00:05:53.210 --> 00:06:00.560
bomb to check and this would be a great

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.060
floor to get a Krampus item I'll take

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.990
either one we definitely don't want to

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.700
keep Butterbean so we could use a deal

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.450
with the devil that doesn't cost us HP

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.370
we did not get one you know what all the

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.080
better to get one on the next floor with

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:19.190
that's my philosophy we're already at I

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:21.050
think like nine damage by by base at

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.930
this point crickets heads unfortunately

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.110
it doesn't multiply your existing

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.720
multiplier

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.689
it also doesn't mark apply your existing

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:33.930
markiplier which is good because if you

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:38.400
mark applied markiplier you'd get a you

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:40.379
know a square of markiplier and I mean I

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.879
like it as much as the next guy but

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:46.650
that's probably just too much markiplier

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:48.060
maybe get like a logarithmic scale going

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.530
or something like that look I know just

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:55.770
enough math to get myself into trouble

00:06:49.530 --> 00:07:00.180
accidentally with this analogy here it's

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:02.219
a bad idea just looking for the shop

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.449
because we can definitely at this point

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:06.000
I mean first off we should donate

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:10.590
because the runs looking good guys

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.900
behind looking dang good though why not

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:16.020
this is free there's actually no reason

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.580
why not but I say why not to remind me

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:21.330
of the amazing Hilary Duff song of the

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:28.229
same same name why not take a crazy

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:29.370
chance why not do a crazy dance I like

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:31.590
to think of that sometimes because

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.419
everyone you know motivating songs are

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:37.669
all well and good when they're

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:40.020
motivating you to do like good things

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:41.520
when you're like ivory I really don't

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.580
want to go to the gym today but I should

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:48.029
oh I want to ask that girl out but I

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:50.129
drove the confidence why not take a

00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:52.020
crazy chance never these crazy chances

00:07:50.129 --> 00:07:56.400
you're more just like anxiety anyway

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:58.139
when that do it crazy dance but then you

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.969
know you're like oh it's nice Hilary

00:07:58.139 --> 00:08:02.250
Duff trying to motivate people you ever

00:07:59.969 --> 00:08:04.620
think about like you know what like bank

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:06.479
robbers listen to that song I don't know

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.830
dude this seems like a risky job and

00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:12.690
then they're in the grocery store and

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:15.940
like you know this Benny you refer your

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:18.130
work and go ahead and run

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:20.700
that bank and they're like you know what

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:24.160
Katy Perry I will go and rob that bank

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:26.230
originally I wasn't going to but then

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:30.640
your song came on and told me I could do

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:32.820
anything and I decided to take that to

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.820
heart

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:37.510
so obviously what I'm saying is that we

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:40.210
should never motivate each other because

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:41.140
it runs the risk of motivating us to do

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:46.690
bad things

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:51.460

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:07.030
actually like it I don't really like TJ

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.190
Miller as a I don't like his work I

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:10.840
should say I've never met him in person

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.610
Asia recalled the one that gives us a

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:18.240
bunch of cards right and I don't think

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:20.920
that that's necessarily that divisive I

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.950
like him on Silicon Valley because he's

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:25.510
like he's abrasive and on Silicon Valley

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:27.070
that works but then I find like in

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:28.480
literally everything else that he's and

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:30.370
he's playing exactly the same character

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:33.100
which is fine I also think that that's

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:34.570
probably him from interviews that have

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.740
seen with him and again you know it

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:39.520
works around I'm not saying he shouldn't

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:41.320
be able to do it so no going into this

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.480
I'm not the world's biggest TJ Miller

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.010
fan although I did like him in Deadpool

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.420
as well turns out I'm actually the

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:48.820
world's biggest PJ Miller fan I just

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:51.700
didn't realize oh I was thinking of JG

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:53.410
when worth this whole time no but I'm

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:56.550
not the biggest TJ Miller fan but he did

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:59.800
an interview with The Huffington Post

00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:04.450
for the release of the emoji movie which

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:07.690
I know I know but in it he espouses the

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:09.820
belief that children don't deserve to

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:12.820
laugh as much as adults because they

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:14.650
haven't earned it literally I'm not

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.960
saying that you'd stolen I'm saying you

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:20.770
know great minds think alike or poison

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:24.460
minds think alike literally an NL SS bit

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:26.050
come to life you know the idea that in

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.730
order to enjoy happiness you have to

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:29.769
suffer a little bit taken to the extreme

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.420
I think he's being like a half sea

00:10:29.769 --> 00:10:33.339
he's half joking that was kind of like

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:35.410
everyone was like oh my god this guy

00:10:33.339 --> 00:10:38.619
hates kids and I was like no he's right

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:40.079
I mean he's also it sounds very evil but

00:10:38.619 --> 00:10:42.639
I also think he is right

00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:44.410
some kids certainly can have tough lives

00:10:42.639 --> 00:10:47.319
but he's like kids aren't aware aren't

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:48.699
aware of their own mortality and as a

00:10:47.319 --> 00:10:50.709
result they don't need a distraction

00:10:48.699 --> 00:10:51.999
from their own mortality obviously

00:10:50.709 --> 00:10:53.589
there's not true for like every child

00:10:51.999 --> 00:10:54.989
but on average I think he's probably

00:10:53.589 --> 00:10:58.600
right

00:10:54.989 --> 00:10:59.949
Wow we survived that now does that mean

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.920
that children shouldn't be allowed to

00:10:59.949 --> 00:11:04.269
laugh no but I mean you got to admire

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.379
the hooks Club somebody saying that as

00:11:04.269 --> 00:11:06.910
they're marketing the movie that's

00:11:05.379 --> 00:11:08.139
basically designed to make children

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:10.319
laugh but it's not like those kids

00:11:08.139 --> 00:11:12.040
resolving and post either right so

00:11:10.319 --> 00:11:16.509
really sad we should have used the

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:20.379
Butterbean there it was it was the crazy

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:22.600
interview and also kind of hilarious you

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:23.949
know he's like seems like that's why

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.049
kids can't drink cuz they haven't earned

00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:28.089
the right to to drink and I'm like

00:11:26.049 --> 00:11:29.679
that's obviously ridiculous you're

00:11:28.089 --> 00:11:31.420
turning me in terms of what I don't want

00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:33.100
to be because I want to be like well

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:36.069
actually kids don't drink because you

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:38.860
know they're not mature enough to handle

00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:40.839
the you know mental effects of alcohol

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:43.059
and also it might have terrible effects

00:11:40.839 --> 00:11:44.709
on their brains but you know beyond the

00:11:43.059 --> 00:11:46.329
you know they don't possess the the

00:11:44.709 --> 00:11:49.480
means to you know stop addiction before

00:11:46.329 --> 00:11:51.249
it starts you know the kids are these if

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.209
you ask them what the way they want to

00:11:51.249 --> 00:11:53.410
eat for dinner they're just going to ask

00:11:52.209 --> 00:11:54.610
you candy all the time they don't have

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.179
that sense of guilt you got to earn that

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:59.439
I understand

00:11:57.179 --> 00:12:03.279
turning these turning me pedantic

00:11:59.439 --> 00:12:04.779
you're losing me my jury yeah everybody

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:06.369
well not everybody in the one thread I

00:12:04.779 --> 00:12:07.899
saw about it on Twitter people were like

00:12:06.369 --> 00:12:11.379
tearing them apart

00:12:07.899 --> 00:12:12.910
kids don't deserve to laugh I'm not

00:12:11.379 --> 00:12:16.809
going to say that what he's saying is

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:19.329
not fundamentally absurd because it is

00:12:16.809 --> 00:12:20.619
but at the same time because nobody's

00:12:19.329 --> 00:12:22.509
saying he's not saying kids don't

00:12:20.619 --> 00:12:25.629
deserve the left he's just saying adults

00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:30.129
learn deserve to laugh more because you

00:12:25.629 --> 00:12:31.899
know taxes and disease and the

00:12:30.129 --> 00:12:35.529
inevitability of you know even if you

00:12:31.899 --> 00:12:37.389
live your entire life right you know

00:12:35.529 --> 00:12:40.119
you're just going to turn to you know

00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:42.080
worm food at the end anyway and you know

00:12:40.119 --> 00:12:46.230
traffic and

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:48.420
etc etc having to actually willfully go

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:49.890
to places like Bed Bath and Beyond like

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.930
adults have earned it

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:54.420
we're killing it let's face it okay if

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:56.340
you're an adult take a rare opportunity

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:59.370
to pat yourself on the back I promise

00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:00.840
you nobody else will we should just

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:04.260
reroll this right now because you're

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:06.420
keeping the world running oh I'll go

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.810
Guppies head you're keeping the world

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:11.460
running you know we have an obligation

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:16.260
as well if you're a parent you have an

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:19.860
obligation I have like a a begrudging

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:22.530
duty to keep the world safe for the next

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:23.970
generation of people you know for the

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:26.040
net for the generation that's coming up

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:27.780
after us you know we got a preserved

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.490
childlike innocence as long as possible

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:33.030
but possible because once it's gone it's

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:35.520
gone forever but adults are the ones

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:37.170
keeping the world running you know you

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.700
ever see like people on Facebook I'm not

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:40.830
going to say that it's recent mother's

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.600
but it's like oftentimes recent mothers

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:45.780
post like a facebook video that's like

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:50.460
kids are so smart if we just listen to

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:53.400
them are you hearing yourself now that

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:56.340
I've met some adults who have held some

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.690
very very stupid opinions I've met

00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.000
adults that are otherwise reasonable

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:02.940
people who hold stupid opinions I've met

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.100
adults who are idiots who hold almost

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:06.300
exclusively idiotic opinions and you

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.340
know what we've all got to share this

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.510
world together today with many of them

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:12.840
would probably say the same thing about

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:14.610
me just in a less articulate way yeah

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:20.780
that was kind of a jerk move but come on

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:27.210
I'm building the character here kids are

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:31.350
way stupider purrr I think absolutely

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:34.410
in many cases free of you know some of

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:36.870
the adult biases perhaps you know like

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:38.400
you ever see a video that's like a kid

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.570
in like a Walmart or a Target or

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.160
something like that and they're like

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.750
mommy why are the action figures in the

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.210
boys section and the dolls are in the

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:47.160
girls section everyone's like you

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:48.210
there's too to speak in the truth I'm

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.940
like I can relate to that I can

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:52.470
understand you know we've grown up with

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:54.900
the idea that action figures or boys

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:57.240
toys and dolls or girls

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.830
and you know so as a result when I see

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.210
that it doesn't look off to me but when

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:02.580
someone's looking at it with fresh eyes

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:04.410
they're like hey it's a little jacked up

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:07.440
here wouldn't you say mom let's go is

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:09.529
cute through that I understand but when

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.910
people drop these overarching

00:15:09.529 --> 00:15:13.860
generalities like if you're so smart if

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.279
only we listen to them oh yeah you're so

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:17.220
smart

00:15:14.279 --> 00:15:19.200
um what Salva God Rose numbered Johnny

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.970
Johnny doesn't know what avocados number

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:25.020
is he doesn't even know what an avocado

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:27.150
is kids are so smart if you just take

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:29.070
the time to listen to them hey Johnny uh

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:33.240
what do you want to be when you grow up

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:36.810
I want to be the son yeah she's

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:40.260
definitely oh well okay I understand

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:41.700
doctor that you have given me a 5%

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.050
chance of survival and the only means

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:48.630
that I can improve that is via this

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:51.120
surgery but before I give you my consent

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:53.700
to operate I'm just going to ask my

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:56.670
two-year-old what he feels about the

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:59.880
situation is you think daddy should get

00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:04.680
the brain surgery I want my name to be

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:08.010
spaghetti I sorry doc the my chief

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:09.920
advisor has spoken we got to go to City

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:12.959
Hall and change his name to spaghetti

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:15.110
I'm just saying you could take it you

00:16:12.959 --> 00:16:17.790
can take it a little too far I

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:20.580
understand by the way I I firmly believe

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:22.260
that one of my two cats is so much

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:24.930
smarter than the average cat that he's

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:26.940
like he's a cat genius this cat can do

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:28.980
no wrong anytime he does anything that

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:31.860
resembles having intent behind it I'm

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:34.200
like this cat has a brain like one heck

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:37.440
of a brain on this cat right am i right

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:40.650
or am i right but in reality is probably

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:44.550
just like a normal cat I feel like he's

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:46.230
smart but I also you know I love them so

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:47.550
of course I feel like he's smart we got

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.720
a lump of coal there that's a lovely

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:53.220
pickup I don't know why I made this

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:55.500
sound like it wasn't so I understand but

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:57.180
then you get these you know parents who

00:16:55.500 --> 00:17:00.089
are like my child is an indigo child

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:02.279
they feel emotional intelligence on an

00:17:00.089 --> 00:17:06.160
ultraviolet wavelength and you go what

00:17:02.279 --> 00:17:08.020
are you are you listening to yourself

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:11.080
I saw a post on Facebook is about like a

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:13.600
13 year old genius which happens all the

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:15.880
time you know part of part of growing up

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.620
is accepting that you know I've done

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:20.620
well for myself in this life but there

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:22.630
are like there's probably like a hundred

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:23.920
12 year olds on planet earth that are

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.900
smarter than I'll ever be

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:28.360
already despite all the you know I've

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:29.860
been bettering myself for a long time

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:32.230
it'll never be good enough they've just

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:34.510
for whatever reason you know they've got

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:37.890
the kind of brain structure that allows

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:37.890
them to hit those highs and that's fine

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:44.410
but they'll never have lived through the

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:45.970
instinct era so I'll always have that

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:47.710
over top of them but then like in the

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:49.030
post this is like a 13 year old was

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.470
explaining like how we can build an

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:53.020
engine to get the Mars and I didn't

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:54.580
watch it because first off I'm not going

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:56.560
to be the jerk who's like this kids an

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.820
idiot I also don't possess the expertise

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:00.010
to know whether or not he is an idiot

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:02.710
but anyway it was like a young mother in

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:04.300
the comments who was like my little

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:05.830
Jeremy's been watching so many of these

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:08.530
videos and you like communicates

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:10.870
telepathically to this child enough you

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:13.270
believe that like you go to work every

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:15.640
day as a says your owner of

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:18.430
self-employed believing that your child

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:21.250
communicates telepathically with other

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:22.780
children I'm not I'm this is actually

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:24.940
kind of a touchy subject that I've waded

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:26.650
into a language thorny leave and by

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:29.260
accident I'm not trying to like

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:32.770
stigmatize mental illness I think this

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:36.490
is a person that is otherwise so because

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:37.120
the rest of the comment seemed totally

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.770
normal

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.000
it's just like man's the next generation

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:41.560
is going to be in such good hands as a

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.190
result of kids like Jeremy and this guy

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:49.390
and you know she seemed to put together

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:52.150
but at the same time looks like you you

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:54.730
actually believe that that's that's

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:57.040
stunning to me and very scary but as

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:59.200
long as you conduct yourself in a you

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.520
know in a manner that's becoming of a

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:03.000
human being and an adult in today's

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:05.050
society it's you can hold that belief

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.650
doesn't really affect me that much

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:10.530
personally

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:13.950
I resist the notion we spend our whole

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:15.600
lives getting smarter that's like you

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:17.370
can't help it you might get more

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.560
ignorant as you get older stuck in your

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:23.490
ways but your brain is such a sponge you

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:26.430
actually can't stop yourself from from

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:27.960
becoming smarter even someone you look

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:30.840
at and you're like when did you get so

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:32.640
dumb they're actually smarter than they

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:34.550
used to be you just probably got smarter

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.960
than them faster than they got smarter

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:38.550
this is now completely ignorant of

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.670
neuroscience but let's ignore that I

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:42.900
think we might as well go for this dude

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:45.660
like this runs 10 out of 10 at this

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:47.730
point and we should be able to use trim

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.350
to move like every wave which I have

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:55.560
failed on miserably here to begin with

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:57.150
but so it's to say that you know

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.770
children is so smart if we just listen I

00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:00.870
think if you need a fresh set of eyes on

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:02.610
something you say six-year-old come here

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:05.310
what do you think of this highway system

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:07.920
it looks stupid there yeah dude

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:09.840
Eisenhower what were you thinking look

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:14.010
at this like clover ramp here this is

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:15.870
absurd what do you think this

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:17.220
neighborhood all the houses look the

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:19.620
same it's ugly

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:21.540
thank you I've been saying that for 30

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:23.610
years I just needed a fresh set eyes to

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:26.010
come along I actually like that was a

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:30.750
jab at the suburbs this will be my next

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:32.130
tangent I don't dislike the suburbs I'm

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:35.520
just I do resist the notion that

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:38.400
children are uniformly intelligent do

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:42.240
they deserve to laugh probably being a

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:44.490
kid is hard dude that's mostly meant

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:45.810
facetiously but it can be certainly I'm

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:47.940
not trying to say I have you if you're

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:50.340
in a messed up family situation like oh

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:52.500
that's well you're you're a messed-up

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:55.170
family situation well I pay income tax

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:56.700
so honestly like you know I'd trade

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:59.300
lives with you in a second I'm not being

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.300
that ignorant

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:07.669
regardless I love the suburbs I live in

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:09.780
a major so I'll major Canadian City

00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:12.240
anytime you say it's a major city people

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:15.660
go oh yeah I live in you know the bowels

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:17.100
of kowloon walled city in Hong Kong 94

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:19.309
thousand people per square foot you

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:22.320
think you live in a city oh I live on

00:21:19.309 --> 00:21:24.929
Europa where me and you know 9

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:27.470
quadrillion other aliens all reside you

00:21:24.929 --> 00:21:29.549
know beneath a single polar icecap

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:34.770
congratulations well let me know how the

00:21:29.549 --> 00:21:36.539
weather is there it sounds but I don't

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:37.200
dislike the suburbs you meet people in

00:21:36.539 --> 00:21:38.940
here all the time

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.679
I didn't buy in here I mean in Vancouver

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:42.299
that are like you know oh yeah I grew up

00:21:40.679 --> 00:21:45.659
in the suburbs couldn't wait to get out

00:21:42.299 --> 00:21:48.900
of there the city has more amenities but

00:21:45.659 --> 00:21:52.230
the suburbs that God they got advantages

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:54.240
first off respect that your parents

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:55.919
probably moved you to the suburbs they

00:21:54.240 --> 00:22:00.270
wanted a reasonably affordable

00:21:55.919 --> 00:22:02.100
neighborhood compared to like a city not

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:05.820
compared to like the absolute country

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:07.740
but he had the idea that was safe you

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:10.020
know you had neighbors you could also

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.730
have a yard to play around in and it's

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:14.520
just like you know this isn't it's a

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:18.510
safe place to raise a child to make some

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:20.460
friends the kids in the neighborhood not

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:23.460
be totally isolated but not not also

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:25.919
thrown into a you know downtown city

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:27.539
center where they you know see somebody

00:22:25.919 --> 00:22:32.700
break a glass bottle over their head

00:22:27.539 --> 00:22:37.289
like once every three months that's a

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:38.610
guy so the suburbs ain't so bad as I'm

00:22:37.289 --> 00:22:39.690
saying to you if you live in the suburbs

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:41.880
right now I'm not saying you should be

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:43.110
like appreciative a hundred percent like

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.850
there are there problems with the

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:47.159
suburbs I'm sure that I'm largely

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:48.929
unaware of I'm not ignorant of it I grew

00:22:47.159 --> 00:22:51.120
up well I grew up in the country and

00:22:48.929 --> 00:22:53.429
then for like three of my four years in

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:56.130
high school I lived in the suburbs and I

00:22:53.429 --> 00:22:58.140
was like this sucks my favorite bands

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:59.669
aren't playing here then later you know

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:02.190
you get a little older you're like

00:22:59.669 --> 00:23:04.880
that's a very minor problem in the whole

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.880
scheme of things

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:11.130
the only thing that I dislike fully

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:14.570
about the suburbs well there's two

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:18.270
things one is even though we own a car I

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:20.430
would prefer not having to own a car and

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:21.500
in the suburbs you pretty much gotta own

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:24.000
a car

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:25.440
most places anyway especially if you're

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.270
a suburb of something that's not a major

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.400
city that's like a trend as a transient

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:31.230
Network kind of gotta own a car

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.640
that means everybody in the suburbs owns

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:35.610
the car and they're probably commuting

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:37.470
to a city and then they got it you know

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:38.850
you're fighting each other for traffic

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:40.920
because you chose to live there with

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:44.120
Annette that's annoying spending some of

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:50.250
your life in traffic like that I mean a

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:52.800
friend of my parents lives in a town I

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:54.270
mean it's time turn that sensitive

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:56.760
information but it just try to think

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:59.340
about how to universalize this basically

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:01.260
he lives two hours away from where he

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:03.750
works so he commutes every day let's

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:05.660
play some commute like bingo right now

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:07.920
we've got the longest commute in Chad

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:11.220
I'm not going to ask you to prove it

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:13.980
because that's kind of ridiculous do we

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:16.110
have the hush fight done we do so I'm

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:21.360
just gonna I'm just going to go then to

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:22.770
the Cathedral um but like if you if you

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.180
go I have a six hour commute I don't

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:28.590
believe you okay

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:29.850
Maya my brother-in-law when they they

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:33.180
used to live in California now they live

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:36.120
in the Washington state he used to have

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:39.620
a three-hour commute but only on the

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:42.180
weekends so he's like some kind of like

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:44.040
facial surgeon or something like that so

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:46.830
he would work in like the Los Angeles

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:48.300
area Monday to Thursday or something

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:50.370
like that and then Friday Saturday and

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.810
Sunday he would drive up he's like a

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:55.290
six-hour commute but only on the

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:57.990
weekends he would drive up to like the

00:24:55.290 --> 00:25:00.210
Bay Area work in a hospital or a clinic

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:01.350
up there and then drive back on Sunday I

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:02.490
don't know where he stayed but it

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:03.900
doesn't this is irrelevant for the

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:05.670
purposes that's a long commute but you

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:09.090
got to divide it by the number of days I

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:12.210
think man who drives two hours a day

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:17.380
five times a week and has for 30 years

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:19.670
is like way more he's got the

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:21.680
he's got the bragging rights there or

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:26.360
the opposite of the bragging rights I

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:28.430
mean what do you drive eight hours once

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.420
a week or an hour and a half per day

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:31.030
five times a week

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:36.710
those are roughly equivalent I think

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:39.350
okay what am i no not quite you know an

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:41.180
hour and 41 minutes let's say I'd rather

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:42.320
do like an eight-hour Drive once a week

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:45.230
I think this once it's done it's done

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:48.050
it's like the same thing with working

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:50.180
out man working out would be way easier

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:52.490
to fall into routine for if it was just

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:57.530
like every Saturday you just spent three

00:25:52.490 --> 00:26:00.740
hours working out you get jacked if

00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:04.760
instead of having one cheat day and six

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:06.110
not cheat days you just had six cheat

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:08.720
days and then one day in which you're

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:10.370
like I'm going to eat nonsense that's a

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.100
dangerous attitude to espouse I'm not

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:14.510
trying to say that that's a good idea

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:16.250
although the idea of intermittent

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:18.110
fasting has started to catch on a little

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:22.000
bit but yeah I'm not a nutritionist I

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:25.700
don't know if that's good or bad for you

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.010
just in general and this doesn't just go

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:30.320
for me you shouldn't you should be weary

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:31.910
of my advice but you should also accept

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.740
that most of the time when I give advice

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:35.930
I also say I don't know what I'm talking

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:37.670
about you should be wary of people who

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:40.250
do what I do that give you advice and

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:42.530
don't hedge their advice in like a

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:44.650
little hot dog bun of but don't listen

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:46.940
to me I'm an idiot do your own research

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:48.470
anybody especially they're like I had

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:50.450
you know gaming youtuber they act like

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:52.370
an authority on anything but like you

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:54.140
know what dpi your mouth should be set

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:56.750
on in the binding of issac I would be

00:26:54.140 --> 00:27:00.470
very afraid of that not afraid maybe I

00:26:56.750 --> 00:27:01.790
would I would be cautious at some point

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:05.870
everybody's doing this job has got to

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:08.510
learn that when you spend like 40 plus

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:13.340
hours a week talking to yourself in a

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:15.140
room you're you get a lot of depth of

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:16.580
knowledge and how to maintain a little

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:18.380
bit of self delusion that you're having

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:20.420
a conversation and all of your other

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:21.830
knowledge just suffers greatly like for

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:23.270
example did you know this idiot and I'm

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:26.309
talking about myself can't even

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:29.669
pronounce snooker correctly

00:27:26.309 --> 00:27:30.899

00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:32.519
who's from a different country I don't

00:27:30.899 --> 00:27:36.690
even understand it like he says words

00:27:32.519 --> 00:27:39.960
differently than me we invented words

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:42.019
here okay I'm getting Li I understand

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:44.759
I've eaten the same drum over and over

00:27:42.019 --> 00:27:55.979

clear oh I just squeezed through the

00:28:11.399 --> 00:28:15.719
door I meant to open that chest could be

00:28:14.129 --> 00:28:17.099
