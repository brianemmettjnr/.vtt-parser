##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.130
everybody welcome action online please

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.600
abiding rising after birth plus that's

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.010
right it's not after birth anymore this

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.440
is my own modded version it's called

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.660
afterbirth where I get all the good

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.880
items ever and you can't have my seed

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.369
traveller because my seed is too strong

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:26.279
for you zip pom to gives me an idea for

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:28.920
a ez JavaScript project afterbirth seed

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.780
or Star Wars character zip Ponte was

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.660
from the forest moon of Endor they use a

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.890
grog salesman in a walk village anyway

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.270
this is getting ridiculous

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.700
let's go burning baseman one we we had

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.559
like some weird duality of man stuff

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.660
with our last few Lazarus episodes like

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.700
I mean first off we random Lazarus over

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.199
and over which was actually pretty cool

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.670
for the most part I had a good time

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.829
playing his Lazarus hope you had a good

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.230
time watch me play his Lazarus two runs

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.840
ago we got crazy strong right off the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.039
bat and then didn't get much stronger

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.159
for the rest of the run but kind of

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.710
steamrolled and then on the last run

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.750
we started out pretty weak and then

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.520
eventually like gradually got stronger

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.869
as the run went on it ended up you know

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.009
carrying it through to its logical

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:21.330
conclusion eventually but it wasn't the

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.490
most entertaining run on pixels which is

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.930
the digital version of on paper just

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.970
wasn't have that kind of that dynamism I

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.560
don't know if that's a real word it

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.009
sounds like a political philosophy and

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.840
that worries me but it's it didn't have

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.930
that that a hutzpah didn't have that

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.070
junus a qua you know it didn't have the

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.299
cojones it didn't have there's no words

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.950
in English that can be used to describe

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.790
this is what I'm trying to get to you

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.630
you got a resort to get assured you know

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.579
the old Russian Valyrian anyway let's

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.229
see what we got going on here Maggie run

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:00.000
actually is like the least mad I've ever

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.560
been about Randleman Maggie because as

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.140
long as you get that speed upgrade once

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.100
you get for like getting all of the

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.979
posting completed as Maggie it's

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.599
actually no problem whatsoever and we

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.130
might be able to open this I can't

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:16.750
recall we might as well

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:19.780
I thought about it I did because I paid

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.830
for it but I wanted to open a golden

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.090
chest and get enough money to get an

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.670
arcade because then we can maybe get

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.470
blood bag or IV bag and we get IV bag we

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.910
can have unlimited money to buy whatever

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.160
we want and hopefully we can make Maggi

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.280
starts a pot but I really do think you

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.950
know Meggie is is not as hated as she

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.690
used to be but even like the details or

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.460
the reports of her death I thought were

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.400
greatly exaggerated to begin with

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:47.580
starting with zero point seven speed not

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.600
good but usually four HP is enough to

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.610
enough to get you out of that hellhole

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.810
before things become truly terrible but

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.580
you know it's it's a consensus thing as

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.550
well you know just everybody's got

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.130
different strengths of weaknesses in the

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.690
game see I suck at dodging a lot of the

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.670
time to begin with so having zero point

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.350
seven speed didn't negatively affect my

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.090
dodging you know like if you already

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.970
you're drinking milk out of a dirty Cup

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.340
I don't think we can do anything with

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.810
that then one extra speck of dirt I

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.820
guess doesn't really hurt it just you

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.310
know makes you think I'm going to go to

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.750
the item room here if you're drinking

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.430
milk out of a clean Cup and there's a

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.080
you know a little bit of soil in it all

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.460
of a sudden that's terrible I don't know

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.600
where this metaphor came from or what

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.690
it's supposed to mean okay well they're

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.860
really making up for our the situation

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.680
that we had on the last room you got a

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.420
tech point five already right off the

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.310
bat here and then holy mantle so I

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.220
wouldn't say we're unkillable but

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.740
there's probably like a near zero chance

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.580
we can be killed so I'm a very happy

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:50.380
camper right now and really we could

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.640
afford to lose all of our red hearts on

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.450
this deal with the devil and still

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:58.150
probably be completely fine just because

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.280
of holy mantle which honestly like I've

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.550
been in my head trying to figure out how

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.410
much HP is holy mantle worth like would

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.200
you rather start a run as Judas or the

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.820
lost in terms of winning like who has a

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.250
better chance of winning I think it

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:16.000
actually it sounds ridiculous but I

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.040
think it might be the lost at least at

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.480
least for me I'll tell you what I don't

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.890
think we want to take a little brim here

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.190
or sorry I don't think we want to take

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.139
brim we can just take well you know what

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.909
what's what's the same factor you

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.590
the same factories you take them both

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:31.689
and then you go down to one spirit heart

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.800
and try to make it pop originally I was

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:35.020
going to say I'm not going to take brim

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.590
because it seems a little too easy but

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.419
then I remembered but first off I don't

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.789
think we've had brimstone in quite some

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.560
time actually and then I remembered one

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.810
HP holy mantle is actually like where I

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.979
want to be we're on almost lost levels

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.810
here so of course if we get a red hearts

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.159
for red heart containers I should say

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.139
we're going to probably steamroll the

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:58.240
game and there's no avoiding that but I

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:03.069
don't think that's necessarily a bad

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:06.279
thing to begin with Plan C Plan C no

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:09.639
Plan C is just useless I wish it weren't

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:11.919
so like the lyrics to save tonight by

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:19.060
Eagle Eye cherry but it is so and that's

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:21.250
a problem we forget that Eagle Eye

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.750
cherry of Swedish it's not like there's

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.389
anything wrong with that dude that we

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.050
are steamed in here so there's anything

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:30.879
wrong with that

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:35.199
of course been to Sweden I have very

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:38.339
little recollection one too many $18

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:42.940
beers I think I stayed in a boat on a

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:44.409
river near I want to call it City Hall

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.080
but it might have actually been a palace

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:49.539
anyway where we got here friends till

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.000
the end I just I always forget cuz when

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:54.580
I think Eagle Eye cherry I think that is

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000
a man who was born on you know a

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:02.319
compound somewhere near like Berkeley

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.900
California I say that as a proud denizen

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:08.680
and citizen of the west coast it's met

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:11.589
with Noah with no ill will we can get a

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:17.020
little bit more money out of this and

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:19.180
like Gothenburg Sweden well I never got

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.939
a positively Yin's Lachman sort of

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.949
situation on our hands okay just give me

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:28.120
a red heart that's I mean it was a

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:30.279
freaky anyway so I'm not too bummed but

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.750
you know what let's let's milk it for

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:34.409
deal with deal with the devil chance

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.849
instead we got some of our money back

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:38.740
functionally speaking roughly a 50%

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:40.320
chance of a deal with the devil we

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.910
really don't need

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.030
a deal with the devil at this point I

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:47.880
would like to up our damage but we don't

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:50.340
need to at least not like any time in

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.570
the near vicinity and you can hate mom's

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:56.340
knife all you want by the way

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:57.420
mom's knife is an item that hilarious at

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.710
first time I don't think we can afford

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.360
it to begin with so we're going to stay

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.500
away from it but it would be nice to be

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.210
able to shoot the knives because I think

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.740
it actually is the exception that proves

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.650
the rule of what I was about to say

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.420
mom's knife rarely has good synergies on

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.210
the other hand brimstone has a ton of

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:14.130
fun synergies and isn't really like a

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.860
steamroll situation most of the time by

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:19.740
itself so you can hate on mom's knife

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:26.510
but a rare brimstone pickup makes me a

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:26.510
happy boy 45% deal with the devil chance

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:33.180
you know you may take issue

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:35.640
statistically I agree with you 42

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.650
percent is not functionally the same as

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:41.640
50% but if you're only doing like one

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:46.710
dice roll you know 40 percent is 50/50

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:50.040
as far as I'm concerned I mean it's

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:51.810
literally not I'm aware of that but you

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:54.120
know for a short hand it's like the sort

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:56.130
of thing where you know we were doing if

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:58.170
we were in the wild somehow and we had

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.850
to calculate like the surface area of

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:02.370
the circle and I was like well for pie

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:05.810
I'm just going to use 3.14 and then some

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:08.490
was like whoa but actually pi is 3.14159

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:10.740
for seven you know that kind of lost the

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:12.180
plot after a few there but it's good

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:18.620
enough for a back of the napkin

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:18.620
calculation let's grab this

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.840
who's going to say like going a little

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.580
slow but it's actually quite the

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:29.220
opposite we're going like very very

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:31.500
quickly so we want not to see a deal

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:33.030
with the devil here actually well you

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.650
know what with one HP now we will take

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.060
mom's knife and we'll still have enough

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:37.500
spirit arts left to keep us going here

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.550
but now we'll shoot a bunch of knives

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:43.430
out instead of a bunch of brimstone

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:46.380
lasers or a single brimstone laser and

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:48.030
it's still like completely fine I mean

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.710
it should be very clear at this point

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:52.410
that this run well not completely

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:56.220
unusable is very very unlikely to be

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:59.190
lost I also believe in the power of the

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:01.620
guppy dream you've gotten so many red

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:03.270
chests relative to the number of red

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:06.290
chests you'd expect to have to start a

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:10.050
run or did in the early stages of a run

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:12.270
that I just believe in the power of us

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:13.410
being able to get that transformation I

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.540
don't know if it works with mom's knife

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:18.240
see I don't know if it's like mom's

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:20.790
knife the way it does take some damage I

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:24.960
don't know if that's what makes it so

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:26.520
it's not part of the guppy lexicon as

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.350
far as like good guppy transformation

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.210
synergies go or if it's actually like a

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.860
special property built in the moms knife

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:34.320
that's like ignore guppy because this is

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:37.980
already too good because brimstone guppy

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:40.280
is excellent so if the knives take on

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:45.710
the properties of the brimstone Laser

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:47.820
repeating of course then there should be

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.860
brimstone synergies here but it to be

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.480
honest with you I probably had moms

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.730
knife brimstone guppy before I mean

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.710
we're getting to the point where we're

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:57.870
almost in like Simpsons did it levels of

00:09:55.710 --> 00:10:00.170
of issac play where whenever I go like

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:02.700
ah you know what's going on with this

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:05.870
it's probably already happened once I've

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:08.430
probably already done it and just lost

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:11.700
temporarily lost memory of it or perhaps

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:14.430
even consciousness who knows so it's a

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:17.460
hard life here locked in my Isaac prison

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:19.230
recording more Isaac content and making

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:22.680
bad jokes like I'm so thirsty you

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:25.650
already know 64 ounces daily of

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:29.050
life-giving h2 well dude that fancy is

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:31.790
like 2 years old at this point actually

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:33.890
fancy is three years old is that a 2014

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:37.180
banger because I always catch on the

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:39.890
songs that are popular and half-decent

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:41.780
like six months after they come out like

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.340
kate is trying to modernize my music

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:45.080
taste it's a futile endeavor

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.940
I will only ever for the rest of my life

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.650
lives in the contraband the best of men

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:51.800
at work the only perfect album ever

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:53.330
created but Sheba she listens the

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:56.270
popular radio station when she's driving

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:58.670
I got to be honest with you a lot of it

00:10:56.270 --> 00:11:02.600
not really my speed you know there's uh

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:06.560
a lot of Shawn Mendes not really mine my

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:08.810
style you know a lot of kind of thing

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.430
what else comes on Demi Lovato you know

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:14.330
today's superstar Cher

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:17.060
no no Cher unfortunately but every

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:20.200
summer there's like one song that I'm

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:23.120
like this one it's kind of grabbed me

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.770
and a few years ago was fancy I was like

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.920
this is kind of like a grimy beat I can

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:29.420
sort of respect even though it's

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:31.040
obviously like you know to commercialise

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.230
which I'm not necessarily against and

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:35.540
then like two years ago that oh I think

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:37.720
that I found myself a cheerleader

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:40.310
no deal I thought we got a deal there I

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.510
don't know what it was last summer to be

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.370
honest with you but this summer it's

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:45.860
this one that you know that and get the

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:50.510
beach house in Miami or something in my

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:53.120
Jamie trying to think is something in

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:54.830
the fast lane go put some miles on it

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.570
it's I think it's called it that's what

00:11:54.830 --> 00:12:01.040
I like or lucky for you that's what I

00:11:56.570 --> 00:12:02.300
like and you're going to say NL that's a

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.430
bad song you should be listening to the

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:07.370
new Kendrick album I have it on my

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:10.340
unlimited google play a music

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:12.920
subscription service not a sponsored

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:15.110
video but hey you to get that if you get

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:18.230
YouTube bread as well I don't have a

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:20.120
youtube red official series sponsored by

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:21.650
YouTube because I pitched them I was

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.910
like what have you just sponsored me

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:24.380
playing The Binding of Isaac and they

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:26.150
said I don't understand what you do and

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:27.950
I said to be honest with you me neither

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:30.950
and you know talks are at a standstill

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:32.410
right now but maybe one day but I have

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:34.910
not listened to it yet

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:36.710
the most recent full album I listens who

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:38.900
was the pimp a butterfly two years ago

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:40.190
two and a half I guess of this play I'm

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.320
not bragging about it I'm just saying

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:46.780
you know

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:49.550
lucky for you that's what I like it is

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:52.790
the reason I don't listen to that much

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:55.610
new music is to be honest with you I

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:58.190
don't necessarily value contemporary

00:12:55.610 --> 00:13:00.440
music and old music that I'm not

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:02.630
familiar with differently you know as

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:05.960
far as I'm concerned I've never heard

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:09.920
Miles Davis's landmark album bitches

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:12.890
brew so you know that says new of an

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:16.160
album to me as the most recent Carly Rae

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:18.760
Jepsen don't take that as a slight at

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:21.470
Carly Rae Jepsen Canadian Idol runner-up

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.870
pop princess and I believe the the

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:25.130
hometown Vancouver British Columbia so

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:29.420
we got to give some you know give some

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:30.620
respect to the 604 we've got a couple

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:34.910
different area codes now but that's

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:36.800
that's the og area code that's how you

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:38.600
know you got like a you got a primo

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:41.770
number you get a call from a 604 number

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:44.950
you're like it's either Carly Rae Jepsen

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:47.000
one of the Sedin twins or the government

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:50.210
okay where we go

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.850
just keep moving you know I've never

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:55.670
heard I mean obviously I have heard

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:59.740
Bruce Springsteen's landmark 1975 album

00:13:55.670 --> 00:14:02.780
Born to Run but if I hadn't you know

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:05.780
that's new music it's new to me anyway

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:07.970
you know I've never heard Thomas Edison

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:09.910
records man sneezing for the first time

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:15.650
ever so why would I listen to the new

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:17.360
migos album when I could listen to six

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:22.730
seconds of Teddy Roosevelt given the

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:24.380
State of the Union address in 1908 this

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:26.570
has become more than the average

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:28.880
caricature okay we got the Empress we're

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:30.680
all ready I mean this is the steamy as

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:33.560
the steamroll runs at this point we

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:36.350
basically are just going to run buck

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:38.740
wild over this just take one makes you

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:41.990
larger get it out of your system

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:43.490
we cannot be hurt when this is like I

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:45.020
don't know why the game is chosen to be

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:47.360
so nice to us recently but I'm obviously

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.560
very thankful for it we may want to do

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.870
boss rush because we're going to make it

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:53.990
the boss rush by like 15 minutes

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:55.940
that's rare and rip of green I think is

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:59.540
fine it's just unfortunate that rib of

00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:03.980
Greta's also corresponded with a run in

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:05.540
which we've gotten like actually barely

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:08.360
enough money to make two shops worth

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:11.720
while we did buy one big shop item I

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:13.340
thought didn't like me we didn't I don't

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.440
know it did I've been I've been lost on

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.730
my own my own world on this run to begin

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.140
with this what happens when they give

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.280
you brimstone and mom's knife right off

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:22.220
the get-go we are still dealing with

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:24.980
4.08 damage but you know when each knife

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:26.540
does 4.0 a damage and you shoot like 70

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:30.110
knives every time you press the button

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:31.910
down feels good but you know that's

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:33.950
going to be enough that's what I'm

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:35.540
trying to suggest here at the same time

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:38.870
it's always nice to have these runs that

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:40.040
are a little on the easier side from

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:42.920
time to time because you don't always

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:45.830
get a steamroll and it also opens up the

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:48.710
commentary to be a little saying here it

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:49.760
really does you might be asking this is

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:51.440
probably going to come out like a week

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.270
after e3 and maybe slightly more because

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:55.550
of the nature of my backlog but III is

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:59.510
going on right now and we went to e3

00:15:55.550 --> 00:16:04.280
last year and I liked it I actually per

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:06.200
my for my money which it was III is like

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.870
one of my favorite conventions to go to

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:10.820
because it's at least last year now it's

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:12.640
open to the public so it's a little

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.950
different but last year it was just like

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:19.370
it was professional and not that busy

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:20.930
and everybody there was like in the

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:22.550
industry so it was like you know you

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:24.200
know people I guess is what I'm trying

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:26.120
to suggest without coming across like a

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:29.240
snob but to be honestly when it came

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:30.530
time to come to III this year originally

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.660
we planned on doing it because it's kind

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:35.240
of like you know when you're in the

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:36.350
gaming industry you can justify it I'm

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:39.440
going to give you like a dirty little

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:41.570
secret that you know is going to get me

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.010
blacklisted by my my friends and

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:45.110
colleagues here but most of the time

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:47.360
when you're going to a convention you

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:50.240
can justify it as like a business

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.980
expense but when you have to justify it

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.230
to your community you know people are

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:55.550
like that's that's work you know that's

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:58.280
networking I don't know how much

00:16:55.550 --> 00:17:00.320
networking there actually is in the

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:03.110
streaming industry like

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:04.610
maybe maybe there's some but is what I'm

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:08.299
trying to get at is it's kind of like a

00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:10.819
pseudo vacation most it's like I like

00:17:08.299 --> 00:17:12.860
video games so I'm going to go do this

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:14.990
semi work-related thing to video games

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:16.910
but also it's let's be honest is sort of

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:20.360
a vacation nothing don't do some work

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:21.919
there but like you know I I've been down

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:24.260
that cycle a few times you know you go

00:17:21.919 --> 00:17:25.579
see appointments for like you know all

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.169
these games and then when they come out

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:28.720
you're like I play that at e3 I don't

00:17:27.169 --> 00:17:31.179
really want to play it now it's just

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:37.160
it's old me in the other direction but

00:17:31.179 --> 00:17:40.429
whoo dude what if we go straw here give

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:42.110
it a shot but anyway we ultimately I put

00:17:40.429 --> 00:17:44.299
the kibosh on e3 this year because I

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:46.940
just want to I realized like I don't I

00:17:44.299 --> 00:17:50.690
don't care about the gaming industry

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:52.490
like I care about games and I don't care

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:54.230
about like I just watched like 30

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:55.429
minutes of the EA press conference so

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:58.010
this is not me trying to be a hipster

00:17:55.429 --> 00:18:01.280
but they they played like a bunch of

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:03.110
Star Wars Battlefront 2 and to thine own

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.059
self be true I looked at it and I was

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:07.520
like that game actually looks good from

00:18:05.059 --> 00:18:09.169
a visual standpoint and from a gameplay

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.570
standpoint it looks beautiful and

00:18:09.169 --> 00:18:14.450
engaging but I was like man I didn't

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:17.510
mean to spend $1,100 on a round-trip

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:21.919
flight to LA to see that I've been

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:23.809
playing the same game for 3,000 runs

00:18:21.919 --> 00:18:25.669
here on YouTube and honestly that's

00:18:23.809 --> 00:18:27.440
where I'm happy it's like I was thinking

00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:29.690
what would I want to see is the e3 press

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:32.870
conference that would make me like the

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:35.059
happiest boy in the world sincerely it

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:37.070
would be hey all of our sports games are

00:18:35.059 --> 00:18:38.929
going to be on PC now that would be the

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:42.020
one where I'd be like I'm dude you guys

00:18:38.929 --> 00:18:45.080
won e3 Congrats now I can lead Bo Horvat

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:46.309
to the Conn Smythe Trophy because we're

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.780
probably never going to see that in real

00:18:46.309 --> 00:18:51.429
life in all likelihood but you know a

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:55.040
man can dream well yeah like I think

00:18:51.429 --> 00:18:56.809
I've accepted that and this is not a

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.340
negative I mean it is a positive you

00:18:56.809 --> 00:19:02.179
know most of the time my time is better

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:03.799
spent making videos and streaming doing

00:19:02.179 --> 00:19:06.320
what I like as opposed to like well what

00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:07.640
does what does this mean for the

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.990
industry and I don't begrudge anybody

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:13.710
that takes that approach but

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:16.050
Lincoln more more except the role that

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:17.520
I'm a guy who likes video games but

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:21.000
doesn't really care where the industry

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:23.070
goes which is why you know on roundtable

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.300
I'm I'm always the guy who's like well

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:26.790
what does this mean for the industry and

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:31.080
I'm like I don't know but I think this

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:33.480
particular thing is good or bad doesn't

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:35.880
it set a bad precedent I got no idea man

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.440
you got those fat cats in the suits

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:40.260
writing the checks that are decided that

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:44.490
stuff I'm just here to support it or

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:48.150
decry it you know I will occasionally

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:50.460
take a stand I guess but I no one's more

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:53.700
surprised than me that my my recent pet

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:55.380
cause on the on the roundtable podcast

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.360
is defending the Nintendo switch a

00:19:55.380 --> 00:20:00.480
console that you know when I watch the

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:02.580
reveal of it I said I don't understand

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.740
this is just like a phone with a

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:07.440
joystick attached to it and then we got

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:09.300
one and for the first like week and a

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.880
half I was like I don't get it

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:13.410
is this like a phone like I don't really

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.710
want to play Zelda right now and we have

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:18.059
ones who switch but it's pretty terrible

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:20.400
what do I do with it and then Mario Kart

00:20:18.059 --> 00:20:21.929
8 came out and I was like I totally

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.970
understand this device and want nothing

00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:27.390
more than to spend every waking hour

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:30.000
with it so I don't know I just kind of

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:32.280
play it as it comes but yeah that's why

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:37.260
I'm not at e3 I also feel like you know

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:39.300
as I get older I value times I know this

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:41.580
is antithetical to say in a young

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:45.170
person's game and I am still a young

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:47.760
person unlike a cosmic sense at least

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:50.910
value like time spent with my family

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:54.030
more you know I only see my parents of a

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:56.670
couple - a few times a year they live

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:59.370
across the country and I was faced with

00:20:56.670 --> 00:21:04.230
the choice you know I want to spend a

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:06.630
week at e3 like making tweets about what

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:08.760
is the old project Scorpio what does

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:10.440
this mean for the Xbox one you know I

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.880
don't really care for the most part I

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:18.030
got one and it plays Game of Thrones

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:20.130
okay sometimes or I could like go hang

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:21.020
out with the people who gave birth to me

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:24.650
and whose comfort

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:27.260
I genuinely enjoy you know as a peer for

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:30.380
like some of the first times in my life

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:32.330
instead of simply like a caretaker and

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:34.940
person taking care of sort of

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:36.260
relationships so you know if we're going

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:38.300
to do I don't want to do both because

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:42.380
they got to do my job I'd rather just I

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:47.810
just been out of my family man and now

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:50.450
you're getting old man old Enel would

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:52.520
have spent time tweeting about the Hovis

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:55.100
method in the microprocessor from the

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:57.290
Xbox one instead of spending time with

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:58.730
his life giver I that's satire I don't

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:00.680
think anybody actually thinks that I'm

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:02.510
just I'm pulling back the veil on what

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:04.790
is effectively like the easiest run I've

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:06.620
ever seen in my adult life here we might

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:08.990
be able to make it to the Hajj fight in

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:12.200
under 30 minutes I don't begrudge

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:13.640
anybody if anything I feel like I'm I

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.530
know once a in the wrong but in the

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:17.030
minority on III people that are not even

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:19.280
in the gaming industry are like hey come

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:20.630
check out my twitch channel I'm you know

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:22.610
like a hobbyist streamer but I'm gonna

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:25.250
stream all the e3 stuff because I love

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:28.100
the industry I like that's cool man I'm

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:29.930
genuinely I have been there at times in

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:33.170
my life I'm not I'm not at all sick of

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:35.450
games I love games Yelich you know Isaac

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:36.620
in dead cells and battlegrounds and

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:39.260
stuff like that I've been playing lately

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:40.810
like these are not cynically for work

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:43.760
these are these are games I genuinely

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:45.230
enjoy and think about in my off time

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:48.320
give me here's the storm I've been

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:49.490
enjoying a MOBA I just sort of am at a

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:53.000
point where I don't care about the

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:55.340
industry I care about the art more than

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.240
that you know the commerce aspect I

00:22:55.340 --> 00:23:01.000
suppose and it's a very going to take

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.990
two wheel of Fortune's it's a very

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.910
self-righteous way to think about it but

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:06.920
and I'm not trying to come at it from

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:08.360
that position I would begrudge anybody

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.950
who does care about the like you know

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.420
the overarching what does this mean for

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:13.190
our industry sort of conversations I'm

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:16.250
glad to be in hand but I'm also glad

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:17.930
that I don't have to have them straight

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:20.540
up we made a bad decision to take the

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:21.230
straw like I overate that item a little

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:23.150
bit

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:24.950
guppies head was crushing it but we'll

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:26.680
replace it as we just did with Pandora's

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:29.600
box and we'll use Pandora's box to

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:31.340
hopefully generate like a Godhead sort

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.120
of situation wouldn't be the worst thing

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:34.490
in the world

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:37.910
we've only got a 33% chance to deal with

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:40.090
the devil so bloodbag doesn't really oh

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:42.290
well nevermind I will definitely take it

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:43.400
because let's put the eternal art and

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:46.880
everyone permanent polaroid

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:49.970
invincibility either way so but we're I

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:51.650
mean let's be honest we don't need

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.420
anything on this run we could get like

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:56.900
almost every bad item in the game and

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:59.930
still be completely fine so this is

00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:01.190
going to be a win the random streak it

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:04.310
rings a little hollow because we haven't

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:06.170
had any not good damage obviously we

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:07.610
haven't had any loss runs we haven't had

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:12.460
any keeper runs but become

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:12.460
well-positioned to enjoy some of those I

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:19.340
actually got hit I actually got hit

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:22.070
twice it's like a new world all right

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:27.860
well I gotta close this up here yet that

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:30.080
the its people talking about e3 I feel

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:36.590
like I'm but I'm sitting at a different

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:39.650
table now alright um let's find ash

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:42.170
we're so early like it wouldn't feel

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:46.160
right for me to not fight hush it

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:49.610
wouldn't be the one feel right for me to

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:55.520
not find an optional boss on this strong

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:58.790
run and although I find the boss quite

00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:03.890
loathsome furnace this time it will be

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:10.850
fun I'm still searching for a

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:12.190
transformation can I please see the copy

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:20.920
[Music]

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:23.180
animation we got me the Sun do-do-do-do

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.260
neck slacks all right well you know what

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:26.600
we'll donate a bunch of money this

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:29.930
turned out to be largely a pitiful waste

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:31.070
but hey nine hundred and fifty cents in

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:33.760
the donation machine we're finally

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:33.760
coming back here

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:40.139
and I mean Goathead does nothing and

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:44.409
Bob's rotten head will never do anything

00:25:40.139 --> 00:25:46.029
we could look for some special rooms

00:25:44.409 --> 00:25:50.169
like actually this would be a great time

00:25:46.029 --> 00:26:02.289
to get a going on there be a great time

00:25:50.169 --> 00:26:03.999
to get a black market give away some of

00:26:02.289 --> 00:26:05.830
this HP let's be honest like we're not

00:26:03.999 --> 00:26:06.700
going to use our bombs if we get stabbed

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:08.980
okay there we go

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:13.749
if we get sad bombs I'll be disappointed

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:15.399
and it's fine not mad at blocked shots

00:26:13.749 --> 00:26:17.919
at least this would be a great time to

00:26:15.399 --> 00:26:19.389
get sad bombs and if we did we would be

00:26:17.919 --> 00:26:25.299
like I wish I hadn't spent so many bombs

00:26:19.389 --> 00:26:26.279
back there to get big chub but not that

00:26:25.299 --> 00:26:30.159
bad

00:26:26.279 --> 00:26:31.869
certainly obviously the big damage here

00:26:30.159 --> 00:26:35.440
does come from actually hitting the

00:26:31.869 --> 00:26:38.499
enemy with a knife but that's not always

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:39.999
going to be easy to do here and I'd

00:26:38.499 --> 00:26:42.009
rather keep holding mantle alive as long

00:26:39.999 --> 00:26:44.259
as possible because there's some damage

00:26:42.009 --> 00:26:47.909
from hush I would say is not unavoidable

00:26:44.259 --> 00:26:50.980
but it's difficult to avoid so the more

00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:54.970
the more time ordered let's just say the

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:57.789
longer I can keep holy mantle active

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:59.109
here the better our standing will be

00:26:57.789 --> 00:27:00.460
when we leave here where it's not the

00:26:59.109 --> 00:27:02.169
better our chances of winning because

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:06.269
like I'm pretty sure our chances of

00:27:02.169 --> 00:27:06.269
beating Hoshi are essentially 100

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:18.330
but the better position will be as

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:20.940
things progressed here so there goes

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:22.559
holy mantle that was not the way I

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:25.800
wanted to lose that usually that's flies

00:27:22.559 --> 00:27:28.440
exactly so yeah that's how I feel about

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:32.370
you three you might say NL what about

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:35.070
pax pax is different packs I've settled

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:38.940
into a groove with pax for one we don't

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:40.950
go to out of our like area pax is that

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:42.870
much anymore because of the fact that

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:46.050
like it's I mean it's expensive to go

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:47.309
there for one but to like I wasn't

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:49.050
getting much value out of you you know

00:27:47.309 --> 00:27:50.670
you shake hands with developers and you

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:52.260
play some stuff and maybe like one game

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:56.760
of pax you go I never would have heard

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:57.929
about this or not for a pax and now like

00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.510
this looks really cool let's play it on

00:27:57.929 --> 00:28:02.100
the show that does happen but it's you

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:03.420
know the juice to some extent isn't

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.760
worth the squeeze just financially

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:07.350
speaking but now when we go to pax we go

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.940
to the tanks West in Seattle because

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:10.410
it's a three-hour drive away and again

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:12.750
it's like a nice vacation for us but

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:14.670
it's also like because that show is so

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:17.670
like gamer focused it's a good

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:19.440
opportunity for us to to meet fans

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:22.770
basically and you know to have

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:24.559
conversations with fans and I think

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:28.620
that's like the cool part of the pax for

00:28:24.559 --> 00:28:30.420
us now it definitely like the first time

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:35.100
I went to pax with a media badge I was

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:37.380
like I can do anything I can get out of

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:40.070
here don't you see the you little yellow

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:42.809
tag on my badge I can skip the line I

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:46.590
could sell four copies of this game if

00:28:42.809 --> 00:28:48.740
people really liked it where we going

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:52.080
here we go just go up to the Cathedral

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:53.460
but but yeah now as much sometimes like

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.809
it gets awkward this is good I'm

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.340
tripping over myself to make myself

00:28:54.809 --> 00:28:58.650
sound like a nice guy here to some

00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:00.059
extent but you know sometimes developers

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:01.050
they'll see that you've got this

00:29:00.059 --> 00:29:03.750
different kinds of badges you're gonna

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:05.820
have a pax you're like you can have like

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:08.190
a media badge which implies that you

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:09.900
work in the media you have a regular

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:11.970
badge you have an exhibitor badge which

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:13.230
is like you're exhibiting something at

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:15.059
the show in case that's not abundantly

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:16.380
clear and you know sometimes developers

00:29:15.059 --> 00:29:17.580
will see the media badge and they'll be

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:20.160
like you know do you want to skip the

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:21.660
line and previously it was like a hell

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.980
yeah you know I understand if you

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:26.060
working like IGN or something like that

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:28.560
and you're like I see 40 games today

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:30.000
this would be very helpful for me and

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:32.640
could also help you as well but now I'm

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.820
like nah man these people you know they

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:38.460
paid like a hundred sometimes more than

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:40.770
a hundred bucks to get in the door you

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:43.410
know pay for flights hotels stuff like

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:45.630
that and they I can wait in line with

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:50.610
everybody else you know I'm okay with

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:51.780
that I want to skip the line most of the

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:53.940
time there will be someone in the

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:55.590
comments is like I saw in LA I don't

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:57.600
know why I use that voice because I

00:29:55.590 --> 00:30:01.530
disagree with them I guess but I saw NL

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:03.420
impacts in 2014 and he skipped a line

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:05.460
and cost me my chance to play nidhogg

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:07.620
look if that actually happened I'm sorry

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:09.210
but I am I'm sceptical I don't remember

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:11.640
that specific situation I believe I ever

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:14.400
played nidhogg at PAX I did play nidhogg

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.840
two attacks and we waited in line like

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.570
normal people and I remember that

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:20.400
because it was two months ago three

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:25.290
months ago I don't know 2017 is going by

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:26.520
crazy fast for me I have a theory that

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:28.980
I'm not even sure it's one of those

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:30.210
theories that seem so obvious that when

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:31.350
I say it I'm pretty sure people are

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:33.390
going to be like yeah that's a thing

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:34.890
it's called this stop pretending you

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:39.180
invented it but it's converged

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:42.600
convergent evolution I assure you I feel

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:46.620
like when I was like 10 years old

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:51.480
one month felt like one year feels in my

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:54.210
life now like the older you get the the

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:58.370
lower a percentage of your lifetime each

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:58.370
unit of time is if that makes sense

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:02.760
trying to think of how to explain it you

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:06.260
know like one year when you're 10 is 10%

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:08.550
of your life we don't really need that

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:10.500
one year when you're when you're almost

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:13.230
30 years like 3% of your life so the

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:15.690
years for me I feel like on a relative

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:18.690
scale or just flying by days are

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:20.840
obviously the same length oh dude peep

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:20.840
it

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:35.990
ah picture yourself with the dance panty

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:44.430
gambits you've got to the chest

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:51.210
mm within 30mins a dangerous item shows

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:54.390
itself so bustling there you jeopardize

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:55.980
your win see that's Lucy in the Sky with

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:59.280
Diamonds but I didn't really think about

00:31:55.980 --> 00:32:01.410
how to tie it back to the existence of

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.970
the crooked penny there which I also

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:05.490
called dad's penny but that time I had

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:08.900
an excuse because it syllabic Lee was

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:08.900
not going to work out with crooked penny

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:16.650
anyway that's that's my perspective on

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:19.020
time I know I'm 14 and this is deep but

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:20.670
you get the idea it's not like I'm

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:25.050
maligning it if anything I'm like damn

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:28.110
dude do you know I'm like Wonder Woman

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:30.630
came out Captain America's Civil War

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:32.130
came out six weeks ago and Wonder

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:34.890
Woman's out already and they say well

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:36.480
actually that's I came out you know last

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:39.420
year and I say no no they came out right

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:43.200
after the Avengers and they say NL the

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:45.260
Avengers came in 2012 and I say no no it

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:48.750
didn't it came out last year

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:50.400
Iron Man came out three years ago I say

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:53.340
like I had the last Iron Man movie was

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:57.450
like four years ago I know you get

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:59.280
confused you know in your old age you

00:32:57.450 --> 00:33:03.660
know the early onset dementia

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:05.190
I still say like you know we're now at

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:07.740
the point where I would say like almost

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:10.770
everybody in the in our in our circle of

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:12.420
collaborators is not old but old enough

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:13.860
that you don't have to say they're a

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:15.420
young adult they I don't know how we

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:18.120
created that by the way that that

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:19.520
eternal heart there linger beam must

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:21.200
have been linger people

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:23.000
like it's not that they're not young

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.980
people but you don't have to say young

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.409
adult anymore there's the dulls and I

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.799
