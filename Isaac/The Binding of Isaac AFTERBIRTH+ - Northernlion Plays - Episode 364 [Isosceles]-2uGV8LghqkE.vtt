##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.710
everybody welcome Aaron lamboy so

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.500
anyways is the right side of the right

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.820
one okay welcome at dinner on the land

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.610
place inviting ones gather applause I'm

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.040
not sweating where we're at in terms of

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.199
uh you know post-it notes I'm just doing

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.150
things I know need to be done eight 9 j7

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:25.260
k t6e not taking a structured approach

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:27.660
necessarily yeah except that we got a

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.619
luck upgrade instead of an okay orbital

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.540
probably not worth it but it might be

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.300
close to being worth it depending on you

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.290
know what one luck upgrade actually

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.270
means for us but I'm not going to

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.860
belabor the point with the you know a

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.090
discussion of the analytical breakdown

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.460
especially because I brought a graph

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.710
here let me pull it up for you give me a

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.289
moment here I'm just joking I just like

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:54.510
that I can one tap to the overlay on a

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.980
moment's notice here how's it going I'm

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.410
recording this rate after the last

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.620
episode so I'm plumb out of grocery

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.290
store analogies and and anecdotes not

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.960
analogies I do have grocery store

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.270
analogies for example when you go to the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.280
grocery store how do you explore the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.020
grocery store hmm we should open that

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.040
not necessarily worth it but probably

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.990
not not worth it I am a round the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.119
outside grocery store man and then I hit

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.659
the interior aisles as necessary when I

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.579
grew up you know I hope I'm not outing

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.970
my parents by saying this but it's

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.880
pretty embarrassing my parents were all

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.409
aisle people so you start in the produce

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.850
section you know fresh fruits and

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.170
vegetables it's Pradas see I nipped in

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.380
the bud there now you don't know what to

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.420
say and then you go through all the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.770
aisles 1 by 1 cm what you need and then

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.200
you come out in the frozen food section

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.259
you grab what you get and then you go up

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.079
to the front and you pay now it isn't

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.869
like it was a decision that was made to

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.430
just you know be because people say you

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.540
know if you shop around the grocery

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.799
store rather than through the grocery

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.550
store it's healthier because you're

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.470
getting you know mostly just fresh

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.680
fruits and vegetables the meat usually

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.939
the meat section is around the edges and

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.579
you know there you go you got a balanced

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:18.859
diet their fruits vegetables and meats

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:21.379
--is but it's really just cuz I don't

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:26.629
venture into the aisles too often I know

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:29.269
what I want okay ah we blew it we did

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.129
not blow it oh my lord I can't believe

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.659
we didn't get hit there now we've been

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:38.420
given a golden gift it's our job not to

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:40.280
squander it we'll try to go in there as

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.930
well to give a chance um I don't know

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.829
how we made that dodge that's like a top

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:49.879
50 NL dodge in in Isaac and I'm not even

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:51.409
being sarcastic here but I just say I

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.090
basically have like the same grocery

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:55.879
list every time I go to the grocery

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.349
store first off we do get this like meal

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.530
delivery service I should have gotten

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:03.500
the two bombs first but we do get this

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.349
meal delivery service so like half of

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.849
our dinners per week are handled but

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.579
then apart from that it's a very easy

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.169
process Kate wants like one week of meal

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.299
replacement drinks that's her breakfast

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:16.669
sorted I get one box of cereal that's my

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.799
breakfast sorted problem solved loaf of

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:21.229
bread that goes bad as far into the

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:25.010
future as possible enough lunch meat to

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:27.530
make you know four or five sandwiches if

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.979
I need granola bars or buy granola bars

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:36.650
get like five of a fruit of my choice

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:42.109
and then I'm out usually get that gets

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:45.379
the job done well no we usually get like

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:48.139
some spring mix you know like some spin

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:49.459
interest and kale you know lettuce

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.259
something like that to throw in as well

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.979
usually that gets the job done and it's

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:56.540
an easy grocery trip you know oh

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:58.519
sometimes little apple juice as well but

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.329
that's not at my best but I will drink

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.349
it if it's there could go to the curse

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.090
room right away we're not going to go

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.069
for like I don't understand the concept

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.290
of a grocery list I've aged out of the

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.659
concept of a grocery list it's almost

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.689
impossible to get me to try a new food

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:17.000
at the grocery store

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:20.060
it might sound boring but you know we

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.340
get enough variety from the blue apron

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.750
style stuff that it ticket ends up

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.910
working out just fine most of the time

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.010
50 cent has got to be

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.710
the best rapper of all time for one but

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.810
also a good opportunity for us to get

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.920
that second level of shop upgrade sadly

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.750
that did not happen but that's fine I

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.460
see it happening all that like actually

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.170
I would lie die did have another grocery

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.580
store anecdote is exactly the same as

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:47.030
the deli counter except it was in the

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:50.840
salsa section you know world's foods as

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.610
we call it I was there and I was like I

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.230
know what salts I want can I get the

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.460
salsa and then there was a lady in front

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.490
of me she picked up like four different

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.020
containers of salsa and she was doing a

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.640
rigorous comparative analysis of them

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.970
and I had to sort of like sidle my way

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.590
in there and grab one in a way I'm not

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.780
begrudging her at all I'm actually not

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.490
envious necessarily but a little envious

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.830
because she's about to discover a new

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:16.070
salsa and that's a magical moment in

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:20.330
anybody's life I'm going to take bows

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.680
but only because we are going to need to

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.330
take one of those items at some point

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.770
anyway and then I you know it's

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.120
available whether or not that was the

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.400
right decision but I'm going to do it

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.420
anyway and we have another spirit heart

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.740
for sale in here so I'm going to grab

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.260
the sphere at our go to the cursive and

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.200
then bounce there's nothing like

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:39.640
discovering a new snack food I've

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:44.230
recently I discovered a new salsa I

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:46.610
guess I am a hypocrite but there's a

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.140
Mexican food of Vancouver's it does

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.670
always get the job done there's a couple

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:54.410
of great places everyone loves Sally

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:57.980
limo on a set of French for some reason

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.240
French Lee but on King's way everyone's

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.390
a big fan of that for good reason but

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.950
not they're all kind of like you know

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.750
Canadian tex-mex are you going to get

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.910
out of bed for Canadian tex-mex maybe

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.860
maybe not but there's a company called

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.590
freshest best that makes tortilla chips

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.060
and salsa and they're all delicious they

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.760
knock it out of the park so if you

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:21.320
happen to find yourself in Vancouver oh

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.670
no I would recommend I mean if you're

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.410
here is like you're staying in a hotel

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.730
don't go to the grocery store buy salsa

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.170
because someone on the internet told you

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.260
to you weirdo I'm just looking out for

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:32.030
you but you know if you get the chance

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.240
to pick it up I would recommend it

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:37.510
personally we go baby I'm not against

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.710
old El Paso or you know paste etc etc

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:42.200
but when you go from the

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.630
fresh salsa to the like jarred salsa

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.450
it's really the jarred salsa just tastes

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:51.530
like you're eating thick you know strong

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:54.320
tomato ketchup not my favorite thing but

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.090
still I'll take it over no salsa at all

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.130
he was established I could eat salsa as

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:02.870
if it were a despacho and be a happy man

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:04.160
okay they're excited and I am shouldn't

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.060
call it and I'm excited bill they should

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.980
call it I'm mad cuz I'm not excited

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:13.220
they're excited I'm just angry about the

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:16.340
situation that has presented itself we

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.900
could die on this one I mean I can't

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.420
complain about dying on this one because

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:26.870
it really would be predominantly my own

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:28.760
fault I gave away an HP upgrade now in a

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.230
way it sort of worked out as we got

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:36.010
damage out of it oh my god I'm excited

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:36.010
dude I'm excited as to it lasts too long

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:51.820
there's still not normal speed dude and

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.820
they never will be again apparently

00:07:54.850 --> 00:08:04.670
Jesus Christ oh my lord no more I bets

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:06.440
they're still excited I'm not I'm only

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:11.830
mad because I think that this is a

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:14.480
mistake like I actually think that maybe

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:16.460
somebody just left the wrong number in

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.740
the code you know they it was supposed

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:21.860
to be zero point two but they made it 20

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:25.600
instead or something like that I'm gonna

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:34.880
die probably possibly no okay we're back

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:36.979
somehow I'm excited you know actual

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.420
candidate for most annoying pill in the

00:08:36.979 --> 00:08:40.610
game by the way I know we've got mr.

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:43.250
boom boom boom I want you in my room

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:46.310
back there but I'm not sure if I want to

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:48.020
go back for that I don't know if I want

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:53.030
to have mr. boom on the payroll right

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:55.850
now I know we can suck it up I guess I

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:58.130
didn't make that clear enough but how

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:59.090
tanky is this guy's a too tanky is the

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:04.640
correct answer

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:06.950
oh my god that's the end of that grocery

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.680
store anecdote for real this time we

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:12.050
could get booger tears or the nose

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:14.030
Goblin whatever the you know industry

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:18.230
term is here no we can't actually

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:22.520
disregard I'm really unhappy that we

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:24.830
were unable to get a spirit heart that

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:28.460
was so good even though we took a hit

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:31.160
there you got to give it up because that

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:35.180
could have gone way worse it was handled

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:36.980
properly we have not seen an item room

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:43.780
yet that's not going to be a secret room

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:46.070
this could be a secret room I hate this

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:48.320
because the run is good it's just low on

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:50.320
HP would have really liked to have had

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.820
that second read hard right now but I

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:57.470
mean who could you blame but yourself

00:09:52.820 --> 00:10:00.380
right Bighorn so we could try to use a

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:02.850
bomb against Bighorn if we landed he's

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:05.759
going down

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:09.980
I don't understand he doesn't give you a

00:10:05.759 --> 00:10:09.980
telegraph or open his mouth you know

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:15.569
also it doesn't make sense to me from

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:17.730
game design standpoint when he opens his

00:10:15.569 --> 00:10:20.149
mouth he's pushing air out how is a bomb

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:22.470
getting in there if anything is

00:10:20.149 --> 00:10:24.899
outrageous diaphragm which allows them

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:27.660
to propel bombs out of it at alarming

00:10:24.899 --> 00:10:29.639
pace should prevent a bomb from coming

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.829
into it unless it was thrown at like an

00:10:29.639 --> 00:10:33.630
escape velocity appropriate to the

00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:39.980
situation you know what I mean probably

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:41.970
not a little mad mad about this one

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:44.910
shouldn't be because I did it to myself

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:46.350
but he also threw bombs in such a way as

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:49.139
to present like the most impossible

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:53.269
array to avoid of all time so you know

00:10:49.139 --> 00:10:53.269
Congrats you got me amazing

00:10:53.329 --> 00:10:58.259
you got it once you play enough of the

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.329
game you got to learn to handle losses

00:10:58.259 --> 00:11:03.029
appropriately or it can lead to some bad

00:11:00.329 --> 00:11:04.889
situations like I I think on an

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:06.630
emotional level my brain thinks that

00:11:04.889 --> 00:11:10.350
it's actually owed a win every time I

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:11.550
play Isaac I'm just going to be straight

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:13.529
with you though I don't think that we

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:17.279
played badly on that run I think we

00:11:13.529 --> 00:11:18.779
played totally fine did we take hits

00:11:17.279 --> 00:11:20.610
yeah we took some hits

00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:22.529
we took some it's on rooms that you

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:28.439
would expect a good player to sometimes

00:11:22.529 --> 00:11:30.000
take hits on but re-rolling the HP and

00:11:28.439 --> 00:11:32.699
taking literally every deal with the

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.990
devil is actually what killed us so it's

00:11:32.699 --> 00:11:37.380
kind of like beside the point

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:40.050
okay okay okay is the poly on going to

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:41.850
be the new Judas for me I can't you know

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:43.740
buy a win with apollyon to save my life

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:46.399
I don't think so I like apollyon I

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:48.689
understand apollyon to some extent

00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:50.550
why didn't every role little monstro

00:11:48.689 --> 00:11:54.709
into a stat upgrade then cuz little

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:58.040
monstro was lovely it's a fantastic item

00:11:54.709 --> 00:12:00.630
you can't say no to this little Slugger

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:03.600
he's amazing at what he does he does a

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:07.829
lot of damage also great for

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:09.630
extinguishing fires blowing up poops I

00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:11.699
don't like the the tear height on the

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:12.789
shots but I mean can't always get what

00:12:11.699 --> 00:12:15.139
you want right

00:12:12.789 --> 00:12:17.059
so we should be fine moving forward here

00:12:15.139 --> 00:12:20.569
I mean I'm mostly just disappointed that

00:12:17.059 --> 00:12:22.399
I died because it's going to cost me ten

00:12:20.569 --> 00:12:24.019
minutes and I don't know if the salsa

00:12:22.399 --> 00:12:26.259
analogy is really enough to carry those

00:12:24.019 --> 00:12:33.829
first ten minutes apart from the

00:12:26.259 --> 00:12:35.659
gameplay itself so who knows ideally be

00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:38.689
an interesting conversation to have

00:12:35.659 --> 00:12:40.219
what was your school lunch like as a

00:12:38.689 --> 00:12:42.829
child and I'm not talking about like

00:12:40.219 --> 00:12:45.789
your cafeteria lunch I'm talking about

00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:48.319
your brown bags you know what you take

00:12:45.789 --> 00:12:50.059
when your mom was making it for you I

00:12:48.319 --> 00:12:52.189
don't I don't not understand your own

00:12:50.059 --> 00:12:53.709
dietary preferences I'm interested in

00:12:52.189 --> 00:12:55.549
knowing what the average like

00:12:53.709 --> 00:12:57.949
eleven-year-old eats where you're from

00:12:55.549 --> 00:13:00.709
and then the difference is that we can

00:12:57.949 --> 00:13:02.179
tease out between it because I can tell

00:13:00.709 --> 00:13:03.619
you straight up I remember it like it's

00:13:02.179 --> 00:13:07.189
yesterday you know you open up your

00:13:03.619 --> 00:13:09.769
brown bag when you got in there usually

00:13:07.189 --> 00:13:11.839
white bread sandwich with a kind of meat

00:13:09.769 --> 00:13:13.849
on it and my mom does this I did not

00:13:11.839 --> 00:13:14.679
inherit it from her because I do not do

00:13:13.849 --> 00:13:17.059
this myself

00:13:14.679 --> 00:13:18.619
usually let's say it's like a ham and

00:13:17.059 --> 00:13:20.479
cheese sandwich she would butter the

00:13:18.619 --> 00:13:22.279
bread and then put the ham and cheese on

00:13:20.479 --> 00:13:25.309
so the meat sandwiches were buttered

00:13:22.279 --> 00:13:27.829
it's not an uncommon thing but when I

00:13:25.309 --> 00:13:29.929
talk to people roughly my age about it

00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:32.119
they go oh yeah my mom did that too and

00:13:29.929 --> 00:13:35.389
it's freaking weird and mom I love you

00:13:32.119 --> 00:13:37.129
but it is I don't know because she

00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:39.169
probably inherited it from her parents

00:13:37.129 --> 00:13:41.439
who you know grew up in the 1950s where

00:13:39.169 --> 00:13:43.699
they were just like why not

00:13:41.439 --> 00:13:47.629
butters delicious put it on everything

00:13:43.699 --> 00:13:50.289
you know the Paula Deen aged making

00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:52.699
questionable decisions and you know

00:13:50.289 --> 00:13:53.569
facing off in the cold war against the

00:13:52.699 --> 00:13:56.899
Soviet Union

00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:59.239
either way those are the two defining

00:13:56.899 --> 00:14:03.429
characteristics in the 1950s is cold war

00:13:59.239 --> 00:14:06.220
hysteria and buttered meat sandwiches

00:14:03.429 --> 00:14:10.009
then that's like the piece de resistance

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:13.699
obviously uh I like it when you talk

00:14:10.009 --> 00:14:15.499
French to me NL secret route it is a

00:14:13.699 --> 00:14:16.879
secret room I want the nine bolt and

00:14:15.499 --> 00:14:19.339
we're going to get the nine ball well my

00:14:16.879 --> 00:14:21.519
baby wants my baby gets and grab this as

00:14:19.339 --> 00:14:21.519
well

00:14:22.989 --> 00:14:29.420
usually when I was younger when I was in

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:31.910
like middle school elementary school my

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:33.529
the first snack you know usually a like

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:36.170
a snack lunch and then a snack

00:14:33.529 --> 00:14:37.670
throughout the day one in the afternoon

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:39.619
one in the morning so first snack was

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:41.509
usually a container of fruit snacks and

00:14:39.619 --> 00:14:44.480
when I got older it was like an apple or

00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:46.759
like some cheese you know relatively

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.079
wholesome so usually fruit snacks I

00:14:46.759 --> 00:14:51.889
don't know I don't understand fruit

00:14:48.079 --> 00:14:53.179
snacks as an adult but when your kid

00:14:51.889 --> 00:14:54.619
wants fruit snacks I guess you get them

00:14:53.179 --> 00:14:56.509
fruit snacks is that the deal I've never

00:14:54.619 --> 00:14:57.920
purchased them as an adult I do think

00:14:56.509 --> 00:14:59.119
fruit snacks are a food for children but

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.410
I don't want to go down that without

00:14:59.119 --> 00:15:04.249
having people who have dissenting

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:05.989
opinions because this is free for us

00:15:04.249 --> 00:15:07.309
basically otherwise it seems like I'm

00:15:05.989 --> 00:15:08.600
punching down at fruit snacks and that's

00:15:07.309 --> 00:15:10.100
not my intention this time we're going

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.829
to learn our lesson and take our HP even

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:16.059
though we have nine lives

00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:19.160
then afternoon snack usually is like

00:15:16.059 --> 00:15:21.199
trying to think at this point it depends

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:24.439
like sometimes you get like some carrot

00:15:21.199 --> 00:15:26.689
sticks kids need like apparently like 12

00:15:24.439 --> 00:15:28.189
calories a day to survive an apple a

00:15:26.689 --> 00:15:30.679
small sandwich and some carrot sticks

00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:33.829
that's all you need and then for juice

00:15:30.679 --> 00:15:35.540
it would be like or for a drink I should

00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:37.639
say it usually be like a juice box like

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:40.100
a 120 milliliter thing of grape juice

00:15:37.639 --> 00:15:42.649
but sometimes you get those high tier

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:44.240
lunches like if you guys had Fried

00:15:42.649 --> 00:15:46.009
Chicken the night before and they were

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.660
leftovers you get like a cold piece of

00:15:46.009 --> 00:15:51.709
fried chicken in your lunch and you eat

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:52.699
it so good sometimes you know mom went

00:15:51.709 --> 00:15:54.619
to the grocery store and she bought

00:15:52.699 --> 00:15:57.829
Lunchables and you're like oh my god

00:15:54.619 --> 00:15:59.929
pizza Lunchables I'm going to be asked

00:15:57.829 --> 00:16:01.339
I didn't kill us I'm going to be the

00:15:59.929 --> 00:16:03.230
envy of all my friends

00:16:01.339 --> 00:16:06.439
thanks to Kanye's new workout plan on

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:09.139
the envy of all my friends now the pizza

00:16:06.439 --> 00:16:10.819
Lunchables at the at the time up to a

00:16:09.139 --> 00:16:12.860
certain age we're definitely atop to

00:16:10.819 --> 00:16:14.509
your lunch now I would rather have the

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:17.720
buttered meat sandwich I think but for a

00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:19.970
while it was that was like oh look who's

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:22.639
mom actually loves him a buttered meat

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:27.330
sandwich you know why we didn't die we

00:16:22.639 --> 00:16:30.100
had the spirit heart totally forgot

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:31.390
and then like when we went to I mean

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.220
Michael al Fox can tell you all about

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:34.750
this we had a bad cafeteria in high

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.370
school no disrespect to the people

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.930
running it you know you're talking about

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.970
a high school with 300 people we didn't

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:42.420
get a lot of like economies of scale we

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:45.480
had like weird microwaved hamburgers

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:47.440
weird microwave cheeseburgers and then

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:50.560
Fridays were fish and chips today it

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:52.420
wasn't too too bad Tuesday's were this

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:55.840
weird thing cuz and it's apparently a

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:57.880
Canadian thing Mexican fries it's

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.510
basically all the nacho ingredients you

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:02.380
could imagine

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:04.540
poured on top of french fries we have it

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:07.810
at Taco Bell up here as well is it weird

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:10.300
I suppose so yeah fairly delicious

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:12.400
though I mean dude

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.680
Steven two runs in a row it's a blessed

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:19.540
run or is it a curse run we're about to

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:22.570
find out I don't know definitely like I

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:28.030
hope this is different in today's

00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:30.670
generation but probably like one third

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:33.040
of my high school class ate french fries

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:35.050
at any given lunchtime and I'm not

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:37.210
talking about like they had you know a

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:39.100
salad and french fries I'm saying like

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:40.870
what did you have for lunch today I ate

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.700
french fries dude this is like a revenge

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:44.440
film it's our Empire Strikes Back which

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:49.570
implies that we're the evil empire here

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:54.820
but I'll accept that we're much more

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:56.620
well prepared this time and I've once a

00:17:54.820 --> 00:18:03.000
week I was with them you know get some

00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:06.100
cafeteria poutine shouldn't be legal

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.840
maybe should be legal I don't know it's

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:10.420
one of those things I flip-flop back and

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:12.670
forth with many times in my life when I

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:15.160
was like 17 years old I was like soda

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:16.570
should be illegal and now that I'm 28

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:19.000
I'm a little bit more moderate you know

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:21.390
you many people and I say everybody many

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.870
people tend to mellow out with age like

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:28.000
soda is just a drug that controls you

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:30.580
mind it makes you you know overweight

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.520
and diabetic now I'm like soda is kind

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:36.070
of delicious so I think people should be

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:38.500
able to make their own decisions we run

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:39.170
into this on the on the NL SS all the

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:43.130
time

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:45.110
because austin eats a delivery flash

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:47.390
takeout fairly frequently and we

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:48.920
oftentimes talk about fast food will be

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:50.810
I go what are your fast food ranking so

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:54.200
I like Wendy's more than McDonald's

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:56.210
you're crazy you know that's the NL SS

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.130
brand in a nutshell help how did I get

00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:00.320
into this great big bloody nutshell etc

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:03.250
etc and there's always like some people

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:06.950
in chat they go you know lull America

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:10.280
how can you eat that food that is not

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:12.470
said ray I only eat that to French

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:15.950
Laundry with chef Heston Blumenthal you

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:17.990
know congratulations apparently you ever

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:19.520
eat fast food apparently you're an idiot

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:23.420
according to some people in twitch chat

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:25.520
but that's why I take issue with that

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:28.460
because I I have to listen to these

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:29.690
people who are you know supporting me

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.880
and thank you very much for the support

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:33.080
I received it graciously at the same

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.480
time they remind me a little bit of

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:37.430
myself when I was a more militant as a

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:40.040
teenager and I'm like ah you know what I

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:42.170
you know you got it people need their

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:44.570
own level of responsibility to things I

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:46.520
think because wait what do you when do

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:47.930
you stop outlawing anything is bad for

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.720
you I guess nothing you should now love

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:51.700
things that are bad for you like I

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.750
understand the idea of having like

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:56.810
prohibitive taxes on things like alcohol

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:57.920
cigarettes you know etc etc but at some

00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:00.350
point if you're gonna be like you know

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:03.140
beefs illegal then you well maybe beeps

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:05.720
not bad reviews nd you know fried foods

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:07.700
are illegal and you're like oh well when

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:09.470
they came for the cigarettes I said

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.810
nothing and then they came for the KFC

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:17.540
and you know Here I am losing my

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:22.010
two-piece I don't know basically but I

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:24.050
do wonder sometimes because like maybe

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:26.510
McDonald's is actually I don't need

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:29.690
McDonald's super frequently oh my god we

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:34.040
do have wait what but every now and then

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:36.350
I get like a mentally hypnotic craving

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:38.510
for chicken nuggets sincerely I'm like I

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:42.650
can't focus unless I have chicken

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:44.810
nuggets right now and I wonder if that's

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:46.220
just because I ate them as a child you

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:47.810
know dan and I talked about this in a

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.940
hearthstone episode weirdly enough but

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:52.430
when I was a kid you know there was that

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:52.760
like Bukit program from Pizza Hut he's

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:54.590
like if

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.850
read books you'd earn points that you

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:59.020
could use those points to get free

00:20:55.850 --> 00:21:02.360
personal pan pizzas so I always had this

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:04.640
association with Pizza Hut where now as

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:06.770
an adult I'm like Pizza Hut I don't I

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:08.660
recognize that it's maybe not that good

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:12.470
but it's the greatest food in the world

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:15.590
to me even if they do spray grease on

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:17.600
the on the pizza to make it shiny I

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:20.810
think it's because as a child we've

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:22.730
associated it with you know a job well

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:24.230
done with like Oh mom and dad have taken

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:26.060
me to Pizza Hut because I did so good in

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:27.950
the Bukit program this month it's

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:30.830
insidious you know and those decisions

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:35.150
not decisions those patterns can hold

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:36.560
true in adulthood as well so I wonder

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:39.170
like what happens if you raise a child

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:41.150
to eat healthy and then you know when

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:42.590
they get older you go hey we're going to

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:45.560
go to McDonald's and they go oh mom I

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:47.300
can't get any good salads at McDonald's

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.710
you think that would happen or would you

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:50.900
just raise a child that's really boring

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:52.430
because for some reason we equate eating

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:57.320
bad food with being more entertaining I

00:21:52.430 --> 00:22:01.370
don't know I don't know it's just it's

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:02.540
interesting to think about like I think

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:03.590
there's two kinds of people in the well

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:05.210
there's many kinds of people in the

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:06.320
world I think there are more than two

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:07.460
kinds of people in the world but there

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:13.310
are two kinds of people that are like

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:14.780
this one is Morgan Spurlock from Super

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:16.460
Size Me and the other one is the guy

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.930
that Morgan Spurlock interviews who eats

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.960
a quarter pounder with cheese every day

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:22.130
and that's it or a big mac every day

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:25.250
Morgan Spurlock's like I'm going to

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:27.020
investigate all the dietary effects of

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:28.670
eating a McDonald's and see the effects

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:30.680
it has and oh you know I've gained

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:32.600
weight and you know my peepee doesn't

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.190
work as well as they used to and my

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.380
moods fluctuating and then there's this

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:39.890
other guy who's like I just eat like one

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:42.140
Big Mac a day and nothing else and I

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:43.700
have the greatest life of all time at

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:46.070
some point in your life you have to

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.420
decide who are you going to be are you

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:50.200
going to be Morgan Spurlock are you

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:52.130
going to be Big Mac guy I think I've

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:54.950
grandfathered myself in the Morgan

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:57.580
Spurlock dumb but I am an vyas of the

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:57.580
Big Mac guys

00:22:58.029 --> 00:23:04.629
I wish I had I mean it's very

00:23:03.159 --> 00:23:07.799
self-serving to say I wish I could just

00:23:04.629 --> 00:23:09.820
turn my brain off and enjoy but no I

00:23:07.799 --> 00:23:11.440
because they think I think they've got

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.039
it figured out that dude at some point

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.989
in his life

00:23:12.039 --> 00:23:15.429
unless he's suffering from like a mental

00:23:13.989 --> 00:23:17.649
illness to something in which case you

00:23:15.429 --> 00:23:20.499
know then this takes on some troubling

00:23:17.649 --> 00:23:23.759
connotations perhaps but you know it'd

00:23:20.499 --> 00:23:26.379
be he was 16 he said I love two things

00:23:23.759 --> 00:23:28.509
screwin and even Big Macs I don't know

00:23:26.379 --> 00:23:29.739
why he had to love screwing as well it

00:23:28.509 --> 00:23:33.879
just made for a better quote I don't

00:23:29.739 --> 00:23:36.009
know maybe he hates screwing of two

00:23:33.879 --> 00:23:38.049
things screw in an eating Big Macs and

00:23:36.009 --> 00:23:40.389
if I can do both of them once a day for

00:23:38.049 --> 00:23:43.299
the rest of my life I'm gonna be a happy

00:23:40.389 --> 00:23:45.070
man and he's in my headcanon he's

00:23:43.299 --> 00:23:50.679
pursued that and if that isn't the

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:56.080
American dream I don't know what is so

00:23:50.679 --> 00:23:57.219
hats off to you Big Mac man I was

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.989
thinking about this the other day as

00:23:57.219 --> 00:24:01.210
well it was actually a week ago almost

00:23:58.989 --> 00:24:03.309
to the minute because I know okay now

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:05.259
we're going to see a movie last week at

00:24:03.309 --> 00:24:07.239
around this time we were at a restaurant

00:24:05.259 --> 00:24:10.119
and on there at the restaurant they had

00:24:07.239 --> 00:24:10.839
ESPN on and they were showing up Joey

00:24:10.119 --> 00:24:13.989
Chestnut

00:24:10.839 --> 00:24:14.589
winning the July 4th hot dog eating

00:24:13.989 --> 00:24:16.839
contest

00:24:14.589 --> 00:24:18.429
you know those every year at Coney

00:24:16.839 --> 00:24:20.799
Island they do that Nathan's Famous hot

00:24:18.429 --> 00:24:23.559
dog eating contest and Joey Chestnut

00:24:20.799 --> 00:24:25.869
eats like 90 hot dogs and wins a free

00:24:23.559 --> 00:24:27.519
t-shirt or something and the

00:24:25.869 --> 00:24:28.779
commentators were like laughing about

00:24:27.519 --> 00:24:31.479
you can tell it was a nice restaurant

00:24:28.779 --> 00:24:33.009
because they had ESPN on the TV with the

00:24:31.479 --> 00:24:34.839
sound on but the commentators were

00:24:33.009 --> 00:24:37.479
laughing about it they're like yeah you

00:24:34.839 --> 00:24:38.889
know he might be considered one of the

00:24:37.479 --> 00:24:44.159
greatest athletes of all time you know

00:24:38.889 --> 00:24:46.679
who real funny Bob that's all why not is

00:24:44.159 --> 00:24:50.639
competitive eating of ridiculous sport

00:24:46.679 --> 00:24:53.320
yeah like it's super ridiculous right

00:24:50.639 --> 00:24:55.929
but is it any more ridiculous than

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:57.519
taking a metal rod and smacking a little

00:24:55.929 --> 00:25:00.039
ball and trying to get it into a hole

00:24:57.519 --> 00:25:04.409
half a kilometer away is it any more

00:25:00.039 --> 00:25:07.450
ridiculous than you know taking a

00:25:04.409 --> 00:25:08.890
circular piece of plastic and throwing

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:11.049
it around with the

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:14.500
of American football you know the type

00:25:11.049 --> 00:25:16.690
of frisbee in that case but all sports

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:18.280
are inherently like a little ridiculous

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:21.850
aren't they they're all like an

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:24.910
incredibly arbitrary rule set that you

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:29.559
know who is the best at shooting a you

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:31.690
know 12 inch circumference rubber

00:25:29.559 --> 00:25:33.100
basketball through a hoop almost exactly

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:35.920
the same size of the basketball from

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:37.540
increasing distances away like it's it's

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:40.030
not like that dude

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:41.500
he's getting paid like it 80 million

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:42.880
dollars over the course of his contract

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:46.540
to be really good at like shooting a

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:48.669
rubber sphere into a hoop what does that

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:50.470
mean to them oh oh that's meant to

00:25:48.669 --> 00:25:52.690
replicate like how good of a hunter you

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:54.760
would have been on this that's to

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:56.080
demonstrate the brains capability at

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:58.780
recognizing Pat and all it's just

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:59.710
basketball not crabbing on basketballs

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:01.510
the same is hockey

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:04.620
hey strap these like weird shoes to your

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:06.760
ground you know go smack around this

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:07.900
vulcanized rubber thing try to get it

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.950
past a dude who's allowed to wear

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.059
different equipment than you because

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:11.740
otherwise the game wouldn't work

00:26:10.059 --> 00:26:15.160
properly you'd be scoring 12 goals a

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:17.380
period against teams other than the

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:20.350
Colorado Avalanche sick okay let's head

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:21.669
down here but the kids so I'm just

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:23.470
saying you know what it took me a while

00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:28.299
to warm up to it but kudos to you Joey

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:29.860
Chestnut why wouldn't you be one of the

00:26:28.299 --> 00:26:32.309
best athletes of all time just because

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:36.760
it's a sport that is not necessarily

00:26:32.309 --> 00:26:40.660
mainstream level popular like it's not

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:42.309
like it's any less merit than like you

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:45.100
know pool or something like that

00:26:42.309 --> 00:26:47.350
billiards and again don't I insulted the

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:49.510
sport that I like the most in this topic

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:51.429
of conversation I'm just saying it's all

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:56.260
the same thing which we as a society

00:26:51.429 --> 00:27:00.540
decide which sports are like fun to

00:26:56.260 --> 00:27:03.820
watch it's like ping-pong fun to watch

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:08.020
bullet ball sorry buddy not that fun to

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:12.150
watch men's volleyball not fun to watch

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:12.150
women's volleyball fun to watch

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:19.020
what were those bone animations dude I

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:21.240
cannot get a deal with the devil for the

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:27.690
life of me here luckily our stats are

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:29.100
like really good regardless but there's

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:30.300
like three levels of sports

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.220
there's mainstream as well it's like

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:34.050
regionally positive for level sports

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:36.300
it's like mainstream level worldwide

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:37.410
popularity soccer soccer is popular

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.810
worldwide yes

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:41.220
even in America soccer is popular there

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:45.030
are probably countries where soccer is

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:46.800
not that popular but those are the

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:48.810
exception rather than the rule yes even

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:50.640
in Canada soccer is popular is it as

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:53.550
popular as hockey Major League Baseball

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:57.120
no of course not because we on a global

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:59.160
level we stink at it oh you know it's

00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:00.150
more with the sports Canadians would

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.040
rather watch because there's like a

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:05.130
chance that we might do okay although we

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:08.580
did beat French Guiana in the CONCACAF

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:10.650
championship recently I don't vote do we

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:14.550
I don't think we need to pick it up at

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:16.140
least but then their sports and I would

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:18.660
even say like NFL football is popular

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:20.790
not necessarily the world over but the

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:25.950
Super Bowl at least is watched the world

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:26.940
over so to some extent so I was throwing

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:29.010
about football I'm probably like

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:30.860
baseball up there this it not

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:33.540
necessarily Major League Baseball but

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:36.080
you know some form of baseball is

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:41.940
popular in a lot of different places

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:44.280
worldwide Lisa was in Korea and Japan

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:46.410
but anyway and Canada the United States

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:48.840
and then like all those countries that

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:51.800
always beat us in the World Baseball

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:53.610
Classic and you go really but anyway

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:56.820
then there's sports that are like

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:59.300
regionally popular like you know ice

00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:02.430
hockey is sort of regionally popular

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:06.330
it's watched a lot of places but not

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:08.430
everywhere certainly like not well

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:11.760
represented on every time same would go

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:14.130
for like cricket a couple of places a

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:16.290
few places really love it not everybody

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:18.780
rugby maybe I don't know it's probably

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:21.030
in there then there's sports that are

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:22.740
like only popular during the Olympics

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:25.650
those are some of my favorites for

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:26.980
example the biathlon I'm going to take

00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:30.820
this because we're probably going to

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:35.169
I anyway and if we don't bonus but if we

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:37.179
do that's fine you know most forms of

00:29:35.169 --> 00:29:38.290
downhill skiing I'm not insulting

00:29:37.179 --> 00:29:40.030
probably there's probably like so many

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:41.590
people for whom they're like I've

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:42.880
dedicated my life to this sport and now

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:45.010
you're crapping on it look if you

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.730
dedicated your life to the biathlon I'm

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:48.580
sorry

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:51.580
nobody outside of like Finland is

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:52.900
watching that on mass unless it's in the

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:54.340
Olympics in their country stands a

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:56.230
chance I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:58.000
news you should have known this

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:59.169
shouldn't be a surprise it's the market

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.120
research you do before you enter the

00:29:59.169 --> 00:30:06.130
business ok curling to some extent

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:08.110
regionally popular in parts of the world

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:11.290
including Canada but mostly I think of

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:14.110
an Olympic sport the vast majority of

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:15.910
swimming events etc anything that takes

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:22.179
place in a specialized arena like a

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:23.620
velodrome counts as well but just saying

00:30:22.179 --> 00:30:25.780
and then there's sports that are just

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:28.240
not popular at all even like within the

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:32.260
Olympics the sports that they show like

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:35.860
no you might have missed it we did the

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:40.870
men's 190 kilometer marathon today and

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:42.640
here's the winners under the sports

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:44.500
merit is not measured in terms of its

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.540
popularity either in terms of what it

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:49.059
gives to the people who enjoy it you

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:51.220
know middle distance running not a great

00:30:49.059 --> 00:30:54.309
spectator sport you do it yourself you

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:58.090
know you learn more about your body you

00:30:54.309 --> 00:31:00.100
learn it's kind of meditation it's a

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:02.650
therapeutic sort of exercise that you

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:09.270
know if you don't get shin splints can

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:11.710
be almost downright Pleasant ping pong

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:14.160
great opportunity to make money off of

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:18.820
hustling people in your University quad

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:22.360
foosball same thing we almost got tags

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:26.350
there I still think we're gonna win but

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:28.919
it's been a little hard fought 9 damage

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:28.919
is good

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:35.870
very good in fact with five rate-of-fire

00:31:32.809 --> 00:31:37.789
especially but we've been hamstrung

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:40.929
quite greatly by our inability to get

00:31:37.789 --> 00:31:43.700
any form of deal with the devil I

00:31:40.929 --> 00:31:45.559
basically only use void like black rune

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:48.640
from this point onwards which is maybe

00:31:45.559 --> 00:31:48.640
not the right course of action

00:31:53.049 --> 00:31:56.179
haki is going to be interesting in the

00:31:54.919 --> 00:31:57.620
next Winter Olympics because I mean

00:31:56.179 --> 00:31:59.809
maybe we're dating the episode at this

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:02.870
point but as of right now the NHL has

00:31:59.809 --> 00:32:04.309
not agreed to send its players to the

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:06.620
Olympics so we might end up with like a

00:32:04.309 --> 00:32:09.740
you know miracle and ice sort of

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:11.870
situation where we got like college kids

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:14.389
playing for Canada in the US or who

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:17.210
knows you know the players might choose

00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:20.389
to forgo an NHL contract or like pay

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:24.159
whatever penalties are required to send

00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:26.630
themselves to the Olympics beats me dude

00:32:24.159 --> 00:32:28.279
normally you'd have like a training camp

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:30.139
almost at this point over the summer to

00:32:28.279 --> 00:32:32.090
get people ready but or to get the

00:32:30.139 --> 00:32:34.010
players ready I know people with a

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:35.809
little sports talk you know what screw

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:37.220
you by the way and I mean that in the

00:32:35.809 --> 00:32:38.600
nicest way possible make sure you use a

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:40.970
twitch Prime subscription if you haven't

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:43.610
already but but if you're one of those

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:49.419
people who's like a sports ball don't do

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:52.730
that okay if you're mad at jocks I

00:32:49.419 --> 00:32:57.559
understand okay it's not fair that in

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:59.450
high school you know football team gets

00:32:57.559 --> 00:33:00.919
all the gifts all the money you know

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:03.110
gets all the funding gets all the glory

00:33:00.919 --> 00:33:05.840
you're over here and you know reach for

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:08.240
the top trivia team wondering why you

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:10.100
can't eat can we get a new pencils for

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:12.889
the trivia team oh sorry can't afford it

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:14.840
we need to buy you know natty light

00:33:12.889 --> 00:33:19.190
cases for the football team this is not

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:22.460
really a correct example but I dispute

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:24.429
that I was standing there but okay but

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:26.990
just get over it

00:33:24.429 --> 00:33:29.500
you said it many times in the past on

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:33.399
this show but football is just an RPG

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:33.399
it's a strategy game

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:37.840
played by people who have leveled

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:41.410
themselves up physically in real life

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:45.670
let's go we even beat the odds I'm

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:53.440
amazed yeah we'll take black powder we

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:55.180
can afford to little scared sports and

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:57.760
games are the same thing sports are just

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:59.500
games you play with your body let's be

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:02.520
nice to one oh that's be the generation

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:04.300
that stops a sports ball and also stops

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:07.960
Dungeons &amp; Dragons

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:11.260
I think we're if you're like the

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:13.419
generation behind mine like the younger

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:15.510
generation I think you guys are doing a

00:34:13.419 --> 00:34:19.419
good job from what I can see anyway

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:21.130
certainly D&amp;D was like still it was a

00:34:19.419 --> 00:34:22.690
little stigmatized when I was in high

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:26.260
school I didn't know anybody that played

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:29.100
D&amp;D that I know of because it was you

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:33.370
know you're like a closeted D&amp;D player

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:34.899
cool what about matches the gathering we

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:44.159
might be able to break that stigma at

00:34:34.899 --> 00:34:44.159
some point together if we work very hard

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:51.280
this run I'm shocking it up it's like

00:34:48.399 --> 00:34:54.280
50% bad play because I think the play

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:57.610
has been okay and 50% like a suboptimal

00:34:54.280 --> 00:35:02.500
seed what is this that's too many

00:34:57.610 --> 00:35:05.440
enemies again like our stats are good

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:07.480
but we took damage at some very poor

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:10.510
times and it didn't quite get the tools

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:12.400
we need for success so as much as I'm

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:14.200
tempted to kind of avoid this we should

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:17.710
just grab it that's the that's the smart

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:20.610
money right there no doubt Jakub

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:20.610
now

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:25.630
what was I talking about before we went

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:39.010
off on this Sports tangent I don't know

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:42.160
doesn't matter okay help just frightened

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:44.680
people they always use them because what

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:47.140
do you see when you first start doing it

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:49.180
you know some of you do this some of you

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:50.410
don't some of you are watching the

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:52.030
videos because you find them

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:53.320
entertaining and some of them and that's

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:55.030
it and some of you are watching the

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:56.860
videos because you know you find it

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:58.300
entertaining but also in your mind you

00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:00.310
Harbor a desire to do this one day as a

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:05.350
career which I encourage you to pursue

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:06.310
it as sensibly as you can you know if

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:08.830
you're like I'm going to drop out of

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:11.560
college to start my youtube channel I

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:12.670
wouldn't I would I would continue doing

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:16.030
whatever you're doing in college and

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:17.620
then do this on the side because nobody

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:19.870
knows how to make it big on YouTube you

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:23.320
know just sort of little dash of luck

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:25.180
good timing knowing people many

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:26.470
combinations with its lead to success

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:28.780
and often times they don't lead to

00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:30.130
success but anyway this could be the end

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:33.100
of this run I just realised so we got to

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:34.390
be abundantly aware I forgot we're not

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:38.410
going the whole way so our odds of

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:39.820
success are actually quite high but if

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:41.770
you end up doing this as a career you

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:45.070
might have a face or a job at least you

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:47.800
might have a phase where you know people

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:50.290
go like you know lady what does anybody

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:51.250
watch anybody play videos of video games

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:52.990
on the internet when they could be

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:54.130
playing those video games themselves and

00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:55.780
then you have a chip on your shoulder

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:57.130
you go little loader you play whether

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.300
you watch people play football when you

00:36:57.130 --> 00:37:00.070
can play football yourself but I

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:01.330
actually don't think of what I do is

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:03.760
like a spectator sport

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:06.220
think of it more like a radio show or

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:08.890
something like that where you know you

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:11.470
found out there's no shortage of content

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:13.500
on the internet what you found hopefully

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:16.600
is like a host that you find

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:19.150
consistently somewhat enjoyable engaging

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:22.120
entertaining and you give it a shot no

00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:23.560
matter what they play you know it's like

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:25.090
finding an actor or an actress you

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:26.950
really like it I really like Giovanni

00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:28.660
Ribisi I'll see anything he's in a

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:30.190
million ways to die in the West what

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:37.430
could go wrong

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:39.860
really okay let's keep the cursor I mean

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:42.500
we we've won the run is the thing it's

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:45.290
all the more embarrassing that we are

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:47.270
having any losses when you remember that

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:50.870
every run only goes to moms hard to

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:52.340
begin with there's nothing wrong with

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:53.540
that chip on your shoulder as well

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:58.130
because I mean it's what you do it's

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:59.540
easy to get defensive but I just I don't

00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:02.870
know I've been doing it so long when

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:04.400
people are like well would anybody want

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:06.950
someone play things on the internet

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:08.270
first off I go I sort of understand

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:10.490
where you're coming from I didn't

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:11.750
understand why for a while to begin with

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:14.300
until I found people that I enjoyed

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:17.270
watching and then secondly I go it's

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:21.590
also you know I'm paying my rent for

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:24.800
like the past six years so you know step

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:26.690
off whoo I don't know what does anybody

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:28.910
ever show up at a Bed Bath &amp; Beyond

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:31.130
Janice but you let they allow you

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:32.690
assistant manage one allow you to

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:37.250
assistant manager one assistant to the

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:39.050
regional manager but good job

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:40.490
Millennials we're doing a good job of

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:42.170
killing these big-box stores I heard

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:46.250
that Buffalo Wild Wings is starting to

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:48.560
eat it thanks to us also department

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:52.040
stores Sears Canada just shut down or it

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:53.810
shuttered went bankrupt it's amazing I

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:56.000
don't mean that in a good way like a lot

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:57.410
of people lost their jobs careers that

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.990
they've held for like 30 or 40 years

00:38:57.410 --> 00:39:02.120
it's just a sign of the times you walk

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:06.470
into a Sears sometimes you go what is

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:09.320
this like a physical Amazon it's like

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:11.960
someone took this website and made it

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:12.230
into a physical store what's up with

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:17.000
that

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:19.640
what a strange concept I could use a new

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.760
shoes myself and we could all use a

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:24.410
family portrait Usk

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:27.380
I think we've seen that one before

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:30.080
smelter the game just got harder the

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:31.610
book of sin fantastic

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:33.020
