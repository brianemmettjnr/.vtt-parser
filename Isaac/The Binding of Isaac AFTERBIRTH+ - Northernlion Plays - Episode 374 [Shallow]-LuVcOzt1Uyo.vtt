##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.350
everybody welcome back to normal and

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.150
play funny once again through is Plus

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.139
where we lost n1 on the last episode

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:14.429
it's such a thing even possible yes

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:17.550
sorry yes I'm sorry I have to do it I'm

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.140
gonna do eaten first off you see this

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.100
precious hat you might not because I

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.519
just put this up with peas at vh0

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.260
4va not how you'd read that if you were

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.199
good at speaking English look at this

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.590
like a nice little cat hat it's like a

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.300
cute cat took or something like that

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.770
actually it's called a toboggan actually

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.530
I come from the land of the ice and snow

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.940
and it's called a freaking tube okay you

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.579
want to call it a bog and that's fine

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.200
what's day to you from Oh

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.660
Louisiana doesn't snow in Louisiana

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.700
actually in the very northern tip of

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.129
Louisiana on the top of a mountain it

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.809
snows once a year you got me all right

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.219
now they've gotten all the straw man out

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.530
of the way we got to d7 it's actually

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.129
like a really good start our rate of

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.350
fire is great for spawning at least for

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.119
having just spawned and I should say the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.159
d7 is good but I don't respect it the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.460
Sun card was nice our damage is probably

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.710
a little bit above average and you know

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.229
no stat stands out as being terrible our

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.810
HP is good as well so it's really really

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.310
a strong even start that doesn't

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.950
necessarily guarantee us a win but gives

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.570
us a good opportunity to it's like the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.950
Bill Gates said about you know how he's

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.110
going to set his children up you know

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.479
he's a multi-billionaire

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.600
he said his philosophy is going to make

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.600
it so those kids don't have to do

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.159
anything but they can't do nothing you

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.409
know they they can do whatever they want

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.030
they just can't sit on it and spin he

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.130
didn't add the spin part I added that

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.759
because what the Fonz says and he's a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.310
cool dude so I'm going to play with fire

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:59.060
Kevin Federline's debut album style the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.060
only album style debut only I'm not sure

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.450
would you rather own Paris Hilton's

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.400
discography or Kevin Federline's

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.240
discography there's no right answer to

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:12.690
that question by the way dude BB F is

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.090
actually stomping it's destroying every

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.560
enemy in his path and another speed

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.880
upgrade is very nice especially

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.860
considering we got a spear at heart to

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.800
begin with how do we win this run easily

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.870
we get an arcade on this floor and then

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.760
we're able to use the Sun card to Garen

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.160
oh we do have an arcade I use the Sun

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:35.250
card because I was impatient then we

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:37.980
guarantee ourselves an IV bag or a blood

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.510
bag and we just you know basically crap

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.400
on the game from there the step three is

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.790
just ball out of control and crap on the

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.310
game it's a little armchair quarterback

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.000
well how do you win in the NFL just stop

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.980
throwing so many interceptions it's not

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.120
that hard probably why you throwing so

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.120
many interceptions don't you know

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:02.790
interceptions are a bad thing for me I

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:06.000
have you on my fantasy team well we're

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.120
going to get bookworm I will say the d7

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.760
is a respectable item as in I'm supposed

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.280
to respect it I just sort of don't but

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.330
I'm going to go how to jump instead and

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.040
it's not that I think the d7 is

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.630
necessarily worse although I do think

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.640
how to jump is a little bit loud I work

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.580
that well how the jump is a little bit

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.350
more easy to understand I suppose and in

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:34.800
terms of like how to maximize this

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:37.440
benefit but I also just don't use the d7

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.800
properly rarely or I should say I don't

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:44.250
use the d7 properly almost all the time

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.989
let's just jump out of here we're still

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.060
really nice spot I'm going to go to the

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.530
item room before the shop and I will say

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.120
the finger pick up it's pretty solid

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.120
there finger pick up

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.340
stay away from me

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:03.120
I'm just trying to oh you're gonna make

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:06.000
me use my own bomb after all the things

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.250
I've done for this this run I don't know

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.370
what I was going to go for there after

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.690
all the things I've done to my country

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.030
actually I've wanted to talk about this

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.450
for a while but have abstained

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.970
what does Vin Diesel mean Wow

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.060
in Latin now what does Vin Diesel mean

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.650
in xxx

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:31.110
he's in the enemies like secret hideout

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.760
they give him a nice young lady with

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.380
whom to spend the night with I'm not

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.660
saying it was theirs to give but you

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.100
know it was on film they're not changing

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.810
it now unless there's a director's cut

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.040
you just gotta respect the directors

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.780
wishes I suppose she's nearly naked he

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.940
looks at her and goes the tzuke's I'm

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.490
gonna do for my country what does that

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.510
mean are you sleeping with her for

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.160
America doesn't that strike you as a

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.070
weird thing to say for a guy who's

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.420
undercover right now is that he's going

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.090
to go into the enemy base

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.620
they say the things I'm going to do for

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.630
my country she's going to report back to

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.240
the boss and be like hey he said the

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.350
things I'm going to do for my country

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.350
seems like he might be an undercover

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:19.260
secret agent for the American government

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:21.300
for the CIA just a weird way to lose you

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.200
know being deep undercover is all I'm

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:29.070
saying it's kind of irresponsible from

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:30.930
Vin Diesel well from Xander cage what's

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.390
the more ridiculous name Vin Diesel or

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.110
Xander cage

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.660
I'm going to say that Vin Diesel is a

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:42.600
more ridiculous name

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.580
because Xander cage is like that guy

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.150
could be the CEO of Spotify for all I

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:50.090
know

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:52.770
Vin Diesel can only be Vin Diesel or

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.310
like a male stripper in the Thunder Down

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.620
Under

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.150
uh you know what these aren't that good

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:02.670
let's go for a deal with the Angels

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:05.970
setup instead percocet glass of scotch

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:08.130
half a Molly and diesel jeans have

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.410
forgotten that there's these are

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:13.170
outdated means because vine is now you

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.840
know gone but if you searched and diesel

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:18.750
jeans I didn't invent a meme okay it's

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.400
just it's a good vine from somebody

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.990
whose I don't know there's probably a

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.840
private text that has now been taken out

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.460
of context but the guys are real happy

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:31.440
that he's wearing diesel jeans and is

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:35.160
under the influence of multiple legal

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:38.850
and illicit narcotics - percocet not

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.960
illegal unless you don't maybe it's

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:43.830
illegal to hold it if you don't have a

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:49.050
prescription port I don't know the kind

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:51.660
of thing I've never had to know as a non

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:54.090
consumer and also not member of law

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.590
enforcement thankfully I don't think I

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.790
would be a good police officer

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:01.590
I like confrontation whenever possible

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:03.990
I'm a non confrontational person because

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.250
I think people sometimes call me out but

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.980
I've got everything to lose and nothing

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:11.610
to gain from confrontation why would I

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:13.110
confront somebody risk not only

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:16.530
potentially getting punched in the face

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:18.120
but risk them proving me wrong and

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.590
they're like actually my kids sick and I

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.730
was just driving to the hospital really

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.320
fast and that's why I'm driving on the

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.560
shoulder of the road in traffic because

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.450
you know if not he's going to die

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.340
instead I just take the story running

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:32.070
through my own personal biased filter

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.660
and then tell it to you know 30,000

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.310
people in an Isaac episode and I'm

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.160
financially compensated for it as a

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:39.110
result

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.410
become a hero of the everyman it's the

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:44.690
birth I have no incentive to get into a

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:47.090
confrontation with anybody like I have

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:48.980
had an encounter once that I've talked

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.390
about many times with a mentally

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.790
disturbed person on the bus here in

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:57.110
Vancouver he called me a homophobic slur

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:58.490
and then you know berated me from the

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.540
back of the bus while I was sitting down

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.570
and people were like you should have

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:04.970
punched him in the face what do I am an

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:06.320
upstanding member of society I can't go

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:07.370
to jail you know me too so I'm going to

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.480
get from people that are like hey

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.730
where's Isaac today

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.170
well sorry I'm serving as 108th jail

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:15.230
sentences that punched out the homeless

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:17.360
doing the face it's quite literally

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:19.340
punching down it's not a good look

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.960
just instead you got to go I'm sorry

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:23.240
that our nation's safety net has failed

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.670
you but please don't take it out on me

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.860
I'm just going to get off the bus here

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:30.260
it's the way you got to handle it you

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:32.330
know there's a reason that bum fights

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.190
existed it was to homeless people

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:36.440
fighting each other I'm not saying it

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:39.800
was good or tasteful or you know

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.540
ethically allowable or permissible by

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:45.020
any extent but it would have been way

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:47.690
worse if it was like a professional or

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:49.640
even amateur like MMA fighter fighting a

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:52.580
homeless guy that's not a fair fight you

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:56.000
know he's that guy's had training and

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:57.470
you know he's got a diet plan and he's

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.060
got him for a career in the business

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:01.190
it's just not the same set of

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.540
expectations that's why you can't just

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:05.390
be getting into fights with homeless

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:08.930
people who you know insult your honor or

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:10.490
disrespect you know and very few people

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:12.170
are going to be on your side everybody's

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:19.930
going to be like yeah he was being a

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:22.970
jerk but also are you okay all right

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:24.710
runs going very well so far I'm still

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:27.890
loving our hat I wish broken modem

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:30.170
didn't like 80% destroy everything I

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:32.570
love about it but that's okay hopefully

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:34.250
we get an eternal heart here and this is

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:36.710
kind of like oh and maybe even better

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:38.630
this is kind of our gimme floor it's

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:42.440
like this is the floor it's our it's our

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:44.690
senior year all we got to do is play

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.220
okay you know don't get in too much

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.900
trouble we should be fine you know if we

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.680
go down to our next floor there's real

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.750
consequences

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.830
we got a roughly 32

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:56.210
any chance of a deal with the devil

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:57.560
repeating of course and area of the deal

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.880
with the angel I should say and a good

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.290
chance of a deal with the devil if the

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:04.610
deal with the angel goes awry like we

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:06.050
got a shot at making this work we are

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.950
going to take up these pod but only

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:10.940
briefly

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:14.120
I always forget like how to jump I rate

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:17.380
it as like a seed to your book it should

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:20.770
probably be like a b-plus to your book

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:23.960
it does require good timing to use

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:25.430
properly I should say but even just in

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.930
terms of like granting you the ability

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:30.080
to get consumables you otherwise

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:32.270
wouldn't be able to it's nice it's

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:35.510
helping us out here we're flush from an

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:37.940
economic standpoint as a result of the

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:40.310
well partly as a result will be how to

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.520
jump pick up so I'm liking that oh come

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:45.650
on

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:47.150
oh come on what was that shot was I've

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:49.730
been Nashville Predators trying to score

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:52.000
a goal in game 7 play Game six of this

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:55.430
year Stanley Cup Finals is you know very

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.680
anti Canadian I almost got the number of

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:58.970
games in this year's Stanley Cup Finals

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.550
mixed up I mean come on

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:06.710
I sure hope somebody lost their job over

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:10.520
that one we get well nice little suite

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:12.050
of money here when I was a kid I thought

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:14.140
I was like really clever because I

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:17.089
remembered I was like going back to like

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:19.730
1986 I know the winners of every family

00:11:17.089 --> 00:11:22.910
help but it was really pretty easy you

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:25.670
know 1986 is Montreal and then like 87

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:27.620
and 1990 is just Edmonton Calgary and

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:30.020
Pittsburgh and then like once again in

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.730
95 it's just like New Jersey Detroit New

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.560
Jersey Detroit Colorado New Jersey

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:35.540
Colorado Detroit Detroit you know like

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.070
it just keeps you only got to remember

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.750
three names it's like remembering the

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:41.110
sequence of notes in the Hot Cross Buns

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:44.420
or something like that

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:48.140
Detroit Colorado New Jersey Saturn

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:50.180
Colorado New Jersey Colorado I don't run

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:52.520
I'm out of Detroit it okay I'm not going

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:54.950
to I'm in hearing to the joke to a fault

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:56.600
at this point it seems there is no

00:11:54.950 --> 00:12:00.779
arcade here

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:03.209
again with the NHL jokes it are probably

00:12:00.779 --> 00:12:04.800
like 15% of people understand but that's

00:12:03.209 --> 00:12:06.089
okay sometimes we go for the references

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.100
that like 2% of people are going to

00:12:06.089 --> 00:12:08.700
understand it's a different story

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:12.060
altogether

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:17.130
okay angelic Spoils I thought is better

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:18.690
angel rooms which is exactly like

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:24.779
befitting with what we've been looking

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:27.690
for on this run let's make our way to

00:12:24.779 --> 00:12:29.279
that room we really really do not want

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:34.279
to take red hard damage it would be an

00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:34.279
embarrassment for me and for my country

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:41.010
it might actually be the worst line of

00:12:39.209 --> 00:12:44.760
dirty talk in movie history because not

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:47.810
only is it just ridiculous it's like a

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:51.029
wink and nod oh is scary to the audience

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:53.970
exclusively but then beyond that it

00:12:51.029 --> 00:12:59.070
could have blown his cover but it is

00:12:53.970 --> 00:13:02.010
very much in come on dude

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:04.290
I mean I'm not too sad about the runs

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:06.690
feel good can we have one run that

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:08.010
doesn't have be BF or Bob's brain like

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:10.829
we're getting to the point where I'm

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:14.220
almost a little cheesed off with these

00:13:10.829 --> 00:13:15.360
items we just can't reliably not get hit

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:18.180
by them although really I should just

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.890
get out of the way anyway well then we

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:22.350
got a 50% chance with a view of the

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:24.329
devil so you know even better now we've

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:26.040
lost a lot of HP in a very short period

00:13:24.329 --> 00:13:31.110
of time to make myself very embarrassed

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:32.910
to that situation anyway I'm sorry I

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:34.649
took it out on you BBF that wasn't fair

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.000
I do also want to say we have that it

00:13:34.649 --> 00:13:38.700
Sears upgrade in the form of the screw

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.440
but little light on VPS for four floors

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:43.589
deep

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:45.449
we haven't improved too much we haven't

00:13:43.589 --> 00:13:48.350
improved our damage at all which is a

00:13:45.449 --> 00:13:50.459
problem but a problem that hopefully

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:53.540
find the means to deal with the speed

00:13:50.459 --> 00:13:53.540
upgrade is okay as well

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:59.460
how like you're not I I feel like I

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.710
should know the explosion radius

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:03.840
obviously the game is sort of infallible

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:08.280
here from you know the standpoint of

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:09.930
execution but at the same time look I

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.070
didn't get hit there I was far enough

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:13.680
away I don't feel like I should have

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:17.100
been hit xxx is one of those movies that

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:20.370
I always am baffled when people older

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:23.300
than me like it because I saw xxx

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:28.800
in a way that should create nostalgia I

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:34.950
was 13 going on 14 the way she tends to

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:37.650
go we organised like a boys night out as

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:39.300
14 year olds there's a quaint time what

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:41.930
can I say let's go to the local

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:45.030
multiplayer first up let's stop off and

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:46.800
montana's you know having some man food

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:50.340
and then we'll go to the movie theater

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:52.530
watch a manly movie that we wouldn't

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:57.810
ever invite our non-existent girlfriends

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:59.280
to xxx so we went inside and I was like

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:00.870
this is garbage and then when we were

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:04.020
talking about it I was like it was so

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:05.880
cool I didn't want to see you know if

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.020
you don't like xxx as a 14 year old I

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.850
was conscious of the fact that it was

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:10.680
going to look a little weird so I was

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.760
like yeah no it was awesome I mean it

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.480
wasn't perfect I mean like a

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.860
cinematographer

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.920
I don't know that's what I meant as a

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:18.090
yeah like Vin Diesel so cool stop thing

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:21.240
and Prague police start taking

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:26.970
PlayStation anyway so I saw a xxx in the

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:30.000
theaters with my boys and I still did

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:32.970
not like it like at all so whenever I

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.800
hear people that are like 33 like five

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:36.780
years older than me they're like it you

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.880
know the later triple exes aren't any

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:43.320
good but the first ones kind of dumb fun

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:46.140
like really like I have an excuse and

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:49.080
I'm still absolving myself you're just

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:52.250
diving all into the I mean of course I

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:54.750
was want to preface this with this but

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:57.810
you know you're always entitled to have

00:15:54.750 --> 00:16:03.090
your own opinion on all forms of media

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:05.610
I ought myself as a snob a lot I've

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:07.180
gotten better about it as I've gotten

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:10.850
older to be honest but

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:12.920
you know it's no fun if I come into this

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:14.420
conversation a hedge every single piece

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.850
of it well you know you might have liked

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:18.589
it if what is your dad was a big Vin

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.910
Diesel thing and you know like you know

00:16:18.589 --> 00:16:23.269
if you like it you like it if you don't

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:26.449
you don't and I respect sir I expect I

00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:28.370
should say that you know you're you got

00:16:26.449 --> 00:16:30.589
the intestinal fortitude to handle a

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:33.649
little dissent without being too

00:16:30.589 --> 00:16:39.199
offended by it but I don't think that

00:16:33.649 --> 00:16:40.459
XXX is very good I will say that I you

00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:42.139
know we've talked about this recently

00:16:40.459 --> 00:16:43.790
but I think transformers is kind of in a

00:16:42.139 --> 00:16:45.319
different camp you like transformers one

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:47.300
and you're like the later ones suck but

00:16:45.319 --> 00:16:48.800
the first ones okay I'm kind of there

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.389
with you I don't really like the first

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:54.589
one but I'm like I got more than the

00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:56.920
first xxx all right this is a huge floor

00:16:54.589 --> 00:16:56.920
for us

00:16:57.779 --> 00:17:02.850
even though we've squandered our deal

00:16:59.579 --> 00:17:06.900
with the devil chance there's a chance

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:08.370
for redemption got like an 18 and a

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:11.689
little percent chance of a deal with the

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:11.689
devil or of a deal with the angel and

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:16.169
like seventeen and a little percent

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:19.890
chance of a deal with the devil I'll

00:17:16.169 --> 00:17:21.900
take either at this point the deal with

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:23.339
the devil see I said I would take either

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:25.589
but I really would prefer to deal with

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:29.010
the angel a this is ideal you know we

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:33.320
can get a deal with the devil in LA face

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:35.610
with an Oakland booty without actually

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:39.659
losing our deal with the angel chance I

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:41.250
like it now we've had some runs that

00:17:39.659 --> 00:17:43.679
we've sort of squandered lately so I

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:45.210
want to slow our roll I did I skipped

00:17:43.679 --> 00:17:46.500
the curse room on the last floor because

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:48.480
I wanted to come down to this floor with

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:53.929
more HP doesn't really make sense that I

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:56.190
then not that good that I then

00:17:53.929 --> 00:17:57.840
immediately went to the curse room but

00:17:56.190 --> 00:18:00.000
it ended up working out so joke's on you

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:06.240
I suppose let's go see if we can get a

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:07.500
blood bag here and if not really would

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:10.110
like to go to our shop we don't have to

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:12.120
do Basara I mean we have to bounce rush

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:13.740
at a point but I don't think I don't

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:16.580
feel any compulsion to do boss rush

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:20.460
right now is what I'm suggesting

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:21.900
magician Empress wheel of fortune we're

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.490
not going to save wheel of fortune until

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:26.370
like the end of the game so we might as

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:28.919
well blow it up and then the question

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:30.750
mark card is nice if we find ourselves

00:18:28.919 --> 00:18:35.039
in a bad spot we can pop it like

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:38.340
emergency an urgent urgent emergency

00:18:35.039 --> 00:18:39.659
just how urgent your love can be I don't

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:46.230
really like that song but I love the

00:18:39.659 --> 00:18:49.080
power goes alright you know you've heard

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:51.210
urgent emergency bye

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.700
by foreigner you know what I'm talking

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:59.809
about it's one of the great all-time

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:59.809
sounds and you know 1980s rock music

00:19:01.399 --> 00:19:09.450
along with the synth from ghostbusters

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:12.330
and the you know guitar beat or a guitar

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:18.989
rhythm from Blondie's call me dinner

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:21.600
today names okay uh look look look look

00:19:18.989 --> 00:19:22.200
look look it's like I've been telling

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.899
you

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:26.460
BFF is occasionally leaving us in a

00:19:24.899 --> 00:19:29.960
situation in which we can't do anything

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:33.509
at all I resent it I don't respect it

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.950
we got 0.3 luck let's gamble a little

00:19:33.509 --> 00:19:37.289
bit get some HP back please

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:42.299
we do need to toll if we got to get

00:19:37.289 --> 00:19:44.850
older I wouldn't even be cheese we could

00:19:42.299 --> 00:19:46.200
probably blow up the blood bank and get

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.399
some HP we could probably blow up any of

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:50.460
this and have a chance to get some HP

00:19:47.399 --> 00:19:52.200
back but I'm I think I'm justified in

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:57.450
being like a little bit ticked off

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:59.190
because like I really am trying to not

00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:00.929
take damage when I walk into a room and

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:05.429
the enemies are so close to me that BBF

00:20:00.929 --> 00:20:09.509
just explodes in my face just like you

00:20:05.429 --> 00:20:10.980
did to me I'm not a big fan of it I'm

00:20:09.509 --> 00:20:16.649
also not going to pick up the poop I

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:18.509
don't see what benefit that gives us we

00:20:16.649 --> 00:20:20.639
play as blue baby so we shouldn't ever

00:20:18.509 --> 00:20:22.559
have to pick up the poop in order to get

00:20:20.639 --> 00:20:24.840
anything accomplished here this is a big

00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:28.700
one thank you to spirit arts preserves

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:31.590
our relatively okay chance of getting a

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:33.570
devil deal or angel deal either one at

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:36.419
this point we got to sort of start to

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:38.970
make sacrifices to our Platonic ideal in

00:20:36.419 --> 00:20:43.619
order to oh yes sure okay in order to

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:45.690
make our run a little easier well the HP

00:20:43.619 --> 00:20:47.730
is actually nice at first I was afraid I

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:49.610
was petrified I'm thinking how am I

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:51.830
going to live without you by my side

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:54.880
now when I was I was thinking probably

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:56.990
it's a silly idea for us to be taking

00:20:54.880 --> 00:21:00.860
fire mined here but we're going to do it

00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:01.880
anyway smelt some trinkets right we

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:06.170
can't donate because we've already

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:12.230
donated enough to break it which I think

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:15.410
in this case was 1 cent 2% of the best

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:19.460
rapper of the 2000 and know we're

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:21.110
talking best rapper mm Kendrick Lamar

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:23.960
you can't just say Kendrick Lamar for

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:25.670
every question was until 2012 when good

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:28.490
kid maad city came out he entered you

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:30.310
know the cultural cultural relevance the

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:34.820
point that he has to this present day ok

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:36.680
you gotta you gotta go Kanye West for

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:38.000
the least most influential rapper this

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:41.360
is that who else you going to go with

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:45.250
Ludacris you probably end up be into the

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.250
top 10 but so would like ja Rule

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:59.940
50 Stan would be you'd probably be up

00:21:52.590 --> 00:22:02.100
there number one number two dude I hate

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:05.340
when we have a run where I start with an

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:07.140
unbridled level of optimism and then

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:09.120
it's just choked out of me by the game

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:10.980
I've made my own mistakes on this run

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:13.230
but come on three point nine seven

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:17.240
damage zero damage upgrades by the time

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:19.760
we hit the depth to a little silly I

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:21.870
would have loved to done angel deals

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.130
which is the sentence that almost made

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:23.610
sense when I said it I would have loved

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:25.440
it done

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:27.900
I would have loved to have done angel

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:29.960
deals but they didn't show up at least

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:32.400
they didn't show up in time for me to be

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:33.960
ready for him all right now if we're

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:37.350
going to talk about unpreventable damage

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:40.230
I think that might take the cake right

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:42.360
there well you really shouldn't stand in

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:45.810
the center of a room as far as possible

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:47.790
away from harmful walls just in case of

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:51.360
mimic spawns when you're directly next

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:53.460
to it I mean I'm getting a little you

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:55.620
might say NL's you know eat a Snickers

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:57.570
not yourself when you're hungry I say

00:22:55.620 --> 00:23:00.720
thank you Snickers are a top tier candy

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:02.940
bar in my personal opinion I do deviate

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.500
from the norm slightly in my candy or

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.880
chocolate bar preferences sometimes we

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.800
call them candy bars sometimes a column

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.630
chocolate bar okay I don't know I don't

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:13.440
know the methodology for it I just say

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:16.800
the words as I learned them right I do

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:19.320
not really care for Kit Kat I know

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:22.380
they're popular pretty much everywhere

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:24.630
not my not my favorite but I am a

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:29.070
skittles man and it's Kittles might be

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:32.130
one of the most popular candies I'm for

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:34.320
him I'll never never dangerous

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:36.450
dangerously close to like popcorn versus

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:39.990
Oreo territory in the last episode but I

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:42.840
never buy candy if there's candy around

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:44.580
I'll find a good reason to eat it most

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:47.310
of the time if you're like hey do you

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:49.770
want like a handful of skittles oh yeah

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:52.170
give me the skittles okay don't just

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:56.760
walk it that's like okay now you're

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:58.500
making some terrible plays but if if I'm

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.570
at a grocery store checkout line just

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:02.509
never happens

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:05.409
the tabloids and the candy and the gum

00:24:02.509 --> 00:24:07.940
are just there for me to look at and

00:24:05.409 --> 00:24:09.499
entertain myself while I wait Finn and

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:11.119
like judge the person in front of me

00:24:09.499 --> 00:24:13.669
I'll be like oh my god you actually need

00:24:11.119 --> 00:24:15.080
40 litres of apple juice like you're

00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:16.820
entitled to buy whatever you want but I

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.799
would also like you to recognize on some

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.210
level that that's ridiculous like I sort

00:24:18.799 --> 00:24:22.940
of resent that you're not all you're in

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:24.200
explode regardless yeah sort of resent

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.909
that you're not looking back right now

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.320
and just being like hey this way at

00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:30.859
least acknowledge the amount of apple

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:34.489
juice you deign to consume here it's

00:24:30.859 --> 00:24:36.529
quite a lot that's all I'm saying

00:24:34.489 --> 00:24:38.090
this is potentially a bad idea but I

00:24:36.529 --> 00:24:42.679
actually think we need some big plays

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:46.720
here sure fine

00:24:42.679 --> 00:24:50.809
hive minds which is actually fire mine

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:52.519
is leaving me in a scary situation in

00:24:50.809 --> 00:24:58.940
dude I hate not having the Polaroid I

00:24:52.519 --> 00:25:01.970
guess you got a beat Isaac with the six

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:04.929
major characters like Isaac Maggie Kane

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:17.090
Judas blue baby

00:25:04.929 --> 00:25:19.039
bu Samson I don't know well I basically

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:21.529
hate that well tell you what we'll come

00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:23.629
back to you when we get some more HP I

00:25:21.529 --> 00:25:25.580
do want to have the chance to make the

00:25:23.629 --> 00:25:28.519
hush fight but I am also like in the

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:33.590
market of course for just that she's

00:25:28.519 --> 00:25:35.239
just feeding the game with the pie of

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:35.599
the Isaac pan and again that should be

00:25:35.239 --> 00:25:38.029
easy

00:25:35.599 --> 00:25:39.379
the fact that it's proving to be a

00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:41.809
little bit more difficult is as much a

00:25:39.379 --> 00:25:43.340
testament to the danger factor on this

00:25:41.809 --> 00:25:45.139
run as it is to the fact that I haven't

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.549
been playing that well over the past

00:25:45.139 --> 00:25:47.960
couple of episodes and I will admit that

00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:49.489
wilfully although it hurts me deep down

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.619
in my soul because this is the one game

00:25:49.489 --> 00:25:53.059
I should at least be good at it turns

00:25:51.619 --> 00:25:55.759
out that the only other game I'm good at

00:25:53.059 --> 00:25:56.899
is a typing race from the tower unite

00:25:55.759 --> 00:26:00.789
and I don't know if that's going to be

00:25:56.899 --> 00:26:00.789
like a real eSport any time soon so

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:06.250
why do this room very simple thought the

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:08.620
second secret room is here it might have

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:12.580
red hearts red hearts open up an ability

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:14.049
to play more never mind an ability to

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:16.390
play more of the demon judgment and

00:26:14.049 --> 00:26:19.660
maybe get a big upgrade and well we were

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:22.390
like sort of right but I'm going to do

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:28.240
this first and if we get it the older

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:29.530
devil will we'll play it by ear could

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:32.080
end up being good could end up being

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:33.250
garbage and could end up being and

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:36.130
probably will be somewhere in the middle

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:37.929
where we don't know whether it's good or

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:39.790
garbage until we think about it some

00:26:37.929 --> 00:26:47.190
more yeah like this is a perfect example

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:47.190
of that uh yeah okay

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:57.279
here's what you do and this is actually

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:59.399
it might not look like it right now this

00:26:57.279 --> 00:27:01.870
is the ballsiest approach to taste here

00:26:59.399 --> 00:27:04.210
and it might preclude us from doing the

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:06.130
hush fight but it's also a little bit of

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:09.039
mad genius in its own right we shouldn't

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:11.350
have done that though it doesn't matter

00:27:09.039 --> 00:27:12.970
too much because we don't have permanent

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:14.799
polaroid invincibility anyway so we're

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:16.809
just gonna that's perfect thank you

00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:20.710
thank you for paying out quickly I do

00:27:16.809 --> 00:27:21.909
kind of want Guppies hair ball because

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:23.409
that would take us one item away from

00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:26.860
guppy with the goat head backing us up

00:27:23.409 --> 00:27:30.130
however I am NOT a hundred percent

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:32.529
convinced that that's that just burns me

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:37.510
up inside I'm not 100% convinced that

00:27:32.529 --> 00:27:39.490
that's sane or at least lies what we are

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:41.740
going to do and I've thrown away so much

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:43.090
HP on this floor so I'm really hesitant

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:45.250
to put myself in a position where we

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:46.960
might do it again but just even judgment

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:48.399
should pay out all I need is for him to

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.769
pay out with something like ceremonial

00:27:48.399 --> 00:27:52.510
robes and then that gives me the

00:27:50.769 --> 00:27:53.710
breathing room to take up his hairball

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:55.389
in the hopes that we get Guffey and

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:57.100
maybe that makes it possible for us to

00:27:55.389 --> 00:27:59.500
leverage this into a hot rod instead of

00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:03.149
a Cathedral chance and you know good

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:03.149
things can can happen there

00:28:06.419 --> 00:28:13.419
being on a half heart interval is better

00:28:08.799 --> 00:28:15.340
here but keep doing what I'm doing if it

00:28:13.419 --> 00:28:18.190
works out in any way shape or form it

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:20.020
should be nice for us and we should have

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:22.030
pretty much every available opportunity

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:23.650
to make it to the hush fight if we want

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:25.000
but we really shouldn't be concerning

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:26.230
ourselves with the hush fight right now

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.309
we should be concerning ourselves with

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:32.679
like our moment-to-moment survival dude

00:28:30.309 --> 00:28:35.950
you're actually crushing me though like

00:28:32.679 --> 00:28:37.419
mathematically is what I resent in games

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:40.570
sometimes what you're doing right now is

00:28:37.419 --> 00:28:43.330
testing my patience you're not testing

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:45.480
my my game acumen by any stretch of the

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:45.480
imagination

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:52.090
all you're doing is like hey are you

00:28:50.559 --> 00:28:54.250
going to give up before I pay out

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:56.530
because it's a long walk back that way

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:59.080
and you got to dodge the red poops every

00:28:56.530 --> 00:29:02.260
time there we go it's a gimpy payout and

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:04.780
I think on a gimpy payout it's not quite

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:07.059
good enough especially with 0.3 Lux so I

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:08.799
think we just bounce some sorry Guppies

00:29:07.059 --> 00:29:11.919
hair ball but being overly aggressive

00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:15.549
has cost me in the past a very recent

00:29:11.919 --> 00:29:17.890
past think it's it's wise for us to just

00:29:15.549 --> 00:29:19.030
leave but we can use the goat head to

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:20.470
hopefully pick up nine lines it would

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.669
still be a good pickup on the next floor

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:22.990
although we wouldn't be doing that well

00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:28.210
we might still do the hustlin antics

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:30.190
anyway we'll see this will be a great

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:32.920
time for a syringe the virus like

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:36.620
doubles up with gimpy

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:38.210
are you a wizard puberty puberty is fine

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:40.280
give me some more puberty pills and I'm

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:42.620
okay with that uh that's an expression

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:44.510
until Isaac I wouldn't have thought I

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:46.250
would ever have said that in my entire

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:51.080
like in my entire life

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:53.920
some puberty pills there are few pretty

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:55.970
pills I in an in an abstract sense

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.860
against me talking about things like

00:29:55.970 --> 00:30:03.170
donors Sam do you get like hormonal

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:05.420
replacement kind of like a meal

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:07.970
replacement but for your endocrine

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:10.370
system again I'm talking about things a

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:14.350
donor's stands in another life there's

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:17.090
like a me who's working as a you know

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:19.310
endocrinologist somewhere for some

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:21.080
reason you just had like violent chest

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:23.330
pains he's wondering why that's because

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:26.030
your evil doppelganger just mentioned

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:31.760
you so we lost our half spirit art I

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:33.560
think there but at least you just look

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:37.390
out red hearts and of course 100%

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:37.390
champion you deal with the devil

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:43.400
again there's no half hard incentive

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:45.530
right now so we're just kind of toughing

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:48.230
it out dude we got so lucky that was by

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:49.850
far I think I was going to say the best

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:54.920
but I'm going to revise it's the only

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:56.480
time I've ever had a broken modem really

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:58.850
be worth anything at all so thank you

00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:02.030
for that the Joker card is way better

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:04.790
served on the cathedral and really at

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:06.590
this point it's just we do Abaddon sin

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:08.480
robes like anything that gives us HP

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:10.220
nine lives that's what we're looking for

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:14.420
we're looking for those items and sort

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:16.820
of those items alone before you get on

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:19.640
my case about this run in which I will

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:21.710
fully admit taking some bad some bad

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:25.430
shots here I'm not that pleased with I

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:28.760
would like to remind you doesn't matter

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:33.920
I would like to remind you come on a

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:37.010
four point nine damage do we have a good

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:42.110
rate of fire oh yeah we actually could

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:43.670
die here but if we Joker we're just

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:46.450
going to spawn in here again so I think

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:46.450
you just tough it out

00:31:47.679 --> 00:31:59.299
Wow okay so be a little smarter not it's

00:31:56.990 --> 00:32:08.990
like so not worth it okay okay we're out

00:31:59.299 --> 00:32:12.049
Oh Joker come on work with me oh we

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:13.669
can't do anything with it unless we want

00:32:12.049 --> 00:32:16.570
to literally put ourselves one hit away

00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:19.250
from death which I I will admit I

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:24.200
thought about for a second there I was

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:26.840
like the sad bonus don't get close to

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:31.429
enemies the sad bone is probably won't

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:33.110
be worth it but it could be have to give

00:32:31.429 --> 00:32:34.850
a little credit to gimpy we haven't

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:40.610
gotten any spirit outside agin sister

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:42.169
yet but we have gotten red hearts and

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:46.220
the red hearts are keeping us in the

00:32:42.169 --> 00:32:47.900
game cards please to a diamonds I mean

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:49.669
it would have been a little bit more

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:56.120
worthwhile if we done the hush fight but

00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:57.620
so be it this all comes down to the

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:58.910
Isaac fight if we can make it to the

00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:00.140
Isaac fight it all comes down to the

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:03.020
eyes of fight that might have sounded

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:07.549
even well spoken it's not well spoken

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:10.780
it's a it's the most obvious truism I

00:33:07.549 --> 00:33:10.780
could come up with we're good

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:17.759
let me continue to move here great work

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:19.230
I know why I thought I was boxed in on

00:33:17.759 --> 00:33:28.139
this room we might actually have an exit

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:32.039
up here which would be very nice I want

00:33:28.139 --> 00:33:36.299
to all hold it hold it hold it

00:33:32.039 --> 00:33:37.590
you're good sometimes it just takes a

00:33:36.299 --> 00:33:39.619
second to realize that you're in the

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:39.619
clear

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:49.860
grab the bombs we might need him all we

00:33:47.279 --> 00:33:54.320
need to do yes that's exactly why I was

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:56.429
not using Krampus head by the way

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:58.049
because I was worried that the bostrm

00:33:56.429 --> 00:33:59.940
could be around the corner not worried

00:33:58.049 --> 00:34:01.889
actually like excited that the boss room

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:03.389
could be around the corner none of this

00:34:01.889 --> 00:34:03.679
is none of this matters you don't need

00:34:03.389 --> 00:34:07.590
it

00:34:03.679 --> 00:34:11.429
ignore it it's solved is all fluff

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:14.669
and a great Krampus is head thank you I

00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:17.190
like a perfect BBF moment redemption for

00:34:14.669 --> 00:34:18.710
the times that is it hit me and I had no

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:21.030
control over it

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:22.649
not every time it hit me was one of

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:28.700
those times I definitely walked into a

00:34:22.649 --> 00:34:30.990
club I'm a little nervous not gonna lie

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:32.940
meet some explosion sleep that's that

00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:34.290
perfect broken modem also extols long

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:40.409
enough to guarantee that we were going

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:40.770
to get the get the skips there which is

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:42.329
nice

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:46.290
otherwise he does multiple attacks which

00:34:42.329 --> 00:34:48.419
is obviously like very suboptimal for us

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:50.250
because we have to dodge them which

00:34:48.419 --> 00:34:54.750
almost just happened right there we're

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:56.550
so close we were also so close to

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:58.440
getting blown up by our own BBF there

00:34:56.550 --> 00:35:01.890
but he did get Isaac I think we're going

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:04.440
to make it and you know what we did not

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:06.030
play an impossible we did not play a

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:07.410
great game but we played a good enough

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:09.480
game to deserve the victory so I'm

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:10.890
excited about that and jeez that would

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.970
have been a problem finally we got blank

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:13.650
card thanks for watching hope you guys

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:14.760
