##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.570
everybody welcome back to non-line

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.220
please the binding of issac entereth

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.870
plus it can't possibly be any worse on

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.330
the damage spectrum than the last drop

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.730
you know what's nice actually you might

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.520
think I oftentimes put up I wouldn't say

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.800
a facade but two eight zero B CH h7

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.270
I wouldn't say of Assad but I put on the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.010
appearance of being unhappy that we have

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.769
Anna saves over run because nasal is a

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.029
little bit less dynamic than most other

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.980
characters because of the built in

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.660
strength and brimstone and flying like

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.360
as a little strong it's easy mode

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.370
however we went through the whole run

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.780
last time except for the chest with a

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.469
damage stat of 3.5 so I honestly think

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.110
that we need to treat ourselves

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.489
otherwise I'm going to make like I'm

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.890
going to break my mental health in this

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.430
game is what I mean to say I people

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.020
asked me NL how can you how can you play

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.910
this game for so long there's a couple

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.949
of answers to that question one of them

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.030
is that I genuinely love it another one

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.710
is that it's my job

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.239
the answer that they're actually looking

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.010
for though is you know why do you keep

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.479
it fresh and the answer to that question

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.220
is very easy first of all the game is

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.890
extremely well designed it builds its

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.869
own freshness secondly I basically do

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.100
what I want I do what feels right in the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.650
game and I think that helps keep it

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.420
fresh so this run by the way is just out

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.040
of control already so we're obviously

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.600
going to be probably completely fine

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.549
here but then the fact that you know we

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.110
have Anna's asel run I think is a good

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.619
example of that I could choose to be

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.240
olenin hazel is a baby mode you know we

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.040
just want to run that was so hard give

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.229
us something you know that you want but

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.630
not we're going to I'm going to treat

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.189
this as the rest and relaxation that we

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.409
deserve after a run now it was garbage

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.270
you know what I'm just going to go away

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.640
too much about the min maxing of Satanic

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.970
Bible as Azazel when we're you know

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.579
blowing the doors off this run already

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.250
so really what this run comes down to is

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.560
do we want to any poops I'm building a

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.350
great case to be made fun of if we end

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.689
up losing but often times Azazel run

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.280
comes as angel runs come down - are you

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.080
going to do boss rush are you going to

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.080
be my girl a dent that damn that ant

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:18.790
that that

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:21.340
don't know down down doom doom and let

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.470
me why not usually you skip ball stress

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.330
because you have a built-in teleport

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.080
card but we'll see how the world changes

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.120
once we get down there

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.410
honestly I'm fairly happy to get the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.480
belly button mostly because we have

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.150
already handled our HP in such an oven

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.100
that was idiotic but we've handled our

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.940
HP in such an obvious way that there's

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.500
really no reason to want red hearts like

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.470
we can actually get enough demon hearts

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.270
to justify taking a deal with the devil

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.280
that cost exclusively demon hearts now

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.990
I'd be saying like the opposite if we

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.510
got an HP upgrade on that boss fight but

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.370
that's because I like to know it's not

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.780
really alliance more I like to focus on

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.880
the positive side for most of these

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.860
items that we get it's only once we get

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.240
I don't know just hypothetically like

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.590
eight floors deep and we're still

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.710
dealing with base damage I'll deal with

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.330
succubus and twenty twenty that I start

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.070
to complain about the the run I

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.120
generally try to put a positive spin on

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.580
things that see things

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.500
in the best possible light most of the

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.600
time despite the character that I play

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.730
on the LSS as well which is just an

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.970
exaggerated version of my own you know

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:29.440
perception of societal slice anyway tamo

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:32.739
undies basically irrelevant apparently

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.050
like literally irrelevant because i

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.090
might as well shoot to shoot this right

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.910
here apparently literally irrelevant

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.280
because we don't have camo well we're

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.810
charging so we want to go into every

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.040
single room with the charge here if only

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.890
because that's the way we've always done

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.709
it so why mess with the formula has been

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.910
working out pretty well you know it's um

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:58.840
the Marvel Cinematic Universe Theory

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:00.459
good timing on that good timing on the

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.930
joke as well with the you know release

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.930
of Wonder Woman recently I'm actually

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.260
and this is a meaty subject to talk

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.209
about

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:12.130
and I'm not qualified I know that there

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:15.250
are there's fanboy wars over like DC

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.650
versus Marvel and and especially

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.739
recently the cinematic universe is a lot

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.970
of ink spilled online you know people

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.380
who are like ah the critics are

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.540
sabotaging DC movies as

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.600
sighs squad was garbage you know a lot

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.830
of people angry at one another

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.180
manufacturing things to yell at each

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.530
other about and forget the fact that

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.540
we're all human beings treating each

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.340
other with respect but I digress gears

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.130
up that's awesome I mean we're good to

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.510
go I think here and if you're passionate

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.910
about that stuff that's cool on the same

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.320
yeah everybody should treat everybody

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:50.270
well until they've been given a good

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:54.230
reason not to at least but I've said my

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:57.010
piece on DC movies of course like

00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:00.380
everybody on planet earth I quite like

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.120
the Christopher Nolan Batman films you

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.510
know what we should go all the way on

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.390
this one

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.620
Incubus is fine and duality is going to

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.940
be interesting at the very least we'll

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.800
try to do angel rooms to get it a little

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.690
bit more of a foothold in the experience

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.880
of how those angel rooms are better now

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.770
or not better as the case may be but I

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.880
mean like I think they're literally

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.860
better I thought Batman vs Superman was

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.360
horrible you might tell me to watch the

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.400
director's cut that's fine it's not

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.480
going to happen I already I gave it a

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.860
chance with the I mean I've got no abyss

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.180
that interest in wanting that movie to

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.410
be good like I understand if you watch

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.490
it and you're like this is bad but I

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.510
want it to be good and then you watch

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.610
the director's cutting you're like this

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.380
is better that's fine but you know I'm

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.790
I'm content with my opinion on that

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.920
movie and how it turned out in my

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.380
opinion but I'm stoked I haven't seen

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.370
Wonder Woman yeah but I'm stoked that

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.470
apparently it's not just good it's great

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:52.310
I think I think it's a very positive

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.900
thing if it in so many different ways

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.260
but mostly I'm just happy that there's

00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:00.050
like a DC movie that it seems like if I

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.150
might like it that's cool I'm quite

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.140
pleased about that

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.400
and I haven't seen the movie I might

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.130
think it's horrible the day you know I

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.750
tend to fall in line without the

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.780
majority of critics think most of the

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.250
time you know I've lived my life like

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:17.060
there's no tomorrow

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.410
you really cannot get red hearts at the

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.820
end of the world on this run butts done

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.520
I can't believe we just squeezed out

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.860
there it's so good yeah I've lived my

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.660
life long enough and you know looked at

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.160
the critical consensus of things long

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:32.780
enough that I I think I'm one of those

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:34.460
guys who mostly the critics represent

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.410
the way that I think and there's people

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.940
that are very opposite of that you know

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.800
ie people

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:43.250
Grandma's Boy and that's fine as well

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.620
you know but I do find myself most of

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.540
the time if I go see a movie and the

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.090
average critic score is like two stars

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.880
I'm like as a two star movie couple of

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:55.580
the couple of experiences where I vv8 if

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.580
I may be honest with you I on abash idli

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:02.510
I think crank and crank 2 are

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:06.530
masterpieces I think that people tripped

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:09.050
over themselves to show in and I mean I

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:11.120
hate when people do this to me

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.440
with hey I got to take this by the way

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.720
to make another deal with the angel and

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.100
you know we were hopefully fine on HP I

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.300
hate when people go old and critical

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.390
just he likes that movie because he

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:22.220
wants to seem smart but I'm doing the

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.590
inverse here and I also hate it but I

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.600
think critics tripped over themselves to

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.190
some extent to be like this movie is

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:32.840
dumb and I'm smarter than it I think

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:36.980
Craig 2 is a genius movie very very very

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:39.130
silly but and and over the top of so

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:42.740
over the top that I can't imagine

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:45.500
disliking it I would like when I watch

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:47.590
that movie for the first time and I was

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:50.960
an adult I did not see when I was like

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:53.060
10 and then just you know grandfather my

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:56.180
enjoyment of that film into existence to

00:07:53.060 --> 00:08:01.130
this day I saw it as an adult I was like

00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:03.560
this is a fantastic parody of action

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.910
movies while also being a like I don't

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.070
know if I'd say a good action movie but

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:09.020
hilarious nonetheless that's the movie

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:11.600
I'll go to bat for I think everybody has

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:14.210
have some that's where I'll go to bat

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.770
for I mean little Steven is not what we

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.180
were looking for there but I'm mostly

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.500
looking for a deal with the angel which

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:22.400
we should get because we have goat head

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:24.740
and then we'll we'll drop the angel

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:28.760
statue up the president there's what I

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:38.200
mean to say and we could if you void the

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:38.200
present I think you get to keep using it

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:45.470
I mean I kind of deserve to get hit

00:08:43.729 --> 00:08:48.380
there I'll be honest with you oh but you

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:49.850
can't avoid the present we shouldn't

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:52.310
have used it we shouldn't they used it

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:54.410
that was dumb anyway Sam sir forget is

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:55.820
this okay I thought for a second I

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:59.930
thought that the sensor with the item

00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:01.160
that gave us 100% deal with the devil

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:06.230
chance and I was like well we already

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:07.279
have that so I handled this deal with

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:10.190
the devil quite poorly we should have

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:11.480
gone you know void present and then we

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:13.010
could have gotten an item every time we

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.050
use it that's actually a huge risk

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:16.250
so I'll take responsibility for that I'm

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:21.740
not going to avoid this I'd rather go

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:23.089
back and void the void The Satanic Bible

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:28.100
so that effectively there's zero chance

00:09:23.089 --> 00:09:30.320
we can ever die on this run this is like

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.970
I literally looked over at my monitor

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.100
and was like how's the preview window

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:36.380
looking all bad frame rate I must have

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:38.660
gotten a Skype message in the time it

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:41.360
took me to turn my head from left to

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:44.589
right to see the monitor I had gotten a

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.589
Skype message what a world

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:51.500
so we're going to get mad spirit arts

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:53.540
here good kid maad spirit arts and boys

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:56.329
the fun item it's kind of like crooked

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:58.880
penny but slightly different value

00:09:56.329 --> 00:10:00.260
proposition slightly different on it but

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.600
a fun item to use nonetheless and

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:04.040
apollyon is a good add into the game in

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.050
my opinion for basically the reason that

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:09.290
this item is guaranteed to exist in some

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:10.310
situations well heads downwards here and

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.600
it choose to ignore the fact that there

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:13.430
was a battery charge which meant I

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.370
totally could have voided the present if

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:19.220
I just hadn't used it and then also

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:20.660
still voided Satanic Bible but you're

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:24.350
going to make mistakes in your life and

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:25.790
you know I hesitate to dig too much into

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:27.320
those like I'm going to be the Bob Ross

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:29.990
of the binding of issac sort of thing

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.550
but you know you got a you got to accept

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.779
it at points in your life you're going

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:36.740
to make mistakes I'll give you a great

00:10:32.779 --> 00:10:39.019
example actually I am and this is not

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:40.579
brag bragging at all here not

00:10:39.019 --> 00:10:43.010
intentionally at least I'm a good

00:10:40.579 --> 00:10:44.300
student I pride myself you know I'm

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:45.829
taking like one to two classes a

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.600
semester in programming that means I get

00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:49.670
a lot of time to focus on each class and

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.230
I would take more of a female

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:53.960
nice that I have plenty of time to focus

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:57.050
on my work as well so I pride myself on

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:59.090
doing well in my classes recently I got

00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:02.060
back an assignment I did I got a mark

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:03.590
that I thought was really really bad

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:06.230
and I was like what happened and I

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:08.450
looked at it and I realized that I had

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:10.520
actually just forgotten it is a coding

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:12.230
class we're at the hand in paper

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.460
assignments weirdly enough but anyway

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.440
that's beside the point

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:17.600
I looked at and I realized that I'd

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.100
actually just forgotten the hand in one

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.860
of the files that was basically

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:23.360
compulsory for the assignment so I cost

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.800
myself about 30 percent of the

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.200
assignment mark just due to

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.090
administrative failure on my fault at

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:31.810
first I was like you know not really

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:34.340
what was me I mean I already I have a

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:36.290
degree so I mean it's I'm not trying to

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:39.050
again is not bragging but it's like this

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:40.640
is kind of just like a it's mostly for

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:43.400
personal growth and for fun but it was

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:45.830
totally needless but you know I tried

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:48.170
not to beat myself up too too hard over

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:49.460
it because it's just you know no matter

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:51.200
what you do in your life you should

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.030
treat things that you care about with

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.890
care if that's not obvious you know in

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:56.990
the in the naming convention you're

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:59.810
going to make mistakes can't beat

00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:01.910
yourself up over over any of them for

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:04.280
too long now I mean if you're looking at

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:05.900
your cell phone while driving and crash

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.640
into somebody and you know they're

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.900
injured yeah you mean you should beat

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:12.440
yourself up over that one you were being

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:14.420
a selfish inconsiderate in degenerate

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.100
and you've caused harm to somebody that

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.390
probably didn't necessarily deserve you

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:19.670
should beat yourself up over that one

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:21.920
for a while but you know not not for the

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:23.810
rest of your life you got to get over

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.550
things now what prompted this

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:27.350
conversation that's right it was a

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:31.340
misuse of an item in a video game so I'm

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:33.350
not gonna I'm not going to act like it's

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:35.090
if that Headey of a thing you know what

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:37.850
let's reroll the whole run I'm ready

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:43.580
get out of here peace pinky void oh we

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:45.440
have we have anti-gravity horn brimstone

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:51.080
shots we're a little slower than we used

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:52.490
to be all you can do you know oh dude we

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.890
need dull razor we need to all raise it

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:58.070
as simple as it comes here all you can

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:59.330
do with mistakes is you know learn from

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:01.520
them and endeavor not to make them in

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.420
the future your you might be young and

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:07.890
if that is the case you

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:09.120
it might be naive not all not young

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:11.580
people and I even not all nice people

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.530
are young however you know people say

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.760
that you know when I was younger they

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:17.790
are you gonna make mistakes don't beat

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:20.700
yourself up is be for yourself if you

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:22.620
make mistakes I'm on my way to being a

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.120
perfect adult I'm gonna figure it out

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.530
I'm going to be the one you're not going

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.900
to be the one it doesn't exist as long

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:28.980
as we're as long as we're human beings

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:32.760
and non machines we're going to make

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:35.910
mistakes and you got a got to do your

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:37.890
best to not make the same one again but

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:39.240
you know make mistakes that are

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:42.150
productive you can't be afraid of

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.740
mistake making necessarily I do not I

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:46.890
don't want this I want to be big I know

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:48.720
I don't want this I want IV big because

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:52.740
I want to be able to use varicose veins

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:57.870
to crap on enemies you know at my

00:13:52.740 --> 00:14:01.050
leisure come on you got this you guys

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:02.280
I will go extremely aggressive on this

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:07.350
it's also going to give us a max level

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:12.690
Bumbo so or at least it's going to help

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:14.130
us on the road to bumbo ISM okay we're

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:16.110
getting in a little bit of dangerous

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:19.800
territory I'm also picking up a lot of

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:21.360
the money it's kind of not what I asked

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.840
for okay yeah that's enough that's

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.450
enough

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.370
he's done it was it worth it no probably

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:28.860
not but our speed is definitely better

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:31.530
now and two blood bags sure that's fine

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:36.030
I still wanted IV bag more but two blood

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:37.770
bags is is totally okay by me and at

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:39.330
least we that was probably going to be

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:43.290
our last play either way so the fact

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:44.850
that it worked for us is very nice but

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:51.270
they made sure it was going to be our

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:53.850
last play now I'll just be honest with

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:56.040
you I hate anti graph with brimstone

00:14:53.850 --> 00:15:00.020
unless your rate of fire is like soy

00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:00.020
milk level it's pretty garbage but

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:11.910
oh I forgot me a dark bum like a via the

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:13.950
reroll obviously so and dark bum really

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:18.450
makes it very very tough for us to lose

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:22.280
even though we we threw away our our

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:25.500
easy win I'm still feeling like this is

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.910
beyond set in stone basically or at

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.740
least we've got a great chance no

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:30.720
absolutely will Emperor out right away

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:32.550
we're leaving behind our teleport card

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:36.060
but we also saved a little bit of HP in

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:38.550
the process just wanted to get him to

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:42.300
fall on the portal and it's exactly how

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:50.490
that went down still a little bit of a

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:51.990
wonky run I think it's fair to say we

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:54.720
need Bumbo to take care of like a little

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:57.020
enemies I was just about to get angry

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.710
that we didn't get a deal with the devil

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:00.420
would have been a little silly

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:03.570
considering we literally just walked

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:05.130
into a deal with the devil but this

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:09.770
doesn't happen often on an Azazel run

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:09.770
but I would say like we need some damage

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:13.950
you know considering we've had so many

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:16.470
great spacebar ends over this runs a

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:17.850
little surprising but we could we could

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:20.250
really use a great spacebar as well I

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:21.000
mean you know the gist of how we got to

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:23.310
this point I'm sure

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.500
there we go that's IV bag so IV bag is

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:29.490
insanely good what I actually want to go

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:30.990
along with this is I mean more HP is

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:36.560
fine but if we could get bloody penny

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:36.560
then effectively no enemy can stop us

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:47.190
now obviously we don't have unlimited HP

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:50.100
so there's sort of like you don't got to

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:52.830
be a little cautious about things but

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:56.310
you know I am also cognizant of the fact

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:57.390
that this allows us to deal way more

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:58.950
damage than we'd ever have the

00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:03.930
opportunity to deal otherwise probably

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:05.460
it can be quite spun but a great rate of

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:11.850
fire increases the cost of some speed

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:14.360
well worth it I think we should go for

00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:14.360
more options

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:20.670
if we could get like a reusable now

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:26.820
bumble this isn't for you if we could

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:29.000
get a reusable way to you've got one

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:30.540
more floor if you get a reusable way to

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.600
get hearts

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:34.830
we're so set we're already in a great

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.230
spot and we're going to hit max level

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:38.760
Dumbo basically I think as a direct

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:40.290
result of the fact that we have IV bag

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.330
we're going to hit it faster at least as

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:43.560
a result of that we don't need to get

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:45.900
another spirit heart but yeah one that's

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:48.270
good but let's not spend two bombs on it

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.890
we might be able to make a good play on

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:51.270
boss rush too but bloody penny would be

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:53.420
a really really nice for making that

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:57.450
happen

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:58.020
for now we'll just let let Bumbo do his

00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:59.700
thing

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:01.950
although B maybe would want the money

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.690
but it's not really necessary right now

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:05.940
I resent that we're having to be a

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:11.640
little picky on the what enemies we use

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:15.090
our best abilities against but hopefully

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:18.570
we can pull that back as soon as

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:21.060
possible Baba is max level Bumbo we've

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:26.460
done it he's ready to go okay Samson's

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:31.430
luck not will we need Tammy's head sorry

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:34.110
Gabby said Guppies head is not actually

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:35.880
that good for us we need the harmik card

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:37.500
though I mean it's good I didn't we

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:40.350
should pick it up and I almost was a big

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:44.160
idiot by not picking it up but we we

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:48.480
don't need it to make the run work

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:49.920
I think we might have a Maggie's bow and

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:53.540
I just haven't noticed because we got so

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.540
much stuff on our head to begin with

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.870
because I think we picked up a half

00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:03.570
heart and encountered as a full heart

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:06.420
which would be fantastic news we're

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:08.190
really looking like I I don't care about

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:09.810
having the cancer trigger to this point

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:12.630
of course having our rate of fire go up

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:14.370
is great but the red hearts you know

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:16.250
what was the guy's name from lost

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:18.620
Desmond the red hearts

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:21.540
Desmond it's all about the red hearts

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:22.980
it's all we need to pop off on this run

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:25.170
oh man you know I'm not trying to be too

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:30.720
impatient we really just recently got

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:32.480
this energy to work but if it could come

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:37.050
to fruition that would be nice gimpy

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:39.480
probably actually does it because it's

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.530
going to give us a high percentage

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.860
chance of getting red hearts from

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:45.150
enemies that we kill so which is good

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:50.460
because apparently the hell it exists

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:52.140
otherwise luck upgrade chaos scar okay

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:54.420
we got a chaos cardigan but we don't

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:59.250
need it yet we want to use the chaos

00:19:54.420 --> 00:20:00.900
card against hush if possible wait can

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:02.430
we hold two cars later we had polydactyl

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:07.680
but then we've rerolls like our whole

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:10.080
run 20 times that make sense okay Plan C

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:13.140
we certainly do not want so I'll blow

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:14.280
you up we're gonna make boss rush we

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.290
can't buy the spirit eyes that make

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:18.780
sense full health range upgrade it's

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:21.750
actually still pretty good and you Jam

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:25.190
so I think we're out obviously that's

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:25.190
the magician now that I think about it

00:20:29.399 --> 00:20:33.220
so effectively I was like we're going to

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:35.230
get a spirit out back anyway might as

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:41.919
well use this for a couple a couple

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:43.059
rooms of goodness hopefully is it I'm

00:20:41.919 --> 00:20:45.580
just saying

00:20:43.059 --> 00:20:48.490
red hearts normally are not this hard to

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:52.480
come by not suggesting some kind of

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:54.279
conspiracy just wondering where my red

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:56.080
hearts are at considering I have five

00:20:54.279 --> 00:20:58.330
luck and Kim P and I just need red

00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:00.130
hearts to like you know do their thing

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:05.409
here for me to pop off to an absurd

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:07.750
degree but anyway it's well worth the

00:21:05.409 --> 00:21:11.340
cost of doing business there no dark

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:14.919
bomb these are my red hearts you jerk

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:16.929
we definitely want that even if it's not

00:21:14.919 --> 00:21:18.520
going to pop right away we'll take this

00:21:16.929 --> 00:21:20.380
but don't suck me into the portal I

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:24.340
don't want to go prong ptosis is like

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:27.610
ten out of ten the hearts are admittedly

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:35.880
surprisingly tempting but you know what

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:35.880
I'm actually gonna try this on for size

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:50.410
don't let dark bum take all your all

00:21:48.429 --> 00:21:54.750
your HP here I really we're just we're

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:54.750
close to making the dream come true here

00:21:55.260 --> 00:22:00.690
which is why I'm protective of I mean

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:04.270
we're getting a lot of spirit hearts

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:07.500
regardless because of the fact that we

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:07.500
have Gympie to begin with but

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:26.540
please Oh got him pretty good

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:30.230
I don't think we're going to ruin this

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:32.960
for ourselves we should be smart but I'm

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:38.120
like where are the red hearts dude I'm I

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:39.620
ain't even mad I'm just stunned dark

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:42.640
bombs taking them all that's it's a

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:42.640
secret the truth comes out

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:58.230
at this point we're kind of cemented in

00:22:53.040 --> 00:23:01.470
look Aki the enemies are dying they're

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:09.690
not giving me the drops before dark bomb

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:11.790
gets them so tight squeeze man I'm also

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:13.740
just missing a lot of the drops we

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:16.550
apparently have like literal permanent

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.550
polaroid invincibility

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:26.970
that was better

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:35.430
I guess the ground being completely red

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:40.410
is in helping the situation here like

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:43.680
literally every every half spirit art

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:46.170
that you pick up is so valuable in terms

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:49.830
of killing enemies and generating spirit

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:52.140
hearts for yourself for that matter that

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:56.240
missing just a few has thrown us like a

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:56.240
little bit out of whack here

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:03.160
can we finished it we got crickets body

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:05.020
which is a nice tears up I don't know

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:07.300
though that was that was weird I'm not

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:09.460
sure we handled that I oh I mean I'll

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:11.710
just guarantee you we didn't handle that

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:16.840
properly I'm not doing the Delirium

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:20.020
fight at least not right now I would

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:23.590
like to get uh that was pretty poor but

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:24.760
like to get 1/2 red heart please I'm

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:26.350
losing my mind

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.210
and the reason I'm losing my mind is

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:30.309
because up to this point I'm not

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:31.990
suggesting like a you know there was a

00:24:30.309 --> 00:24:36.520
change in the game necessarily but most

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:41.920
of the time Gympie gives you so many red

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:43.929
hearts that it's actually annoying the

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:48.220
fact that we're getting what appears to

00:24:43.929 --> 00:24:49.900
me to be like almost none is crazy so

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.190
we're basically just doing this or pop

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:56.530
it in here and we're pressing the

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:58.030
spacebar twice probably probably didn't

00:24:56.530 --> 00:25:00.520
even need the press the second time but

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:02.890
I stand by it

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:06.570
hey the speed upgrades nice hey tanks we

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:08.710
got spun I also got some HP out of it

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:09.730
we'll head down to the next floor no

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:12.220
deal with the devil but that's

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:14.590
completely ok just don't squander the

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:17.260
run do the run is the run is innocent

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:19.809
and also very very good and this fun

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:26.550
pick up you know for extra damage not

00:25:19.809 --> 00:25:30.929
insignificant we got spun and Sun

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:35.080
everything the body needs on this one

00:25:30.929 --> 00:25:39.480
please do it he's like shadowing me get

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:39.480
out of here you dark bum jerk

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:48.210
taking all my red hearts before I can't

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:56.250
even see him because the portals are

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:57.990
covering them up half the time I got

00:25:56.250 --> 00:26:02.610
pretty lucky there okay that belongs to

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:05.700
me this also belong here do we take half

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:08.250
damage there now we took a full heart

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:11.310
that's fine and we're really like this

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:13.790
is a very very strong run as long as the

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:16.560
red hearts hold up which so far they

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:18.150
have been a little iffy on but I mean

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:22.350
I'm thinking that's like largely my

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:23.640
fault as the case may be just give me

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:25.770
more red hearts that's good this runners

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:27.510
like and I'll apologize for it but it's

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:28.860
come off the rails a little bit mostly

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:33.990
because of just the fact that it's very

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:37.170
strange it's it's like a IV bag to deal

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:38.520
damage run but then this jerk is taking

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:41.160
all my red hearts despite the fact that

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:45.000
most of the time it's like one of my

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:48.030
favorite items dark bomb that is mostly

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.740
the only reason I'm probably even better

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:54.000
than I have Reese's but the only reason

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:57.060
I'm messing around at all with the with

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.810
IV bag is a varicose veins is really fun

00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:00.480
when it works

00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:01.920
ohoo deal I'm not fighting huh sure this

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.920
set up I think it's just asking for

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:06.810
trouble and be anti grab with like a

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.610
really short range brimstone lasers just

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:11.040
sort of frustrating to deal with so we

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:16.700
found a found a way to circumvent a

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:16.700
situation in a way that's that's fun

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:23.060
just need to make sure that we are doing

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.060
so in a way that's safe

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:30.920
and the jury's cut out to be honest how

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:38.090
house way how do you not take damage

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:40.430
there someone got dusted okay you know

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:46.250
what you gave me a spirit art I am not

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:48.950
even mad except a little bit and the

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:50.510
dream is really that we use a spirit

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:53.270
hard to deal damage let me get a spirit

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:54.710
heart back because they seem to be

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:56.540
showing up you know as often as red

00:27:54.710 --> 00:28:00.730
hearts here I think we've done honestly

00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:03.530
might be better off going the flies and

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:08.210
then we can use hematemesis and that's

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:12.350
pretty productive hematemesis for us we

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:15.130
could get Guffey it's not likely but we

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:15.130
could get Guffey

00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:31.460
I need it we got max-level Bumbo dealing

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:33.830
some damage as well it's just like

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:36.350
without anti grab this run looks a lot

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:42.320
safer is all I'm trying to say I almost

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:44.629
wish we were in the sort of situation in

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.279
which we could like if we had a the

00:28:44.629 --> 00:28:49.039
drain you heart right now forget it

00:28:46.279 --> 00:28:54.529
Eva's bird heart or whatever um we would

00:28:49.039 --> 00:28:56.629
be rolling right now no way to use bird

00:28:54.529 --> 00:28:58.730
heart would change nothing disregard

00:28:56.629 --> 00:28:59.989
that I'm feeling this run is making me

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:01.460
lose my mind a little bit it's probably

00:28:59.989 --> 00:29:03.789
time for this to be the last Isaac run

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:06.980
of the day I'm getting a little sloppy

00:29:03.789 --> 00:29:09.289
we didn't need that maybe we want to not

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:10.700
take any red hearts that way we're

00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:12.440
always losing spirit arts and

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:16.179
potentially always gaining them might

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:19.549
seem like an obvious strat here but it

00:29:16.179 --> 00:29:20.960
isn't in my opinion because most of the

00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:22.429
time you have IV bag you want to get as

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:25.070
many red hearts as possible like I need

00:29:22.429 --> 00:29:31.059
the red heart so I can play this once

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:34.730
like stop being like too overdramatic I

00:29:31.059 --> 00:29:38.389
need the red heart Sally I can't get in

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:39.799
there coz it's too dangerous man I need

00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:42.409
the red heart so that I can hurt myself

00:29:39.799 --> 00:29:44.210
so that I can only use spirit arts from

00:29:42.409 --> 00:29:48.409
that point on with you I'm getting that

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:51.379
here that's the one okay so we're in a

00:29:48.409 --> 00:29:55.879
better spot now just let this guy die by

00:29:51.379 --> 00:29:59.389
natural laser-based causes I need this

00:29:55.879 --> 00:30:01.190
actually because we're going to well and

00:29:59.389 --> 00:30:02.830
we didn't need to but we can better to

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:06.200
have to than have one because we can

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:07.249
check this out I don't think I want to

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.139
play you it's just a little too

00:30:07.249 --> 00:30:10.489
dangerous right now don't pick up red

00:30:09.139 --> 00:30:11.899
hearts red hearts belong to dark bomb

00:30:10.489 --> 00:30:15.859
now despite the fact that I'll really

00:30:11.899 --> 00:30:18.129
understand what I'm doing a pyramid so

00:30:15.859 --> 00:30:18.129
now

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:24.650
we're using IV bag red hearts go to dark

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:26.420
bum who can give us spirit hearts this

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:28.250
is just like a pivot of our strategy and

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:30.680
spirit Arts will be generate from

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:33.130
getting hit ourselves we just pick up to

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:37.190
make up for the fact that we took damage

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:38.690
I'm thinking maybe there is a there is

00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:45.370
something that makes the dreamwork in

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:50.900
there don't want to go too deep on on

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:52.550
this like at all so we get hit you know

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:53.840
if we deliberately hurt ourselves a

00:30:52.550 --> 00:31:00.530
couple times per room things are going

00:30:53.840 --> 00:31:06.910
to start to get a little scary we should

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:06.910
also let Bumbo pick up the all the coins

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:11.150
the other thing that this run could

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:13.190
really do with is just a little bit of

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:14.780
patience honestly and you know I mean

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:17.420
I'm not above singing the Guns &amp; Roses

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:21.170
song I've been walking the streets at

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:25.610
night just trying to get it right and I

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:29.560
need you it's more like old Axl like not

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:29.560
the axle from old the axilla is old

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:35.660
[Music]

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:39.130
again these belong to you so you can get

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:42.380
okay well you know what pop perks here

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:44.360
that's that's as close to like an

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:46.690
indication as I can give you that this

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:51.340
proof of concept for this run will work

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:51.340
Isaac's getting dust like no time flat

00:31:51.430 --> 00:32:00.950
and nothing here really sells it got a

00:31:56.630 --> 00:32:04.610
tears upgrade ten bombs Virgo virgos

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:10.550
occasional longer invincibility so there

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:14.270
is this value not sure it's that good

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:17.120
but something whipworm avea Slee on the

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:18.590
run like this not really our our biggest

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.550
concern I picked up a red hard but

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:20.750
that's you know the good thing about

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:23.810
that is that there's always going to be

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:26.630
more will just try to like spam some

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:28.670
anti-graft portals now and now that I've

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:30.130
actually taken the time to realize how

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:31.510
quickly I can spam out these

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:35.169
since I'm like live I messed around with

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:36.760
this finicky like IV bag strat and then

00:32:35.169 --> 00:32:38.470
I press the spacebar next to an enemy

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:46.559
and I go alright that's why because it's

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:49.240
flippin sweet but you know it as a

00:32:46.559 --> 00:32:50.980
secondary attempt you could do a lot

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.450
worse than like once every two seconds

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:57.910
being able to put out a portal that is

00:32:52.450 --> 00:33:00.970
just going to murder most enemies should

00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:02.350
have gotten the HP there well the great

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:04.360
thing about this run the run is very

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:06.130
good it's just I'm experimenting with it

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.669
in like putting ourselves in a weird

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:09.760
spot

00:33:06.669 --> 00:33:11.049
it's basically what's happening but the

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:13.090
great thing about this run is that we

00:33:11.049 --> 00:33:14.860
know if we walk into the boss fight and

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:16.720
we have the ability to press the

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:19.240
spacebar blue baby is basically going to

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:22.049
die we'd like to have the ability to

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:26.860
press the spacebar twice if possible

00:33:22.049 --> 00:33:29.650
little shad a little too little and but

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:31.720
it's not too late it just is it's later

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:33.640
than I'd like it to be it's like a happy

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:37.630
ending but why did we wait so long

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:40.059
maybe beelzebub no we only got two so we

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:45.429
again blue baby is just so highly dusta

00:33:40.059 --> 00:33:47.679
belen it why why do it first off no

00:33:45.429 --> 00:33:51.159
streak secondly we should be able to

00:33:47.679 --> 00:33:53.679
dust delirium there's there's so many

00:33:51.159 --> 00:33:55.770
ways that delirium gets dusted go in

00:33:53.679 --> 00:33:59.620
with full health and a perk spill and

00:33:55.770 --> 00:34:03.039
deliriums dusted we just mash the

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:04.780
spacebar until it dies so we're going to

00:34:03.039 --> 00:34:07.090
try to get back to full HP basically

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:11.470
we've got a nice damage bonus as well

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:14.889
like I'm feeling a love there it really

00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:20.130
actually does it really does not matter

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:22.890
whether I think the hearts or okay

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:24.420
let's go scary doesn't really matter

00:34:22.890 --> 00:34:26.160
right now whether I think the hearts or

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:31.260
blue baby takes the hearts what does

00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:34.320
matter is that we don't take damage and

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:38.280
also that we fight delirium lasts or

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:40.200
it's not fast at least we got some work

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:42.000
to do first but I think this is actually

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.230
a chance for redemption so I'm very

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:49.110
grateful that we've been given this

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:52.560
opportunity I am going to use I'm going

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:58.230
to use our varicose vein strat but I can

00:34:52.560 --> 00:35:01.170
only use it once I know we're safe to

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:04.590
use it if that makes sense like lovers

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:07.680
card that's very good I needed I want it

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:11.190
to generate a lot of red hearts so that

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:14.550
we can use them or dark bomb can use

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:16.350
them so the way that that happens is

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:20.550
like we're taking these for now because

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:22.530
we want them but the way that that

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:27.630
happens is we find a very home Thank You

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:29.970
infamy but a very busy room it's not

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:32.880
this room dude infamy you're the

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:35.990
greatest okay we're at full HP now we

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:38.580
can start the pop so now we start

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:40.280
hopefully not using too many red hearts

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:44.820
verb gives us another range uphill

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:46.110
justice card more HP's oh it ended rock

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:50.790
no kidding

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:52.050
to spirit heart let's go maybe we don't

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:53.370
need to get finicky with it maybe I'm

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:57.840
just trying to come up with excuses to

00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:59.580
use our easy way out more often I think

00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:02.270
we should just slow down except the

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:05.670
spirit hearts that we get for free as

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:08.850
being an awesome bonus and then when we

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:11.850
fight delirium just you know shoot our

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:13.860
whole lot all at once aqua rate a phrase

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:19.560
that them I think you understand what I

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:20.670
mean if you don't what I mean is we're

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.620
going to walk into that room we're going

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:24.210
to stand next to delirium we're going to

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:25.860
press space we're going to wait till our

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:27.030
invincibility wears off and they're

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:28.920
going to press space again because it

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:31.620
gives us that gives max time for bumbo

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:33.450
to do a bumbo wants to do rip of greed

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:36.299
is irrelevant right now

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:38.760
and I actually don't cause pretty bad I

00:36:36.299 --> 00:36:39.450
don't care about fighting delirium last

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.609
anymore

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:47.880
I think we're ready I know it changed

00:36:41.609 --> 00:36:50.099
pretty quickly but a perk spill would be

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:52.799
nice you know algae's doesn't really

00:36:50.099 --> 00:36:55.500
matter that much the HP is it's good it

00:36:52.799 --> 00:36:58.049
gives us another like a little leg up on

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:59.849
the situation but this is what we want

00:36:58.049 --> 00:37:01.740
we want to kill multi segmented enemies

00:36:59.849 --> 00:37:05.119
so that they have a huge chance to drop

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:05.119
things that can turn into spirit arms

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:14.730
all right could a tiny room probably not

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:21.960
a delirium fight full HP though too hard

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:23.819
that's actually enormous so we basically

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:25.790
do not care about that but this could be

00:37:23.819 --> 00:37:30.859
delirium I'm ready I'm ready to crap on

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:30.859
monster it to boss is I'm going to hit

00:37:31.549 --> 00:37:41.849
we can't lose IV bag so we can't you

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:45.559
can't make the call here I take more red

00:37:41.849 --> 00:37:45.559
hearts it would it would work

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:49.589
hopefully this serves there's a little

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:53.430
bit of redemption for a run that we

00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:56.250
played quite spottily I'll admit to what

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:58.079
clubs 82 bones it's it's good if our

00:37:56.250 --> 00:38:00.569
bombs are a little bit better but you

00:37:58.079 --> 00:38:03.260
know it's not it's not bad because

00:38:00.569 --> 00:38:05.790
they're our bombs are bad too

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:07.260
still more bombs either way come on dude

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:09.589
I mean I'm just making idle chitchat

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:12.720
here will you pay out with thank you

00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:14.940
the more red hearts the merrier I don't

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:18.359
really know that's a tiny skull that's

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:20.910
just part of the ground why did that

00:38:18.359 --> 00:38:24.740
shoot at a 45-degree angle yeah okay

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:24.740
item maybe I'm losing my mind

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:33.030
get in here you don't you know I've been

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:34.740
treating these low range brimstone

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:35.880
lasers if they're a huge negative we

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:38.480
should really just treat them as if

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.480
they're turrets

00:38:44.529 --> 00:38:51.260
use the turrets Thank You Bumbo use the

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:55.609
turrets to deal damage sure there's a

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:58.039
chest back there if Chester on to infamy

00:38:55.609 --> 00:39:01.819
is the star of the show if if chests

00:38:58.039 --> 00:39:04.270
were guaranteed to give us items no

00:39:01.819 --> 00:39:04.270
problem

00:39:07.599 --> 00:39:13.240
second two of hearts I'm starting to

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:13.240
think somebody up there likes me

00:39:16.029 --> 00:39:20.059
I don't know if I can stomach playing

00:39:18.499 --> 00:39:21.559
another judgement at this point getting

00:39:20.059 --> 00:39:23.900
a little on the ridiculous side with the

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:24.410
judgments we I almost don't think we can

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:26.329
lose

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:27.980
we can't take two two of hearts in but

00:39:26.329 --> 00:39:30.799
we basically have one and a half times

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:34.579
our existing amount of HP I would be

00:39:30.799 --> 00:39:36.049
surprised if you lose could be delirium

00:39:34.579 --> 00:39:40.539
I almost want it to be at this point so

00:39:36.049 --> 00:39:42.200
we can finish this this curse to run but

00:39:40.539 --> 00:39:47.359
we're gonna get it

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:52.749
dim-bulb highly relevant okay last

00:39:47.359 --> 00:39:52.749
assist cool not what I wanted at all a

00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:07.749
bunch of pills we should take them it's

00:40:03.529 --> 00:40:07.749
no reason not to take them should take

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:15.289
tears up tears up does not work but nice

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:17.569
to know hematemesis is worse than two of

00:40:15.289 --> 00:40:20.829
hearts but they both you know they got

00:40:17.569 --> 00:40:20.829
they got their merits

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:29.400
I still think something about this run

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:33.869
is like it's a little bit of a cruel

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:36.750
joke like to give me all this this the

00:40:33.869 --> 00:40:39.840
most convenient way that's hilarious to

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:41.790
deal damage and then not give me the

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:43.710
amount of red hearts necessary to do it

00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:46.260
because all of our red arts are being

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:51.810
siphoned by you know the usurper dark

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:54.960
bombs I ain't mad I'm just sort of like

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:57.720
we're we got all the items necessary for

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:59.130
a wicked synergy and you you took it all

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:01.590
away and then you shoved it in my face

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:04.380
and now those are just the lyrics to

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:05.670
that song by puddle of mud can you take

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:09.930
it all away

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:12.119
I mean yes it is you got me the Delirium

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:14.130
fight cannot be down there so instead we

00:41:12.119 --> 00:41:17.849
continue what feels like the world's

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:21.090
longest run and I told you just because

00:41:17.849 --> 00:41:23.940
it's azazel run doesn't mean you know

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:26.810
it's guaranteed to be you know a say me

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:31.859
kind of boring snooze fest this is a

00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:35.369
this is not a snooze fest in my

00:41:31.859 --> 00:41:36.980
estimation at least I'll go to this with

00:41:35.369 --> 00:41:39.869
one less HP and maybe that's you know

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:42.450
silks silk slippers down the staircase

00:41:39.869 --> 00:41:46.200
you know the beginning of the end but I

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:49.290
think we got it okay ish get dusted Gish

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:51.650
welcome to the dusting party sure it's

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:51.650
latchkey

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:57.720
not against it go back I don't think

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:59.730
it's a half red heart it's a half red

00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:05.520
heart forget a second half red heart

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:06.090
we'll work it in but now you're speaking

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:09.050
my language

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:14.760
and or offering me a Vegemite sandwich

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:19.200
delirium Satan all right but like at

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:20.790
some point there's going to be the

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.410
delirium flight of the thing and once

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:29.130
once we get that then you know the

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:32.370
world's our oyster very very easy money

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:34.230
I don't want to use compost because I

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:36.420
might accidentally turn IV bag into

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:41.790
spiders I don't think it does that but I

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:44.150
think it is worth not us being silly

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:44.150
about

00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:51.800
was that the damage out of nearsighted

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:53.480
friend because I don't think I've ever

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:55.310
been as impressed with nearsighted

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:56.840
friend as I was right there which is a

00:42:55.310 --> 00:43:00.670
big surprise for an item that's again

00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:03.080
been in the game for 200 years so maybe

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:07.280
maybe nearsighted friend has brought it

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:15.070
back completely get dusted to dustings

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:20.960
what's one dusting because it's one dust

00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:22.900
one bank okay we need I need a half

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:25.630
heart nice nice

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:29.930
are we ready this has got to be it right

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:33.170
what it's the world's longest floor I

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:41.770
didn't think it was possible for a floor

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:41.770
to be this long this there's no question

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:50.170
we got all way I wanted both of them it

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:50.170
doesn't really matter but okay

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:58.340
we've got invincibility out of Virgo

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:59.960
that means we wait

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:02.860
yeah wait and deal as much damage as

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:07.160
possible with your own brimstone lasers

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:11.330
there's no reason to hurt ourselves we

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:13.100
might as well wait till our

00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:17.450
invincibility is almost up and then pop

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:20.840
it yeah I mean we're gonna win the Virgo

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:22.790
invincibility oh my god you got totally

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:25.130
crapped on there the Virgo invincibility

00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:26.510
was too good so wait is it you know a

00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:29.150
little bit of redemption towards the end

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:30.560
