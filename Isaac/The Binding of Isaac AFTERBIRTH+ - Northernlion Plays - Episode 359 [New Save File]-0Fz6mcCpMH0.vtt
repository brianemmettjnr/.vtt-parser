00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.570
everybody welcome back to the lion place

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.819
the binding of issac afterbirth plus I

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.760
just did a poll on Twitter and the poll

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.080
said new save file in Isaac as of right

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.059
now it is seven hundred and forty one

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.650
votes thirty six percent of people say I

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.120
want a new save file fifteen percent of

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.710
people say I don't want it forty nine

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.470
percent of people say I just want to

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.310
vote so we siphoned out the people who

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.289
just want to do their democratic

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.789
obligation and I appreciate that

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.260
but it seems like the overwhelming

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.750
majority of people that have a

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.189
preference want to see a new save file

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.800
so let's delete this one in the middle

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.690
here and start brand new from zero it's

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.300
going to be a little bit of a oh I am on

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.690
freakin normal mode let's not get

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.910
ridiculous here I mean in my eyes Jesus

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.280
Christ not used to hitting the continue

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.489
button it might be a new save file but

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.600
we don't need to start from freaking

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.129
normal mode that's a little bit of an

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.329
embarrassment we have to beat everything

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:04.650
uh normal mode I don't think we do DWM

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:06.119
vsc-2 R so we're going to try it out you

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.460
know the thing is I didn't delete my

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.990
major save file so it really doesn't if

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.700
things don't work out here if we decide

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.140
that new save file is for whatever

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.610
reason you know it lacks all the cool

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.680
synergies or something like that it's

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.619
going to take too long to get there then

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.860
we can always scrap it and just say it's

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.540
unnecessary for us to proceed here but I

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.030
want to give it a shot you know it could

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.820
be cool to get a little bit of a

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.130
nostalgic hit and kind of revisit how

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.170
you know the quests to real platinum God

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.270
goes but I also recognize that you know

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.710
at this point in Isaac you basically is

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.360
even watching this long you've seen

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.119
everything gameplay-wise that there is

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.110
to see and there's a lot of it to see

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.240
don't get me wrong

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.290
oh come on come on take a shot coward

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.470
take a shot would have used rocks do

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.750
these rocks are weird oh my god a blue

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.420
hardened okay I can't pain that forever

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.560
but it might be nice to revisit some of

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.270
the stuff that can happen in the game

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.860
that I might have been unaware of not to

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.680
mention beating some of the challenges

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.700
over again and something a lot of issac

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.289
streamers have done and I've always been

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.810
resistant to because to be honest I

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.060
cling to my progress because of the fact

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.280
that

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.590
I mean not everything in this game was

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:23.349
not hard-fought if that makes sense

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:26.560
we've we've managed to you know scrit

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.970
scrape and survive on a lot of these

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.980
more difficult challenges I didn't even

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:35.260
know the wafer was a default item so to

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.060
lose those it feels like it hurts it's

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.580
like you're ripping it straight from my

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.900
my actual body but at the same time I

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.250
think it'll be worth it to at least give

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.790
it a try bombs a key please

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.549
human appearances I think we should

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.280
check the library as well plus I do want

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:56.880
to point out this is not a library I do

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:59.860
want to point out that it's probably a

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.150
given but these first few runs are

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.120
probably going to be pretty short

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:08.290
because of the fact that the new save

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.989
file only goes to to mom on the first

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.269
few attempts here excuse me so I'm uh

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.819
what we'll try to fit in multiples in

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.260
and I just didn't even feel right saying

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.750
that well trying to fit will try to fit

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.040
in multiple runs for our first few

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.600
episodes here I'm a little commentary

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.250
off-balance because of the fact that

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.840
we're it's weird cuz we're playing the

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.480
same game that I played three thousand

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.010
times but you know it's a new save file

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.959
so it feels totally different but I

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.760
think we should just relax and get back

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.410
into it

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.750
how's it going everybody by the way if

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.220
you're not a big fan of this decision

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.319
what is your opinion you know there will

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.870
always be a backlog in some inertia so

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.489
you know comment and tweet me and be

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.900
like I hate this if you hate it and if

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:51.190
you like it make sure to comment that

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:54.670
you liked it as well you know I really I

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:57.430
truly believe that the downfall of

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.470
modern discourse online is that the

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.420
people who have mildly Pleasant and

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.209
mildly negative opinions on things are

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.819
not incentivized to comment you know you

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.310
don't see too many three or four star

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:13.239
reviews of restaurants on Google Yelp

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.100
etc etc same with Amazon Metacritic you

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.750
know it's always five stars in one stars

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.090
this is the greatest product ever this

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.750
product stinks we should just use the

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.099
Stars card I think but I'm not going to

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.780
use the X we can teleport that's an

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:26.830
advanced level technique that a normal

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.419
player wouldn't know

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.370
when they first got started because

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:37.479
we're like neo being reborn here but

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:39.250
anyway I think clatters you should leave

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.750
more three star reviews I mean it's

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.729
unrealistic to say you should review

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.250
like every product you've ever had in

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.569
your life but if you like mildly enjoy

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.789
something I think you should leave a

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:52.210
review for example eating lunch at

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:54.430
Starbucks look it's probably more

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.229
expensive than and I'm saying this

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.849
because I had Starbucks for lunch today

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.060
it's probably more expensive than it's

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.520
worth

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.199
but it's convenient and even though they

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.300
basically microwaved the sandwiches

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:06.340
right in front of you sometimes it can

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.900
hit the spot like I just had a nice ham

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.099
and red pepper sandwich and I was like

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.740
this is not the best sandwich I've ever

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:13.300
had in my entire life and it was pricier

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.830
than it should have been but it kind of

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.710
hit the spot in the moment so you know

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.879
what that's a three star sandwich I'm

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.949
going to go after this and I'm going to

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:25.060
review that Starbucks that's like your

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:27.099
homework assignment for today is find

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.930
something that you are sort of okay with

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:29.800
and give it a three star review now I

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.319
know what you're going to say you're

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.639
going to say NL it's a small business

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:34.419
well it's not really a small business

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.610
it's probably owned by a local

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:40.840
franchisee and you're going to blow up

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.639
their spot here oh come on what a waste

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.949
but we'll still take it on you're going

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.300
to blow up their spot here and give them

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:49.659
a three star review that's going to

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.279
lower their overall average it is dude

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:54.250
I'm taking the worst damage of all time

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:56.050
here it might lower their average but

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.879
it's in the interest of being honest I'm

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.449
sick of seeing only we're almost

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:03.039
exclusively five stars and one stars

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:05.169
because you know what happens is then

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:07.509
people look at it and they go I think

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:11.650
the subway is a three but it's got a

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:15.550
four point one rating right now what is

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:17.949
this shop this is what shops look like

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:21.310
I'm losing it man

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:22.930
I think this subway is a three but it's

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.279
got a four point one rating so I'm going

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.129
to give it a one two bring it more in

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:28.300
line with my my own personal beliefs

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:30.909
right now it's the same thing that

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.440
happens on like Metacritic user reviews

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:33.759
people go this game is a six but it's

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.860
got an eight so I'm going to give it a

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:37.449
one they even acknowledge it they go I

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.000
don't think it's actually a one but I

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:41.100
had to give it a 1 to balance

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.190
scale that's not how it's supposed to

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.170
work my dudes anyway that's your

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.570
homework assignment give something a

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.730
three or four star rating that you think

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:53.520
is imperfect but you know worth having

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.770
an honest opinion about I want to rebuke

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.650
the notion that only five star reviews

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:02.940
are acceptable although I will admit

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:04.170
when it comes to legged monster -

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:09.450
disappeared in the basement we've done

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:10.470
it when it comes to it's just so good we

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.930
got to take as many items as possible

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:15.120
just because we've unlocked Azazel oh my

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.280
God we're making incredible progress but

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.680
what if you got a ghetto bird driver or

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.290
door - driver is something like that you

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.210
got to give them a five star you got to

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:26.730
give them at least a four star unless

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:29.010
they like you know actually put your

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:31.200
safety into question because otherwise

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:32.460
you're really like you're screwin them

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:37.830
they're just doing this for a side

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:39.630
hustle and you know being a honest could

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.850
cost them a lot unfortunately it's not I

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.950
don't love it you know I would love to

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:46.110
only give five stars to over drivers who

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:48.450
have like you know you karaoke in the

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:50.220
backseat and you know hey there's a you

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.570
know free San Pellegrino on tap back

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.729
there but that's not realistic they're

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:55.110
getting paid like two dollars a ride to

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:57.660
shuffle you around the city you've never

00:07:55.110 --> 00:08:00.479
been to before and also like not kill

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.830
you in the process so you know I all you

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:03.510
got to give them a five star for that

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:06.600
it's like a friend helping you move even

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:08.640
if they drop one thing you got to give

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.780
them a five star review I think they're

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.710
doing it not out of the goodness of

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.790
their heart but it's not like they're

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:15.419
getting rich out of it

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:17.820
the restaurants absolutely because you

00:08:15.419 --> 00:08:20.370
know we've got this like awful inflation

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:22.350
now where we look at restaurant reviews

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.550
on like Google especially if you're in

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.479
the city you've never been to before you

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:26.280
look at the restaurant reviews and

00:08:24.479 --> 00:08:27.540
you're like oh that place only as a 4.2

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:32.280
I don't know if I want to go there

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:35.310
that's really good is it actually a 4.2

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:37.140
or is that doesn't just satisfy 84

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:39.120
percent of customers and then the other

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:45.409
16% gave it a 1 that's the thing you'll

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:45.409
never know right anyway I digress

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:53.260
three star reviews are the most helpful

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:57.520
reviews in my opinion at least I go to a

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:59.950
lot of locations that I would consider

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:02.490
to be three stars and I frequent them

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:06.610
you know there's a coffee shop near me a

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:08.110
little too pricey service is very slow

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:11.740
but the sandwiches are delicious

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:13.540
and that's a three star experience for

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:15.820
me maybe bump it up to four because it's

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:19.500
close but that doesn't really affect

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.500
other people I suppose anyway I digress

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.620
it's the same thing when he comes to

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:26.950
like arguing about anything online you

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:28.570
know the people who are moderate about

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:29.620
things they don't comment because they

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.630
just go out you know I'm just going to

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:33.850
get on with my life you only get the

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:35.410
people at both extremes excuse me these

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:38.350

appropriately for once I don't know man

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:50.200
basically I don't know what I'm not the

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:51.520
secret room basically I don't know what

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:55.960
I'm talking about is what I'm trying to

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:58.210
get at here but I appreciate the people

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.470
in the comments who leave comments like

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:02.230

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.930
life and I appreciate that and I'm like

thanks a lot I'm happy to hear that it

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.730

sincerely more comments like that and

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:13.720
then there's comments that go how did

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:15.280
this idiot ever like you know graduate

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.080
from middle school he's got no common

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.330
sense he can't even launch a rocket into

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:22.089
orbit like that's an average skill that

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:24.100
the modern day a man and woman learns in

00:10:22.089 --> 00:10:26.020
kindergarten apparently and I'm I guess

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:28.180
I didn't go to Neil Armstrong school for

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:30.550
gifted freaking astronaut anyway I'm

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:31.839
digressing here but I appreciate those

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:35.020
comments as well cuz sometimes they make

00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:36.940
me laugh but I also really appreciate

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:40.420
the ones that are like this episode was

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:42.880
pretty good it was not a waste of my

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:47.320
time to watch this that's like hey

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:49.750
thanks for the honest opinion you know

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:52.300
there are people in this industry and

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:55.300
they kind of understand why who woulda

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:58.529
thought angry fly dude a booster pack

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:59.850
item showing up so soon but therapy

00:10:58.529 --> 00:11:05.370
on this business I understand why I do

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:07.829
it who just shut down any form of

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:09.259
criticism you know if you criticize them

00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:14.430
you're blocked that's it

00:11:09.259 --> 00:11:16.230
even people that are we use the tower to

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:19.379
get like infinity bombs

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:23.279
we're a god we're actually a god we just

00:11:19.379 --> 00:11:25.019
use the tower to get six bombs it's

00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:26.189
incredible you know you get a lot of

00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:27.779
criticism especially when you do

00:11:26.189 --> 00:11:30.209
something wrong it comes from a lot of

00:11:27.779 --> 00:11:31.800
sources so it's very tempting to just be

00:11:30.209 --> 00:11:34.170
like you know if you ever say anything

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.959
negative about me you're cut but I don't

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:38.430
think it's honest because a lot of times

00:11:36.959 --> 00:11:39.449
I get like a negative tweet or something

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.980
like that and then I look at their other

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:42.629
tweets and their tweets are like

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:44.220
positive in there they just feel like

00:11:42.629 --> 00:11:46.019
their voice is not being heard and then

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:50.160
I try to make an effort a lot of the

00:11:46.019 --> 00:11:51.569
time to reach out to those people and be

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.999
like hey I understand why you're upset

00:11:51.569 --> 00:11:55.949
right now it's like a Vince Gilligan

00:11:53.999 --> 00:11:58.350
made you know every episode of Breaking

00:11:55.949 --> 00:12:01.649
Bad like fly you'd be like Vince

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:03.329
Gilligan by the way dude safety scissors

00:12:01.649 --> 00:12:04.170
is crushing it for us right now who

00:12:03.329 --> 00:12:06.569
would have thought we'd learned

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:13.259
something new by deleting or starting a

00:12:06.569 --> 00:12:14.759
new save file so many bombs you might

00:12:13.259 --> 00:12:16.230
get spun here as well we already saw

00:12:14.759 --> 00:12:19.709
that right yeah down in the next floor

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:22.500
um I think it's important because you

00:12:19.709 --> 00:12:25.110
can here's a little dirty little secret

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.850
about doing YouTube and twitch you get

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:29.339
to a certain size a lot of people like

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:31.199
you and that's sweet I'm not saying I've

00:12:29.339 --> 00:12:33.839
got a big head over it at all I don't

00:12:31.199 --> 00:12:36.449
walk out in public and go like oh I'm

00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:38.850
like the God's gift to entertainers you

00:12:36.449 --> 00:12:41.129
know because I can make up song lyrics

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:43.050
that are not horrible on the fly I

00:12:41.129 --> 00:12:46.410
mostly walk outside and go you know

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:48.839
remember when the server says enjoy your

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:51.809
meal you say thank you you don't say you

00:12:48.839 --> 00:12:53.579
too because that'll be awkward so that's

00:12:51.809 --> 00:12:56.879
where I'm at in my life but it's very

00:12:53.579 --> 00:12:58.410
easy and I think seductive to get

00:12:56.879 --> 00:13:00.839
yourself into this position where you

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:03.029
only accept praise and never accept

00:13:00.839 --> 00:13:04.559
criticism it's not healthy because

00:13:03.029 --> 00:13:06.959
you're going to get criticized all the

00:13:04.559 --> 00:13:08.100
time in public you know not just because

00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:10.070
you're living in the public eye of even

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:14.330
just like driving

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:17.250
no of you probably I get yelled at once

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:19.170
every time I Drive but I'm assuming that

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:20.490
it's happening behind closed doors

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:23.040
because I don't hear it you know but

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:24.779
there are definitely like I yell it like

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:27.510
four people every time I Drive so I'm

00:13:24.779 --> 00:13:28.710
like I must be getting yelled at now and

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:30.779
then even if I think I'm not doing

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:32.940
anything wrong the old left hand has

00:13:30.779 --> 00:13:34.890
appeared in the basement let's go

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:37.010
honestly though I'm loving safety

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:42.029
scissors let's stick with that for now

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:44.250
you kind of stay open to criticism you

00:13:42.029 --> 00:13:46.410
know that's what I like about school it

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:50.010
sounds weird but you get criticized like

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:51.900
all the time and it's not the criticism

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:52.950
as like a negative connotation but you

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:55.830
know your teacher is going to be like

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:58.830
hey you only got 70% of this right your

00:13:55.830 --> 00:14:00.240
mark is a 70 keeps you keeps you honest

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:04.470
you know reminds you that you got to

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:06.120
keep working hard stay hungry you'd be

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.500
surprised because I know I get tweets

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.089
all the time that are like don't listen

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.370
to the haters and I'm like nah dude

00:14:09.089 --> 00:14:15.600
don't obviously you don't listen to the

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:20.490
haters who just go like hey bald jerk

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:22.680
you you suck lick on my peepee you go

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:24.600
okay that guy first off how summer

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:27.900
vacation treating you I hope you do well

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:29.400
in 9th grade next year but also you know

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.420
those people you just tune him out and

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:33.150
now again I'm going to get like a

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:35.520
hundred tweets in four days that say hey

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:37.950
ball jerk lickin my peepee but anyway

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:41.160
I'm going to forget why I'm getting

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:42.839
those tweets and be very confused but

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.490
you know when people are like they like

00:14:42.839 --> 00:14:46.500
your content and they have a just got a

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.790
little bone to pick you owe it to

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:50.310
yourself to hear them out otherwise you

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:52.410
know you end up in an outcast situation

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.980
I know you like to thank your don't

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.930
stank

00:14:52.980 --> 00:15:00.890
but lean a little bit closer see roses

00:14:54.930 --> 00:15:03.600
really smell like boo boo food anyway

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:05.760
we've been on this tangent many times in

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:08.070
episodes before so I don't want to I

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:10.350
don't want to belabor the point too too

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:13.560
much I'm just saying thanks thanks for

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:16.700
all the honest criticism as long as it

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:20.320
doesn't say lick my peepee in which case

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:23.450
you should show your pal

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:25.790
those they're like sometimes you just

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:26.990
got to be come on those are the comments

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:30.710
that make you wonder about human society

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:32.620
it's like that and agdq chat you go are

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:35.240
we all right as the species right now

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:38.180
I'm sure everyone's going no I have to

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:41.270
watch the news recently we're screwed

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:43.460
you know I don't know maybe maybe not

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:46.450
I don't get paid to have an opinion on

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:48.740
that so I choose not to I'm going to

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:51.740
donate as much money as possible here

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:53.510
because we do need to unlock stuff and

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:56.600
we I mean we have to get it back to 999

00:15:53.510 --> 00:16:00.260
cents to begin with no reason to buy a

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:03.140
bomb here it's actually like a pretty

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:06.110
engaging first run here I was worried we

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:07.550
just you know either snowball out of

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:09.980
control or get nothing interesting but

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:13.970
it's actually just like a nice run lots

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:16.160
of damage good potential for deal with

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:19.250
the devil action as a result of the goat

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:21.620
head obviously and unlocking a lot of

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:23.480
stuff plus you know newfound love for

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:31.460
the safety scissors Jarrah flies is a

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:36.440
great spacebar item like YouTube isn't

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:39.320
which are a job that LG you take undue

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:43.520
amounts of nonsense admittedly like you

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:45.380
get up if you're in a normal job little

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.880
Chubby's appear in the basement but

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:49.160
because we beat the catacombs or

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.390
something what is this wait we have seen

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:55.340
this once before I just don't remember

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:58.580
what it is seven seals all right it gets

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:59.780
a little weird yeah remember now did we

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.160
get the horsemen that follows us around

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.510
I think this item is actually pretty

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.270
good

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:06.230
obviously we'll take gimpy as well I

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:07.490
feel bad saying this because there's a

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:09.410
lot of youtubers to take like a lot of

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:11.320
garbage let me take a drink here for a

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:13.760
second

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:15.470
you know get my thoughts in order

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.640
there's a lot of youtubers to take a lot

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:19.250
of garbage and they would listen to me

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:21.800
say this and be like are you serious but

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:25.220
it's also really easy to be like I am

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:28.300
the greatest person in the world I never

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:31.070
want that I always want to feel like a

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:32.730
little bit like trash I think that's my

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:34.740
natural state

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:37.799
you feel a little bit like trash you're

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:40.890
motivated you know of course you're also

00:17:37.799 --> 00:17:43.010
anxious never really content but you're

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:44.970
ambitious you know you strive for

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:49.530
self-improvement to some degree and I

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:51.419
think that's as virtuous or maybe

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:56.690
incredibly damaging the psyche I don't

00:17:51.419 --> 00:17:56.690
know dude I got no idea

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:03.540
I'm adrift without a generation in my my

00:18:00.299 --> 00:18:05.580
my a millennial I think so then all

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:07.200
these other Millennials are you know

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:10.320
playing with fidget spenders in Eden

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:12.030
avocados host deny and honestly I'm but

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:15.919
guacamole man personally but I've never

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:19.410
had avvocato toast if you've never

00:18:15.919 --> 00:18:22.530
sliced an avocado there should really be

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:25.740
like a form of therapy where you just

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:28.200
cut an avocado over and over and I feel

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:31.760
like I'm saying avocado weirdly it's the

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:36.000
most pleasant vegetable slash fruit to

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:38.040
to slice there's like just the slightest

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.309
bit of it sounds creepy but there's just

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:44.700
the slightest bit of resistance it's

00:18:41.309 --> 00:18:46.799
like cutting into a fatty cloud I love

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.690
it and then when you peel like the the

00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:51.120
skin off of the avocado and it just

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:54.540
comes off like you know I hang the

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:55.470
helicase get NL please stop you'll just

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.630
need a bit if you put a toothpick

00:18:55.470 --> 00:19:00.750
underneath your big toenail and just

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:02.460
kick the wall as hard now I'm just these

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:06.510
are these are internet means at this

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:09.919
point I'm testing the the power of your

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:09.919
imagination in your mind's eye

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.960
I can't believe that we've gotten so

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:19.270
many booster pack Ives I mean I know

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:24.520
what sample size of one anything can

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:28.510
happen right careful you know we could

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:30.400
get mega assuming it's actually unlocked

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:34.510
which I think it's not but and we

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:38.620
couldn't be like oh my god mega what a

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:40.990
rarity um we I mean obviously it's super

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:43.350
worth like losing our lives here to pick

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:46.720
up these items so we're going to do so

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:49.299
we're going to become guppy which has

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:52.000
unlocked Guppies hair ball and unlock

00:19:49.299 --> 00:19:55.900
challenge number eight and then we're

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.820
also going to take spirit of the night

00:19:55.900 --> 00:20:01.360
which will kill us as well but I think

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:03.880
the why wouldn't we right and then we're

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:05.350
going to take this HP and we're going to

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.390
use this once and we're going to take

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:08.559
this now I'm going to skip the item room

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:10.720
on this floor you're not going to love

00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:12.160
that but hear me out here I think it's

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:19.660
important for us to don't we all not to

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:21.640
Eve because we what is the eve it's like

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.620
get more than 12 spirit arts in a single

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:25.660
run or something anyway I would like to

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:27.460
do boss rush on this run because we have

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:29.500
to do it for progress so we might as

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:33.190
well get as many Birds stoned at once as

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:34.720
is possible we unlock a lot of stuff

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.650
here but you know we got posted notes to

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.440
fill it's going to take us a little

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:40.299
while here sure why not

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:43.179
I mean this is the final floor one way

00:20:40.299 --> 00:20:45.570
or the other so we might as well accept

00:20:43.179 --> 00:20:48.490
it two hearts is not worth anything

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:52.570
anyway my my commentaries been weird

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:55.570
this episode I acknowledge that as much

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:58.270
as I you know push this idea I'm not

00:20:55.570 --> 00:21:01.270
really a self-hating youtuber I've been

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:02.980
doing this business long enough you know

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.990
not everybody has what it takes and

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:06.309
that's not to say that it's a hard job

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:08.950
at all but you need to be self-motivated

00:21:06.309 --> 00:21:11.260
and I know that a lot of jobs goli know

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:12.549
in their interview listings they go you

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.290
know you got to be a self-starter that

00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:15.280
means we have bad management but really

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:17.350
like you know if you're the kind of

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.010
person who doesn't work well without

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:19.780
supervision

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:21.700
it's a tricky job and a lot of people

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:23.710
kind of washout as a result of that so I

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:26.880
do have respect for myself and other

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:26.880
youtubers and what we do but

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:32.520
there is there's a seductive power of

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:34.560
Fame as well the way that I've reacted

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:38.100
to the very minimal level of Fame that I

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:39.330
have and it is did I get recognized like

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:42.120
once a month

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:44.070
Lazarus that's my level of Fame is like

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:46.290
once a month I'll be out like a doughnut

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:48.480
shop in downtown Vancouver and then I'll

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:49.890
you know someone will be like hey NL I

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.420
love your videos and I'll be like thank

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:52.590
you that's very nice of you so I'm not

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.750
getting stopped like Matthew McConaughey

00:21:52.590 --> 00:22:00.660
or something we need this but we're also

00:21:54.750 --> 00:22:02.760
tight on time but is I to want to hide

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:05.910
in a cave for the rest of my life I

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:07.620
think some people react on the other

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:11.010
hand and they're like I love this and

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:13.410
I'm like why I love making the videos

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:15.810
and I do like meeting people that are

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:17.220
fans of the videos as well but you know

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:19.380
it has like a subtle effect where

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:22.530
whenever I'm out in public I'm like I

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:24.960
actually can't be an asshole because

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:27.420
even though I'm not famous I might be

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:30.360
famous enough for people to hate me if I

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:33.480
am a dick to some oh oh there's not even

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:34.680
any freaking boss rush here you might as

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:38.400
well watch the exit

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:40.170
finale here um but like if I was a dick

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.030
to someone in public it could be a story

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:45.140
I could see the reddit headline it's

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:48.540
like you know famous bald you to bird

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:49.890
calls lady a bad name in public not that

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.510
I would ever do that but that's that's

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:53.790
what's going through my mind like every

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:57.570
time I'm outside is like I'm going to be

00:22:53.790 --> 00:23:00.420
nice to everybody's fate God write the

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:02.820
Bible it falls off the shelf to stop his

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:05.400
mother's hand and she turns into a

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:07.260
ladybug it was and we have surmounted

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:13.680

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:18.740
