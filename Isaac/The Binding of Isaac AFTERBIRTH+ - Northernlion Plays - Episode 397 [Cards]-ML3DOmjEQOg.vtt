##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.750
everybody welcome extra lamb please

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.670
abiding by Stanford plus we're just

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.000
mainline in these challenges

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.000
I don't remember it's in the cards I do

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.150
remember beans you get the bean you got

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.789
black bean you got the songs that remind

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.880
us of the good times and if I'm not

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.789
mistaken the songs that remind us of the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.580
best times am I we had 99 bombs I was

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.930
thinking like if I well I thought we had

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.760
number two we don't have number two we

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.279
have but bombs sorry I was a little a

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.719
little confused by the situation as

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:41.640
presented there 99 poisonous bombs go by

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:47.430
like look balloons it's a relatively

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:51.539
easy run to imagine winning even if we

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.719
get no bombs we can use 15 per floor

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.739
without suffering like any consequences

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.539
I hate to do this but please jump at me

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.210
please jump thank you

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.850
you get farted on and then you will pass

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.049
away I will get a tears and shot speed

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.850
increase that's worth effectively

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.479
nothing but I think our game plan is

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:17.880
very obvious here get to mom which is

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.409
the end of this run use as few bombs as

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.409
possible I mean if we wanted to get

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.259
technical and like cheesy and possibly

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.720
like create the most disliked video I've

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.950
made since the episodes of Isaac in

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.530
green mode where I thought it was a

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.990
smart idea to never buy keys those were

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.070
the days or episode 90 of battlegrounds

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.659
equally dud days wow that that pretty

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.880
much gives us the win honestly Majesty

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.770
giving us occasional bombs is very

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.229
valuable here but yeah what I was going

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.299
to say is the way that we would probably

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.280
do that is just by blowing up the doors

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.470
getting to the bosses killing the bosses

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.040
with bombs then we're using literally a

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.090
bomb per room and that I think it

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.469
doesn't get any better than that we're

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.590
probably gonna not going to go through

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.479
90 rooms what the heck have I come

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.360
across here it's a like a booster pack

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.310
item I've never seen eyeball tears don't

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.170
you love it when you get an item that

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.650
can't conceivably provide you with any

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.900
benefit on a run like this

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.599
I'm not mad about it it's cool to see

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.340
new items I always like to experience

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.379
new stuff and it means that well it's

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.879
not true in real life I don't always

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.799
love to experience new stuff I'm the

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:29.280
kind of guy find something that like on

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.319
the menu I order it a million times why

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.090
mess with perfection right I will say

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.409
dude kind of a rough draw to find

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.590
Krampus this early but we're still

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:39.329
killing it from a bomb perspective we

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.430
probably want to keep beans just because

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.980
we can't or like the duh bean I should

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.810
say just in case we do run out of bombs

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.190
like we take up dad bombs or ki pill or

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.530
something like that we can put ourselves

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.239
in a pretty nasty spot there if we

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.790
didn't have any way to deal damage but

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.870
the dream is to never have to worry

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.730
about that so the other like very mild

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.209
bit of strategy as you keep in mind is

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.859
like always use bean as quickly as

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:12.720
possible when it's available because it

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:15.180
has a time charge associated with it now

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.099
I will admit I'm a little scared we're a

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.290
third of the way through the run more or

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.680
less way I mean in terms of total rooms

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.239
we're not even close but we're like a

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.730
third of the floors through the run and

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.379
yet you may have noticed we're already

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.060
closing in on being like more than a

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:36.419
third of our bombs down wouldn't say

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.909
that I'm alarmingly concerned but I

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:40.709
would say that it's like on the list I'm

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:42.090
starting to get a little worried so you

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.150
know what would actually be like a

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.889
low-key good pickup and I'm not going to

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.760
talk about Thor again despite a name in

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:53.099
the god of mixture a Loki great pickup

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:59.129
would be a map item something that

00:03:53.099 --> 00:04:01.019
allows us to prioritize the use of our

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:03.479
bombs that much more effectively just

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.159
because we're going to know when they're

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:06.870
applicable is like the highest

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:09.209
conceivable efficiency and when they're

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:14.609
not basically we're just going to keep

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:16.169
throwing bombs down here then a 67 but

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.880
almost halfway through the run I'll take

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.280
the pills because I'm not a baby if you

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.940
want to give me bombs or ki then shoot

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.370
coward you're only going to kill a man

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.820
although you probably will ruin the

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:33.070
Challenge 100% and you know what that's

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.070
your right video game is your right

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.850
please stop swallowing all of the toxic

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.430
but fumes from my bombs

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.310
I need those to damage these enemies and

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.729
you're making me an angry individual

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.840
here

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:49.540
okay little Chad probably irrelevant so

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.370
be it

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.130
okay flooded cakes be smart here because

00:04:52.370 --> 00:05:00.889
fifty eight bombs we read like half

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:03.410
probably wise to maximize the utility of

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.789
each bomb so on in a room like this just

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.770
get all the enemies to get as close to

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:09.979
you as they can seem as we can forty

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:13.010
eight hour energy I could not be less

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:17.020
excited about a basically useful pill

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:20.510
but here we are

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:24.080
kick that bad boy in there kick this bad

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:26.840
boy in there I'm a little amazed that we

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.660
haven't taken damage that could have

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.150
screwed us here later okay I do want to

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.740
point out in episode whatever of the

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.050
binding of issac which is this one I

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.470
could have used a bomb to get a bomb and

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.660
a penny

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.880
I know it's sacrilegious to not care

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.060
about that even though it's a would be a

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.880
positive for us to do so I apologize I

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:52.570
have brought great shame upon my Isaac

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:57.169
skills I'm only being like hat facetious

00:05:52.570 --> 00:06:00.229
it is a bad move to not go for it okay

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:02.870
like the thing is though yet okay so

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:04.910
like here's the problem first off we

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.510
should just bounce but now like there's

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:12.800
pride tied up in it so I can't refuse

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:15.169
that was annoying do me you never mind

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.729
just do me I'm going to say do me a

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:18.800
favor but I've changed my mind there

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:22.660
there we go there's some extra bombs out

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:25.039
of this appreciate it appreciate it

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.919
BOGO bombs would be another beautiful

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:30.760
pick up that arcade ended up being like

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:32.750
surprisingly quite good

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.430
you know what is nice about the

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.830
challenges as well I'm learning a little

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.270
bit about the world around us like and

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.890
by the world around us I mean about this

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.530
game that I played 10,000 times but I

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:46.370
always write off the value of the

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:48.830
concussion effect from our stinky bombs

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.750
here from toxic bombs they're really

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.360
really nice in a situation like this in

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:58.940
which we have no other means to hurt

00:06:53.360 --> 00:07:00.860
enemies using our bombs to kind of buy

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.320
us a little bit of time is very nice

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:07.060
that was a that was a poor move on my

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:10.490
part I'll be the first to tell you that

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:14.090
one more on the annoying side if I'm

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:17.780
being honest and okay one bomb to maybe

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:18.470
get consumables worth it but probably a

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:24.940
bad idea

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:35.240
we're almost approaching like using

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:36.979
bombs to open doors territory proving to

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.450
be surprisingly difficult we still got

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:40.400
two floors left and we're not exactly

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:43.790
killing it I mean in the Annie

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:46.280
Department but we're definitely not

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:47.690
killing it in the in the survival

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.610
department right now we're definitely

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.650
not killing it in the damage Department

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:54.250
so and what departments are we killing

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:58.610
it in maybe the Department of Energy

00:07:54.250 --> 00:08:00.470
Rick Perry Rick Ross these are just

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:04.370
Rick's at this point alright so I'm

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:07.070
going to be very slightly ballsy here IV

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:09.229
bag is actually potentially a game

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:12.070
winner for us but it's a big potential

00:08:09.229 --> 00:08:14.540
what we need to make IV bag really pop

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:16.460
just this is pretty good what we need to

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.950
make a V bag really pop would be an

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:21.140
orbital right here which I don't think

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:25.190
it's conceivable for us to get unless we

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:28.920
beat the odds and manage to get a deal

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:31.800
with the devil possible

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:34.590
I got to be honest though coming across

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.270
a tanky I walked right into him coming

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:40.020
across a tanky enemy at this point in

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:41.990
our lives is an extremely bad situation

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:45.480
to be in

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:48.450
please give me any alternative means of

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.950
dealing tips I'm scared dude like I'm

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:55.400
looking at this run and I'm like what

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:55.400
are we gonna do what are we gonna do go

00:08:55.550 --> 00:09:00.450
we're gonna be out of bombs soon so

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:03.000
we'll use this I had what is the blue

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:07.410
map might give me an indication of where

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:14.430
to go I'm not in the business of buying

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:17.280
a single bomb what how and I don't just

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:22.470
mean like how like a house way I did not

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:23.490
see what came for us there I am

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:29.100
perturbed

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:31.800
I just cannot I can't

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:35.360
I'm not going to wait I'm sorry please

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:38.250
give me something now I care

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:42.480
now I care about trying to maximize this

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:45.660
oh the shacks this is probably the it

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:48.810
might be the right way I really thought

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:52.730
I got them both we got to be so savvy

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.730
with bomb and beam usage

00:09:53.760 --> 00:10:08.250
just keep them going here Annie come on

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:13.180
jump that hurts me deep in my soul any

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:15.130
unnecessary usage of a bomb is like the

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:17.620
worst thing we could do this is fine

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:19.150
that that will save us time in the long

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.350
run even if you got to wait for this

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.450
thing to eventually come to fruition

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:24.240
here as long as it doesn't spit out a

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:25.870
spider that runs away from our fart

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.330
should be okay

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:31.000
so just to be on the safe side I'm

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:33.400
popping it probably was unnecessary but

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.320
I got a little skittish this should be

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:37.510
good

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:41.050
all right good recovery 13 bombs

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:46.660
remaining it's an enemy that gives us an

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:48.490
orbital aka like life is but a dream we

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:54.550
have just been saved like a ray

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:57.550
lamontagne song like a ctrl s shortcut

00:10:54.550 --> 00:11:04.180
in Photoshop or Microsoft Word we have

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:08.070
been saved like a coupon for a product

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:08.070
you actually use we have just been saved

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:18.740
well there's there's some just IMed

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:21.950
there's some justification for dark bum

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:23.060
I think we still have three bombs if we

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.740
didn't get an orbital I think we might

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.750
have been screwed and I'm just being

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:29.120
100% oz we could still lose I don't

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:31.460
think we will but if we hadn't gotten an

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:36.160
orbital I think we may have just like

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:39.440
literally lost so save the bombs

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:46.640
probably most prudence or keep them

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:48.980
around for you know mom plays here don't

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:53.120
forget about your beam it's kind of just

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:55.700
good advice in general I suppose I mean

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:59.540
it I really don't want to use a bomb so

00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:03.040
I won't but it's annoying I don't like

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:03.040
when runs make you slow down

00:12:07.839 --> 00:12:15.139
but you know what it's probably good

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:17.930
practice and I think we put two and two

00:12:15.139 --> 00:12:19.279
together here like that that usually

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:20.449
sounds like your salat you've solved the

00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:23.899
mystery but what I mean in this case

00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:25.610
specifically is we've gotten the items

00:12:23.899 --> 00:12:28.190
we need to succeed the orbital has

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:30.649
changed the run for us we're going to

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:32.180
take damage if we stand here but it's

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:34.519
another thing is great about challenges

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:36.350
from a novelty standpoint we actually

00:12:34.519 --> 00:12:37.940
don't care about taking damage as much

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:41.209
as we care about salvaging three bombs

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:44.540
it's like a weird counterintuitive way

00:12:41.209 --> 00:12:46.639
to look at things but I really feel like

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:48.860
now save the lovers dark bomb is

00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:51.319
actually bad for us right now because we

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:53.660
get more efficiency out of red hearts

00:12:51.319 --> 00:12:56.269
that we can pick up dark dark bomb is

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:57.649
bad for us from a from using a lovers

00:12:56.269 --> 00:13:00.110
card perspective is what I mean to say

00:12:57.649 --> 00:13:03.290
not bad for us in general necessarily

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:05.089
but my life is worth less than the three

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:07.459
bonds we have around us and I don't mean

00:13:05.089 --> 00:13:10.100
like the concept of my existence rather

00:13:07.459 --> 00:13:13.819
I mean the literal amount of life that I

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:17.600
have is worth less than than the bombs

00:13:13.819 --> 00:13:21.230
right now we're walking in like exactly

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:23.209
the same speed and direction as our

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:26.029
orbital so use a bomb knock these guys

00:13:23.209 --> 00:13:29.089
out yeah start rotating this way not

00:13:26.029 --> 00:13:32.660
good damage dude sorry dark bomb okay be

00:13:29.089 --> 00:13:34.130
smart by these two we're probably like

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:35.389
two rooms away from the boss fight we're

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:37.250
going to come away from this one with a

00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:39.259
victory but dude got to give it up to

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:41.930
the beams challenge a little bit more

00:13:39.259 --> 00:13:44.560
potent than I had thought was uh what's

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:44.560
going to happen

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:58.500
highly vegetable grab it get the heck

00:13:54.060 --> 00:14:00.240
out of town all we got to do is walk

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.800
into mom this is one of the rare

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:05.040
situations in which red mom would have

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.980
been better but turns out we didn't need

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:10.290
to save any of our bombs at all but

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:11.760
she's saying bombs moms I'm just you

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.680
know I'm confused but I'm also happy

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.780
that this run is closing in on

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.380
completion look at that bomb efficiency

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:20.040
right there

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:26.010
one bomb equals two bombs suck on that

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:28.770
Archimedes sad bombs would have been

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:30.750
nice would have been nice but you know

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:33.570
what we're getting the polaroid for no

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:35.610
reason and we're out of here 14 minutes

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:38.610
and burnt penny nothing wrong with that

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:46.310
let's go check out the it's in the cards

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:53.209
challenge here basement one two a space

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:56.160
card against humanity why why

00:14:53.209 --> 00:14:58.829
so we get starter deck deck of cards

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:02.220
nine volt and battery so essentially

00:14:58.829 --> 00:15:07.920
just a lot of cards it's actually like a

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:10.380
pretty good start like it's it's an

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:18.600
advantageous start relative to a normal

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:19.800
run and it only goes to Mom's foot I'm

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.320
not going to say whether that's good or

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.699
bad it's just short you know we might be

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.920
able to push it a little further

00:15:23.699 --> 00:15:27.600
I suppose if we want to but just

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:32.250
remember we're not using you know beam

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:33.930
power anymore doesn't mean we don't want

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:36.420
to use bombs whenever appropriate yeah

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:43.980
like dad probably was not appropriate

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:45.630
but okay I cards against humanity' is

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.820
probably the best card I actually hate

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:50.070
that and emergency contact which I never

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.930
remember what it does and thus not only

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:53.639
do I not get use out of it but I

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:55.199
irritate everybody who's like you don't

00:15:53.639 --> 00:15:55.649
remember what it does but it's actually

00:15:55.199 --> 00:15:59.250
pretty good

00:15:55.649 --> 00:16:00.930
I know it's not like everybody tweaks me

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:02.930
to say it's not a teleport card and yet

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:05.279
somehow and I'm not saying you're wrong

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:06.810
every time I use it I end up getting hit

00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:08.640
by a wall master and sucked out of

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:10.079
existence that's my memory at least

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:14.220
maybe it pulls the other enemies out I

00:16:10.079 --> 00:16:16.410
don't remember I'll replace egde and you

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:19.140
can play the sender you want point tip

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:23.820
all the time fight dude give me this

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:27.390
deal with the devil right after all we

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:31.380
win I know a lot of a lot of runs of

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:33.540
bend this but sack daggered equals you

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:36.870
win plus gimpy even is like even better

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:40.680
but I I've lived too long on this

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:42.630
glorious planet to like deal damage with

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:47.310
three point five damage tears that sort

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:49.110
of thing isn't my bag baby I want to

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:51.269
chop things up with a big old linoleum

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:54.360
knife here like it's the intro to the

00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:57.720
Aqua Teen Hunger Force movie notice I

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:59.250
didn't call it a film I don't know what

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.440
that lines supposed to mean it was like

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:03.390
a mr. show call back notice I didn't say

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.960
TV because TV is a nickname and

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:05.790
nicknames are

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:09.570
for friends and television is no friend

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:11.400
of mine you see Cavill is ironic because

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:13.050
they were also on television at the time

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.490
was on HBO was a very forward-thinking

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:15.440
network at the time not that it isn't

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:17.430
anymore

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.170
speaking of which dude I got to be

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:21.420
honest with you I'm not trying to rush

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:23.430
this episode out it just I mean when you

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:26.550
get sack daggers smoke it if you got it

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:29.220
it's 7:35 Game of Thrones is on at 8:00

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:36.660
you know a channel that's on HBO no she

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:40.050
didn't I will say that dude so when you

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:45.270
get HBO in Canada at least you can't

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:47.160
just get HBO is then it's I this is like

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:48.690
now going down ten different tangents I

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.640
don't necessarily want it to go down I

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:54.600
feel like a lot of people in my business

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:56.580
and I am not even being ironic referring

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.530
to it as a business this time but they

00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:00.630
have a chip on their shoulder about old

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:02.220
media well this is why we're putting you

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:05.940
guys out of business and I don't feel

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:07.800
like that you know I YouTube has its

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.120
advantages mostly it's like dude if you

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.740
already have your dream job why are you

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:13.320
punching down these people go into the

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:14.640
office every day to work on you know two

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.630
and a Half Men or something like that

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.400
you're just going to make them feel bad

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:19.290
about themselves with your comments that

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.150
are founded in ignorance plus you've

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:22.740
already get to make your own hours and

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:24.360
you know play video games for a living

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:26.100
why you coming across like you're some

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:30.120
sort of subset that's persecuted or

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:31.680
anyway the point is like I'm not the

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.360
kind of guy who just wants to crap on

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.630
old media and go like I'll get with the

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:39.420
times look I get it every get what the

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:40.980
times is a fair expression a lot of the

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.690
times but it's also a young person's

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:44.910
game you know you worked in television

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:47.580
since the time you were 22 years old

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:49.290
you're 55 you got like five years to go

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:51.180
to retirement everyone's going just

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:53.220
reinvent your whole life right now or

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:55.410
die that's the wave it's easy for you to

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.760
do well let me put this way it's easier

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:58.920
for you to do when you're 19 than when

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:01.590
you're like you know 50 because all I'm

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.970
saying so I got sympathy for people who

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:06.020
are you know they find themselves in

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:09.050
times of trouble as industries change

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:11.640
I'm not taking that I learned my lesson

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:15.990
I'll still do it for one read

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:17.040
fine by me but it is stupid that you

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:20.100
can't just buy HBO

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:21.570
like you'd have to be as stupid as I am

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:24.510
to pay 18 bucks a month to the movie

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:27.360
channels Plus HBO but the movie channels

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:29.280
just highlight like a how Netflix is

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:32.190
eatin their lunch and is 10 times better

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:35.310
for 18 dollars Canadian a month so like

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:37.530
15 USD roughly I don't know why I was

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:38.880
such a stickler for that roughly don't

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:43.470
get me wrong it's not an exact

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:51.090
calculation anyway you get three movie

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:54.870
channels and HBO I basically paid all

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:57.870
that for HBO's Netflix is like $15

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:59.910
Canadian a month you choose I mean

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:02.250
there's a much greater library of movies

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:03.990
and TV shows you can watch them at your

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:05.340
leisure you don't have to oh sorry the

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:06.750
movie you want to watch start at 15

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:09.060
minutes ago so actually like you're

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:12.870
screwed you got to wait for five days

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:14.250
for it to be back on blank card would be

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:17.880
nice by the way but I don't think were

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:19.170
going to get the money and I can't

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.270
stress enough just a much greater

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:24.990
selection the movie channel is like

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:26.400
cheap pay-per-view now have I seen good

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:30.470
things on the movie channel no not

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.470
really to be honest with you but I have

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:34.230
strengths the other ones too is space

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:38.180
we're never going to need to a space

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:40.830
gonna run this short I have put it on

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:42.030
now I'm happy about this because I do

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:47.460
want to get enough money to get blank

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:49.500
card if possible I have put it on when

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:51.900
I'm doing work in the background work

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:54.240
that doesn't require me to you know be

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:57.030
quiet essentially now we should never do

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:59.520
this you know little dicey here by a

00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:01.860
little actually I mean like a lot dicey

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:05.700
but it you know we do have 12 damage as

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:08.490
well or 10 damage I should say so we're

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:10.140
going to get there it's a blank card and

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:11.790
I think it is worth it for blank card

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.680
now what are we going to use blank card

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.910
with well as of right now we don't have

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.840
anything to use blank card with

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:17.840
unfortunately but

00:21:18.529 --> 00:21:22.619
eighteen dollars a month for that is

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:24.090
like it I guess at some point that's why

00:21:22.619 --> 00:21:26.039
people say get with the times is because

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:30.960
you kind of you know you lose sympathy

00:21:26.039 --> 00:21:32.730
pretty easily when you can get a much

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:34.590
better service for cheaper that also

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:38.309
offers you know greater flexibility but

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:39.330
anyway I'll keep this I'm you know

00:21:38.309 --> 00:21:46.409
you're supposed to vote with your wallet

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:49.019
I think this is why I've become like the

00:21:46.409 --> 00:21:51.299
way that a ham because like I should

00:21:49.019 --> 00:21:54.419
vote with my wallet out of principle I'm

00:21:51.299 --> 00:21:57.840
like I don't like the fact that this is

00:21:54.419 --> 00:22:01.169
expensive but it's convenient enough

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:03.239
that the convenience factor outweighs my

00:22:01.169 --> 00:22:04.799
anger and as a result I've chosen that

00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:07.230
this isn't the fight I want to fight

00:22:04.799 --> 00:22:09.629
right now I will continue to pay too

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:11.249
much money for HBO and I will just

00:22:09.629 --> 00:22:13.830
cancel the service when Curb Your

00:22:11.249 --> 00:22:16.190
Enthusiasm is 11 season finishes I

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:19.440
walked on the spikes okay we got to be

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:22.789
actually cautious mostly because as

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:24.929
usual kind of a dumb man here in the

00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:27.690
created a situation in which we could

00:22:24.929 --> 00:22:31.769
actually die and snatch defeat from the

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:33.419
jaws of victory let me out I mean

00:22:31.769 --> 00:22:35.700
especially the 10 damage we don't really

00:22:33.419 --> 00:22:39.749
need to use sack dagger it's very

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:42.720
tempting to do so though I can't tonight

00:22:39.749 --> 00:22:48.359
since like HBO is like the pre Netflix

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:52.590
you know 15 years ago almost nobody on

00:22:48.359 --> 00:22:54.389
TV was making good TV except for HBO I'm

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:57.210
not saying that like if anybody should

00:22:54.389 --> 00:22:59.460
be playing the what if game about

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:01.289
Netflix is definitely blockbuster you

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:03.210
know they have the opportunity to buy

00:23:01.289 --> 00:23:05.730
them for 12 cents on the dollar and then

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:07.649
they said hahaha your service is stupid

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:09.419
you should feel bad and now you know

00:23:07.649 --> 00:23:10.950
there's like 10 Netflix left there's

00:23:09.419 --> 00:23:13.259
alright 10 blockbusters left in North

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:14.999
America but you know HBO really was like

00:23:13.259 --> 00:23:18.450
the proto Netflix but they're kind of

00:23:14.999 --> 00:23:20.340
just behind the times here now again

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:23.999
this is always the pressure for me is

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:25.710
when I've played badly it looks like I'm

00:23:23.999 --> 00:23:27.809
throwing to get out of here quickly

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:29.929
that's not the case I would much rather

00:23:27.809 --> 00:23:32.729
finish this run

00:23:29.929 --> 00:23:38.539
successfully blank card world that's not

00:23:32.729 --> 00:23:44.729
that bad we can use that appropriately

00:23:38.539 --> 00:23:46.169
just try not to die like an idiot I'm a

00:23:44.729 --> 00:23:47.729
little worried about what this guy's

00:23:46.169 --> 00:23:54.029
going to get up to when he starts to

00:23:47.729 --> 00:23:57.359
fire again you should be we should be

00:23:54.029 --> 00:24:01.169
okay I don't know true this is going to

00:23:57.359 --> 00:24:03.119
be close we got a we got a speed upgrade

00:24:01.169 --> 00:24:07.529
I don't know if we want a speed upgrade

00:24:03.119 --> 00:24:08.700
with 1.9 speed and 1 hp and at least we

00:24:07.529 --> 00:24:10.019
can see where we're going again

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:16.049
you got to open that when you get the

00:24:10.019 --> 00:24:18.299
chance but we have basically in fact

00:24:16.049 --> 00:24:22.289
even at this present moment well I was

00:24:18.299 --> 00:24:24.929
about to say that we've thrown away our

00:24:22.289 --> 00:24:27.269
best chance I'm continuing to kind of

00:24:24.929 --> 00:24:30.210
throw away our best chance by still

00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:33.299
using sac dagger for effectively no

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:34.739
reason well there's a reason it's just a

00:24:33.299 --> 00:24:36.599
bad reason let's not completely

00:24:34.739 --> 00:24:39.840
misrepresent it it does do a lot of

00:24:36.599 --> 00:24:41.429
damage however there's no need to worry

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:44.700
about dealing a lot of damage in this

00:24:41.429 --> 00:24:44.970
situation because we're already crushing

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.249
it

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:51.059
we do have blank card gear up blank RDR

00:24:47.249 --> 00:24:53.039
a classic combo basically because this

00:24:51.059 --> 00:24:56.029
one only goes to Mom's foot we win if

00:24:53.039 --> 00:24:56.029
the spirit heart Falls

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.710
so I mean even if we can just get into

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:05.710
the shop which is one room away

00:25:06.159 --> 00:25:12.909
unfortunately have to do a big room to

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:12.909
get to it so this is like a little scary

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:21.770
just don't step on the creep think we're

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:26.169
going to pull this out come on spirit

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:26.169
arts to the shop is like a classic combo

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:31.909
you're not greed but you're also not

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:33.740
spirit on so instead we blank card Yara

00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:39.799
will get a copy of every consumable

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:41.240
Emperor temperance and parents well if

00:25:39.799 --> 00:25:44.360
we only have one floor left we should go

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:46.179
Emperor Yara at this point we could blow

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:51.890
up a temperance card except that we can

00:25:46.179 --> 00:25:54.980
because we don't have any dang bombs now

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:59.530
we can no we can we can't get over there

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:59.530
are you crazy I just walked over here

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:20.920
I'm begging if we want to all do that

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:24.330
huge we not AdBlue map like where's my

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:27.510
second secret room we could go back

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:31.960
possibly should go back for stone chests

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:33.700
in the boss trap room or mob trap room

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:36.190
but I find myself slightly perturbed

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:39.160
about this overall situation to be

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:43.120
honest with you so I'm just oh I saw it

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:47.530
coming but I dare not move in case I

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:49.000
moved myself into into danger watch out

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:56.230
because those spawn bombs you're just

00:26:49.000 --> 00:27:00.280
going down you're dusting dude fool card

00:26:56.230 --> 00:27:02.230
death card log okay hello this might be

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:03.940
a little close you're an emperor fool

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:08.200
fools not relevant Yara

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:10.620
Emperor brownie it's the hardest boss I

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:13.210
actually think we'll probably die here

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:19.210
champion brownie might buy me the

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:22.360
slightest bit of safety dude we've done

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:24.310
it I I hate it because you should be mad

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:26.530
at me for this because this is like the

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:28.900
worst I've ever played and yet still

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:31.510
been rewarded but I mean what can you do

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:34.270
except like blank card Yara and then

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:36.400
Yara that and now all of a sudden you

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:38.800
pick up these four you come down to the

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:40.990
next floor you look at what's around you

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:42.640
but I mean it's kind of just all for

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:46.060
naught because we're popping this bad

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:48.430
boy and then we're just walking into

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:50.290
victory basically you know the problem

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:52.960
supposedly with Arsenal is that they

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:57.160
always try to walk it in that's the

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:58.540
benefit of this run and look we might

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:02.470
have gotten a little lucky at the end

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:04.420
but the spirit of winning was still

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:08.470
there that's another two challenges down

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:10.210
this one unlocks superfan SMB superfan

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:11.710
is a decent item so I'm okay with that

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:12.760
