00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.230
everybody welcome back to the land

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:09.330
please bunny once again truth plus we're

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:11.070
we just had a great run as Lazarus you

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.009
know what we just got the razor on Eve

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.360
let's try to leave is like well I don't

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.010
want to say almost done

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.000
what is that far-right thing on the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.990
post-it anyway it must be delirium yeah

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.820
because I've only got it done with a

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:30.510
couple of people when I don't know I am

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.790
an idiot I am a moron man last episode I

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.380
looked at Lazarus post-it note and I

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.660
said oh we've already done the hush

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.350
fight no we haven't we did boss rush

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:45.120
boss rushes the star then the the tear

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:48.570
drop emoji is delirium and the far right

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.629
is hush no the far right is delirium and

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.320
the bottom right is hush anyway we're

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:59.579
gonna play as Eve we have to do the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:04.830
entire negative side so Sheol into the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:07.979
dark room and or the void k98 bs s70

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.869
excuse me excuse me even supposed to

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.750
start with a razor blade now excuse it

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.000
can you hear me I want to call it off

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.580
Eve was a but that's the whole reason

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.020
I'm doing the Eve run here is that my

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.400
girl was supposed to start with the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.840
razor blade I thought we unlocked that

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.490
doing greed or something I can't

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.259
remember how we don't know look it

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.329
doesn't matter too much in the whole

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.030
scheme of things you will survive here

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.250
and it's all we go Jesus I mean that you

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.780
don't need a razor blade if you just you

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.520
know take damage against the champion

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.020
right off the bat so the easiest way to

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.729
enable the transformation here monstros

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.259
long if you have the stats screen up and

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.880
you pick up monstros long for the first

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.880
time you probably are like this is a

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.189
total ripoff in actuality it's like one

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.020
of the most fun items in my opinion that

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.960
the game has to offer and you know

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.630
magnifies any tear effects that you can

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:04.250
associate with it the thing is like we

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:08.039
probably actually want to get that HP

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.890
but I am a slave for you I can't deny it

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.349
I ain't trying to hide it and buy for

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.900
you in this case I specifically mean

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.540
for high-damage so I really don't want

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.040
to get rid of poor Babylon unless we get

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.120
something out of it and we did get

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.999
something out of it in the form of the

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.629
halo basically we got more HP which is

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:30.719
useful you know an early HP upgrade to

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:34.079
grab some deal with the devil fuel is is

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:36.599
positive have we done mega Satan is Eve

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:40.079
I thought we had almost you know

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:44.459
exhausted is posted so I imagine we

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:46.079
probably have yeah we have so we don't

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.079
we can take a deal with the devil pretty

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:53.010
much guilt free without worrying about

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:55.019
how it's uh excuse me sir

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.699
without worrying about how it affects

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.239
our our prospects here we're pretty much

00:02:56.699 --> 00:03:03.209
rolling monstros long doesn't win the

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:08.609
game by itself but it unveils a lot of

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:10.290
synergies that I think could be positive

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.980
for us here I got a sneeze and a half I

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:17.729
can feel it just behind like the

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.949
something in my nasal Farrell for Ringel

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:21.449
look I'm not a doctor I really thought

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.370
we could sneeze there you know use a

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:24.659
little once you get inside of the human

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.819
skull as far as I'm concerned for me

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.790
it's just like I don't even I don't know

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:33.590
what's what there's just goo two

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.590
eyeballs and a brain in there somewhere

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:42.580
get the finger which is a pretty

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:46.990
positive item for us to grab here the

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:49.630
finger little like do I know cuz I never

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.830
use it properly that it's actually

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:55.480
basically a form of piercing shot and

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.480
and also spectral tears like it goes

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.070
over rocks it goes through enemies like

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.240
these these stone men here from high

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.800
Valyria we got nothing to worry about as

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.750
long as we can use that appropriately I

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.000
kind of want to try for a little secret

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.160
room action we got it which means that

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.510
we are gonna gain access Wow first off

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.540
took quite a lot of money and secondly

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.000
quite a lot of money secondly to this

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.940
cursed room in here that's given me

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.150
spirit heart I want to be careful but

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.980
the truth here like what I do it like

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.220
this now that we have a spirit heart

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.440
let's take advantage of this get Whore

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.750
of Babylon working for us we didn't

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:42.580
enter you're right we didn't enter that

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:44.230
way I can't recall the finger scales

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.300
with damage but I believe that it does

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.700
you know what would be like is this even

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.770
in our version of the game yet like we

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:55.420
might not have unlocked it if we can get

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:59.500
I of Belial it's the eye of Belial it's

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:06.310
poison in one bite please look out I am

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:11.850
an excellent fighter BFFs not bad but

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:17.800
yeah whoa Barrett can know if we can get

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:21.190
oh my god hi guys that's not a great one

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.680
if we can get aya Belial to get piercing

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.680
shots with monstros lung we're like

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.470
already extraordinarily rolling what's

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.780
the point of chaos card don't hate me

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.970
for this but I think on an average run

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:37.380
chaos might be like one of the most

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:43.240
overrated cards it's also simultaneously

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:45.070
very good though it kind of runs into

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.990
the credit card problem is all I'm gonna

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.690
suggest

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.960
and the credit-card problem is is merely

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.550
that so we've worked our last remaining

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.590
pillages verb so if we get a good pill

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.240
you can double up lock up is not that

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.680
bad

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.320
and we got two verbs so we might as well

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.300
verb a lock up and then let's burp

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.090
another luck up and then we'll try our

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:08.100
luck with this last pill yeah yeah that

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.470
was a smart call so we got up to three

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.840
luck as a result of that um it's a great

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.790
card but it suffers from being too good

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.620
to use now if you're gonna fight mega

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.890
Satan and you get this card you're like

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.950
the luckiest person on earth but if

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.630
you're just holding on to it and

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:27.680
wondering when to use it it does have an

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:31.530
opportunity cost like it takes up a slot

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:33.360
the whole time that you're holding it so

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.240
yeah I would love to you know go to the

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.100
hush fight and crush the second phase of

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.710
hush with this chaos card and I'll

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.780
probably plan on doing so it is probably

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:47.010
worth saving until that point but for

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:50.430
now who knows dude it's like if imagine

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.330
if in real life you had the ability and

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.880
I think this would be terrible

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:56.010
legislation I would forego like all of

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.620
my political principles to vote for

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:01.560
whatever party oppose this legislation

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:04.640
but imagine if you had like one crime

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:08.430
you could just do one crime any crime

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:10.200
and you would you know one of them would

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.970
get you'd get off automatically you can

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.590
use your get-out-of-jail-free card by

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.970
the way if you're saying why wouldn't I

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.680
just do a murder you're a terrible

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.780
person

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.610
if the law is the only thing stopping

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.590
you from murdering people you need to

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:24.420
take a deep look inside yourself and

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.770
examine things well I want to get the

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.150
most value out of my

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:30.540
get-out-of-jail-free card

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:33.480
no that's you know robbing a bank maybe

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:36.630
oh no did I ruin I did ruin Whore of

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.340
Babylon murdering somebody and stuff

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:41.130
what I hear you know your money is

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.480
federally insured etc etc either way I'm

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.890
not saying you're not a terrible person

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.240
by the way if you're like wall just

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:47.160
robbed a bank I'm just saying

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:51.330
more so than murder that would should be

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:53.610
like your first pick I think okay let's

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.830
use a bomb

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:58.289
well anyway the whole point of that like

00:07:55.830 --> 00:08:00.840
part of the conversation was the idea

00:07:58.289 --> 00:08:03.810
that you might think that that would

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:05.039
make you more likely to do the crime and

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.300
I think that there's something to be

00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:08.479
said about that but I think you'd also

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:11.189
like at least I would go through life

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:12.689
probably die at the age of 80 still

00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:14.340
being like I don't know if it's worth

00:08:12.689 --> 00:08:21.389
use like the get-out-of-jail-free card

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:23.219
yet no it's like like chaos if I'm being

00:08:21.389 --> 00:08:26.219
honest with you and this is not even

00:08:23.219 --> 00:08:28.199
messing 0% which is a double negative so

00:08:26.219 --> 00:08:30.960
I'm messing with you literally zero

00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:32.729
percent right now it's probably the

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.200
smart money to use the chaos card on

00:08:32.729 --> 00:08:35.909
this guy right here just to make sure we

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.890
get some use out of it cuz let me let me

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:41.669
paint a picture for you what if we end

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:43.289
up getting a year of room before we

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:45.660
fight hush assuming we can even make it

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:48.980
to the hush fight here what do we take

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:54.209
with us the era room to the chaos card

00:08:48.980 --> 00:09:02.010
nobody knows so we're still not at war

00:08:54.209 --> 00:09:04.410
babylon enabling here i wonder if if the

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:06.990
google deepmind algorithm to can scan

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:08.910
for the word whore in which case i've

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:11.550
really got to start calling it like lady

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:13.589
of babylon which might seem like it's

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:16.350
being deeply misogynistic on my part I'm

00:09:13.589 --> 00:09:18.420
just trying to find a name that you know

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:21.839
is indicative of what the item does I'm

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:24.810
not suggesting of course not I don't

00:09:21.839 --> 00:09:26.250
hold that troubling attitude what we're

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.760
gonna do here is look for an item room

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:31.980
and change the topic of conversation a

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:35.120
shot speed is like infinity per second

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:37.519
here it's actually pretty good with the

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:40.500
monstros long to be honest with you

00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:42.120
finger I don't know if the damage from

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.589
finger this is why we need spider bot

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.500
but I don't know if the damage from

00:09:43.589 --> 00:09:49.019
finger is doubled as a result of BFF at

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.760
range I'm assuming if the finger

00:09:49.019 --> 00:09:53.070
collides with an enemy if it even does

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:56.540
melee damage which maybe it just does

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:56.540
the range damage up close

00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:04.620
then it might get the benefit of it but

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:06.660
I'm not certain you might think that

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:09.990
this run is not looking that hot right

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:11.370
now that was pretty dumb of me I I very

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.990
much disagree to be honestly I think

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.640
this run is fantastic I think we just

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:18.840
happened upon a room that is like the

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:21.930
worst possible candidate for our present

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:23.310
skill set so still got an item room on

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:25.260
this floor not sweating it too much I'm

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:29.070
still on a little bit of an Isaac hi

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:31.290
from the from the last run as well that

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:34.340
Lazarus run was like actually of 10 out

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:36.360
of 10 please please sir please thank you

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.180
and we've got unlimited bombs that

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:41.580
would've been helpful a moment ago but

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:45.570
life goes on anyway

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:48.090
we're holding it together here I know

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:50.040
there's that fairly famous Patton Oswalt

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:51.600
bit about you know when you turn like a

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.540
certain age you should be able to you

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.040
know get away with crimes it's a funny

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.170
joke but I disagree with it

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.210
what are we they ever taken curse of the

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:03.180
tower I bet we have because I know

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:07.580
myself we need to hook God I tried to

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:07.580
use black powder we need to take it but

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:13.170
the gist of that joke you know it starts

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.910
out with the idea that birthdays are I'm

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.800
not gonna tell the joke over again

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.720
because it's like you ever try to

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.370
explain a stand-up bit that's funny to

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.920
somebody and then he goes like blah blah

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:25.500
blah you gonna be there too but you know

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:27.930
the gist of that bit is that you know

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:30.540
your birthday's stop mattering or stop

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:33.390
being worth celebrating when you're over

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:36.540
the age in like 21 after that it's like

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:38.490
every every 10 years you get a birthday

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:40.560
I agree with that I disagree with the

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:42.300
idea and I think so does he that when

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:45.030
you reach a certain age you should be

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:47.640
able to legally commit murder but you

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:51.500
know that's a comedian it's gonna be

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.500
telling jokes probably is the idea

00:11:55.830 --> 00:12:01.110
he's my expectation at least I wouldn't

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:03.760
know cuz I've never laughed in my life

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:07.840
so we're at full red hearts that stinks

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:09.760
but what's great is that if we start to

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.610
lose HP we can now use like horror

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.050
Babylon to be an indicator of how much

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.910
HP we have although we're done with this

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:18.280
before regardless so figured we just try

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:22.240
to maximize our potential here check

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:25.420
this out we got a semi useful space bar

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:28.210
item it's only semi useful right now but

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:35.710
it's okay we'll take a quick peek for

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:39.550
pills or magic mushy and actually with

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:43.600
unlimited bombs here hear me out here

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:47.010
blow myself up did not activate Whore of

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:51.940
Babylon not a big fan

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:53.920
grab this use it power pill no no I

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:56.290
actually don't want that please don't

00:12:53.920 --> 00:13:00.850
kill me here I bought a pill by accident

00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:05.260
that was so oh I'm a moron I wanted to

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:07.740
buy a spirit heart this won't kill me no

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.740
whore Babylon

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:16.750
now we have Whore of Babylon so we're

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:18.730
like low on HP we bought a spear at

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.560
heart actually think I would love to buy

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:22.389
two spirit hearts at the cost of maybe

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.709
no arcade on the next floor we didn't

00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:26.350
get a second spirit art we did get a

00:13:23.709 --> 00:13:27.910
health upgrade pill kind of the opposite

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:29.889
of what we want that might seem like a

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:31.240
terrible idea it may be a terrible idea

00:13:29.889 --> 00:13:33.279
but what it is done is given us the

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:35.670
damage necessary with a little bit of

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:40.410
protection on top of it to hopefully

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:40.410
take advantage of our relatively good

00:13:40.529 --> 00:13:45.250
damage and then other steps here to not

00:13:43.629 --> 00:13:50.620
take more damage in the future it's the

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:53.110
idea at least we also picked up mom's

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.699
bottle of pills at half price which that

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:58.360
that's a half price item as far as I'm

00:13:54.699 --> 00:13:59.649
concerned I'm pretty stoked because we

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.959
know there's a health upgrade in our

00:13:59.649 --> 00:14:03.939
rotation which is good even if we don't

00:14:01.959 --> 00:14:06.610
want to use it as HP we can always use

00:14:03.939 --> 00:14:11.290
it as a deal with the devil fuel as I

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:12.879
say but then beyond that I only picked

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:15.790
it up because I knew there was a lock up

00:14:12.879 --> 00:14:18.069
in the rotation so I figured that that's

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.519
enough to sway me if we know about two

00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:19.930
pills

00:14:18.519 --> 00:14:22.089
one of them's neutral and one of them's

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:23.680
good sure if we got no better space bar

00:14:22.089 --> 00:14:26.019
item it's a lot of conditions on this

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:28.120
but give me give me give me mom's bottle

00:14:26.019 --> 00:14:29.860
of pills and I'm a happy camper buy

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:35.110
another spirit heart keep ourselves safe

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:38.769
here PhD is kind of bad but I'll accept

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:40.480
the cost I mean it's great but it's bad

00:14:38.769 --> 00:14:42.370
for you as Eve but I'll accept the cost

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:45.819
here because in the future it could be

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:49.120
worth a lot right now it's it's a pretty

00:14:45.819 --> 00:14:50.470
big negative honestly but with mom's

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.180
bottle of pills you got to go for the

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:54.430
long-term synergy and you know the more

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:56.069
Isaac I play the more I'm like Eve is a

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:58.630
fun character because of that trade-off

00:14:56.069 --> 00:15:02.050
often times you know the way ed

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:03.399
described it is so good he liked and

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:06.029
this was like three years ago or

00:15:03.399 --> 00:15:08.500
something but he likes playing as Eve

00:15:06.029 --> 00:15:10.600
because the trade-off of like should you

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.519
trade HP for damage is interesting I

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:14.769
agree that's interesting but it's also

00:15:12.519 --> 00:15:15.070
oh my god stop relying on the finger is

00:15:14.769 --> 00:15:17.410
it

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:18.700
orbital it's also kind of old hat at

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:21.670
this point you know we've been down that

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:23.590
road more times than we care to admit

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:26.830
what's way more interesting is the idea

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:28.420
of these situations at least to me it's

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:30.310
more interesting the idea of these

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:34.030
situations that are like should I trade

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:35.920
away my existing worth for more

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:37.120
potential in the future that's kind of a

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.070
cool trade for me because at some point

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:41.950
you got to say you know what know this

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:44.280
good item is bad for me because it makes

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:46.810
me worse now even if it makes me

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:48.520
potentially a little better later or you

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:52.630
just ride that train like the whole way

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:55.740
but gonna have consequences as well this

00:15:52.630 --> 00:16:02.740
would be a great time to beat the odds

00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:04.930
get a deal with the devil no such luck

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:06.760
might as well take the HP still on pace

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:08.530
for boss rush chaos doesn't do anything

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:13.510
for boss rush it's not like a big

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:13.900
positive there got a try first things

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:18.130
first

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:19.720
1.53 speed go through that yeah okay in

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:25.120
the end this is like very worth that I

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:26.680
think for the spirit heart alone which I

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:31.930
will pick up dust Lea okay good good

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:34.180
good yeah this is it's a little bit of a

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:36.490
rude awakening after the Lazarus run the

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:38.020
Lazarus run is like the worst kind of

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.820
run not that I'm complaining it's the

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.140
worst kind of run to have to start your

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:43.030
recording day if you're planning on

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.380
recording like 8 Isak episodes because

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.150
it just gives you the keys to the

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:48.310
kingdom right off the bat you get like

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:49.960
isaac affluenza you know when you when

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:52.240
you start a run that strong you never

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:55.560
learn what it's like to be down in the

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:59.140
trenches you know fighting for damage

00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:01.000
now you may argue after 2300 hours and

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.740
steam of playing The Binding of Isaac

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.990
rebirth and then you know probably like

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:06.939
a thousand plus of the original version

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:08.800
of the game we should probably have

00:17:06.939 --> 00:17:11.730
internalized that lesson and to that I

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:15.310
say who are you like you know my

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:17.550
headmaster I never went to a school with

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:17.550
a headmaster

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:28.140
I went to the schools I went to barely

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:30.210
at a principal dude and when we went

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:32.279
there we didn't have any principals it

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:35.100
was both ways now I didn't walk there

00:17:32.279 --> 00:17:37.890
both ways in the snow I took a bus but I

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:44.309
had to wake up pretty early to get on

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:45.419
the bus that's a terrible place to stand

00:17:44.309 --> 00:17:48.870
there goes our deal with the devil

00:17:45.419 --> 00:17:50.520
chants the curses of the unknown I'm not

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:52.950
gonna say that there what's what's

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:57.149
beating me up the most here but come on

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:58.799
man I'd like to be able to see how much

00:17:57.149 --> 00:18:02.730
HP I have I think that's a universal

00:17:58.799 --> 00:18:04.260
right the universal right of Isaac you

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:06.240
have everybody has the right to one

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.850
damage upgrade before the caves part two

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:10.620
is over everybody has the right to see

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:12.990
how much HP they have everybody is the

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:14.880
right to have either a curse of the maze

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:16.440
or a curse of the loss but not both with

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:22.789
the one exception being the ultra hard

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:22.789
challenge how are you not deceased

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.169
very very good I'm actually gonna take

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:31.419
this opportunity because I think boss

00:18:29.169 --> 00:18:33.340
rush is basically an unrealistic pipe

00:18:31.419 --> 00:18:36.700
dream right now it take this opportunity

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:38.710
to head back and go to the curse room

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.460
and sack a spirit heart for the for the

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:42.159
right to do so

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:43.690
ah this is good so we know we have one

00:18:42.159 --> 00:18:47.499
and a half spirit hearts at least I

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:52.600
think it most actually as well but let

00:18:47.499 --> 00:18:54.429
us I should have taken wishbone a couple

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.379
floors ago let us get down to the Whore

00:18:54.429 --> 00:18:57.850
of Babylon state here there we go so we

00:18:56.379 --> 00:18:59.169
have wonderful heart left right now we

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:00.129
couldn't even play it a little bit more

00:18:59.169 --> 00:19:01.539
if we wanted to but I don't think

00:19:00.129 --> 00:19:04.809
that'll be necessary we'll take roid

00:19:01.539 --> 00:19:06.850
rage and we now have one spirit heart

00:19:04.809 --> 00:19:09.570
remaining with one red heart to back it

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:13.029
up so we should be cautious but

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:14.679
simultaneously simultaneously like

00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:18.369
pretty happy about the way that this is

00:19:14.679 --> 00:19:26.320
going almost dodge rating it to speed is

00:19:18.369 --> 00:19:30.990
a it's a liability sometimes probably

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.990
the best bad gas pill I've ever used

00:19:31.259 --> 00:19:40.570
no all right there goes Whore of Babylon

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:47.169
but technology 0 plus monster has lung

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:50.710
now you speak in my language would be

00:19:47.169 --> 00:19:52.419
better if not all of our shots you know

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:53.919
hit his skull and then dissipate it but

00:19:52.419 --> 00:19:57.340
maybe I should stop aiming at the skull

00:19:53.919 --> 00:19:59.289
if I'm gonna complain about it now if we

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:02.950
can get I mean again Belial tears I like

00:19:59.289 --> 00:20:05.950
tena attend but if we could get any form

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:09.809
of piercing shot your boy would be an

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:12.460
extremely happy camper worth it okay

00:20:09.809 --> 00:20:15.690
bounce out of this room we need to see

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.690
now is the shop

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:21.270
and ideally like if we could stop

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:23.400
walking into enemies that'd be good

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:25.650
mom's toenail is a zero out of ten

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.600
trinket masquerading as like a 9 and a

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:28.980
10 trinket don't believe its lies here's

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:32.490
all you need to know its dang geez

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:33.870
Ling's favorite trinket when was the

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:39.150
last time you watched and easily play

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:41.309
The Binding of Isaac rebirth 1991 dudes

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:44.100
fully invested on pub G right now not

00:20:41.309 --> 00:20:47.700
there's anything wrong with that play it

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:51.230
a lot myself it's a great game what do

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:53.970
you think about the micro did you look I

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:56.669
can understand being cynical about a lot

00:20:53.970 --> 00:21:00.330
of games and I can understand being

00:20:56.669 --> 00:21:01.740
cynical about pub G I really can even

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:04.679
though you're likely to saying that no

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:06.270
I'm I'm being I'm being honest with you

00:21:04.679 --> 00:21:07.440
I'm actually gonna use the Sun card here

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.240
oh dude this is perfect

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.799
do we still want to use the Sun card

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.720
though I mean we could use it to get

00:21:10.799 --> 00:21:14.460
full HP and then come back and play this

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:18.660
dude that took a red heart even though

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:22.110
it might not look like it but pub G is

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:24.600
also really fun and whenever people are

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:26.160
like but what does it mean for the

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:29.419
industry I'm like what are you in the

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:32.309
industry for dude I'm in the industry

00:21:29.419 --> 00:21:36.000
I'm worried about the trend of like loot

00:21:32.309 --> 00:21:37.620
boxes as uh as gambling that's why we

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.850
rag on them in the series all the time

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:41.130
for saying they're never gonna have loot

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:43.020
boxes and then all of a sudden they have

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:44.370
loot boxes and they say like well we're

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:46.290
trying to fund the prize pool for our

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:47.790
tournament my dog you sold like 11

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:49.770
million copies of your game you can't

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:51.960
fund a prize pool for your tournament

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:54.120
and now let's ignorant a business I

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:58.169
don't think it is I think it's like the

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:59.760
International you know although the

00:21:58.169 --> 00:22:01.860
International for some reason I'm like

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.120
cool with them funding it maybe because

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.840
you get the experience but anyway I

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.970
digress

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.049
but in the end pub G is such a fun game

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:09.299
to play with friends that when people

00:22:07.049 --> 00:22:10.620
are cynical about it I'm like dude what

00:22:09.299 --> 00:22:13.890
do you want out of this where you want

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:17.520
it to be like a you know visitor base

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:20.070
puzzle-platformer instead it's crushing

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:22.500
it it gives me it reminds me of being 16

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:24.510
and like coming home with my friends

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:26.520
well not with my friends I lived in the

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:28.020
suburbs but I'm coming home and talking

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.350
to my friends being like loves play some

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.350
halo too

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:37.370
it distills the the experience of the

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:40.220
video gaming industry is an art no it's

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:43.410
it's actually like the opposite of art

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:46.920
I'm trying to think of like a good movie

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:49.800
comparison because it is it is not like

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:51.960
a Darren Aronofsky film it's like a

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:58.130
really really well-made fast and the

00:22:51.960 --> 00:23:00.570
furious just because you know it's not

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:01.830
intended to be high-minded art and I'm

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:03.480
the most pretentious person on the

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:04.740
analyzed that's probably so for me to

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:07.920
say this I think means something

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:11.880
hopefully it's cuz it's not high art

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:13.770
doesn't mean it's you know not a

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:15.510
worthwhile endeavor sometimes you have

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:17.250
to be very smart to make stupid things

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:21.120
and sometimes stupid things are

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:22.590
extremely enjoyable so I think that was

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.970
the right math on this we got quite a

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:26.940
lot of money we're not gonna make boss

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:33.480
Russian that's okay let's keep moving

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:37.620
here and attempting I know it's bad gas

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:39.330
perks I'm potentially but not quite good

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.950
enough by the way don't think it's like

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.510
only them and that allowed to like pub

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:44.340
do if you don't like pub G that's fine

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:46.350
but if any of the time

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:48.510
it sounds like I'm specifically like

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:50.970
some talking Nick here that's not my

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:52.740
intention there are dozens of you out

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:54.180
there but if any time it gets mentioned

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:56.880
you're like why do people like this

00:23:54.180 --> 00:24:00.480
games fun dog not everything's like an

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:02.280
international conspiracy to to dislike

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:04.290
or they'd like to like something that

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:06.780
you don't like specifically to single

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:08.520
you out and I want to go a little bit

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:10.860
further I think we're living

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:13.800
particularly right now in an era where

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:17.310
to be aloof is is seen as a positive

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:18.660
thing and I disagree with this the

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:20.250
reason people like it is because it's

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:23.070
fun and just because you don't like

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:25.700
something you you can never be above

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:28.170
someone on an intellectual level

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:30.000
specifically by not liking a piece of

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:33.600
media and I want to make that clear the

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.880
one exception is transformers if you

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.950
don't like the Transformers movies you

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:40.140
do have you got like one extra point and

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:41.550
intellect versus people who like them

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:42.400
but they could beat you they might also

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:43.900
have their masters and

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:46.120
Chemical Engineering and that's like 40

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.950
points okay so like just it's one point

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.240
it's two point five percent as much as

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:52.860
having a degree in chemical engineering

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:55.390
by the in the NL scale at least but I

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:57.010
hate to see cuz I was part of the

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:59.950
generation that did this you know ten

00:24:57.010 --> 00:25:02.680
years ago I hate to see people judging

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:05.470
other people or building themselves up

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:06.430
by specifically cultivating an identity

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:09.790
of what they don't like

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:11.410
it's the lamest as a teenager it's

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:13.150
actually no problem and I don't say that

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:15.070
to demean the teenagers watching this

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:16.750
but you know you're you've got a you got

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:18.970
a case you're figuring out your identity

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:22.180
if your identity is like I'm the guy who

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:25.660
doesn't like Radiohead go for it dude

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:27.970
you'll you'll work it out I mean I okay

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:29.170
computer is an all-time classic and you

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:31.330
know your mileage may vary with respect

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:33.820
to kid a and amnesiac etc etc but I

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:36.130
disagree with you but I agree with your

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:39.430
right to say it as an adult is the

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:40.570
lamest thing ever if 99% of the time

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:42.400
you're talking about something you're

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:45.010
going I don't like this people are gonna

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:48.280
start to wonder like you know it's it's

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:50.710
way easier to be the dude who may says--

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:52.720
than to be the dude who yeas Sates and

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:54.460
I've been saying this for years but if

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:56.320
you're the dude who always nay says--

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:58.420
and I think it's applies to YouTube as

00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:00.280
well in a big way and it's a guiding

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:03.820
philosophy for like the let's look at

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:06.460
series much much to my commercial

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:09.190
detriment by the way but if you're the

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:13.170
guy who always nay says people are like

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:16.270
he's being honest cuz there's no reason

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:18.850
for him to lie about how bad something

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:20.560
is there's always a reason to lie about

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:23.260
how good something is people are way

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:25.300
more cynical if you're positive if you

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:26.950
give a great game an 8 out of 10 people

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:31.720
will be like how much did the publisher

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:33.070
pay you you give a great game like a 5

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:36.310
out of 10 people are like he's a

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:38.740
discerning customer well maybe maybe not

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:41.710
there's also I think there's a case to

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:44.500
be made for the idea that you know being

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:46.630
negative is commercially a positive

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:48.670
thing for a lot of people even if it can

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:50.230
sometimes become a little dishonest I'm

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:54.160
not singling out anybody in particular

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:55.210
here nor would I go over the top as

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:58.510
suggestions and people

00:26:55.210 --> 00:27:00.400
or frequently negative are necessarily

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:04.990
not giving you their honest opinion I'm

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:06.940
just saying to be a naysayer as a and

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:08.440
everybody's got honest criticisms of

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:10.210
something I'm very much Switzerland

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:12.490
myself here which is a cool thing I

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:15.490
think being quite neutral in the

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:17.380
situation but if you're always a

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:22.720
naysayer if you're like that thing that

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:26.320
people like I don't like it for me I'm

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:27.670
like that's wicked lame you don't have

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:30.760
to like everything that other people

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:34.990
like but you know you start to notice a

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:37.330
trend I think of cultivating an image

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:39.700
being above things that the masses like

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:43.150
you know some things the masses like a

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:44.830
kind of garbage I'll level with you a

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:46.330
million percent on that by the way Nine

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:48.490
Lives big pickup and now what are you

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:50.830
talking about talk about Isaac no is

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:52.330
episode 8 million in this series I'm

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:57.100
getting on a soapbox and destroying

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:58.750
everything I've worked for I still have

00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:00.400
this chaos card which is very stunning

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:05.140
to me by the way I think we might be

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:07.090
able to make the hush fight and we have

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:11.340
99 cents so it would be a good thing to

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:15.430
do oh thank God for the range upgrade um

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:18.280
like there's some trash music out there

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:21.910
I listen to the radio some of this

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:23.950
garbage I don't think it's objectively

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:26.470
garbage definitely I am the kind of guy

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:28.900
where probably if I Melissa a top 40

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:30.880
radio like 80% of what comes on I'm like

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:33.250
I'm not a big fan I don't go on Twitter

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.810
and go how can the idiots blah blah blah

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:36.640
why doesn't everybody listen to spider

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:40.000
land by Slynt that's uh blah blah you

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:41.320
know but still I think everybody's got

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.890
like an industry that they're kind of

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:46.210
like that with but all I'm saying is

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:47.440
that I'm I'm no better than the other

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:49.240
average person that's the key to the

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:51.430
soapbox is you get on the soapbox and

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:53.230
you admonish other people and then at

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:54.970
the end you tie it in you get like all

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:56.950
these free shots in and then at the end

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:58.780
you go oh you can't criticize me because

00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:01.150
I'm aware of the fact that I'm an idiot

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:03.400
that's I see and then this is even meta

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:04.710
because I'm telling you that I'm aware

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:08.840
of the fact that I'm away

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:12.059
it's oh no I've gone cross-eyed again

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:14.039
but I this is and I think I've done this

00:29:12.059 --> 00:29:16.320
tangent at least once before probably

00:29:14.039 --> 00:29:18.570
like two years ago but if you're out

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:20.100
there you might be like a you know 15

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:21.539
year old version of me right now and

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:24.690
you're like oh you're gonna go see a

00:29:21.539 --> 00:29:26.820
mother this weekend it looks alright a

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:29.580
little pedantic but Darren Aronofsky

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:32.970
really peaked with PI his 1998 student

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:34.200
it's fine but eventually people are

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:36.299
gonna stop asking you for your opinion

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:38.100
cuz they already know it in advance how

00:29:36.299 --> 00:29:40.679
do you feel about X I don't like it why

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:43.110
not uh I haven't seen it yet really but

00:29:40.679 --> 00:29:44.629
as it's pitchfork media gave it a you

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:47.909
know you get the idea

00:29:44.629 --> 00:29:53.009
and that's what I try to do with let's

00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:55.740
look at is if stuff is bad I just I'm

00:29:53.009 --> 00:29:57.539
Way less likely to cover it because I

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:59.369
think there's so many games on Steam in

00:29:57.539 --> 00:30:00.899
today's day and age we're definitely

00:29:59.369 --> 00:30:02.159
gonna make the hutch play by the way and

00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:04.169
this is we're not talking about Isaac

00:30:02.159 --> 00:30:05.909
anymore you might think that's dishonest

00:30:04.169 --> 00:30:09.360
stood like scuttle coverage if something

00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:12.210
is not very good but I disagree if I was

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:14.399
i GN and I was like I don't like destiny

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:16.619
- I'm not gonna review it out of respect

00:30:14.399 --> 00:30:19.440
for Bungie I think that would be a bad

00:30:16.619 --> 00:30:22.740
sign but let's look at is not really

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:24.960
meant to be is this game good is this

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:27.749
game bad at least it is present state

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:29.909
it's more like highlighting cool stuff

00:30:27.749 --> 00:30:31.769
that I've played on Steam cuz with 20

00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:34.019
games coming out a day I don't

00:30:31.769 --> 00:30:35.399
necessarily know a really definitely

00:30:34.019 --> 00:30:37.740
gonna fight house yes I don't

00:30:35.399 --> 00:30:40.169
necessarily know if you need to be like

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:41.490
hey here's a game that just came out you

00:30:40.169 --> 00:30:42.779
may or may not have ever heard of it but

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:45.210
it's bad so don't buy it

00:30:42.779 --> 00:30:46.919
you're already probably not gonna buy it

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:48.570
because you may not know that it exists

00:30:46.919 --> 00:30:52.190
now there are exceptions you know we've

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:54.990
if Isaac to came out and it sucked I

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:57.869
would definitely have to be the guy that

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:59.970
would be like I gotta do a video on this

00:30:57.869 --> 00:31:01.799
here's what I don't like about it but if

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:03.539
it's like you know one man and II team

00:31:01.799 --> 00:31:05.580
comes out with the game looks cool is

00:31:03.539 --> 00:31:07.139
not cool but it's also not making any

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:08.730
waves it just kind of feels like

00:31:07.139 --> 00:31:10.590
punching down to be like hey I played

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:12.509
this game and I don't like it

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:14.070
anyway let's donate a bunch of money

00:31:12.509 --> 00:31:16.559
here you may disagree with that by the

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:18.029
way and you may even very much

00:31:16.559 --> 00:31:22.499
vehemently disagree with

00:31:18.029 --> 00:31:24.989
love to know your thoughts on that the

00:31:22.499 --> 00:31:26.190
NL SS is where we oftentimes end up

00:31:24.989 --> 00:31:28.109
playing stuff that's come out that

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:29.429
nobody's heard of that ends up being bad

00:31:28.109 --> 00:31:30.929
and we kind of poke fun at it so I do

00:31:29.429 --> 00:31:33.330
still have an outlet for that it's not

00:31:30.929 --> 00:31:35.159
like I'm just you know scuttling all

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:36.389
coverage that that might be funny cuz I

00:31:35.159 --> 00:31:37.799
know people are gonna be like yo you're

00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:39.359
gonna missing out in the humor value of

00:31:37.799 --> 00:31:42.509
it I do understand where you're coming

00:31:39.359 --> 00:31:45.869
from there but what I would what I would

00:31:42.509 --> 00:31:48.029
pass on to you is that you know being

00:31:45.869 --> 00:31:50.580
kind of like ironically detached from

00:31:48.029 --> 00:31:52.529
stuff and being above everything that

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:57.169
other people like it's so it's a

00:31:52.529 --> 00:32:00.450
shortcut get dusted hush it's a shortcut

00:31:57.169 --> 00:32:02.820
for looking intelligent but as you get

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:06.210
older people are way more interested in

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:08.059
talking to people who who are passionate

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:11.429
you know who are like yeah I work in

00:32:08.059 --> 00:32:12.960
human resources how is it this stinks no

00:32:11.429 --> 00:32:14.489
they don't want that they want they want

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.279
to talk to the dude who's like I work in

00:32:14.489 --> 00:32:18.629
human resources how is it it's super

00:32:17.279 --> 00:32:21.989
cool let me tell you all the cool things

00:32:18.629 --> 00:32:24.059
about my job it's lame to be excited

00:32:21.989 --> 00:32:26.039
about anything get that trash out of

00:32:24.059 --> 00:32:28.739
here and also I drop my controller and

00:32:26.039 --> 00:32:31.200
then I caught it that's that's an

00:32:28.739 --> 00:32:33.690
attitude for like that that works when

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:35.879
you're 15 and there's nothing against it

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:40.589
if it works you smoke a while you got it

00:32:35.879 --> 00:32:42.629
right once you get to college people are

00:32:40.589 --> 00:32:44.099
like house or go you enjoy organic

00:32:42.629 --> 00:32:45.659
chemistry if you're if you're not

00:32:44.099 --> 00:32:48.149
enjoying it be honest but if you are

00:32:45.659 --> 00:32:51.989
enjoying it dude step up oh I love

00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:53.879
trying to figure out what molecules are

00:32:51.989 --> 00:32:59.009
chiral versions of other ones

00:32:53.879 --> 00:33:02.159
okay so faiths I'm giving you life

00:32:59.009 --> 00:33:04.619
advice I I shouldn't be because as I

00:33:02.159 --> 00:33:06.239
always say you shouldn't take life

00:33:04.619 --> 00:33:09.149
advice from a 28 year old that's how you

00:33:06.239 --> 00:33:10.649
get yourself into trouble very few

00:33:09.149 --> 00:33:12.779
people you know on their deaths death

00:33:10.649 --> 00:33:13.440
beds are like I hit peak wisdom at age

00:33:12.779 --> 00:33:15.580
28

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:18.430
but either way

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:22.390
I'm trying it's from a place of love I

00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:27.690
mean necessarily I'm trying to trying to

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:30.370
give you my limited life experience for

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:31.450
that I think I would have wanted to hear

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:32.500
when I was younger although I probably

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:33.930
would have been like I'm not taking

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:36.190
advice from this guy he plays you

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:39.330
through YouTube games on the internet he

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:39.330
doesn't even have a master's degree

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:44.590
which might be good advice and Jeff

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:48.490
maybe I did hit peak wisdom at like 22 I

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:51.580
don't know mm I didn't by the way we are

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:54.970
fighting or we're on track to fight

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:56.410
delirium here and that is a big get

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:58.840
because our speed is already like

00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:59.860
infinity out of 10 um I'm not gonna

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.840
fight that guy cause it could be

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:05.110
delirium so we'll just stay away for now

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:06.220
but I I don't love our odds of going up

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:07.780
against the lyrium here I think our

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:09.100
stats are pretty good but I would like

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:11.110
to point out we're not in the Whore of

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:13.450
Babylon state and our damage is four

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:16.110
points to zero which I I'm trying hard

00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:21.360
to avoid recognizing as the meme number

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:25.420
we can make it we can make it so I don't

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:26.890
really love our odds monstros lung gives

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:29.890
us a little bit more hurting power no

00:34:26.890 --> 00:34:31.540
question and as does Jacob's Ladder but

00:34:29.890 --> 00:34:35.470
Jacob's Ladder is more like wound clear

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:36.880
than single target damage I think and I

00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:39.700
have to say I think cuz the runs a

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:41.410
little weird anyway this is all good if

00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:44.530
you want to be cynical about pub G dude

00:34:41.410 --> 00:34:48.250
I'm cynical about pub G as well I'm also

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:50.020
a bit of a realist I think so I'm like

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:51.850
yeah you know it was a great marketing

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:54.310
move to say you're gonna do early access

00:34:51.850 --> 00:34:56.320
without doing microtransactions until

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:58.810
launch and then like oh wait a minute

00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:02.080
we've sold four million copies we should

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:03.880
probably go back on that I'm not afraid

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:06.460
to tell you because I think is being

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:08.620
honest that if I was the if I was CEO of

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:12.220
Blue Hole I would be like you know I

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:16.990
know we said that but we could also make

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:19.060
like quite a lot of money and against

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:21.640
what I would consider to be common sense

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:24.160
and it's little insulting but a lot of

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:26.500
battlegrounds players are like you know

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:27.369
totally cool with with them games

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:30.880
concrete's that were

00:35:27.369 --> 00:35:32.380
the game semi recently but so so maybe

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.329
you're actually given the consumers what

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.740
they want and I can understand how you

00:35:34.329 --> 00:35:37.960
would be frustrated by that you're like

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:39.700
these these sheep don't even know that

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:44.259
they're destroying the industry but at

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:46.210
the same time mostly I'm I'm pretty live

00:35:44.259 --> 00:35:49.329
and let live sort of guy within reason I

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:51.849
think even when you might be saying well

00:35:49.329 --> 00:35:53.079
NL I hear you every time you go to the

00:35:51.849 --> 00:35:54.849
grocery store you get another anecdote

00:35:53.079 --> 00:35:56.680
about somebody not behaving to your you

00:35:54.849 --> 00:35:58.359
know societal ideal yeah but I don't

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:59.619
think that person should be like I don't

00:35:58.359 --> 00:36:00.789
think they're an actual idiot

00:35:59.619 --> 00:36:05.279
nor do I think they should be like

00:36:00.789 --> 00:36:09.220
penalised by the law or something oh

00:36:05.279 --> 00:36:11.140
those are Seinfeld bits you know don't

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:16.809
take them to their logical extremes

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:21.519
that's my job so the cliff notes of that

00:36:16.809 --> 00:36:24.490
meandering soapbox was you know there's

00:36:21.519 --> 00:36:28.900
like Power Rankings for personalities I

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:32.019
think genuinely enthusiastic number one

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:33.579
a New England Patriots this year every

00:36:32.019 --> 00:36:36.279
year number two

00:36:33.579 --> 00:36:38.609
probably genuinely dismissive number

00:36:36.279 --> 00:36:42.299
three

00:36:38.609 --> 00:36:44.859
artificially dismissive number for

00:36:42.299 --> 00:36:46.480
artificially enthusiastic I think I

00:36:44.859 --> 00:36:51.369
would rather interact with somebody

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:53.319
who's regularly semi intellectually

00:36:51.369 --> 00:36:55.329
dishonest ly negative about things than

00:36:53.319 --> 00:36:57.549
somebody who's like oh yeah chemical

00:36:55.329 --> 00:37:01.049
warfare that's really cool you know

00:36:57.549 --> 00:37:02.920
that's unlike an ethical level

00:37:01.049 --> 00:37:04.569
specifically cuz I know there's probably

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:10.089
cool science involved as terrible as

00:37:04.569 --> 00:37:13.539
that sounds either way that's that's the

00:37:10.089 --> 00:37:17.380
Power Rankings I strive in my life to

00:37:13.539 --> 00:37:20.130
not necessarily be always genuinely

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:23.680
enthusiastic but to not be ashamed like

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:25.089
with when people are like oh you sounds

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.619
like your programming class is pretty

00:37:25.089 --> 00:37:28.089
boring I'm like you know there's parts

00:37:26.619 --> 00:37:30.549
of it I don't like that much but I

00:37:28.089 --> 00:37:33.519
really like the problem-solving aspect

00:37:30.549 --> 00:37:35.529
of programming you know I'm taking a

00:37:33.519 --> 00:37:38.109
JavaScript class is really cool cuz I've

00:37:35.529 --> 00:37:39.170
only ever done object-oriented

00:37:38.109 --> 00:37:42.380
programming language

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:44.059
Jes has object-oriented components like

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:46.400
you can create objects but it's also a

00:37:44.059 --> 00:37:48.680
more dynamically typed language which is

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:51.619
weird for me plus I've never done like

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:53.390
almost any HTML or CSS so I've kind of

00:37:51.619 --> 00:37:55.880
got a long like learning curve ahead of

00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:57.499
me trying to figure out you know how

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:59.509
that stuff is structured plus you know

00:37:57.499 --> 00:38:00.890
the part of front-end dev is trying to

00:37:59.509 --> 00:38:03.170
make things look nice which I have no

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:05.599
skills in so you know it's it's really

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:07.489
fun for me but also a unique challenge

00:38:05.599 --> 00:38:09.980
to try to learn that stuff and there you

00:38:07.489 --> 00:38:12.559
go you've spun your the fact that you

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:14.410
know my first assignment was hey can you

00:38:12.559 --> 00:38:17.150
submit a web page that has a picture of

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:18.470
you know a pet or family member on it

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:23.720
into something that was a little bit

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:25.039
more exciting it's infectious I could've

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:27.200
just been like yeah it kind of stinks

00:38:25.039 --> 00:38:29.200
but I want a job one day that's cool I

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:32.150
want to spend more time with that guy

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:34.130
guy who has no respect for his own time

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:39.859
except he's doing some of his parents

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:41.690
wanted to do anyway I'm not trying to

00:38:39.859 --> 00:38:43.460
rag on you don't don't take that last a

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:44.900
little bit by the way as like me

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:46.099
admonishing people who don't know what

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:47.539
they want to do with their life I don't

00:38:46.099 --> 00:38:50.509
know what I want to do with my life

00:38:47.539 --> 00:38:52.670
I'm here I love playing video games on

00:38:50.509 --> 00:38:54.920
YouTube how could you not first off I

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:58.999
mean there are there are lays I suppose

00:38:54.920 --> 00:39:01.519
but it's not all sunshine and roses but

00:38:58.999 --> 00:39:04.789
the duty itself is like a really nice in

00:39:01.519 --> 00:39:07.849
my opinion but even still like you know

00:39:04.789 --> 00:39:09.230
I'm 28 YouTube goes up what do I want to

00:39:07.849 --> 00:39:11.839
do I don't know probably something in

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:13.759
that you know computer technology field

00:39:11.839 --> 00:39:16.400
of things but I don't know if I want to

00:39:13.759 --> 00:39:19.670
be a front-end dev a database

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:22.309
administrator a visionary for AOL or

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:23.569
something who knows so don't sweat that

00:39:22.309 --> 00:39:25.460
that's not what I meant

00:39:23.569 --> 00:39:27.710
there's more dislike you know it shows a

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:29.630
great deal of self respect to do things

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:37.210
that you enjoy and it not be ashamed

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:37.210
about it that's cool that's cool stuff

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:42.470
and that goes for anything by the way if

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:44.360
you're on the if you're a smart guy and

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:45.770
you feel guilty about being really good

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:46.220
at football in your high school or

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:49.550
something

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:51.080
screw that dude love football it doesn't

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:52.880
have to just be dorky stuff that it's

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:54.890
traditionally societally a little bit

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:57.230
shunned you know you can still you could

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:59.780
be the guy who's smart but also loves

00:39:57.230 --> 00:40:01.300
you know doing pancake blocks ain't

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:05.540
nothing wrong with that

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:07.880
live your true self I'm very non self

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:09.470
improvement I as well and this is this

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.030
conversation is making me put that into

00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:14.120
question I'm just telling you then you

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:22.210
have to thine own self be true okay we

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:26.990
have better damage now but I don't fully

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:28.760
understand whether or not we have a

00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:30.500
great chance I mean the sad bombs are

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:32.570
nice we got unlimited numbers of them so

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:34.820
that's good we were very right to not

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:38.030
fight delirium right off the bat because

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:42.920
he was in that room let's give it a try

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:44.990
min so you should really in my opinion

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:48.200
be throwing down sad bombs like non-stop

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:51.230
here and I'm not gonna apologize for it

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:53.240
the sad bombs the added benefit of sad

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:55.820
bombs here is that static tears are

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:57.980
gonna connect all of our like Tammy's

00:40:55.820 --> 00:41:01.850
head deaths touch shots so they are

00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:03.650
gonna sincerely cover like the whole

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:05.540
room maybe not with a ton of damnit

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:07.850
filled with enough to harass the enemy a

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:11.060
little bit of needle them if nothing

00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:12.950
else we also and I haven't been doing a

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:15.830
great job of this so far we should

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:18.620
endeavor to an extreme degree to not

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:20.540
take damage beyond the obvious that you

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:24.740
just shouldn't try to take damage in the

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:25.940
first place we don't want to have to if

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:29.540
we lose this fight we're gonna have one

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:35.170
HP and then we're gonna have to die to

00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:38.390
delirium ten times so I would prefer to

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:40.550
avoid that if possible we're pretty much

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:42.650
on pace to succeed right now when you

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:44.830
consider the Sun card but we could do

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:44.830
better

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:57.420
which is what I'm trying to do it in

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:59.720
president Oh am i selling my own bomb I

00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:04.380
think and they got hit immediately after

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:07.620
no the more we can make like the weak

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:09.360
enemies that delirium spawns or becomes

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:12.030
I should say the more that we can make

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:14.790
those eat like an entire sad bomb the

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:20.820
easier our life becomes like this guy oh

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:22.620
my god like tell a frag myself every one

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:26.580
of those bombs might be like 5% of his

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:36.780
HP if they take the brunt so sure that's

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:40.010
20 that we have to hit with but every

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:42.780
single one you know helps us out here

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:45.630
please spawn more enemies that basically

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:50.420
never move couple of really good bombs

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:54.260
in here by the way we've equalized our

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:54.260
previous errors I think

00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:07.400
that was I thought mom's heart had

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:07.400
detached and was flying around the room

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:17.640
he's almost done dude that should do it

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:19.250
right there it didn't I Papa Sun card

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:23.250
real quick that might get the kill

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:25.140
didn't there we go and by the way this

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:26.400
was not like a throw I think we took a

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:28.320
lot of damage that we shouldn't take him

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:31.890
but for the most part like we were not

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:40.560
particularly stat it up for this so I'm

00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:41.370
very happy that this worked out we had

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:46.160
already done that

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:46.160
I think we'd already

00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:54.950
well thanks for watching hope you guys

00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:55.940
enjoyed the episode of particular like

00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:57.230
button upset a great deal of course

00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:59.540
subscribe your LC for the future but for

00:43:57.230 --> 00:44:02.110
now thanks for watching and I'll see you

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:02.110
next time
