##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.179
everybody welcome back sit on the line

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.640
please

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.649
the binding of issac Eduard plus we are

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.740
doing challenges today and I always do

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.719
it on the wrong save file here suicide

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.880
King is our next one you might be saying

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.070
why not just copy that save file into

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.289
the first slot from the second slot the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.130
answer to that question is maybe one day

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.140
we'll have the capability to get all

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.000
Jesus I forgot what this one was that

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.470
will have the ability to get a three

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.439
million percent you know to get all

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.750
three save files handled that was like

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.430
kind of an awful draw there but anyway

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.950
life goes on what we're going to do here

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.930
try to succeed on the suicide King

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.739
challenge what do we have if a cat my

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.090
reflection

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.850
mr. mega you're giving me more spiders

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.940
all Jesus so how do we work our way out

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.109
of this pretty terrible mess it's not

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.640
easy but nobody so sorry about that

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.149
mouse pointer nobody said it was easy

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.549
it'd be such a shame for us to part I

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.130
think that's how the scientist by

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.920
Coldplay goes I don't remember it's been

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.860
a while that's a different song okay I

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.140
don't also don't remember what our HP is

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.920
on this run which is arguably like

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.390
substantially more of a problem we

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.070
probably don't have item rooms our

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.100
damage is lovely

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.630
we at least got a spirit heart there the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.579
big problem of course is just going to

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.770
be dodging our epic Akshata and there's

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.990
an easy way to get around that although

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.509
it's also somewhat unlikely and that's

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.229
to pick up pyromaniac or host head

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.430
both of which are anecdotally speaking

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:46.040
relatively rare I think it's fair to

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:49.340
suggest I would really like to stop

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.570
accidentally creating more spiders

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.920
[Music]

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.430
because I'm blowing up these freaking

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.350
pots but it's not plausible dude they

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.860
just keep common and they don't stop

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.780
coming

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.420
don't even ask what they do to the rules

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.130
okay we got HP back we've actually

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.950
handled ourselves relatively well on

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.539
this floor this may surprise you I mean

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.489
I'm not super stoked to the damage I

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.000
took there this may surprise you I'm

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.160
actually really

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.840
happy we fought Ragman I seem like close

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.070
to an ideal boss fight for us to have

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.650
here now I think it's fairly obvious

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:27.390
here

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:30.340
yes khatola would be nice actually hey I

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.560
wasn't even being facetious good soul to

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.850
make flies not aggro us it's going to

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.190
make it a little easier to kill a

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.170
variety of different enemies here anyway

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.230
our game plan is pretty simple

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.840
shoot ipecac in such a way that it

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.670
explodes on enemies without having a

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.239
chance to ever ricochet and come back to

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.650
us that's the the dream come true here

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.810
maybe it'll work maybe it won't I think

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.730
this is the one that we failed to the

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.890
gloomy wood plea to rebirth the first

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.720
time it's going to be a problem and

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.140
you're done just put this down here to

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.450
be safe and one more spirit heart for

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:12.180
the road oh it's a dream come true room

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:16.000
or as I call it ad room you know what

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.070
you lost your chance if you want to make

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.739
spiders than make spiders do but when I

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.739
get lemons from life I don't make

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.870
spiders I make spider ade the lemonade

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.420
analog made out of spiders that's

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.980
substantially cheaper and as a result

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.840
gives us a competitive advantage in the

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.690
market as compared to products that

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.930
contain real fruit so what is the apart

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.910
from just dodging our own ipecac shops I

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:44.709
think one of the things we could pursue

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:50.530
is a shot speed if we're able to get

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:53.230
high shot speed we might be able to

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.760
shoot straight longer before our shots

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.130
would come back and hurt us so I think

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.380
that's a sensible approach for us to

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.140
take there dessert is fine and then we

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.390
will try both of these pentagrams again

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.190
find Judas's shadow also fine

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:10.530
I'll be the first to tell you we

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.530
probably don't need extra damage

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.090
what is our extra life here as well I

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.489
don't I don't recall

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:23.199
how that works in suicide King but

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:27.639
anyway we're out good performance

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:29.830
sort of I'm happy we're alive and I'm

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:34.449
looking forward to making some progress

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.979
here this is the the hardest challenge

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:40.000
one of the hardest challenges at least

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:41.919
in in rebirth in my opinion so if we

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.300
fail this once twice three times the

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.220
lady it doesn't really matter you know

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.440
it's part of the part of the course to

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:51.340
be expected I guess is what I mean to

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.380
say there oh okay I've been playing a

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.910
little bit more Isaac today than when I

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.830
have the past week or so and I'm not

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.229
going to you know belabor the discussion

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.720
by going off on like yet another oh the

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:04.360
backlog is so big sort of thing I

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:08.410
recognize we have larvae pretty decent

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:12.100
but yeah that's going to hurt let's

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.840
check it out so I feel like you know

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.310
just escape here even though that

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.900
trinket is probably better I feel like

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:22.780
I'm in a good position to perform okay

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:25.240
right now like I'm primed I'm ready and

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.610
then as they say in the song willing and

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.010
able and again I don't know if that's a

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:36.960
that could be can con that could be a

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:36.960
Canadian song would not surprise me

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.760
the easiest way out now that it is

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.590
actually a surprising number of like

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.110
almost chisa both strategies here I

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.700
guess the easiest way out is probably

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.800
just to pick up like brimstone or

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.860
something anything that makes it so that

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.200
our shots either no longer explode or

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.060
they just go straight for like infinite

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:04.210
range so like technology would also be

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:04.750
really good missing that would have been

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.880
a problem

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.520
why are you is it's good told thanks you

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.000
so slow I don't think we've gotten skat

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:17.919
ole on our like vanilla save file yet so

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:20.919
we are still missing that that was

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:22.390
almost a genius play okay if I hadn't

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:24.610
shot again it might have been a genius

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.980
play anyway let's go

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.050
just focus I find I don't know if this

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.970
is true for other people because I don't

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.910
know do other people you talk to

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.950
yourself when you play video games

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:38.440
I'm excited seems like actual hell it

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.970
was the other one I'm drowsy okay give

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.450
me I'm drowsy for the boss fight at

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:47.260
least but I find when I'm focused on

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:51.160
doing something I oftentimes not always

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:54.010
but oftentimes do worse you know the big

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.780
example for me is like rhythm games so

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:58.000
in guitar hero or rock band if you're

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.430
playing a track if you're thinking about

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.380
playing the track I oftentimes find that

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.850
I actually play a lot worse and if I'm

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.919
not thinking about playing the track if

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:08.290
I'm like lost in my own world I find

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:09.580
that I'm kind of like absent mindedly

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.470
oftentimes doing way better than

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:16.210
expected and I think the same holds true

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:18.310
for Isaac I think when I go off on

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.750
tangents in Isaac I oftentimes find I

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:23.470
know I said oftentimes about a million

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:27.970
times there I oftentimes find myself

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:29.860
playing a little bit better so the jury

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:35.440
is now out that's not the phrase that

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:38.560
the time is now to find a tangent to

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:41.290
speak of okay I'm drowsy did not last as

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:43.960
long as I wanted it to but he still died

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:47.470
are you a wizard please don't give me

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:51.030
Krampus here I'm begging you oh it's not

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.030
Krampus it's two abilities to fly

00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:57.840
that was a tough decision you normally

00:07:56.189 --> 00:07:59.729
like the spirit of the night is 10 out

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.969
of 10 times better or it's better 10 out

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:05.969
of 10 times then lord of the pit however

00:08:02.969 --> 00:08:08.879
in this situation I'm not convinced

00:08:05.969 --> 00:08:11.249
because we might actually not want

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:13.740
spectral tears because we'd rather have

00:08:11.249 --> 00:08:17.159
more fine control over when our tears

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:18.509
explode we also in in many runs we

00:08:17.159 --> 00:08:20.370
probably would have wanted to take both

00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:23.099
just to facilitate the easy Judas's

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:33.199
shadow I don't think that's the case on

00:08:23.099 --> 00:08:33.199
this one though excuse me excuse me

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:43.370
something is not right when word you

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:45.650
know we have 48 damaged or 45 damaged I

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:49.450
guess and yet we can't kill that guy in

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:52.310
one hit range up actually pretty good

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:53.960
just going to be honest with you

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:57.650
you guys are getting blown up there's a

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:59.540
small chance I might be able to make the

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:00.920
demon judgment work for us so I'm going

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.930
to leave you alive for now

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:06.320
whereas Arnold Schwarzenegger said in

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:08.540
the classic film from 1985 commando I

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.400
like you Sully that's why I'm going to

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.900
kill you last and then when he kills him

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:14.780
he says you know when I said I was going

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:20.870
to kill you last and he goes yeah and he

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:23.500
goes I lied it's a perfect movie the

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:25.820
only perfect movie ever made

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:30.080
what about Schindler's List you know

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:32.270
what about Schindler's List as far as

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.730
I'm concerned that's just like Steven

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:37.730
Spielberg's the hottie and the Nottie

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:39.440
that Steven Spielberg's Norbit that

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:42.020
Steven Spielberg's Adventures of Pluto

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:44.300
Nash that Steven Spielberg's Tower Heist

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.710
that Steven Spielberg's Bowfinger okay

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:48.950
pump the brakes both fingers actually

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:50.990
really good not everything Eddie Murphy

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:52.880
has done since the year 2000 is trash

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:56.780
yeah what about the Nutty Professor the

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:59.030
Nutty Professor sorry to tell you it's

00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:01.670
not good I don't I don't want to be the

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:02.990
bearer of bad news you've made me be the

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:05.330
bearer of bad news here

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:08.420
I saw Nutty Professor to the Klumps in

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:10.040
theaters got lots of fond memories of

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:14.930
that movie I like when the lady says

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:17.210
Hercules Hercules it's just not great

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:18.890
though okay we're still alive we got a

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:23.450
spirit all right let's get that party

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:24.530
started on a Saturday night there's

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:27.140
something to be said for a remote

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:31.640
detonator I may buy it just because Oh

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:33.620
what's uh okay I may buy it just because

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.940
we get five bombs out of it but let's

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.320
see if we get a deal with the devil here

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:38.120
and like what our decision-making

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.220
process will look like as a result your

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:42.670
poison to death I'm sorry to tell you

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:48.990
you've been poison to death

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:52.600
no you're dead I know that was a man

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:54.790
well thought though grab this okay we

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.470
gotta beat the Cathedral so there's like

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:59.560
a lot of there's a lot of game left

00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:01.000
unfortunately grab this I think we stick

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.130
with Bob's rotten head even though it

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.560
might actually do less damage that was

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:06.940
an amnesia pill in there and weird you

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:12.550
know keep on rocking in the free world

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:14.380
due to due to trying to see maybe it's

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:16.480
really hard for me to look for a secret

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:20.260
room because our shots no longer explode

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:26.640
on the walls case in point I don't see

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:28.990
why it wouldn't be here get back out oh

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:32.260
so other things that are like 10 out of

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:36.310
10 at this point if we could get nine

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:37.450
lives I would be very happy because I

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.650
mean how many times do you think we have

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:39.040
to hit eyes if you kill them at this

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:42.850
point

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:45.300
under 10 or somewhere in that vicinity

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:48.840
at least so I think it's very

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:51.910
conceivable to suggest that we could

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:54.370
over the course of many lives beat Isaac

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:55.930
with one HP we have to get to Isaac

00:11:54.370 --> 00:12:01.480
first of course you can't forget about

00:11:55.930 --> 00:12:07.540
that the other thing is it would be nice

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:09.730
to have a little bit more speed makes it

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:11.110
easier to kind of like dodge it looks

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:13.360
like Kerbal space program right we can

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:16.750
dodge around our shops a little bit more

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:20.710
effectively as a product of our speed

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:22.360
parameter scoot ole is actually I

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:24.100
wouldn't say it's the unsung hero this

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.170
run because I've reserved that for like

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:29.140
things that actually have a pretty

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:30.580
market impact on the run but Scott ol is

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:32.890
way better than I ever would have

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:35.080
expected it to be just neutralizing

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:37.890
those annoying flies is like eight out

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.890
of ten usefulness

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:48.650
stop I have to hit you with this

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.650
like it was pardon me

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:53.330
that was bad

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:59.980
you will never get this how can you both

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.390
be so close to death it just does it you

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:04.540
didn't even have a health bar there

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:07.090
that's cheating speed plus range exactly

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:09.550
what we were looking for another amnesia

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:13.710
pill we're going to do this world a

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:13.710
favor and be that the pill garbage can

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.820
we probably shouldn't have done that

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:21.460
because you could have look for a shot

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:23.890
but I'm out I'm out dude this isn't

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:26.470
about rushing every room carries with it

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:28.030
an inherent cost and the cost is

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:30.460
directly proportional to the likelihood

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:32.350
that we damage ourselves what we're

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:36.100
trying to do is race against time here

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:37.750
and honestly like every I it's not that

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:41.680
bad we got a big speed upgrade so it's

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:44.880
not that bad every item we get is a

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:49.840
golden gift so I'm probably going to try

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:56.170
to use the Hermit to get out of boss

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:58.510
rush i think that strikes me as the most

00:13:56.170 --> 00:14:02.680
sensible approach to our relatively

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:03.310
complicated situation right now that

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.100
worked

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:10.570
i'm almost like mad at myself that that

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:16.030
work this thing's going to be it was

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:17.650
difficulty this is our mom floor it's

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:19.390
funny oh there's a tinted rocker I

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:22.300
almost missed it's funny but I almost

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:25.210
feel like this is not as difficult as it

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:26.830
was the first time I did it and all we

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:29.260
actually didn't need to waste our bomb

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:30.670
there I'm wondering if it's because over

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:34.480
the course of the last like two or three

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:36.640
years I have willfully created this my

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:39.280
reflection epic egg situation for myself

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:41.080
over and over and as a result I'm like

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:47.110
used to it at this point

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:48.790
it's not my natural resting state but

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:50.080
it's not as bad as it could be I mean

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.750
what do we what do we care about here

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:54.700
we'll grab piggy bank because we can

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:57.700
arrange ups not bad and then I think

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:59.940
we're just out possibly second secret

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.940
room

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:07.800
literal second secret room

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:09.360
oh I'm drowsy range up I think we're

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.830
still good on the range ups and our pill

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.589
is the hermit's we need the Hermit for

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:15.570
now and then we'll take I'm drowsy maybe

00:15:13.589 --> 00:15:22.950
then the mom's heart might be an

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:25.620
acceptable approach there good good good

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:29.940
like I think it's smart to aim to just

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:33.480
barely miss that way the shot might

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:35.459
catch the the walls on the on the way

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.810
back and is more likely to miss on that

00:15:35.459 --> 00:15:41.190
was like 10 out of 10

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:43.560
I'm 0% mad I would love to ditch Bob's

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:48.329
rod and head for Krampus --is non Rawdon

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:52.829
head Krampus is regular old head thank

00:15:48.329 --> 00:15:58.110
you thank you for not teleporting me as

00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:59.700
well and then you can't go Loki's horns

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:02.519
here which is why I'm going to go Loki's

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:05.040
horns here it's such a stupid decision

00:16:02.519 --> 00:16:07.529
that it would be idiotic for me not to

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:09.329
do it because I have the chance to shoot

00:16:07.529 --> 00:16:10.920
for the swing for the fences and even if

00:16:09.329 --> 00:16:15.209
I miss you know land amongst the stars

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:17.310
here so what's the problem with this

00:16:15.209 --> 00:16:20.100
well the problem with this is that every

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:22.350
now and then I get a little bit lonely

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:24.209
cuz you never coming round that's what

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:27.360
we're worried about once every few shots

00:16:24.209 --> 00:16:28.920
we're going to accidentally fire four

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.180
shots and those are going to be very

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:33.990
tough to dodge because they're all going

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:36.079
to approach me from different sides so

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:41.640
it's going to really force me to stay

00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:45.120
stay alert and stay safe here turn

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:47.160
around bright eyes but don't you dare

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:50.459
walk backwards cuz you're down around

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:54.149
right okay what makes you small might

00:16:50.459 --> 00:16:57.210
pay dividends here okay

00:16:54.149 --> 00:17:02.620
curse of the maze

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:04.540
we beat Loki's horns on that one I was

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:06.520
extremely close I was going to open

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:08.290
those chests which is why I walked back

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:15.670
into that room but maybe I'm going to

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:19.810
take this as a sign for now I feel in

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:21.970
control of this run blister is actually

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:23.740
kind of horrible I don't know if it

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:25.150
would be that bad with 45 damage if

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.410
attacked but I also think it would

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:31.420
provide us with nothing

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:34.330
oh one holy mantle per floor it's a

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:38.260
dream come true I could still see us

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:39.610
losing this run but I'm increasingly

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:43.480
pleased with the way it looks right now

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:44.950
and unlike unlike some of the runs

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.870
there's our holy mantle youthful still

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:48.430
unlike some of our challenge runs this

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:54.340
one has not been achieved this one is

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:56.500
like an absolutely liked by the textbook

00:17:54.340 --> 00:18:00.250
approach to this except you probably in

00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:02.920
most situations would not take Loki's

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:06.750
horns I'll give you that one no tinted

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:08.770
rock on a room with this many rocks I

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:14.920
don't call them tinted rocks anymore

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:18.850
either they're their huge stones stones

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:20.860
of an alternative pin okay thanks for

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:22.690
the two bombs that's very nice when we

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:25.860
got our spirit heart back for our

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:28.270
earlier miss play and then just dust

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:30.670
momma Gertie as easily as possible

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:33.340
you're dead we got a deal with the devil

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:36.850
and a big speed upgrade and a deal with

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:42.510
the devil is not quite copy but we need

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:44.919
to take Guppies head that's fine

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:46.990
guffy said is better than Krampus a said

00:18:44.919 --> 00:18:50.019
in the situation getting three flies per

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:52.840
room that can do 90 damage each is

00:18:50.019 --> 00:18:56.440
disgust or not 90 I guess they do all

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:59.620
that is they do 45 plus all they do 45

00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:00.820
times 1.5 that's really it's been a

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:04.330
while since I had to care about that a

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:06.190
camera can't recall specifically look at

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:13.750
congressman on trial I cannot recall

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:16.510
let's move on the wound to for flies of

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:20.710
this magnitude can do a lot of damage my

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:24.490
dudes retro vision is irrelevance these

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:26.230
are not though so we already had Bob's

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:33.460
curse to start no we had mr. mega to

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:35.340
start that's correct another spirit

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:41.649
heart holy Mantle's gone that's

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:49.450
completely my bad remember we do have a

00:19:41.649 --> 00:19:50.980
dark judas respond oh I don't know what

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:53.380
happened we got a bob transformation

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:54.880
somewhere in the middle there I thought

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:59.519
we would have died from getting hit

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:59.519
there but apparently not so lucky us

00:19:59.549 --> 00:20:04.019
what is our other like we have a first

00:20:02.019 --> 00:20:08.309
life here that's what I'm trying to

00:20:04.019 --> 00:20:08.309
reconcile that by myself confused

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:16.389
dude the Bob transformation is so rare

00:20:12.809 --> 00:20:18.940
anytime we like get a Loki's horn shot

00:20:16.389 --> 00:20:21.399
if the option is open to us just bail

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:27.970
like get out of the room as soon as you

00:20:21.399 --> 00:20:32.820
can run away from the Loki literally

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:36.720
it's not the note Bay Bay from run away

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:40.740
okay uh it's not I mean is more useful

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:44.049
immediately less useful long-term

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:45.429
crystal ball love a spear at heart we

00:20:44.049 --> 00:20:48.320
didn't get a spirit out we have stars

00:20:45.429 --> 00:20:51.430
card is fine but now we're looking for

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:54.860
so these guys are just going to get porn

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:55.640
like a Natalie Imbruglia Jam and it is a

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:59.240
jam

00:20:55.640 --> 00:21:04.220
not quite banger status but blast from

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:08.360
the past no doubt tinted rock that's a

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:10.490
big one that's pretty bad we're

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.930
basically like living and dying based on

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:15.140
the strength of our tinted rocks right

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:17.000
now based on the fact that we're finding

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:20.420
tinted rocks which essentially means

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.610
that our survival is entirely a product

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:28.360
none of our luck set but of our like

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:31.400
mercurial you know luck set IRL so I'm

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:34.390
that shouldn't make you very confident

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:38.420
about our chances yet at the same time

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:40.690
here we are still rocking in the free

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.690
world

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:48.740
good work so we could go into the self

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:51.440
sacrifice or the curse room but if we go

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:55.420
into there we would need to get

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:55.420
something to take us out or we're dusted

00:21:56.290 --> 00:22:01.310
what an interesting conundrum we find

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:04.640
ourselves facing it nevermind it's just

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:06.560
a single trinket we also have a star's

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:08.480
card instead of the I'm drowsy pill so I

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:13.520
must have left

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:18.260
I'm drowsy on the previous floor you

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:21.890
might be irritated by the way by the

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:23.960
fact that I don't use epic act to blow

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:28.160
open the secret rooms it's because it's

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:30.980
honestly super difficult and also as a

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:35.260
result dangerous to get the ipecac shot

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:37.670
to actually blow up on the door it

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:40.160
refuses to play nice so we got to be a

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:42.920
little bit more cautious now l1 is not

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:46.360
it that's already it this should be a

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.360
second secret room here then

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:53.220
I would rather fire as little as

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:55.410
possible by the way but in the end we

00:22:53.220 --> 00:23:00.540
got a kind of nut up we're gonna have to

00:22:55.410 --> 00:23:06.170
shoot sometimes this is a problem that's

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:08.280
fine so our first respawn was last okay

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:15.510
which I probably should have realized

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:18.390
you start with I tried so hard to dodge

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:23.720
that that was like there was a a

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:33.270
maelstrom now I don't buy it

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:35.400
oK we've still got jock dudas here but

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:38.070
we also have a possible second secret

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:42.690
room nice range up again I still think

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:49.800
that's okay and I don't mind this

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:55.200
actually we got a spear at hard we got

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:58.710
some more flies a lock-up would make it

00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:00.630
more worthwhile but sure okay so we're

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:02.460
doing 50 damage we I guess we don't get

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:05.010
a second damage multiplier a little bit

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:07.580
of a bummer but you know you're doing

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.580
your part here

00:24:10.409 --> 00:24:17.049
we got hit once and that's completely

00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:19.629
okay get the heck out of town so we want

00:24:17.049 --> 00:24:20.799
to fight Isaac as soon as possible but

00:24:19.629 --> 00:24:22.619
it wouldn't be the worst thing to find

00:24:20.799 --> 00:24:26.199
some tinted rocks along the way so let's

00:24:22.619 --> 00:24:31.839
going to check out these rooms and if we

00:24:26.199 --> 00:24:33.969
ever feel afraid like that we're going

00:24:31.839 --> 00:24:36.369
to teleport and I dude

00:24:33.969 --> 00:24:42.039
that was actually I was inside of the

00:24:36.369 --> 00:24:43.989
devil's beam so I consider myself

00:24:42.039 --> 00:24:50.679
extremely lucky to have not taken damage

00:24:43.989 --> 00:24:54.659
there another plausible wind condition

00:24:50.679 --> 00:24:58.059
is honestly bombs we don't have many but

00:24:54.659 --> 00:25:06.879
all that was so dumb a combination of

00:24:58.059 --> 00:25:08.969
bombs and and and flies could get the

00:25:06.879 --> 00:25:11.319
job done

00:25:08.969 --> 00:25:15.929
spirit hearts please that's not a spirit

00:25:11.319 --> 00:25:15.929
heart I hate this

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:29.570
take me out real problems good stuff

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:35.419
dude that was like my like spinal cord

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:38.299
took over function for me there no I'm

00:25:35.419 --> 00:25:42.350
mad so I mean it is my own fault

00:25:38.299 --> 00:25:44.570
I took Loki's horns I shouldn't have

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:46.190
taken Loki's horns but it was fun well

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:47.450
on our second pass we'll go through

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:48.799
these and you know do it the

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:50.270
old-fashioned way probably unless I

00:25:48.799 --> 00:25:51.830
forget which is also plausible but for

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:52.850
