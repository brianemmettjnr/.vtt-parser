##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.740
everybody welcome back to northern lion

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.750
place abiding by Stanford Plus where

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.610
we've almost finished all of the rebirth

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.920
challenges we got ahead travel we got

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:21.660
suicide King and 11 and 19 I am going to

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:25.369
break up the minutia a little bit by

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.140
doing a run that is not a challenge to

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:35.370
re-experience things about The Binding

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:37.860
of Isaac Cain to the Cathedral totally

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.350
works um not that I was getting bored

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.899
with like the challenges necessarily but

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.800
to c6 my qg6

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.649
d6 don't mind if I do I just like at

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.329
some point I really do have it's not

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.050
like I spend my nights thinking about

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.300
this but I really do have a theory of

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.250
Zayn eNOS and it's not even just Zane

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.059
eNOS to use like you know he said the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.559
word but it's it's a theory of

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.570
entertainment and that the theory which

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.420
has been documented by people smarter

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.610
than myself is that restriction breeds

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:17.040
creativity it's the same reason like you

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.570
know whenever we've done like Kate and I

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.049
have done player unknowns battlegrounds

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.100
custom games I I don't like people are

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.439
like why don't you do one that's just

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.210
like a hundred people fists only look it

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.220
could be fun or like a hundred people

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.130
motorcycles only it could be fun but I

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.860
think when you set you weigh the table

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.320
so much in the direction of like things

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.689
being zany it stops being zany where you

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.159
actually get to Zayn is when there's a

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.170
little bit of freedom involved when you

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.970
have the choice to not be zany and you

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.030
choose to be zany that's where

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.920
entertainment can flourish right that's

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.659
why the concept not the best games

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.399
necessarily come in a game jams it's the

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.810
concept of a game jam is so cool it's

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:01.259
like of course you know industry is kind

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.119
of like one big game jam then the end

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.770
the theme is make the best game or

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.360
perhaps the game that you like the most

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.670
or perhaps the game that can sell the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.530
most but the game jam is like hey just

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.510
do something but it has to be done in a

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.080
short period of time usually or it has

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.370
to be you know on this particular

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:21.850
theme or blah blah blah so I the freedom

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.850
aspect of Isaac that is sometimes not

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.920
inherent with those challenges as it's

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.810
only a byproduct the fact that we have

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.280
to do all the challenges over again in

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.320
the first place that it even becomes an

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.250
issue but anyway that's that's my like

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.560
overly self-important reasoning for why

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.180
I'm doing a normal Isaac run at the

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.930
present moment cuz you get situations

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.680
like this also I missed item rooms so we

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:52.210
got doorstop I don't know what doorstop

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:55.120
is but I can operate under an assumption

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.860
obviously we want transcendence named

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.710
after the best Johnny Depp movie

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.230
obviously um excuse me and I'll it's not

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.940
called Edie would which is actually the

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.280
best Johnny Depp movie but I diagram I

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.170
mean there's some good ones I'm not the

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.700
biggest Johnny Depp fan but I even I

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.790
would admit that he's done some great

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.040
work over the course of his career let's

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.720
try it oh it's a second son card that's

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.290
Oh what is this infamous anyway let's

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.650
move on and we'll get this key as well

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.140
I miss item rooms dude item rooms are

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:30.340
like the few will that you use to tailor

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.230
your run okay what I'm trying to distill

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.350
this down to is the idea that you know

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.330
sometimes the least zany thing you can

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.739
do is be like everything has to be zany

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:45.060
cuz now you're just making it like

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:45.060
normal it's like okay be careful

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.390
although is Virgo giving us this

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.970
protection here I'm actually going to

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.820
use our bomb I don't think we're in

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.200
trouble but like we might as well be a

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.690
little bit more careful we handled this

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.050
wrong it's like if you ate pizza for

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.489
every meal you get sick of it eventually

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.690
I think it'd be one of the foods at

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.820
least for me that I would be like

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.800
slowest to get sick of I think I'd get

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.239
sick of it eventually might take you

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.040
know a couple decades right be like you

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.870
know what I'd rather just not eat then

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.180
eat pizza for this meal at some point I

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.310
think it would happen that's why you got

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.870
to mix it up ice cream pizza ice cream

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.500
don't follow this advice this is bad

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.390
advice

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.580
I still live under the like the idea

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.819
that

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.500
the terrible specter that youtubing and

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:33.479
then you know being a twitch streamer is

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.430
still very young profession we don't

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.900
know the long-term ramifications I'm not

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.270
trying to suggest it's terrible for your

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.250
health but you know most youtubers

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.050
twitch streamers I know myself included

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.620
you know we're incentivized to spend a

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.629
lot of time sitting down don't really

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.889
prioritize good diet and exercise oh it

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:51.990
keeps all doors open

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.550
dude that's actually keeps the doors

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.039
that we came through open it's actually

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.900
pretty great if it works on like mob

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.340
trap rooms or you know we can enter a

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.560
room preview it and then leave if we

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.180
want I'm worried that you know like 20

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.690
26 is going to roll around and

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:12.419
everybody's going to be like hey turns

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:14.069
out I'm dead I hope not dude I hope not

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:19.259
I got to live to fight the robots in the

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:20.969
upcoming technical if that wasn't into

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:22.590
the item that was mmm because let's be

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:23.969
honest the robots are going to destroy

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.199
us if it ever comes to the point where

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:28.469
they could wage war almost by definition

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:30.180
they would end our existence but anyway

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:31.620
unless we were useful in some kind of

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.479
like you know maybe they could farm us

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.319
for meat or something we could be the

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:40.199
new okhta that didn't give me

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:45.659
invincibility I'm kind of like trying to

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:47.909
not go this low on HP but I'm gonna

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:52.830
because I know you know to thine own

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:54.810
self be true right I mean we have 5 HP

00:05:52.830 --> 00:06:00.449
already you really need to push it this

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:02.729
far probably not we're in a really

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:06.960
really good spot provided we can still

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:08.940
get our deal with the devil and then I

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.430
guess it's like a secondary obvious

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:15.090
condition living would be pretty good

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:17.580
I'm gonna use a bomb here oh I think

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.590
I've actually it's like the fastest I've

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.349
ever done a 180 on a trinket this

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.000
trinket sucks if it accidentally leads

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:27.930
to me walking through doors this trinket

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.699
sucks especially using a bomb hurts the

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.110
most okay so we will get a deal with the

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.870
devil if we don't get hit on this room

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:37.349
I'll call it right now CNN projects

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.759
because then we're able to get a spirit

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:40.050
heart most of the time and in this case

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:44.370
obviously we were

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:47.729
and a year arun gives us a key and a

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:51.870
spirit hard and a pill why not give it a

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:53.490
shot is my my feeling year if the pills

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.110
good maybe we can buy it again it's

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.940
lemonparty probably not good enough to

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:03.720
blow up a donation machine that still

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:05.340
needs a little bit of love all we need

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.379
to really give us a great chance of

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.479
winning this run is some kind of dps

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:12.180
upgrade right here I'd settle for you

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:13.259
know tears as long as it was decent in

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.909
the end we don't have any choice but to

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:16.289
settle I did turns out I'll settle for

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:18.449
pageant boy because in the end I'm not

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:19.169
going to leave the item back there you

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:21.270
know you ever hear the expression

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:26.400
beggars can't be choosers we're getting

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:29.129
an item here we got to take it we've got

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.110
no choice in the matter more or less for

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:34.050
the time being at least one day dude it

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:37.020
did have d6 in the seed so you know what

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:39.240
they say d6 in the seed d6 indeed I

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:43.139
think uh sure said there Ludacris said

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:49.229
that in asurs magnum opus yeah okay it's

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:50.840
HP that is DPS why not I mean we have we

00:07:49.229 --> 00:07:53.849
have enough HP to still have some

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.860
layaway this is not a why not this is a

00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:58.919
why why I take lord of the pit and

00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:01.889
transcendence if I was a more dishonest

00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:04.620
man I could spin it oh well we got a

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:06.419
speed downgrade when we took large so I

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.009
think it was actually very smart for us

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:10.110
to take this to get a mild speed upgrade

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:13.319
but no it was just a mistake if I'm

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:16.050
leveling with you in the end it ended up

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:20.849
working out okay but it was a mistake

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:24.629
nonetheless little Bryn great pickup

00:08:20.849 --> 00:08:25.500
obviously I counter ninetails also a

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:27.659
great pickup

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.940
we've got very few problems here you

00:08:27.659 --> 00:08:31.860
know what we got a role doorstop and the

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:34.560
reason we got a role doorstop is because

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:36.060
I didn't want the HP upgrade seed like

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:42.449
it sometimes it's bad to have too much

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:45.510
HP it's like god idiot luckily HP is

00:08:42.449 --> 00:08:47.310
like maybe the third most valuable

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:49.740
resource so no big deal dude we just

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:52.870
trade it away life force for nothing out

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:55.970
of inertia um

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:58.310
we got a roll with it to see what it can

00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:00.080
do for us because oftentimes items and

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:02.000
Isaac can make a bad first impression

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.920
and then be excellent or alternatively

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.760
make a great first impression and then

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.940
be garbage

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:10.250
there was a long time where I thought

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:13.190
cursed I was a good item now you might

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:15.110
say that's just idiocy and to a large

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:17.450
degree you would probably be correct as

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:26.420
idiocy combined with a little bit of

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:28.190
stubbornness that I can't deny but you

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:30.020
know you look at and you go cool I can

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:31.550
fire multiple shots that's the triple

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.870
shot is a much better example you get

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:36.110
triple shot and you go oh this is

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:37.610
amazing I'm shooting three shots instead

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:42.200
of one now two of them are missing in my

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:44.750
rate of fire is garbage but still Herman

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.580
okay well we're probably not at the

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:49.640
point where we need to use a card like

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:51.770
the Herman to like skip boss Trap rooms

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.090
or anything like that but I'm so pleased

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:56.600
that I've been able to get back into the

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:58.670
loop of like playing Isaac on a non

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.080
challenge run a run that actually like

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:03.110
we don't know how far it's going to go

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.820
and well I mean we will at some point

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:07.070
but for now we don't know if this ends

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:09.890
at the chest or what because it's been

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:11.720
like a month since I did might as well

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:16.510
take it it's been like a month since I

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:18.800
did like a vanilla episode basically I

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:24.350
kind of appreciate this new Isaac

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:25.670
existence again you'd be surprised you

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:27.890
know you can keep your skills pretty

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:31.430
sharp for life if you know you deuce one

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:33.170
thing 45 minutes a day everyday for your

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:36.050
entire adult life you'll get pretty good

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:37.790
at it you know imagine if you ran 45

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:39.290
minutes a day every day in your adult

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:41.030
life how good would you be at running by

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:43.300
the end of it probably better than I am

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:46.970
at Isaac but still I digress a little

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:49.400
bit of work you know can can get a lot

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:56.420
of progress done probably what do I know

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:58.550
okay so good for Cano Meccano again we

00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:01.010
finally got rooms which I didn't mention

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:02.240
but is very nice let's see what we get

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:04.550
in here I kind of want to take the

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.990
Hermit with me but perthro is better I

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:09.649
want to take the Hermit Oh

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:11.990
oh I want to take the Hermit to avoid

00:11:09.649 --> 00:11:13.700
having to do boss rush but I don't know

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:15.589
if we've even done boss rushes cane so

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:21.709
maybe we actually want to keep her

00:11:15.589 --> 00:11:24.560
throat oh he's done it that's not small

00:11:21.709 --> 00:11:28.940
rock we have done boss rushes came so we

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:30.950
don't need to do boss rush but perthro

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.510
was more enjoyable than the Hermit as

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.980
far as cards go I mean we could use the

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.330
Hermit to save a key but it wouldn't

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:37.670
actually save a key because we have a

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:46.760
golden key right now so disregard that I

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:49.610
don't know what I'm talking about head

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.740
through here and I mean we could blow it

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.750
up but what a week really care at this

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.950
point I think we've already gotten both

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.600
secret rooms as well so let's just

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:58.880
bounce we've used a non zoo so we would

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:00.050
see better rooms if they existed we're

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:07.250
going to head downwards here

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:09.290
I like Cain dude if there were like

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:14.089
balance changes that I wanted to make to

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:18.470
Isaac in general this is kind of like a

00:12:14.089 --> 00:12:20.360
hangover from the last maybe like three

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.980
months worth of episodes on the 1

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:26.630
million and one percent save file but oh

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:28.670
dude absolutely but giving every

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:30.950
character more or less the same base

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:34.490
damage as Cain I think would be like a

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:37.670
possible example cuz I'm we're living in

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:40.070
like a post difficulty Isaac world if

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:44.930
that like without being overly cocky

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:49.610
like you know what we roll that that's

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:51.680
not good at all Isaac is not a oh okay

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:53.870
well could be worse Isaac is not a

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.760
difficult game to beat that doesn't mean

00:12:53.870 --> 00:13:00.470
that I've never had difficulty beating

00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:03.680
it okay like phrasing maybe but yeah

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:05.450
what I mean potentially so I'm not your

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.850
initial reaction might be like well

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:10.250
people already win like at least 90% of

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:12.470
the runs they do oftentimes so like why

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:14.810
make it easier because it's more fun and

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:15.920
that's really I think about that

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:19.250
sometimes when I think about like the

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:23.000
eyes a game design like you know

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:25.370
like single-player games people beat

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.990
them all the time like the most

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:29.120
single-player games and I would argue

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:30.800
even stuff that is like oh it's you know

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.959
only for hardcore gamers even stuff like

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.399
Dark Souls included they're designed to

00:13:32.959 --> 00:13:35.990
be beaten they're not designed to beat

00:13:34.399 --> 00:13:37.519
you they're designed to provide maybe

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:41.139
like a challenge along the way but

00:13:37.519 --> 00:13:46.100
mostly they're designed to be enjoyable

00:13:41.139 --> 00:13:47.540
and certainly Isaac is enjoyable but you

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:50.180
know what's not enjoyable that one

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:51.649
stretch of time where we seemingly never

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.930
got damage upgrades until like the

00:13:51.649 --> 00:13:56.420
eighth floor of the game that was a dang

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:59.120
old nightmare dude so I am going to make

00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:01.069
myself look like an idiot and actually

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.540
remove all suspicion that I am an idiot

00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:04.819
in the way that I did that we should

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:07.250
have taken whore Babylon first and then

00:14:04.819 --> 00:14:09.110
the ability to fly then spirit of the

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:11.209
night because it would have given us

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:14.740
permanent or Babylon state with more HP

00:14:11.209 --> 00:14:17.000
but anyway more spirit hearts rather

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:20.060
still I mean I don't think this was a

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.670
bad decision to take both items but it

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.930
was a very bad decision to take them in

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:25.579
that order either way we're still going

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:27.579
to be fine just getting the rust out a

00:14:25.579 --> 00:14:30.139
little bit

00:14:27.579 --> 00:14:31.009
it's what I'm going to chock it up to

00:14:30.139 --> 00:14:33.379
anyway

00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:35.420
now our damage is actually very very

00:14:33.379 --> 00:14:38.779
good for this stage of the game all I

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:40.699
would like to see we're right on pace

00:14:38.779 --> 00:14:46.220
for boss rush as well all I would like

00:14:40.699 --> 00:14:47.629
to see is a tiers upgrade we've already

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.949
seen our deal with the devil here but

00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:51.350
there's no way that we can like lower

00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:53.120
our odds so if Gertie gives me in tears

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:59.870
upgrade I'm a very happy camper as far

00:14:53.120 --> 00:15:01.160
as I'm concerned all of those shots were

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:04.930
hitting but it looked like I wasn't

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:09.050
firing at all tiers upgrade please dude

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:10.370
torn photo already seen our deal with

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:12.199
the devil and we are off to the next

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.879
floor this is what I missed I missed the

00:15:12.199 --> 00:15:16.990
ability to make mistakes and have that

00:15:13.879 --> 00:15:22.550
light colors at amber of your entire run

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:24.529
yet here we are doing everything we can

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:28.360
holding on to what I have and pretending

00:15:24.529 --> 00:15:28.360
that I'm a Superman

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:37.020
and yet if you keep it with 8.4 damage

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:38.670
in the 7 rate of fire I'm like you know

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:41.070
it would be the ideal way to kill these

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:42.810
enemies run into them with ball of

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:48.149
bandages that's really like a good use

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:52.709
of your time the human brain is like bad

00:15:48.149 --> 00:15:55.200
I don't like everyone I find it a little

00:15:52.709 --> 00:15:56.610
disingenuous everyone goes oh the human

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.170
brain is so amazing like isn't it

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:59.970
amazing what the brain can do oh it's so

00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:01.830
incredible if you're in neurologists you

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:06.420
get to say that you know you've trained

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:07.130
in the neurological arts brain magic as

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.990
I call it

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:10.470
but like the brain actually sort of

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:12.630
sucks

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:14.250
I think we've evolved even though we

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:17.339
don't understand our brain and even

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:18.750
though I'm an idiot and like let's be

00:16:17.339 --> 00:16:20.100
honest like I have no idea what I'm

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:23.040
talking about it mostly I'm just

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:26.279
fabricating a bit of a bit to do in an

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:28.110
in the nine Episode here we are smarter

00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:31.230
than our own brains at this point like I

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:32.520
can imagine if you don't eat if you're

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:33.870
so stupid you don't even know you have a

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:36.089
brain we're talking like you know back

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:40.020
in the Premio lithic revolution days

00:16:36.089 --> 00:16:41.940
right then the existence of the brain is

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:44.790
like mind-boggling even our brain sucks

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:46.290
dude we know on a logical level we know

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.880
like oh you know consuming too many

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:49.500
trans and saturated fats has a higher

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:51.660
incidence of heart disease you know oh

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:53.640
don't smoke cigarettes oh don't drink

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:56.820
alcohol is bad for you oh you know like

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:58.050
I should really like work on improving

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:00.300
myself but instead I'm going to watch

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:02.700
six hours of Judge Judy like logically

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:04.550
we know some things are bad for us but

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:07.650
we do them anyway

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:11.309
like the best tasting food in the world

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:14.189
is like fried cornmeal with cheese dust

00:17:11.309 --> 00:17:16.140
and salt on it and that's not because it

00:17:14.189 --> 00:17:18.360
objectively tastes the best it's because

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:22.199
our brains are like hey that's a potent

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:24.600
cocktail to like you know have energy

00:17:22.199 --> 00:17:26.579
that you can actually use give yourself

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:29.700
some you know reusable fat so that you

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:32.790
can stay stay alive in the winter right

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:36.990
we're due for like a brain refactoring

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:39.390
our brains were built when we had

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:41.970
different user requirements than we have

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:45.620
at the present moment and that's

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:49.200
excited for like I get that there's like

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:50.730
they're always making movies about this

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.500
is scary this is like we're doing head

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.919
trauma by accident they're always making

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:58.049
movies about technological like

00:17:54.919 --> 00:18:00.960
futuristic dystopia so rarely is there a

00:17:58.049 --> 00:18:02.640
futuristic utopia sometimes they'll do

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.230
like you know the movie starts and it's

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.960
like everything's perfect in the future

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:08.760
but it you know like 45 minutes in

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:11.280
you're like but it is and we're actually

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:14.190
all like slaves to the matrix or

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:17.640
something like that right anyway I think

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:19.740
you know I'm excited for the what I

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:21.720
would consider in as a lay person the

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:24.570
inevitability of refactoring our brains

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.620
like dude imagine here's just a simple

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:27.990
one right now

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.950
ideal food I'll dress ruffles potato

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:32.520
chips

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:34.080
sweet chili heat Doritos you know you

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:36.360
can change that to some extent by

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.860
changing your habits no doubt but what

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:40.320
if you could just you know pop into the

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:44.400
the brain clinic and they're like okay

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:48.150
so like now you're really you're just

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:50.309
going to like love apples like an apple

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:51.809
is I I think Apple stays good I eat you

00:18:50.309 --> 00:18:53.280
know I don't need an apple a day to keep

00:18:51.809 --> 00:18:55.230
the doctor away because I think that's

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.450
just marketing but I eat an apple a day

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:59.640
because it's a healthy and reasonably

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:02.039
nutritious snack and by the way if

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:04.530
you're going are nutritious NL what

00:19:02.039 --> 00:19:06.809
about carbohydrates my dog it's a

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:09.240
freakin Apple get off the internet

00:19:06.809 --> 00:19:12.030
you've gone too far if you if you're on

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:14.070
say I'm not bad-mouthing keto okay

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:15.780
remember you're the one saying apples

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:18.570
are bad for you I've you fired the first

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:20.970
shot if you're on some kind of diet that

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:24.059
is like I can eat infinite salami but I

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:25.880
can never touch an apple that's fine but

00:19:24.059 --> 00:19:28.860
keep it to yourself because that is like

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:32.130
not sensible in my opinion but again I'm

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:33.510
not a doctor anyway but imagine you

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:36.419
could just head over to the brain clinic

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:38.370
and the brain doctor would be like I

00:19:36.419 --> 00:19:41.669
don't know what they call them he would

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:43.950
be like hey by the way like a nice like

00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:45.929
granny smith apple tastes better than

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:49.830
like Reese's peanut butter cups to you

00:19:45.929 --> 00:19:52.409
right now forever I would do it in a

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:54.360
heartbeat imagine if you could if you

00:19:52.409 --> 00:19:57.750
could wire you know your brain

00:19:54.360 --> 00:20:01.920
on the low level to be like the number

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:03.000
one most important thing or the number

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:06.510
one thing that I get the most enjoyment

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.550
out of is like exercising we'd be better

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:10.230
off man maybe it would round off a

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:13.520
little bit of the edges of humanity I'm

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:15.720
not saying I want to live in a faultless

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.850
civilization I think as human beings our

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.830
faults are what gives us character and I

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:21.570
wear my faults on my sleeve you know how

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:23.640
many episodes ago was that I was like

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:24.660
maybe the visual part of my brain is

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:27.600
actually broken

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:29.370
I find myself endeared to myself as you

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:32.100
might expect in spite of the fact that I

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:34.430
have flaws but there's something to be

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:37.350
said for progress as well I think I

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:42.420
don't know it's I'm not saying there's

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:44.880
no troubling implications to you know

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:46.980
the progress of course there always is

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:52.260
but I don't know I guess I feel the need

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:54.930
to be cautiously optimistic about it

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:58.050
instead of pessimistic because like all

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:59.310
media's pessimistic about it but you

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:00.960
know what I'm an idiot

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:02.850
let's let's try something here I don't

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.770
care it enough about boss rush what we

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:06.720
should do instead is open this and see

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:09.000
if the door stays open it doesn't so

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.170
there is no need for us to have this I

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.340
think not that I can think of right off

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:17.190
the cut anyway but then again you know

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:18.900
whenever I think about stuff like that

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:20.670
I'm like maybe I would be if you guys

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:22.530
seen John Carpenter's magnum opus they

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:24.620
live is magnum opus is actually the

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:28.310
thing but like they live is also amazing

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:31.980
stars Keith David and rowdy roddy piper

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:33.480
anyway is it i'm not going to spoil the

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:35.550
ending of they live or anything like

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.750
that but well you know what that i might

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:38.340
as well not talk about it so i'm going

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:41.490
to spoil a little bit of they live they

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:44.040
live is about it's basically like a

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:48.090
1980s version of the matrix but a little

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:50.220
bit more comedy focused where like the

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:52.710
idea is that an alien civilization is

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:56.750
clandestinely taken over humanity and

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:59.060
they use like advertising to keep us

00:21:56.750 --> 00:22:02.160
compliant i guess would be the best word

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:03.810
rowdy roddy piper finds a mystical pair

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:06.210
of sunglasses that allow them to break

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:07.270
they're kind of like hypnosis over

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:10.050
mankind and then

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:13.240
you know he endeavors to take down this

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:15.160
take down the race of the you know

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.960
basically the alien masters in this case

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:19.660
there's like a couple of dudes in the

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:21.760
movie who are like come on do the aliens

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:24.220
are like really helpful in their like

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:26.350
given us sweet technology and stuff like

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:29.230
that they're not so bad I always wonder

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:31.180
if like me being like yeah gene therapy

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:35.680
will be really cool if I'm like that guy

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:37.690
I'm like come on baby yeah we're like

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:40.570
we're all exactly the same now but like

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:42.910
it's not so bad look at the TV's great

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:46.330
Netflix is only $14 a month you know I'm

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:49.420
like ah maybe I shouldn't have bought

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:51.130
that there was no reason um maybe I do

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:57.490
end up being that guy that would be

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:59.560
unfortunate so I think like the doorstop

00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:01.210
is not a great item not a great trinket

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.950
I should say I might be missing out on

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:08.890
some of the more creative uses of it I

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:10.600
will acquiesce either way I don't know

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:12.250
I'm just I guess I'm more I'm more

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:14.830
optimistic about the future than a lot

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:16.540
of people Automation is interesting

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:18.970
though I mean I mean first off

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:22.210
automation no breathing don't give an F

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:23.800
if I it cetera et cetera um but it's an

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:25.000
interesting thing to think of we've

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.470
already talked about that in a pretty

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.730
recent Isaac episode so I'm not going to

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:32.230
go down that road but still we live in

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:34.270
interesting times dude sometimes I think

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:35.500
about that not just when they whatever

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:38.190
people say it's like men you live in

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:39.840
interesting times it's always like haha

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:43.000
2017

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.200
you know return of 2016 just when you

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.480
thought planet Earth couldn't get

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:48.520
weirder and you know there's something

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:50.320
to be said about that but we really do

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.610
live in like interesting times

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:55.240
you know the printing press was invented

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:58.000
in like the 13th century there's but

00:23:55.240 --> 00:24:00.040
that's like one invention now I might be

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.720
ignorant but sorry I think it was

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:05.010
invented in the 14th century but anyway

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:09.130
if you if you lived in the 14th century

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:11.610
imagine being like feeling how lucky you

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:15.400
were that you live to see one

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:18.040
world-changing invention I think about

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:20.530
that sometimes you know if you were born

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:21.120
in the 14th century your parents might

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:23.850
be like

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:27.240
you're you have no idea how lucky you

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:29.910
are when I was a kid

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:32.670
the printing press didn't even exist you

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:37.530
know we had to copy everything by hand

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:38.070
in a monastery in like Stilgar Germany

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:41.580
you know

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:43.230
oh yeah mom you don't understand how

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:45.900
lucky I am to live in a world with the

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:48.750
dang printing press but like in if you

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:50.780
were born in between like the 1950s and

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:54.300
today you've lived through some

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:56.040
incredible like life-changing inventions

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:59.160
like a life-changing invention like

00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:01.500
every five or ten years you know okay

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:04.470
obviously like radio is not that recent

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:06.030
but it is not that oh yeah that's what I

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:08.400
mean not that recent but like you know

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:11.460
television and color television the

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:13.770
launch of satellites you know landing a

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:16.410
man on the freaking moon International

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:18.660
Space Station telecommunications

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:21.930
networks including the Internet you know

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:24.720
vast improvements in modern medicine and

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:27.150
vaccinations and you know people always

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.830
talk about Iliad maybe where they were

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:31.350
back sliding on that I don't know like a

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:34.230
few people a small percentage of the

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:36.090
population compromising herd immunity is

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:41.250
pretty silly and needless but at the

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:43.590
same time like you know just still do

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:44.730
polio still basically doesn't exist so I

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:49.230
think they I think we're still doing a

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:51.560
pretty good job for the most and by we I

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:55.950
mean people smarter than me possible you

00:25:51.560 --> 00:26:00.630
but definitely smarter than me you know

00:25:55.950 --> 00:26:02.100
we we've lived in the point or we've

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:03.300
lived through an era I guess by

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:05.190
definition if you're watching this

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:07.080
you're probably a contemporary if not of

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:09.120
mine unless these have somehow persisted

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:10.830
in the future in which case what happens

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:14.490
in this episode to get it preserved in

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:15.630
the international record but anyway by

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:16.890
the way we're saving the present so

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:19.500
hopefully use it on this deal with the

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:22.260
devil we have lived to the point where

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:25.220
like we're getting back lat we're so

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:28.050
jaded with like the life-changing

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:30.060
inventions that we have that were jaded

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:33.960
with them and we're like our cellphones

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:35.130
actually good I mean sure I can access

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:37.530
the sum total of

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:39.720
human knowledge at my fingertips in an

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:41.340
instant but like is that distracting me

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:45.620
from looking at trees while I'm on the

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:48.750
bus makes me so freakin such a

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:50.760
masturbatory argument dude whenever

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:52.170
someone wants to insult someone it's

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:55.230
always yeah they were on their cell

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:56.880
phone just once I want them to like

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:58.050
actually it'll never happen but actually

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.790
confront the person on your cell phone

00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:02.010
oh yeah what you're doing on your cell

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:04.320
phone playing Digimon Go or something

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:06.810
like that oh actually I was reading the

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:10.020
original version on translator of Anna

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:11.820
Karenina because it's 2017 you can get

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.780
freaking anything on the Internet what

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.010
do you think I'm just looking at pretty

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:16.200
pictures on this thing

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:19.020
I was reading the scientific journal

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:22.230
paper on you know how to build a solar

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:26.100
sail in zero gravity freakin ignorant

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:27.330
douchebag anyway I mean mostly I do use

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:34.130
if you're looking at funny photos I

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:37.230
can't deny that but like I don't have to

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:38.610
know grandpa uses the look at pictures

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:47.070
of what other people are eating for

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:52.260
lunch idiot pheromones have we done hush

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:56.670
with Cain no do we want to do hush with

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:59.370
Cain well like eventually yes with

00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:01.230
strange attractor Dark Matter might not

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:02.850
be the right time for it but let's see

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:05.670
we got a 100 percent chance of a deal

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:09.720
with the devil here we'll see what we

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:12.150
get there and actually like we'll

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:13.560
definitely get an item because we have

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:16.080
the present which we'll use which will

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:18.060
actually be a stat decrease because

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:22.620
we'll lose the effects of dim bulb but

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:24.120
let's say I mean like it's almost like

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:26.730
you got to take the shot and become a

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:30.360
Guster here we didn't get it but we did

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:31.470
get stronger what okay well you know

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.460
what that makes me mad enough that I'm

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:35.280
getting the heck out of here

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:37.440
I'm actually a little cheese dim bulb is

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:42.330
better than losing dim bulb to get

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:44.640
ceremonial robes weird I wouldn't have

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:46.290
expected that on the bright side we can

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:48.300
now hold the space bar item which might

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:55.170
compensate for the mild stat decrease

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:57.000
anyway I'm just saying we're and you

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:59.100
know what what's funny about this I

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.950
always like to take the bit like one

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:03.570
step further I might be here like you

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:07.050
know oh every 10 years there's a

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:08.940
life-changing invention that's amazing

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:11.940
then you know imagine if you live in

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:14.010
like the year 2500 you put every five

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:15.870
years the life-changing invention try

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:18.929
every five minutes a life-changing

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:21.330
invention imagine living in the early

00:29:18.929 --> 00:29:22.500
2000s and thinking the iPod was

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:24.290
revolutionary

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:29.040
these idiots didn't even have

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:30.630
teleportation technology yet why do we

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:36.480
talk like this in the future I do not

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:38.460
know or maybe like society won't exist

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:42.960
in that point while we live in like you

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:45.150
know caves waiting for you know fifteen

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.770
thousand years to pass so that it's safe

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:52.350
to go outside again and breathe the air

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:55.350
I don't know maybe maybe not that's what

00:29:52.350 --> 00:30:01.290
I mean when I say our frames are broken

00:29:55.350 --> 00:30:03.059
you know there's something like what is

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:06.210
it the great filter the great filter is

00:30:03.059 --> 00:30:07.860
like any society sufficiently

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:12.540
technologically advanced enough to

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:14.520
possibly travel interstellar Li also by

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:18.030
definition has the potential to destroy

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:19.800
itself because you know the you I mean

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:22.020
you're basically flying through space on

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:25.200
explosions so if you just apply those

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:28.559
explosions to the ground instead you

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:31.290
could kill your whole species you would

00:30:28.559 --> 00:30:33.720
think that like if our brains were sweet

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:35.670
we'd be like hey I know we got

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:38.309
differences but like maybe we could put

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:41.340
that aside and like remove the specter

00:30:38.309 --> 00:30:47.340
of possibly destroying our entire

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:49.590
species but we're like nah and I'm done

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:52.140
the same way like I'm not a war monger

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:54.270
of course but like you know I have I

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:58.220
have petty disputes and stuff like that

00:30:54.270 --> 00:31:00.799
my brain is broken as well I understand

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:02.299
someone cuts you off in traffic your

00:31:00.799 --> 00:31:04.429
brain doesn't go like oh I think that

00:31:02.299 --> 00:31:06.260
they're probably having a hard day so

00:31:04.429 --> 00:31:08.900
why don't you cut him some slack now and

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:10.490
stay your brain is like I'm going to

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:12.020
well you're not actually going to do

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:13.700
this but in your head you're playing out

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:14.360
the fantasy of like I'm gonna run you

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:16.190
off the road

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:18.440
well you're I'm gonna teach you what

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:19.760
it's like you know oh you want to go

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:23.350
around being a jerk well what if I'm a

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:27.880
jerk to you oh you're dead you know like

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:27.880
we're Petty's spiteful creatures

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:34.760
sometimes and it might sound like I'm

00:31:32.299 --> 00:31:36.440
trying to be like go don't cut yourself

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:38.720
on that edge but I don't mean it like

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:40.220
that I'm generally speaking a pretty big

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:43.039
fan of humanity I mean have you seen

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:47.809
they live it's a great film made by

00:31:43.039 --> 00:31:51.950
humans many of society's greatest movies

00:31:47.809 --> 00:31:54.640
have been made by people in my opinion I

00:31:51.950 --> 00:32:02.210
don't want to be like political but

00:31:54.640 --> 00:32:04.909
please oh good wait a minute we didn't

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:06.980
get rid of dimbo I am I am an idiot uh

00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:07.789
give me a moment here I thought I got

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:09.380
rid of dim bulb

00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:11.390
but I really just didn't think about it

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:13.130
I didn't get rid of dim bulb what I got

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:16.190
rid of was an item that kept dim bulb

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:21.650
permanently charged which is a subtle

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:23.179
but stark difference you guys been

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:24.919
watching Game of Thrones I thought it

00:32:23.179 --> 00:32:28.659
was a really bold artistic choice when

00:32:24.919 --> 00:32:32.960
they revealed Tony Stark in this act

00:32:28.659 --> 00:32:38.059
he's Iron Man you see man round Wow now

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:42.230
now this is Game of Thrones it is that

00:32:38.059 --> 00:32:44.090
Avengers with Robert Downey jr. the coin

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:48.820
bag has appeared in the basement you

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:48.820
unlock challenge 24 and it's a start

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:56.480
well okay I mean obviously pyromaniacs

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:58.880
good great if we have red hearts which

00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:01.580
we don't but good pinking shears lovely

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:04.150
item sorta allows us to use a little bit

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:04.150
of dim bulb

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:14.540
the Necronomicon is if I use the death

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:16.280
card like 20 times or something right

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:19.280
maybe I killed 10 enemies with a death

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:26.510
card I don't know something along these

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:28.130
lines excuse me sir we should win uh but

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:37.010
if I think it's less guarantee than it

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:39.710
looks right now because we we do have

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:42.470
nine lives but we don't actually have a

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:45.680
great ability to kill enemies largely

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:47.540
like entirely as a result of the fact

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:51.590
that I've willfully inflicted head

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:57.500
trauma on myself here you know strange

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:59.390
attractor combined with a combined with

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:02.870
tiny planet it's not a great selection

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:04.640
of items just to level with you now with

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:06.670
love of coal is a little better and you

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:09.050
know we got a little brim backing us up

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:14.270
there's there's some positives to say it

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:16.460
ain't all bad but we've got a long way

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:19.070
to go as well even though dim bulb is is

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:24.649
worth something I think it makes sense

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:26.899
to only use the shears on rooms that we

00:34:24.649 --> 00:34:28.820
feel we need to use the shears on

00:34:26.899 --> 00:34:30.980
because we only get the stat bonus from

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:32.929
dim bulb wow that was really bad we only

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:35.300
get the stat bonus from dim bulb for one

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:37.520
room anyway we might as well get the

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:39.890
shears end a stat bonus on the same room

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:42.260
so I don't think it's worth using the

00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:44.419
shears in a suboptimal room like a room

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:45.919
that's relatively easy just because we

00:34:44.419 --> 00:34:47.810
want to get one room of stab bonus

00:34:45.919 --> 00:34:49.399
because we only get the stat bonus on

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:52.220
the room that's already relatively easy

00:34:49.399 --> 00:34:57.350
I think this makes a little bit of sense

00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:59.210
a little bit of sense so we're probably

00:34:57.350 --> 00:35:01.930
going to end up having to tap into nine

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:01.930
lives here

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:09.980
which is a little scary but honestly

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:11.930
with the shears I think we got a pretty

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:13.790
good chance to beat blue baby if we can

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:15.830
just get into the blue baby room and

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:23.360
then pop the sheers and stand in the

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:24.830
corner and we will get two opportunities

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.350
like let's say we use the shears on our

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:31.130
first chance we'll get two opportunities

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:32.450
because we have nuns habits so as long

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:34.760
as you've got a few lives left when we

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:36.680
go in there even if we die a few times

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:39.860
trying to fight after using this years

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:45.310
we'll still have enough charges to get

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:49.610
the shears ooh back that was actually

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:56.360
horrendously idiotic of me you still

00:35:49.610 --> 00:36:00.290
champions huh he's fast he's fast he's

00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:02.180
fast he's really really fast um some you

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:03.590
might want to pop this year's on this

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:07.310
one but I really feel like I should be

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:08.630
able to okay well disregard then see

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:18.980
like what I'm going to do then is pop

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:20.870
the shears and then hide yeah okay I

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:23.720
mean the spirit art is also great here

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:27.970
um but the static tears are amazing

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:33.560
actually we got pretty lucky and we're

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:36.860
gonna anta if we fail this this fight

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:40.210
right here will probably go back to the

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:43.850
shears just so we can still get a charge

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:45.470
but I do well I don't know we're getting

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:47.660
the stat bonus permanently that ended up

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:48.830
being pretty easy I guess oh this is a

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:50.030
fun run especially towards the end

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:51.320
